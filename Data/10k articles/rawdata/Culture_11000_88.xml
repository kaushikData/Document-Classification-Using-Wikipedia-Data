[[File:Box of "ACME EXPLOSIVE TENNIS BALLS" (screencap).jpg|thumb|right|An example of an Acme product from a Road Runner cartoon]]

The '''Acme Corporation''' is a [[fictional corporation]] that features prominently in the [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|''Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote'']] animated shorts  as a [[running gag]] featuring outlandish products that fail or backfire catastrophically at the worst possible times. The name is also used as a generic title in many [[cartoons]], especially those made by [[Leon Schlesinger Productions|Warner Bros.]], and [[film]]s, [[TV series]], [[commercials]] and [[comic strips]].

The company name in the ''Road Runner'' cartoons is [[irony|ironic]], since the word ''acme'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (ακμή; English transliteration: ''akmē'') meaning ''the peak'', ''zenith'' or  ''prime'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acme|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acme|website=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet products from the fictional Acme Corporation are often [[Generic brand|generic]], failure-prone, and/or explosive.

== Origin ==
[[File:Acme anvil.gif|thumb|A real-world advertisement for ACME anvils]]

Acme means "pinnacle", so the name was sometimes used to symbolize the best. An early global Acme brand name was the 'Acme City' whistle made from mid 1870s onwards by [[J Hudson &amp; Co]], followed by the 'Acme Thunderer', and [[Acme Siren]] in 1895.  The name became particularly popular for businesses in the 1920s, when [[alphabetical order|alphabetized]] business telephone directories such as the [[Yellow Pages]] began to be widespread: a name at the beginning of the alphabet would be listed first, and a name implying "the best" was even better. There was a flood of businesses named Acme; some survive to this day, including [[Acme Brick]], [[Acme Markets]], and [[Acme Boots]]. Early [[Sears]] catalogues contained a number of products with the "Acme" trademark, including [[anvil]]s, which are frequently used in Warner Bros. cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-a.html |title=ACME |work=The Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion |author=E.O. Costello |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712234115/http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-a.html |archivedate=2011-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ubiquitousness of the name became something of a joke.

Warner Brothers animator [[Chuck Jones]] has said the name Acme was chosen because of its prevalence:

{{quote
| Since we had to search out our own entertainment, we devised our own fairy stories. If you wanted a bow and arrow you got a stick. If you wanted to conduct an orchestra you got a stick. If you wanted a duel you used a stick. You couldn't go and buy one; that's where the terms acme came from. Whenever we played a game where we had a grocery store or something we called it the ACME corporation. Why? Because in the yellow pages if you looked, say, under drugstores, you'd find the first one would be Acme Drugs. Why? Because "AC" was about as high as you could go; it means the best; the superlative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/218723%7c0/Chuck-Jones-Memories-of-Childhood.html |title=Chuck Jones: Memories of Childhood |people=Peggy Stern and John Canemaker (filmmakers) |medium=Documentary |publisher=Turner Classic Movies and Warner Bros. |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |time=12 min.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The name Acme also had other connotations for people in Los Angeles at the time. During the time the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons were being produced, the [[traffic light]]s in Los Angeles were manufactured by the Acme Traffic Signal Company. The traffic lights paired "Stop" and "Go" semaphore arms with small red and green lights. Bells played the role of today's amber or yellow lights, ringing when the flags changed—a process that took five seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/citydig-should-i-stop-or-should-i-go-early-traffic-signals-in-los-angeles/ CityDig: Should I Stop or Should I Go? Early Traffic Signals in Los Angeles]. ''Los Angeles Magazine''. Retrieved 2015-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Acme semaphore traffic lights were often used in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoons for comedic effect due to their loud bell which was often followed by screeching tires and many sight gags.

It is a misconception that Acme is an acronym standing for such things as "A Company Making Everything", "American Companies Make Everything" or "American Company that Manufactures Everything".&lt;ref&gt;[https://acme.com/what_is_acme/ Acme.com: "What is ACME"?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/32268/where-did-looney-tunes-%E2%80%9Cacme-corporation%E2%80%9D-come Mental Floss: "Where did ACME corporation come from?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional depiction ==

The company is never clearly defined in ''Road Runner'' cartoons but appears to be a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] which produces every product type imaginable, no matter how elaborate or extravagant—most of which never work as desired or expected (some products do work very well, but backfire against the coyote). In the ''Road Runner'' cartoon ''[[Beep, Beep (film)|Beep, Beep]]'', it was referred to as "Acme Rocket-Powered Products, Inc." based in [[Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey|Fairfield, New Jersey]]. Many of its products appear to be produced specifically for Wile E. Coyote; for example, the Acme Giant [[Rubber band|Rubber Band]], subtitled "(For Tripping Road Runners)".

While their products leave much to be desired, Acme delivery service is second to none; Wile E. can merely drop an order into a mailbox (or enter an order on a website, as in the ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' movie), and have the product in his hands within seconds.

The name "Acme" is used as a generic corporate name in a huge number of cartoons, comics, television shows, such as an early episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', and film, from the silent era onward in such titles as [[Buster Keaton]]'s silent film ''[[Neighbors (1920 film)|Neighbors]]'' (1920) and [[Harold Lloyd]]'s ''[[Grandma's Boy (1922 film)|Grandma's Boy]]'' (1922).

Examples which specifically reference the Wile E. Coyote cartoon character include:

=== Animated films, TV series ===
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Don't add examples merely because they have something labelled Acme in them. Only use examples that specifically reference the Wile E. Coyote cartoon character, please --&gt;
* The 1988 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' attempted to explain Acme's inner workings in detail. The movie's plot is centered on the murder of the founder of Acme Incorporated, Marvin Acme ([[Stubby Kaye]]). Many of the film's scenes involve Acme products, and the climactic scene of the film is set in the Acme warehouse.
* The ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' series expanded on Acme's influence, with the entire setting of the show taking place in a city called "Acme Acres". The show's young protagonists attended "Acme Looniversity". In one episode, the coyote sues Acme, accusing it of making products that are unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = K-Acme TV| series = Tiny Toon Adventures| serieslink = Tiny Toon Adventures| number = 64| airdate = 26 February 1991| season = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the legal hearing, however, an Acme representative argues the products are not dangerous ''if used properly''. For example, the coyote would attempt to launch himself using an Acme catapult by cutting the rope used to wind it, but the Acme representative pointed out that he was supposed to simply pull a lever.
* The corporation is also mentioned in ''[[Animaniacs]]'', such as the Acme song from Cookies for Einstein, and ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''{{'}}s home in Acme Labs.
* Acme Corporation is the main antagonist of the movie ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (2003). The head offices of Acme are depicted, revealing it to be a multinational corporation whose executive officers are led by the villainous Mr. Chairman, portrayed by [[Steve Martin]].
* The cartoon series ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'' is set in Acmetropolis.
* In ''[[Wakko's Wish]]'', the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' feature film, the [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Warner siblings]] and other characters live in the village of Acme Falls.
* ''External World'', a short film by [[David OReilly (artist)|David OReilly]], features Acme Retirement Castle, a dystopian retirement facility for disabled cartoon characters.
* The 2015 [[direct-to-video]] animated film ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]'' portrays Acme as a [[department store]].
* In August 2018, Warner Bros. announced they were developing a ''Coyote Vs. Acme'' animated movie with [[Chris McKay]] producing and Jon and Josh Silberman completing the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/wile-e-coyote-movie-coyote-vs-acme-warner-bros-1202919639/ |title=Wile E.

'''Anti-Croat sentiment''' (Croatophobia or Anti-Croatism) is discrimination or prejudice towards [[Croats]] as an ethnic group, and towards [[Croatia]] as a country.

Anti-Croat sentiment was – and still is&lt;ref&gt;[https://vlada.gov.hr/news/croatian-ministers-call-for-putting-an-end-to-anti-croat-sentiment-in-serbia/16671 "Croatian ministers call for putting an end to anti-Croat sentiment in Serbia"], the official pages of the Government of the Republic of Croatia, 02. April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/croatia-serbia-nazis-refugees_us_5603cca7e4b08820d91bad3d "Serbia compares Croatia to Nazis"], Zoran Radosavljevic and Matt Robinson, "Huffington Post", 24. September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; – especially present among some [[Serbs]], starting in the 19th century.

==Serbian nationalism during the 19th Century ==

With the nation-building process in mid-19th century, first Croatian-Serbian tension appeared. Serbian minister [[Ilija Garašanin]]'s ''[[Načertanije]]'' (1844)&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Philip J. |last2=Riesman |first2=David |title=Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0-89096-760-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3}} claimed lands that were inhabited by Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Montenegrins, Bosnians, Hungarians and Croats were part of Serbia.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;{{Rp|3}} Garašanin's plan also includes methods of spreading Serbian influence in the claimed lands.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} He proposed ways to influence Croats, who Garašanin regarded as "Serbs of Catholic faith".&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;{{Rp|3}} This plan considered surrounding peoples to be devoid of national consciousness.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;{{Rp|3–4}}&lt;ref name=anzulovic&gt;{{cite book |title=Heavenly Serbia: From Myth to Genocide |last=Anzulovic |first=Branimir |year=2001 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=1-86403-100-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|91}} [[Vuk Karadžić]] in the 1850s then denied the existence of Croatians and Croatian language, counting them as "Catholic Serbs". [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]] was at the time a kingdom in [[Habsburg Monarchy]], with [[Dalmatia]] and [[Istria]] being separate Habsburg Crown lands. [[Ante Starčević]], head of the Croatian Party of Rights, advocated for Croatia as a nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gP9yAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=ante+star%C4%8Devi%C4%87+proved+croats+exist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TDVEVkm6kO&amp;sig=D73EGAISKpE4yU03ii5aU4u4sj4&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicqMHYsr3LAhVC2hoKHbaHCsUQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=ante%20star%C4%8Devi%C4%87%20proved%20croats%20exist&amp;f=false In the Name of Independence: The Unmaking of Tito's Yugoslavia], Branko Belan, 2010, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Austro-Hungary]] occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 and [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] gained its independence from [[Ottoman Empire]], Croatian and Serbian relations deteriorated as both sides had pretensions on Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1902 there was a reprinted article written by Serb Nikola Stojanović that was published in the publication of the Serbian Independent Party from [[Zagreb]] titled ''Do istrage vaše ili naše'' (''Till the Destruction, ours or yours'') in which denying of the existence of Croat nation as well as forecasting the result of the "inevitable" Serbian-Croatian conflict occurred.
{{quote|That combat has to be led till the destruction, either ours or yours. One side must succumb. That side will be Croatians, due to their minority, geographical position, mingling with Serbs and because the process of evolution means Serbhood is equal to progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bilandžić|first=Dušan|title=Hrvatska moderna povijest|publisher=Golden marketing |year=1999|page=31|isbn=953-6168-50-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Nikola Stojanović, ''Srbobran'', 10.08.1902.}}

During the 19th century, some Italian radical [[Nationalism|nationalists]] tried to promote the idea that a Croatian nation has no sound reason to exist: therefore the Slavic population on the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] (Croats and [[Slovenes]]) should be [[Italianization|Italianized]], and the territory included in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uk9VVZ1esGwC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=italianization+croatia+risorgimento&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Wd7NK1LmI&amp;sig=HVcnt659FPKYSC5YqTHS6yF3nro&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBGoVChMIy9-ynKzZyAIVjHEUCh2-cgd6#v=onepage&amp;q=italianization%20croatia%20risorgimento&amp;f=false "Buying and Selling the Istrian Goat: Istrian Regionalism, Croatian Nationalism, and EU Enlargement"], (book), John E.

==Canadian Internment camps during World War I==

In World War I, 8,579 male "aliens of enemy nationality" were interned, including 5,954 [[Austro-Hungarian]]s, including ethnic [[Croats]].  Many of these internees were used for [[forced labour]] in internment camps, such as the [[Castle Mountain Internment Camp]] and the [[Eaton Internment Camp]].

===Fascist Italy===
{{see also|Italianization|Italian war crimes}}

Fascist-led [[Italianization]], or the forced assimilation of Italian culture on the ethnic Croat communities inhabiting the former [[Austro-Hungarian]] territories of the [[Julian March]] and areas of [[Dalmatia]], as well as ethnically-mixed cities in Italy proper, such as [[Trieste]], had already been initiated prior to World War II. The [[Anti-Slavic sentiment]], perpetuated by Italian Fascism, led to the persecution of [[Croats]], alongside ethnic [[Slovenes]] on ethnic and cultural grounds. 

In September 1920, Mussolini said: {{quote|When dealing with such a race as Slavic - inferior and barbaric - we must not pursue the carrot, but the stick policy. We should not be afraid of new victims. The Italian border should run across the [[Brenner Pass]], [[Snežnik|Monte Nevoso]] and the [[Dinaric Alps]]. I would say we can easily sacrifice 500,000 barbaric Slavs for 50,000 Italians.|[[Benito Mussolini]], speech held in [[Pula]], 20 September 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HyVMfMQoSCYC&amp;pg=PT46 |title=Aut aut |year=2011 |isbn=9788865761069 |first=Marta |last=Verginella |chapter=Antislavismo, razzismo di frontiera? |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

This period was therefore characterised as "centralising, oppressive and dedicated to the forcible Italianisation of the minorities" &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1C0mJLFrpC0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=centralizing,+oppressive+and+dedicated+to+the+forcible+Italianization+of+the+minorities&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1JjDM7NeFfbl-_W3DuNjZmdDq4eA The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border by Glenda Sluga, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; consequently leading to the emigration of around 105,000&lt;ref name=Cresciani_ClashOfCivilisations/&gt; [[Slovenes]] and [[Croats]] from the Julian March, mostly to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (around 70,000), but also to [[Argentina]] (some 30,000). On the other hand, several thousand [[Dalmatian Italians]] moved from Yugoslavia to Italy after 1918, many of them to Istria and Trieste.

Following the Axis [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, Italy occupied almost all of [[Dalmatia]], as well as [[Gorski Kotar]] and the Italian government made stringent efforts to further Italianize the region. Italian occupying forces were accused of committing war crimes in order to transform occupied territories into ethnic Italian territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=990541c2-46f4-4c51-a191-16e03a64a65b&amp;articleid=cbfd7ebc-ed2c-46a5-a4c6-6a27b7e7662b#acbfd7ebc-ed2c-46a5-a4c6-6a27b7e7662b Z.

===Chetniks=== 
{{see also|Chetnik war crimes in World War II}}

[[Chetnik]] ideology during [[World War II]] foresaw the need for the ethnic cleansing of certain areas in order to consolidate an ethnically "pure" Serb territory as the basis of post-War Yugoslavia. This ethnic cleansing was supposed to be conducted "at a convenient moment", [[Croats]] alongside [[Bosniaks]] were to be targeted as part of this policy. One of the numerous documents that attest to this plan is Mihailović's written "instruction" to [[Pavle Đurišić]] from 20 December 1941:&lt;ref&gt;https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Instrukcija_D._Mihailovića_Pavlu_Đurišiću_od_20._prosinca_1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

|text=The goals of our squadrons are:
*A struggle for the freedom of our people under the scepter of His Majesty [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]],
*To create Greater Yugoslavia and [[Greater Serbia]] within it, and ethnically cleansed Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Syrmia]], [[Banat]] and [[Bačka]] within Greater Serbia,
*A struggle for inclusion into our state life all other Slavic territories occupied by the Italians and Germans ([[Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Istria]] and [[Carinthia]]) as well as [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Albania]] with [[Shkodër]],
*Cleansing the state territory from all national minorities and non-national elements,
*To create immediate common borders between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and Slovenia by [ethnically] cleansing [[Sandžak]] from Muslims and Bosnia from Muslims and Croats...}}

The basic precondition for creating an ethnically clean area was the securing of a pure Serbian ethnic state and the ethnic cleansing of the area inhabited by Croats and Bosniaks. Ustase lead massacres of Serb civilians accelerated Chetnik cleansings in the Bosnia region leading to more volunteers in the Chetnik army. Similarly, Chetnik atrocities lead to larger Ustase volunteers.

Regarding the realization of his [[Greater Serbia]]n program [[Homogenous Serbia]], [[Stevan Moljević]] wrote in his letter to [[Dragiša Vasić]] in February 1942:

{{Quote
|text=(...) 2) Regarding our internal affairs, the demarcation with the Croats, we hold that we should as soon as an opportunity occurs, gather all the strength and create a completed act: occupy territories marked on the map, clean it before anyone pulls itself together. We would assume that the occupation would only be carried out if the main hubs were strong in [[Osijek]], [[Vinkovci]], [[Slavonski Brod]], [[Sunja, Sisak-Moslavina County|Sunja]], [[Karlovac]], [[Knin]], [[Šibenik]], [[Mostar]] and [[Metković]], and then from within start with an [ethnic] cleansing of all non-Serb elements. The guilty should have an open way - Croats to Croatia, Muslims to Turkey (or Albania). As for the Muslims, our government in London should immediately address the issue with Turkey. English will also help us. (Question is!). The organization for the interior cleansing should be prepared immediately, and it could be because there are many refugees in Serbia from all "Serb lands" (...).}}

It is clear from the documents of the Chetnik commanders that the real reason for the terror against the non-Serb population was the desire to establish an ethnically pure Greater Serbia in the historical territory of many peoples, most notably Croatian, Muslim, but also Bulgarian, Romanian, Hungarian, Macedonian, Montenegrin and others and not crimes over the Serbs in NDH as Chetniks officially claimed. Draža Mihailović went even further from Moljević and requested more than 90% of the NDH's territory where more than 2,500,000 Catholics and more than 800,000 Muslims lived, accounting for about 70% of the total population with Orthodox Serbs making up only about 30% of the population.

In the context of Chetnik genocide, one of the main Chetnik commanders Milan Šantić stated in [[Trebinje]] in July 1942: "The Serb lands must be cleansed from Catholics and Muslims. They will be inhabited only by the Serbs. Cleansing will be carried out thoroughly, and we will suppress and destroy them all without exception and without pity, which will be the starting point for our liberation." &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In the "Elaborate" of the ''Chetnik's Dinaric Battalion'' from March 1942, it's stated that Chetnik's main goal was to create a "Serbian national state in the areas in which the Serbs live, and even those to which Serbs aspire (Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Lika]] and part of [[Dalmatia]])" where "only Orthodox population would live". It is also stated that Bosniaks should be convinced that Serbs are their allies, so they wouldn't join the Partisans, and then kill them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://povijest.net/dinarska-cetnicka-divizija-4/|title=Dinarska četnička divizija (4)|website=Hrvatski povijesni portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bajo Stanišić]], the final goal of the Chetniks was "founding of a new Serbian state, not a geographical term but a purely Serbian, with four basic attributes: the Serbian state [Greater Serbia], the Serb King [of] the [[Karađorđević dynasty]], Serbian nationality, and Serbian faith. The Balkan federation is also the next stage, but the main axis and leadership of this federation must be our Serbian state, that is, the Greater Serbia."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

[[Chetnik]] ethnic cleansing targeted Croat civilians throughout areas of [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in which Croats were massacred and expelled, some examples of which include: [[Krnjeuša massacre]], [[Trubar massacre]], [[Bosansko Grahovo massacre]] and the [[Gata massacre]]. According to the Croatian historian, [[Vladimir Žerjavić]], Chetnik forces killed between 18,000-32,000 Croats during World War II, predominantly civilians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vladimir Geiger|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|title=Human Losses of the Croats in World War II and the Immediate Post-War Period Caused by the Chetniks (Yugoslav Army in the Fatherand) and the Partisans (People's Liberation Army and the Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia/Yugoslav Army) and the Communist Authorities: Numerical Indicators|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/103223?lang=en|pp=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An '''aptitude''' is a component of a [[Competence (human resources)|competence]] to do a certain kind of [[Labour (economics)|work]] at a certain level. Outstanding aptitude can be considered "talent". An aptitude may be [[Physical fitness|physical]] or [[mind|mental]]. Aptitude is inborn potential to do certain kinds of work whether developed or undeveloped. Ability is developed [[knowledge]], understanding, learned or acquired abilities ([[skills]]) or [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. The [[innate]] nature of aptitude is in contrast to skills and achievement, which represent knowledge or ability that is gained through [[learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/sommerb/sommerdemo/stantests/mental.htm|title=Standardized tests: Aptitude, Intelligence, Achievement|website=psychology.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gladwell (2008){{sfn |Gladwell |2008}} and Colvin (2008),{{sfn |Colvin |2008}}  often it is difficult to set apart an outstanding performance due merely to talent or stemming from hard [[training]]. Talented people as a rule show high results immediately in few kinds of activity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://developingmultipletalents.com/multitalented-artists/ Multitalented Creative People]&lt;/ref&gt; but often only in a single direction or genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetoptens.com/greatest-comedic-actors/ Greatest Comedic Actors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biography.com/people/groups/drama Famous People in Dramatic Film]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intelligence and aptitude ==
Aptitude and [[intelligence quotient]] are related, and in some ways differing views of human mental ability. Unlike the original idea of IQ, aptitude often refers to one of the many different characteristics which can be independent of each other, such as aptitude for military flight, air traffic control, or computer programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/sommerb/sommerdemo/stantests/mental.htm|title=Standardized tests: Aptitude, Intelligence, Achievement|website=psychology.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach measures a variety of separate skills, similar to the [[theory of multiple intelligences]] and [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] and many other modern theories of intelligence. In general, aptitude tests are more likely to be designed and used for career and employment decisions, and intelligence tests are more likely to be used for educational and research purposes. However, there is a great deal of overlap between them, and they often measure the same kinds of abilities. For example, aptitude tests such as the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] measure enough aptitudes that they could also serve as a measure of general intelligence.

A single construct such as mental ability is measured with multiple tests. Often, a person's group of test scores will be highly correlated with each other, which makes a single measure useful in many cases. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor's [[General Learning Ability]] is determined by combining Verbal, Numerical and Spatial aptitude scores. However, many individuals have skills that are a lot higher or lower than their overall mental ability level. Aptitude subtests are used intra-individually to determine which tasks that individual is more skilled at performing. This information can be useful for determining which job roles are the best fits for employees or applicants. Often, before more rigorous aptitude tests are used, individuals are screened for a basic level of aptitude through a previously-completed process, such as [[SAT]] scores, [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] scores, [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering|GATE]] scores, degrees, or other certifications.

== Combined aptitude and knowledge tests ==
[[Test (student assessment)|Tests]] that assess learned skills or knowledge are frequently called [[achievement test]]s. However, certain tests can assess both types of constructs. An example that leans both ways is the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] (ASVAB), which is given to recruits entering the armed forces of the [[United States]]. Another is the [[SAT]], which is designed as a test of aptitude for [[college]] in the United States, but has achievement elements. For example, it tests mathematical reasoning, which depends both on innate mathematical ability and education received in [[mathematics]].

Aptitude tests can typically be grouped according to the type of cognitive ability they measure: 
# [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|Fluid intelligence]]: the ability to think and reason abstractly, effectively solve problems and think strategically. It’s more commonly known as ‘street smarts’ or the ability to ‘quickly think on your feet’. An example of what employers can learn from your fluid intelligence is your suitability for the role for which you are applying
# [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|Crystallised intelligence]]: the ability to learn from past experiences and to apply this learning to work-related situations. Work situations that require crystallised intelligence include producing and analysing written reports, comprehending work instructions, using numbers as a tool to make effective decisions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://megasociety.org/noesis/138/aptitude.html The Too Many Aptitudes Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellsphere.com/happiness-article/multipotentiality-multiple-talents-multiple-challenges/1196517 Multipotentiality: multiple talents, multiple challenges] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718024926/http://www.wellsphere.com/happiness-article/multipotentiality-multiple-talents-multiple-challenges/1196517 |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jocrf.org/about_aptitudes/Pease.html Personal Reflections on Testing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726205838/http://www.jocrf.org/about_aptitudes/Pease.html |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Radhanpur State-CoA392.jpg|thumb|190px|Coat of arms of [[Radhanpur State]], one of the princely states ruled by the Babi dynasty.]]
The '''Babi dynasty''' or '''Babis''' or '''[[Babai (Pashtun tribe)|Babais]]''' are a community (Pashtun Tribe) in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], originally of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] descent, now residing in [[India]], largely. The community traces its origins to the dynasty founded in 1654 by Sherkhanji Babi (ruled 1654–1690).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Soszynski |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/j/junagadh.html |title=Junagadh |website=Members.iinet.net.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last [[Nawab]] of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] left India after the [[Partition of India|Partition]] in 1947.

They entered India from Khorasan under the leadership of Usman Khan, a follower of [[Mughal emperor]] [[Humayun]]. Bahadur Khanji Babi, son of Usman Khan, migrated to India and entered service under the Mughals. The hereditary title (Tribe) of Babi was conferred to him in 1554 from Emperor [[Humayun]], for "services against the Rana of [[Chittor]]". Sherkhanji Babi, founder of the [[Babi (title)|Babi]] dynasty in 1654, arrived in [[Kathiawar]] in the [[royal train|train]] of Prince [[Murad Baksh]], the [[Imperial Viceroy]] and son of [[Shah Jahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Babi Tribe is a Pashtun tribe which originates from eastern Afghanistan and western regions of Pakistan. Babi or [[Babai (Pashtun tribe)]] is son of Ghorghasht or [[Gharghashti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghantribes.com|title=Ghorghasht or Gharghashti|last=Babi|first=Babi|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gharghashti|Babi]] Pathans claim to have arrived in [[Gujarat]] during the rule of [[Shah Jahan]]. After the collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]], the Babis were involved in a struggle with the [[Gaekwad dynasty]] of the [[Maratha Empire]] for control of [[Gujarat]]. While the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s were successful in establishing control over all of [[Gujarat]], the Babis retained sovereignty of the [[princely states]] of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]], [[Radhanpur State|Radhanpur]], [[Balasinor State|Balasinor]] and [[Bantva Manalapan, sardargadh |Manavadar]],.

Babi descendants are found throughout north [[Gujarat]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. Iconic [[Bollywood]] actress [[Parveen Babi]] was of Babi lineage, but most contemporary Babis, barring those belonging to princely lineages, are in modest circumstances. Many are petty landowners, but there is marked urbanization among the Babi as well. Though the Babis observe a tradition of [[endogamy]], but there are cases of marriages with the [[Chauhan]] and [[Behlim]] communities, and they accept daughters from the [[Gujarati Shaikh|Shaikhs]] and [[Sunni Bohra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Communities in Gujarat by Satish C Misra pages 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of this dynasty ruled over the [[princely state]]s of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]], [[Radhanpur State|Radhanpur]] and [[Balasinor State|Balasinor]], as well as the small states of [[Bantva Manavadar]] and [[Sardargarh State|Sardargarh]].

{{Generations Sidebar}}

'''Baby boomers''' (also known as '''boomers''') are the [[demography|demographic]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the [[Silent Generation]] and preceding [[Generation X]]. There are varying timelines defining the start and the end of this cohort; demographers and researchers typically use birth years starting from the early- to mid-1940s and ending anywhere from 1960 to 1964.

The term "baby boomer" is also used in a cultural context, so it is difficult to achieve broad consensus of a precise date definition. Different people, organizations, and scholars have varying opinions on who is a baby boomer, both chronologically and culturally. Some define "baby boomers" as those born between 1946 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018|others=Posard, Marek N., Kavanagh, Jennifer, Edwards, Kathryn, Efron, Sonni|title=What Do Millennials Think About Security Issues?|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2571.html|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Baby boomers are associated with a rejection or redefinition of traditional values. Many commentators, however, have disputed the extent of that rejection, noting the widespread continuity of values with older and younger generations. In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], boomers are widely associated with privilege, as many grew up in a time of widespread government subsidies in post-war housing and education, and increasing affluence.&lt;ref name=Owram1997&gt;{{Citation | last = Owram | first = Doug | year = 1997 | title = Born at the Right Time | isbn = 0-8020-8086-3 | publisher = Univ Of Toronto Press | location = Toronto | page = x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a group, baby boomers were the wealthiest, most active, and most physically fit generation up to the era in which they arrived, and were amongst the first to grow up genuinely expecting the world to improve with time.&lt;ref name="Jones1980"/&gt; They were also the generation that received peak levels of income; they could therefore reap the benefits of abundant levels of food, apparel, retirement programs, and sometimes even "midlife crisis" products. The increased consumerism for this generation has been regularly criticized as excessive.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinker |first=Steven |year=2011 |title=The Better Angels Of Our Nature |location=P.524 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of the boomers was that they have tended to think of themselves as a special generation, very different from those that had come before or that has come afterward. In the 1960s, as the relatively large numbers of young people became teenagers and young adults, they, and those around them, created a very specific [[rhetoric]] around their [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]], and the changes they were bringing about.&lt;ref name=Owram1997a&gt;{{Citation

 | page = xi
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rhetoric had an important impact in the self perceptions of the boomers, as well as their tendency to define the world in terms of generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. The baby boom has been described variously as a "shockwave"&lt;ref name="Owram1997"/&gt; and as "the pig in the python".&lt;ref name=Jones1980&gt;{{Citation| last = Jones | first = Landon| year = 1980| title = Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation| publisher = Coward, McCann and Geoghegan| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Generation Jones]]" is sometimes used to describe those born roughly between 1954 and 1964. The term is typically used to refer to the later years of the Baby boomer cohort and the early years of [[Generation X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=FNP Interactive - http://www.fnpInteractive.com |url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/archives/display_detail.htm?StoryID=91159 |title=The Frederick News-Post Online – Frederick County Maryland Daily Newspaper |publisher=Fredericknewspost.com |date=December 19, 2008 |accessdate=2010-08-02 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206110817/http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/archives/display_detail.htm?StoryID=91159 |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP080111"&gt;Noveck, Jocelyn (2009-01-11), "In Obama, many see an end to the baby boomer era".[https://web.archive.org/web/20090125183857/http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1372376%2Cw-obama-baby-boomer-era-011109.article].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:US Birth Rates.svg|thumb|350px|right|United States birth rate (births per 1,000 population). The segment for the years 1946 to 1964 is highlighted in red, with birth rates peaking in 1949 and dropping steadily around 1958 reaching pre-war depression era levels in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] Bottom of this page https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus.htm "Vital Statistics of the United States, 2003, Volume&amp;nbsp;I, Natality", Table 1-1 "Live births, birth rates, and fertility rates, by race: United States, 1909–2003."&lt;/ref&gt; The drop in 1970 was due to excluding births to nonresidents of the United States.]]

The term [[baby boom]] refers to a noticeable increase in the birth rate. The post-war population increase was described as a "boom" by various newspaper reporters, including Sylvia F. Porter in a column for the May 4, 1951, edition of the ''[[New York Post]]'', based on the increase in the population of the U.S. of 2,357,000 in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's Digest'' August 1951 pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of "baby boomer" is in a January 1963 ''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]'' article describing a massive surge of college enrollments approaching as the oldest boomers were coming of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/542159/how-generations-named-baby-boomers-generation-x-millennials|title=How Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials Got Their Names|date=May 1, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authors have delimited the baby boom period differently. [[Landon Jones]], in his book ''Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation'' (1980), defined the span of the baby-boom generation as extending from 1943 through 1960, when annual births increased over 4,000,000. Authors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]], well known for [[Strauss-Howe generational theory|their generational theory]], define the social generation of Boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960, who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II, but old enough to remember the postwar American High.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Neil |last1=Howe |first2=William |last2=Strauss |title=Generations: The History of Americas Future, 1584 to 2069 |year=1991 |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |pages=299–316 |isbn=0-688-11912-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pew Research Center]] defines baby boomers as being born between 1946 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defining generations: Where Millennials end and post-Millennials begin|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/defining-generations-where-millennials-end-and-post-millennials-begin|accessdate=May 8, 2018|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the generation can be segmented into two broadly defined cohorts: The Leading-Edge Baby Boomers are individuals born between 1946 and 1955, those who came of age during the Vietnam War era. This group represents slightly more than half of the generation, or roughly 38,002,000 people of all races. The other half of the generation was born between 1956 and 1964. Called Late Boomers, or Trailing-Edge Boomers, this second cohort includes about 37,818,000 individuals, according to ''Live Births by Age and Mother and Race, 1933–98'', published by the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Brent |last=Green |title=Marketing to Leading-Edge Baby Boomers: Perceptions, Principles, Practices, Predictions |year=2006 |publisher=Paramount Market Publishing |location=New York |pages=4–5 |isbn=0976697351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing battle for "generational ownership" has motivated a handful of marketing mavens and cultural commentators to coin and/or promote their own terms for sub‑segments of the baby-boomer generation. These monikers include, but are not limited to, "golden boomers," "generation Jones," "alpha boomers," "[[hippies]]," "[[yippies]]," "[[yuppies]]," "zoomers," and "cuspers."

In [[Ontario]], Canada, one attempt to define the boom came from [[David Foot]], author of ''Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century'' (1997). He defines a Canadian boomer as someone born from 1947 to 1966, the years that more than 400,000 babies were born. However, he acknowledges that is a demographic definition, and that culturally it may not be as clear-cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home |title=By definition: Boom, bust, X and why |work=The Globe and Mail |date=June 24, 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-27 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520180757/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home |archivedate=May 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Owram argues that the Canadian boom took place from 1942 to 1960, but that culturally boomers everywhere were born between the late war years and about 1955 or 1956. He notes that those born in the years before the actual boom were often the most influential people among boomers; for example, musicians such as [[The Beatles]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[The Rolling Stones]], as well as writers like [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], who were either slightly or vastly older than the boomer generation. Those born in the 1960s might feel disconnected from the cultural identifiers of the earlier boomers.&lt;ref name=Owram1997b&gt;{{Citation

==Characteristics==

===Size and economic impact===
76 million Americans were born between 1946 and 1964, representing a cohort that is significant in size alone. In 2004, the British baby boomers held 80% of the UK's wealth and bought 80% of all high-end cars, 80% of cruises and 50% of skincare products.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Duncan (Sept 16, 2004) "Live Fast, Die Old", [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3659996.stm BBC News site]. Retrieved 2007-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the size of the group, Steve Gillon has suggested that one thing that sets the baby boomers apart from other generational groups is the fact that "almost from the time they were conceived, Boomers were dissected, analyzed, and pitched to by modern [[Marketing|marketers]], who reinforced a sense of generational distinctiveness."&lt;ref name="Gillon"&gt;Gillon, Steve (2004) ''Boomer Nation: The Largest and Richest Generation Ever, and How It Changed America'', Free Press, "Introduction", {{ISBN|0-7432-2947-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the articles of the late 1940s identifying the increasing number of babies as an economic boom, such as a 1948 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article whose title proclaimed "Babies Mean Business",&lt;ref&gt;"Population: Babies Mean Business", [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9925897/site/newsweek/ ''Newsweek'', August 9, 1948]. Retrieved 2007-01-26. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128095707/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9925897/site/newsweek/ |date=January 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a 1948 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article called "Baby Boom."&lt;ref&gt;"Baby Boom", [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856041,00.html ''Time'', February 9, 1948]. Retrieved 2007-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ken Dychtwald#Age Wave|age wave]] theory suggests an [[economic slowdown]] when the boomers started retiring during 2007–2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/ousivMolt/idUSN3131412220080131 Economy faces bigger bust without Boomers], Reuters, Jan 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Projections for the [[aging U.S.&amp;nbsp;workforce]] suggest that by 2020, 25% of employees will be at least 55 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Chosewood, L.

The Baby Boomers came into being the largest voting demographic in the early 1980s, a period which ushered in a long running trend of rapidly increasing income inequality. From 1979-2007, those receiving the highest 1 percentile of incomes saw their already large incomes increase by 278% while those in the middle at the 40th-60th percentiles saw a 35% increase. Since 1980, after the vast majority of Baby Boomer college goers graduated, the cost of college has been increased by over 600% (inflation adjusted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130710193649/https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/29/how-the-baby-boomers-destroyed-americas-future.aspx | title =How the Baby Boomers Destroyed America's Future | last =Planes | first =Alex | date =June 29, 2013 | website =The Motley Fool | publisher =The Motley Fool | access-date =April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey found that nearly a third of baby boomer multimillionaires polled in the [[United States]] would prefer to pass on their [[inheritance]] to [[Charity (practice)|charities]] rather than pass it down to their children. Fifty-seven percent of  these boomers believed it was important for each generation to earn their own money; fifty four percent believed it was more important to invest in their children while they were growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/06/half-of-baby-boomers-to-leave-inheritance-to-kids|title=50% of Boomers Leave Estates to Kids|first=ABC|last=News|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural identity===
Boomers grew up at a time of dramatic social change. In the United States, that change marked the generation with a strong cultural cleavage, between the proponents of change and the more conservative individuals. Some analysts believe this cleavage played out politically since the time of the [[Vietnam War]] to the mid‑2000s, to some extent defining the political landscape and division in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200712/obama |title=Goodbye to all of that |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=2010-08-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100103235533/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200712/obama| archivedate=January 3, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/weekinreview/21broder.html | work=The New York Times | title=Shushing the Baby Boomers | first=John M. | last=Broder | date=January 21, 2007 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, the boomers became more conservative, many of them regretting the cultural changes they brought in their youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/12/opinion/la-oe-bowman-baby-boomers-more-conservative-20110912|work=Los Angeles Times|title=As the boomers turn|last=Bowman|first=Karlyn|date=2011-09-12|accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported on the religious affiliations of baby boomers. Citing Wade Clark Roof, a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of California]] at [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], the articles stated that about 42% of baby boomers were dropouts from formal religion, 33% had never strayed from church, and 25% of boomers were returning to religious practice. The boomers returning to religion were "usually less tied to tradition and less dependable as church members than the loyalists. They are also more liberal, which deepens rifts over issues like [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ostling|Ostling, Richard N.]], "The Church Search", April 5, 1993 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978164,00.html ''Time'' article retrieved 2007-01-27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early and mid-boomers were coming of age at the same time across the world, so that they experienced events like [[Beatlemania]] and [[Woodstock festival|Woodstock]], organizing against the Vietnam War, or fighting and dying in the same war. Boomers in [[Italy]] were dressing in mod clothes and "buying the world a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]." Boomers in [[India]] were seeking new philosophical discoveries.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some American boomers in Canada had found a new home after escaping [[military conscription|the draft]]. Canadian Boomers were organizing support for [[Pierre Trudeau]]. It is precisely because of these experiences that many believe those born in the second half of the birth boom belong to another generation, as events that defined their [[coming of age]] have little in common with leading or core boomers.{{original research inline|date=May 2013}}
Politically, early Boomers in the United States tend to be [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s, while later boomers tend to be [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/ "The Whys and Hows of Generations Research"]. Pew Center. September 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The baby boomers found that their music, most notably [[rock and roll]], was another expression of their generational identity. [[Transistor radio]]s were personal devices that allowed teenagers to listen to [[The Beatles]], the [[Motown|Motown Sound]], and other new musical directions and artists.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the west, baby boomers comprised the first generation to grow up with the [[television]]; some popular Boomer-era shows included ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', ''[[Captain Video]]'', ''[[The Soupy Sales Show]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the 1985 study of U.S.&amp;nbsp;generational cohorts by Schuman and Scott, a broad sample of adults was asked, "What world events over the past 50 years were especially important to them?"&lt;ref&gt;Schuman, H. and Scott, J. (1989), Generations and collective memories, ''American Sociological Review'', vol. 54 (3), 1989, pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt; For the baby boomers the results were:
* Baby Boomer cohort number one (born 1946–55), the cohort who epitomized the cultural change of the sixties
** Memorable events: the [[Cold War]] (and associated [[Red Scare]]), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., political unrest, [[Apollo program|walk on the moon]], risk of the draft into the [[Vietnam War]] or actual military service during the Vietnam War, anti-war protests, social experimentation, [[sexual revolution|sexual freedom]], drug experimentation, the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[environmental movement]], [[Feminism|women's movement]], protests and riots, and [[Woodstock]].
** Key characteristics: experimental, individualism, free spirited, social cause oriented.
* Baby Boomer cohort number two (born 1956–64)
** Memorable events: the [[Cold War]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., for those born in the first couple of years of this generation, the [[Vietnam War]], [[Apollo program|walk on the moon]], [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s resignation, lowered drinking age to 18 in many states 1970–1976 (followed by raising back to 21 in the mid-1980s as a result of congressional lobbying by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD)), the [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargo]], raging inflation, gasoline shortages, economic recession and lack of viable career opportunities upon graduation from high school or college, Jimmy Carter's reimposition of registration for the draft, the Iran hostage crisis, [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Live Aid]]

Some debate exists regarding the generational identity of those born from 1961 to 1964, as some demographers and researchers consider these individuals to be part of the younger demographic cohort, [[Generation X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generation X: Once Xtreme, Now Exhausted|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/08/27/generation-x-once-xtreme-now-exhausted-part-5-of-7/#6a73decb5d2a|accessdate=6 August 2016|publisher=Forbes|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Jon|title=The Generation X Report: Active, Balanced, and Happy|url=http://lsay.org/GenX_Rept_Iss1.pdf|publisher=Longitudinal Study of American Youth – University Of Michigan|accessdate=2013-05-29|page=1|date=Fall 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Geographic Channel's Six-Part Limited Series "Generation X," Narrated by Christian Slater, Premieres Sunday, Feb. 14, at 10/9c|url=http://www.multichannel.com/prfeed/national-geographic-channel-s-six-part-limited-series-generation-x-narrated-christian-slater-premieres-sunday-feb-14-109c/396948|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Multichannel News|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X Employees Struggle the Most Financially, Most Likely to Dip into Retirement Savings, According to PwC Study|url=http://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2013/2013-financial-wellness-survey-press-release.html|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=PrincewaterhouseCoopers|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Healthcare ==
The density of Baby Boomers can put a strain on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. According to the [[American Medical Student Association]], the population of individuals over the age of 65 will increase by 73 percent between 2010 and 2030, meaning one in five Americans will be a senior citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carrington.edu/blog/medical/baby-boomers-will-affect-health-care-industry-u-s/|title=How baby boomers will affect the health care industry in the U.S. {{!}} Carrington.edu|website=carrington.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and end-of-life issues==
{{See also|Aging in the American workforce}}

{{As of|1998}}, it was reported that, as a generation, boomers had tended to avoid discussions and long-term planning for their demise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/1998/12/21/focus3.html Baby boomers lag in preparing funerals, estates, etc. The ''Business Journal of Milwaukee'' – December 18, 1998 by Robert Mullins]. Retrieved 2007-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning at least as early as that year, there has been a growing dialogue on how to manage aging and end-of-life issues as the generation ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu-ref.com/reporter-s-notebook-kicking-and-screaming-baby-boomers-begin-to-talk-about-aging Article in ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709033425/http://www.harvard.edu-ref.com/reporter-s-notebook-kicking-and-screaming-baby-boomers-begin-to-talk-about-aging |date=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a number of commentators have argued that Baby Boomers are in a state of denial regarding their own aging and death and are leaving an undue economic burden on their children for their retirement and care. According to the 2011 Associated Press and LifeGoesStrong.com surveys:
* 60% lost value in investments because of the economic crisis
* 42% are delaying retirement
* 25% claim they will never retire (currently still working)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retirement?

An indication of the importance put on the impact of the boomer was the selection by ''TIME'' magazine of the Baby Boom Generation as its 1966 "[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]." As Claire Raines points out in ''Beyond Generation&amp;nbsp;X'', "never before in history had youth been so idealized as they were at this moment." When [[Generation&amp;nbsp;X]] came along it had much to live up to according to Raines.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite book|last=Raines|first=Claire|title=Beyond Generation&amp;nbsp;X|year=1997|publisher=Crisp Publications|isbn=978-1560524496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boomers are often associated with the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], the [[civil rights movement]], and the [[second-wave feminism|"second-wave" feminist cause]] of the 1970s. Conversely, many trended in moderate to conservative directions opposite to the counterculture, especially those making professional careers in the military (officer and enlisted), law enforcement, business, blue collar trades, and Republican Party politics. They are also associated with the spending trends and [[narcissism]] of the [[Me generation|"Me" generation]].

People often take it for granted that each succeeding generation will be "better off" than the one before it. When [[Generation X]] came along just after the boomers, they would be the first generation to enjoy a lesser quality of life than the generation preceding it.&lt;ref name="Isabel Sawhill, Ph.D 2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well? |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/sawhill/200705.pdf |accessdate=22 March 2013 |author=Isabel Sawhill, Ph.D |author2=John E.

Baby boomers continue to have a significant effect on politics, as the [[United States presidential election, 2016]] came down to two controversial candidates in [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]], both boomers, with a majority of Trump's support coming from the Baby Boomer generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/136928/dont-blame-millennials-scarily-close-election-blame-baby-boomers|title=Don't Blame Millennials for This Scarily Close Election.

Bush]] and [[Donald Trump]].

Within the UK, numerous Baby Boomers have served as major party leaders, including four prime ministers ([[John Major]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Gordon Brown]], and [[Theresa May]]), and five leaders of the opposition ([[Neil Kinnock]], [[Margaret Beckett]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110620">'''Bahá'í studies''' refers to the scholarly study of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], its [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[History of the Bahá'í Faith|history]] and [[Bahá'í literature|literature]].  Bahá'í studies are currently conducted in a variety of venues, including institutes of the [[Bahá'í administration]] as well as non-affiliated universities.  Some scholars study some aspect of the Bahá'í Faith as part of research on related matters while others engage in Bahá'í studies as a primary focus of their research. Scholars' comments on the religion and its predecessor [[Bábism]] date back to the at least 1845, the year after its founding. Initially they were often [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]s or [[Christian missionaries]] but through time both Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'í researchers have addressed the religion especially in tune with the [[Growth of religion#Bahá'í Faith|growth of the religion]], which has been called significant.

===19th century===

A wide variety of accounts, encounters and investigations began to circulate outside of Persia as events began to unfold from the Spring of 1844 with the [[Declaration of the Báb]].

==Bahá'í review==
{{main|Bahá'í review}}
Bahá'í scholars who are also members of the faith must submit their work for [[Bahá'í review|review]] by the [[Bahá'í administration]] and obtain prior approval. According to the administration of the religion, the purpose of the review is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&amp;chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To ensure the accuracy of the presentation of the teachings of the religion
* To protect the religion from misrepresentation by its own followers
* To ensure dignity of the form

[[Juan Cole]], a former Bahá'í who had disagreements with the Bahá'í administration on account of the [[Bahá'í review|review]] describes it as "a system of in-house censorship" which "has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink = Juan Cole | last2= |first2= |date= June 1998 |title= The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 | url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal= The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |publisher= |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= September 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several conflicts originating from the practice of review, and a number of prominent academics, including [[Juan Cole]], [[Denis MacEoin]] and [[Abbas Amanat]], have either been excommunicated or forced to resign due to academic disagreements with the religious hierarchy.  Denis MacEoin has said that the review has stifled research in Bahá'í studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= MacEoin |first= Denis| authorlink = Denis MacEoin| last2= |first2= |date= 1990 |title= The crisis in Babi and Baha'i studies: part of a wider crisis in academic freedom? |url= http://fglaysher.com/bahaicensorship/archives/Denis%20MacEoin,%20Crisis%20in%20Babi%20and%20Baha'i%20Studies.pdf |journal= British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |publisher= |volume= 17 |issue= 1 |pages= 55–61|doi=10.1080/13530199008705506 |access-date= September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moojan Momen, another academic in the field of Bahá'í Studies who has labeled Juan Cole and Denis MacEoin "apostates," disagrees and states that "there is no more 'censorship' involved in this process than with any other academic journal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Marginality and Apostasy in the Bahá'í Community | url= http://bahai-library.com/momen_marginality_apostasy| first = Moojan | last= Momen | journal="Religion" | pages = 187–209 | year = 2007 | number = 37:3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vudl 333067 MEDIUM.jpg|thumb|''Chicago Ledger'' Vol. XLIX, no. 21; May 21, 1921]]

'''The ''Chicago Ledger''''' was a story paper published in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] from 1872 until 1924. Put out by the Ledger Company and edited by Samuel H. Williams, the ''Ledger'' was a [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] literary magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Frank Luther|title=A History of American Magazines, v.4|date=1957|publisher=The Belknap Press of the Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge(MA)|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such periodicals were printed using engraved steel sheets. The plates, or casts of them, were then sent out to be printed and inserted into other newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=John Edward|title=Newspaper Designing|date=1947|publisher=Harper|location=New York|page=468|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b112907|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ledger'' subscriptions originally sold for $1 for 52 issues and, by 1879, the paper had a circulation of 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=Herbert E.|title=The Literary Interests of Chicago, III &amp; IV|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=January 1906|volume=11|issue=4|page=501|jstor=2762563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although begun as a literary paper of "a good class,"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Franklin William|title=Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814-1879, v.6|date=1910|publisher=Trustees of the Illinois State Historical Library|location=Springfield (IL)|page=111|url=https://archive.org/details/newspapersandpe00scotgoog|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Ledger'' eventually became more melodramatic in tone. In his 1910 book, '''Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois''', Franklin Scott, notes that "[t]he sensational, although not immoral, character of the Ledger stories, and the use that the large mail-order houses have made of its advertising columns, have given this paper an unusually long life and extensive circulation."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1892, [[William D. Boyce]], who helped to found the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and later the [[Lone Scouts of America]], purchased the ''Ledger'' and turned it into a "mail order" paper. As such, the Ledger relied on advertising by direct mail retailers to support its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Frank Luther|title=A History of American Magazines, v.4|date=1957|publisher=The Belknap Press of the Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge(MA)|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vyUuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U0r9jlEr6ezdwhlFcDh5Ly6ikp-8g&amp;ci=17%2C15%2C949%2C1540&amp;edge=0&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of publication made money without a large initial outlay. The ''Ledger'' contained serialized fiction and short stories designed to appeal to the whole family. Later issues had a supplement called the ''Little Ledger'', which offered "Useful Knowledge, Romance, and Amusement for Young People."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Edward T. LeBlanc Memorial Dime Novel Bibliography|url=http://dimenovels.org/Series/194|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vudl 389675 MEDIUM.jpg|thumb|left|Agent Button for The ''Saturday Blade'' and The ''Chicago Ledger'']]
The W.D. Boyce Company operated from the "second skyscraper in Chicago," at 30 North Dearborn Street&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Advertisement|journal=Marketing Communications|date=1921|volume=117|issue=December 1|page=148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLU9AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until moving to the historic [[Boyce Building]] at 500-510 North Dearborn Street. Boyce sold the ''Chicago Ledger'' and ''The Saturday Blade'', known together as Boyce's Big Weeklies, through a network of news boys. They earned two cents per paper sold and were not charged for unsold issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frasca|first1=Ralph|title=The Rise and Fall of the Sunday Globe|date=1992|publisher=Susquehanna University Press|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fnPP-BeS81oC&amp;dq|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system worked well for the company as it provided them with a sales force in rural areas and functioned in accordance with Boyce's philosophy of providing rural boys with advantages more easily accessed in cities. Their recruiting material bore the slogan, "The best way to help a boy is to help him to help himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=W.D.

The '''Chimilas''' or ''Ette Ennaka''&lt;ref name=Adelaar/&gt; are an indigenous people in the Andes of north-eastern Colombia. Their [[Chimila language]] is part of the [[Chibcha language]] family; there were estimated to be around 1000 speakers in 1998.&lt;ref name=Adelaar/&gt; At the time of the Spanish Conquest the [[Ariguaní River]] valley was the strategic centre of their territory.&lt;ref name=Adelaar&gt;Willem F. H. Adelaar, Pieter Muysken (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UiwaUY6KsY8C&amp;pg=PA75 The Languages of the Andes]''. [[Cambridge University Press]] p75&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Serranía del Perijá]] mountains the [[Yukpas]] were also part of the Chimila confederation of tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{Citation|last=Gutierrez Hinojosa|first= Tomas Dario|last2=|first2=|authorlink=|title=Valledupa: Musica de una Historia|location=Bogotá|publisher=Editorial Grijalbo|year=2000|isbn=958-639-175-2}}, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Columbian era==
At the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] they were established in most of the [[Cesar River]] basin and its valley (including [[Valledupar]] in the [[Cesar Department]]) between the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] and the [[Serranía del Perijá]] mountain ranges and bordering the [[Magdalena River]].&lt;ref name=cesar&gt;{{es icon}} Cesar 30 Años de Progreso – Gobernación del Cesar (1997). Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; A Chimila [[cacique]] at the time of the Conquest lent his name to the city of [[Chimichagua]], Colombia, while another, ''Upar'', lent his name to Valledupar, via the Spanish ("valley of Upar"). The "Cesar" name of the Cesar River and Cesar Department is an adaptation from the Chimila indigenous word ''Chet-tzar'' or ''Zazare'' ("calm water") into Spanish, in reference to the Cesar River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/musica/musabo/pag09-17.htm LABLAA - Luis Galvis: Don Gonzalo] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two major cities in the region; one was called ''Thamara'' (present-day [[Tamalameque]]) and the other was ''Upari'' named after their powerful chief. the [[cacique Upar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gutierrez Hinojosa|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish scribes described Thamara as a very large city with more than a thousand huts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdez|first=Gonzalo|last2=|first2=|authorlink=|title=Historia General y Natural de las Indias, Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Oceano|location=Asunción|publisher=Editorial Guarinia|year=|isbn=}}, p303&lt;/ref&gt; The Chimila society was structured in a pyramidal structure with a working class divided into fishers, hunters, artisans, miners, goldsmiths and merchants. The Chimilas used [[Arhuacos]] as their slaves. The Chimilas believed in an immortal figure called ''Masirguta'' and were monotheist believing in the god ''Narayajana'' (also referred to as ''Yao''). Chimilas were practiced musical rites with drums of many sizes, flutes with a tip made out of wax varying in between two and five holes, imitated the singing of the [[rufous-vented chachalaca]] birds with an instrument called ''[[guacharaca]]'' and [[maracas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gutierrez Hinojosa|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chimilas cultivated the [[maize]] in a technical manner and to a lesser extent other local species of vegetables and fruits for consumption and certain trees near their huts to produces shadows and freshen their area. Chimilas also harvested the ''[[Gynerium sagittatum]]'', a cane used to produce bows and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gutierrez Hinojosa|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conquest==
Around 1720 the Chimilas began a guerrilla war against the [[Spanish Empire]]. Violence continued well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Adelaar/&gt; In 1990 a reservation called Issa Oristuna was created.&lt;ref name=Adelaar/&gt;

'''Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence''' (a.k.a. '''CETI''') is a branch of the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] that focuses on composing and [[decipher]]ing [[interstellar messages]] that theoretically, could be understood by another technological civilization.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Steven |title=Greetings, E.T. (Please Don’t Murder Us.) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/magazine/greetings-et-please-dont-murder-us.html |date=28 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study once was known as ''exosemiotics''.&lt;ref name="Reed2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reed | first=Mary L | title=Exosemiotics: an inter-disciplinary approach | journal=Acta Astronautica | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=46 | issue=10-12 | year=2000 | issn=0094-5765 | doi=10.1016/s0094-5765(00)00037-0 | pages=719–723| bibcode=2000AcAau..46..719R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known CETI experiment of its kind was the 1974 [[Arecibo message]] composed by [[Frank Drake]].

There are multiple independent organizations and individuals engaged in CETI research; the generic application of abbreviations CETI and SETI ([[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]) in this article should not be taken as referring to any particular organization (such as the [[SETI Institute]]).

CETI research has focused on four broad areas: [[mathematics|mathematical]] languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]], algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering "natural" language communication. There remain many [[undeciphered writing systems]] in human communication, such as [[Linear A]], discovered by archeologists. Much of the research effort is directed at how to overcome similar problems of decipherment that arise in many scenarios of interplanetary communication.

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Douglas Vakoch]], [[David Grinspoon]], [[Seth Shostak]], and [[David Brin]]) at an annual meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[cosmos]] was a good idea.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150213"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-cosmos-risky.html|title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET?

== History ==

In the 19th century there were many books and articles about the possible inhabitants of other planets. Many people believed that intelligent beings might live on the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and [[Venus]].&lt;ref name="Launius"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Launius | first=Roger D. | title=Venus-Earth-Mars: Comparative Climatology and the Search for Life in the Solar System | journal=Life | publisher=MDPI AG | volume=2 | issue=3 | date=19 September 2012 | issn=2075-1729 | doi=10.3390/life2030255 | pages=255–273| bibcode=2012Life....2..255L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since travel to other planets was not possible at that time, some people suggested ways to signal the extraterrestrials even before radio was discovered. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is often credited with an [[Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal|1820 proposal]] suggested that a giant triangle and three squares, the [[Pythagoras]], could be drawn on the [[Siberia]]n tundra. The outlines of the shapes would have been ten-mile-wide strips of pine forest, the interiors could be rye or wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J. Madeleine|last2=Nash |first3=Richard|last3=Woodbury |title=Space: Onward to Mars|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967915,00.html|date=July 18, 1988|page=50|subscription=yes|volume=132|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|'''The Pythagoras]] [[Joseph Johann Littrow]] proposed in 1819 to use the Sahara as a sort of blackboard. Giant trenches several hundred yards wide could delineate twenty-mile-wide shapes. Then the trenches would be filled with water, and then enough kerosene could be poured on top of the water to burn for six hours. Using this method, a different signal could be sent every night.&lt;ref name="Moore2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Moore | first=P. | title=Our Universe: An Introduction | publisher=AAPPL Artists &amp; Photographers Press, Limited | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-904332-41-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2CrRW01bMC&amp;pg=PA52 | access-date=23 July 2018 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, other astronomers were looking for signs of life on other planets. In 1822, [[Franz von Gruithuisen]] thought he saw a giant city and evidence of agriculture on the moon, but astronomers using more powerful instruments refuted his claims. Gruithuisen also believed he saw evidence of life on [[Venus]]. [[Ashen light]] had been observed on Venus, and he postulated that it was caused by a great fire festival put on by the inhabitants to celebrate their new emperor. Later he revised his position, stating that the Venusians could be burning their rainforest to make more farmland.&lt;ref&gt;Cattermole, P., &amp; Moore, P. (1997). Atlas of Venus. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1800s, the possibility of life on the moon was put to rest. Astronomers at that time believed in the [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Kant-Laplace hypothesis]], which stated that the farthest planets from the sun are the oldest—therefore Mars was more likely to have advanced civilizations than Venus.&lt;ref name="ebsolar"&gt;Owen, T. C. (2001) "Solar system: origin of the solar system", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Deluxe CDROM edition&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations focused on contacting Martians. In 1877 [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] announced he had discovered "canali" ("channels" in Italian, which occur naturally, and mistranslated as "canals", which are artificial) on Mars—this was followed by thirty years of Mars enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chayka |first1=Kyle |title=A Short History of Martian Canals and Mars Fever |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a17529/a-short-history-of-martian-canals-and-mars-fever/ |website=popularmechanics.com |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Martian canals proved illusory.

The inventor [[Charles Cros]] was convinced that pinpoints of light observed on Mars and Venus were the lights of large cities. He spent years of his life trying to get funding for a giant mirror with which to signal the Martians. The mirror would be focused on the Martian desert, where the intense reflected sunlight could be used to burn figures into the Martian sand.&lt;ref name="Ley 1953 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Ley | first=W. | title=Rockets, missiles, and space travel | publisher=Viking Press | year=1953 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZdTAAAAMAAJ | access-date=23 July 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] mentioned many times during his career that he thought his inventions such as his [[Tesla coil]], used in the role of a [[Tesla coil#Utilization and production|"resonant receiver"]], could communicate with other planets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Seifer| first =Marc J.| title =Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius| publisher =Carol Pub.| year =1996| location =Secaucus, New Jersey|chapter=Martian Fever (1895-1896)| isbn = 978-1-55972-329-9 | oclc = 33865102| page =157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| date=July 20, 1931| title=Tesla at 75| periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=3|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742063-3,00.html| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he even had observed repetitive signals of what he believed were extraterrestrial radio communications coming from Venus or Mars in 1899. These "signals" turned out to be terrestrial radiation, however.

Around 1900, the [[Guzman Prize]] was created; the first person to establish interplanetary communication would be awarded 100,000 francs under one stipulation: Mars was excluded because Madame Guzman thought communicating with Mars would be too easy to deserve a prize.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, Willy. Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel (revised). New York: The Viking Press (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical and scientific languages==

===Lincos (Lingua cosmica)===
{{main|Lincos (artificial language)}}
Published in 1960 by [[Hans Freudenthal]], ''Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse'',  expands upon Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Freudenthal H |year=1960 |title=Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse. Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics (Book 28) | publisher=North-Holland, Amsterdam| ISBN=978-0-444-53393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several researchers have expanded further upon Freudenthal's work. A dictionary resembling Lincos was featured in the Carl Sagan novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'' and film adaptation.

===Astraglossa===
Published in 1963 by [[Lancelot Hogben]], "Astraglossa" is an essay describing a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses. In Hogben's system, short pulses represent numbers, while trains of long pulses represent symbols for addition, subtraction, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hogben, Lancelot |title= Science in Authority |publisher= New York: W. W. Norton |year=1963 |ISBN=1245639935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carl Sagan ===
In the 1985 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] explored in some depth how a message might be constructed to allow communication with an alien civilization, using [[prime number]]s as a starting point, followed by various universal principles and facts of [[mathematics]] and science.

Sagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. [[Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence]]. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.{{ISBN|0262191067}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated collection of articles on the same topic was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Vakoch, Douglas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4oxZgRn3QFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22communication+with+extraterrestrial+intelligence%22+vakoch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wrekTd_BGc7TiAKPupDjCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence]. SUNY Press, 2011, 500 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival (film)===
In 2016, [[McGill University]] Linguistics Professor, [[Jessica Coon]], spoke with Business Insider about how 2016 sci-fi blockbuster, [[Arrival (film)|''Arrival'']], properly portrayed how humans might actually communicate with aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival' nails how humans might actually talk to aliens, a linguist says|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/alien-language-in-arrival-linguist-2016-11|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create this language, film producers consulted with [[Wolfram Research]] Founder and CEO, [[Stephen Wolfram]] - creator of the computer programming language known as the [[Wolfram Language]] - and his son, Christopher. Together, they helped analyze approximately 100 [[logograms]] that ultimately served as the basis for the [[alien language]] utilized throughout the film. This work, along with many other thoughts with regard to artificial intelligence communication has been documented in an interview published by Space.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival', AI and Alien Math: Q&amp;A with Stephen Wolfram|url = https://www.space.com/34783-stephen-wolfram-arrival-interview.html|website = Space.com|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During production, Wolfram's personal copy of [[Lincos (artificial language)|''Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse'']] was also on set.

===A language based on the fundamental facts of science===
Published in 1992 by Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle, ''A language based on the fundamental facts of science'' is a paper describing a language similar in syntax to Astraglossa and Lincos, but which builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Devito, C. | author2=Oerle, R | last-author-amp=yes |title=A Language Based on the Fundamental Facts of Science| journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |year=1990| volume= 43 | pages=561–568 | PMID= 11540499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Busch general-purpose binary language used in Lone Signal transmissions===
In 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing SETI Messages Design |first1=Michael W. |last1=Busch |first2=Rachel M. |last2=Reddick |work=Astrobiology Science Conference 2010 |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5070.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HnXxFGgj?url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5070.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}; {{allow wrap|{{cite journal|title=Testing SETI Messages (Extended version) |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/lonesignal-prod-web/ENCODING-MWB_PAPER.pdf |first1=Michael W. |last1=Busch |first2=Rachel.

This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the Lone Signal hailing message.&lt;ref name="Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project |first1=Charles R. |last1=Chapman |work= |url=http://sites.google.com/site/lonesignalactiveseti/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IqrYp0fX?url=https://sites.google.com/site/lonesignalactiveseti/ |archivedate=2013-08-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictorial messages==
Pictorial communication systems seek to describe fundamental mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as [[bitmap]]s. These messages presume that the recipient has similar visual capabilities and can understand basic mathematics and geometry. A common critique of these systems is that they presume a shared understanding of special shapes, which may not be the case with a species with substantially different vision, and therefore a different way of interpreting visual information. For instance, an arrow representing the movement of some object could be interpreted as a weapon firing.

===Pioneer probes===
The two [[Pioneer plaque]]s were launched on [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] in 1972 and 1973, depicting the location of the Earth in the galaxy and the solar system, and the form of the human body.

===Voyager probes===
Launched in 1977, the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes carried two [[Voyager Golden Record|golden records]] that were inscribed with diagrams depicting the human form, our solar system, and its location. Also included were recordings of images and sounds from Earth.

===The Arecibo message===
The [[Arecibo message]], transmitted in 1974, was a 1679 [[pixel]] image with 73 rows and 23 columns. It shows the numbers one through ten, the atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, the formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA, the number of nucleotides in DNA, the double helix structure of DNA, a figure of a human being and its height, the population of Earth, a diagram of our solar system, and an image of the Arecibo telescope with its diameter.

===Cosmic Call messages===
The ''[[Cosmic Call]]'' messages consisted of a few digital sections - "Rosetta Stone", copy of Arecibo Message, Bilingual Image Glossary, the Braastad message, as well as text, audio, video, and other image files submitted for transmission by everyday people around the world. The "Rosetta Stone" was composed by [[Stephane Dumas]] and [[Yvan Dutil]] and represents a multi-page bitmap that builds a vocabulary of symbols representing numbers and mathematical operations. The message proceeds from basic mathematics to progressively more complex concepts, including physical processes and objects (such as a [[hydrogen]] atom). The message is designed with a noise resistant format and characters that make it resistant to alteration by noise. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from [[Evpatoria Planetary Radar]] under scientific guidance of [[Alexander L. Zaitsev]]. Richard Braastad coordinated the overall project.

==Multi-modal messages==

===Teen-Age Message===
{{Main|Teen Age Message}}
The ''[[Teen Age Message|Teen-Age Message]]'', composed by [[Russia]]n scientists ([[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Zaitsev]], Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the [[Evpatoria Planetary Radar|70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center]] to six star systems resembling that of the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consists of three parts:

Section 1 represents a coherent-sounding radio signal with slow Doppler wavelength tuning to imitate transmission from the Sun's center. This signal was transmitted in order to help extraterrestrials detect the TAM and diagnose the radio propagation effect of the interstellar medium.

Section 2 is analog information representing musical melodies performed on the [[theremin]]. This electric musical instrument produces a quasi-monochromatic signal, which is easily detectable across interstellar distances. There were seven musical compositions in the First Theremin Concert for Aliens. The 14-minute analog transmission of the theremin concert would take almost 50 hours by digital means; see [http://www.faces-from-earth.net/images/Files/Zaitsev_JCTE1107.pdf The First Musical Interstellar Radio Message].

Section 3 represents a well-known Arecibo-like binary digital information: the logotype of the TAM, bilingual Russian and English greeting to aliens, and image glossary.

Star systems to which the message was sent are the following:&lt;ref name="cplire.ru"/&gt;

===Cosmic Call 2 (Cosmic Call 2003) message===
The [[Cosmic Call]]-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program ''Ella'', and the Braastad message.

==Algorithmic messages==
Algorithmic communication systems are a relatively new field within CETI. In these systems, which build upon early work on mathematical languages, the sender describes a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a [[virtual machine]]. Algorithmic communication has a number of advantages over static pictorial and mathematical messages,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009|reason=cite a reliable source that says this}} including: localized communication (the recipient can probe and interact with the programs within a message, without transmitting a reply to the sender and then waiting years for a response), [[forward error correction]] (the message might contain algorithms that process data elsewhere in the message), and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message. In principle, a sophisticated program when run on a fast enough computing substrate, may exhibit complex behavior and perhaps, intelligence.

===CosmicOS===
''[[CosmicOS]]'', designed by Paul Fitzpatrick at [[MIT]], describes a [[virtual machine]] that is derived from [[lambda calculus]].

===Logic Gate Matrices===
''Logic Gate Matrices'' (a.k.a. LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal [[virtual machine]] that is constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations, for example: (1,0,0) &lt;-- (OR (0,0,1) (0,0,2)). Using this method, one may describe an arbitrarily complex computing substrate as well as the instructions to be executed on it.{{Clarify|date=March 2009|relevance to communication? Form of compression maybe?}}

==Natural language messages==
This research focuses on the event that we receive a signal or message that is either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or one that is in its natural communicative form. To tackle this difficult, but probable scenario, methods are being developed that first, will detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content: from its physical level encoding and patterns to the parts-of-speech that encode internal and external ontologies.&lt;ref name=Elliott04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott01 /&gt;

Primarily, this structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected.&lt;ref name=Elliott00a /&gt; Aims of this research include: contributing to the understanding of language structure and the detection of intelligent language-like features in signals, to aid the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name=Elliott02a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott02b /&gt;

The problem goal is therefore to separate language from non-language without dialogue, and learn something about the structure of language in the passing. The language may not be human (animals, aliens, computers...), the perceptual space may be unknown, and we cannot presume human language structure, but must begin somewhere. We need to approach the language signal from a naive viewpoint, in effect, increasing our ignorance and assuming as little as possible.&lt;ref name=Elliott00b /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott07 /&gt;

If a sequence can be tokenized, that is, separated into "words", an unknown human language may be distinguished from many other data sequences by the frequency distribution of the tokens. Human languages conform to a [[Zipf's law|Zipfian distribution]], while many (but not all) other data sequences do not. It has been proposed that an alien language also might conform to such a distribution (&lt;ref name=Elliott00b /&gt;). When displayed in a log-log graph of frequency vs. rank, this distribution would appear as a somewhat straight line with a slope of approximately -1. [[SETI]] scientist [[Laurance Doyle]] explains that the slope of a line that represents individual [[Tokenizing#Token|tokens]] in a stream of tokens may indicate whether the stream contains linguistic or other structured content. If the line angles at 45°, the stream contains such content. If the line is flat, it does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=David|title='Through The Wormhole' Host Morgan Freeman: 'We Can't Be' Alone In The Universe (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/morgan-freeman_n_1322480.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=25 May 2013|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Through the Wormhole: Information Theory : Video : Science Channel|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/through-the-wormhole/videos/through-the-wormhole-information-theory.htm|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interspecies communication ==
Some researchers have concluded that in order to communicate with extraterrestrial species, humanity must first try to communicate with Earth's intelligent animal species. [[John C. Lilly]] worked on with [[interspecies communication]] by teaching dolphins English (successful with rhythms, not with understandability, given their different mouth/blowhole shapes). He practiced various disciplines of spirituality and also  ingested [[psychedelic drug]]s such as [[LSD]] and (later) [[ketamine]] in the company of dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin-347 /the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin]&lt;/ref&gt;  He tried to determine whether he could communicate non-verbally with dolphins, and also tried to determine if some extraterrestrial radio signals are intelligent communications.  Similarly, [[Laurance Doyle]],{{CN|date=November 2018}} [[Robert Freitas]]{{CN|date=November 2018}} and [[Brenda McCowan]]{{CN|date=November 2018}} compare the complexity of cetacean and human languages to help determine whether a specific signal from space is complex enough to represent a message that needs to be decoded.

The '''''Etymologicum Genuinum''''' (standard abbreviation '''''E Gen''''') is the conventional modern title given to a [[Lexicography|lexical]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and [[scholiasts]], both ancient and recent, including [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Georgius Choeroboscus]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], [[Orion of Thebes]], [[Oros of Alexandria]] and  [[Theognostus the Grammarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Symeonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship discovered the ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century [[manuscripts]], ''Codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1818 (= A) and ''Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci'' 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest [[recension]] nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by [[Richard Reitzenstein]], who was the first to edit a sample section.&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.&lt;ref&gt;Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by [[Ada Adler]] and continued by [[Klaus Alpers]],&lt;ref&gt;Alpers (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the other by [[François Lasserre]] and [[Nikolaos Livadaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- )&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edition is published under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum'', but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E. Duke, Review of Lasserre and Livadaras (1976), ''[[The Classical Review]]'' (N.S.) 28 (1978) 295-297&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19163">'''Fashion Revolution''' is a not-for-profit global movement with teams in over 100 countries around the world.  Fashion Revolution campaigns for systemic reform of the [[fashion]] industry with a focus on the need for greater [[Transparency (trade)|transparency]] in the fashion [[supply chain]].  Fashion Revolution has designated the anniversary of the [[Rana Plaza]] disaster in [[Bangladesh]] as Fashion Revolution Day. In 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 millions of people around the world called on brands to answer the question Who Made My Clothes? The [[hashtag]] #whomademyclothes became the no.1 global trend on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Muzaffar |first=Zareen |date=27 April 2015 |title=2 Years Later, Bangladesh's Rana Plaza Debacle Continues to Resonate Globally |url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/2-years-later-bangladeshs-rana-plaza-debacle-continues-to-resonate-globally/ |magazine=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dearden |first=Lizzie |date=24 April 2015 |title=Fashion Revolution Day: #whomademyclothes campaign remembers Rana Plaza disaster |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/fashion-revolution-day-whomademyclothes-campaign-remembers-rana-plaza-disaster-10201871.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ayre  |first=Josie |date=24 April 2015 |title=It's Fashion Revolution Day!

==History==
Fashion Revolution was created in 2013 in response to the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh by [[Carry Somers]] and Orsola de Castro.  Somers and De Castro had worked as [[fashion designers]] in the UK for over two decades and saw that the factory collapse could act as a catalyst for change in the industry.

==Fashion Revolution Day / Fashion Revolution Week==
Fashion Revolution Day takes place annually on 24 April, the anniversary of the [[2013 Savar building collapse|2013 Rana Plaza building collapse]] when 1133 died and over 2500 were injured.  In 2016, it expanded into Fashion Revolution Week.

The first Fashion Revolution Day took place on 24 April 2014.  Fashion Revolution's hashtag #insideout was the no. 1 global trend on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfam.org.uk/education/education-blog/2015/03/fashion-revolution-day&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hepburn |first=Stephanie |date=14 April 2015 |title=Can a hashtag change the fashion industry? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/apr/14/can-a-hashtag-change-the-fashion-industry |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generation Snowflake''', or '''Snowflake Generation''', is a [[neologistic]] term used to characterize the young adults of the 2010s as being more prone to taking offense and less resilient than previous [[generation]]s, or as being too emotionally vulnerable to cope with views that challenge their own. The term is considered derogatory.&lt;ref name=Collins2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/snowflake-generation |title = snowflake generation |work = [[Collins English Dictionary]] |access-date = 18 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Green |first1 = Miranda |title = Year in a Word: Snowflake |url = https://www.ft.com/content/65708d48-c394-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354 |accessdate = 27 December 2016 |work = [[Financial Times]] |date = 21 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several informal examples of usage of the word ''[[Snowflake (slang)|snowflake]]'' to refer to people.

==Background==
The term ''snowflake'' has been used to refer to children raised by their parents in ways that give them [[wikt:special snowflake syndrome|an inflated sense of their own uniqueness]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trophies&gt;{{cite news |title = Are Trophies Really So Bad? |first = Anna |last = North |date = 25 July 2014 |work = [[The New York Times]] |url = http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/are-trophies-really-so-bad/?_r=0 |accessdate = 17 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RumbelowDelicate"&gt;{{cite news |last = Rumbelow |first = Helen |title = Generation snowflake: Why millenials are mocked for being too delicate |url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/generation-snowflake-why-millenials-are-mocked-for-being-too-delicate/news-story/2f885d016af1a881bff92b69282fd88e |accessdate = 15 November 2016 |work = [[The Australian]] |location = Surry Hills |date = 9 November 2016 |subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage of ''snowflake'' has been attributed to [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'', and its [[Fight Club|1999 film adaptation]]. Both the novel and the film include the line "You are not special.

In it she wrote about a confrontation between [[Yale University]] students and faculty Head of College, [[Nicholas Christakis]].&lt;ref name="GFox"&gt;{{cite book|title=I Find That Offensive!|last=Fox|first=Claire|publisher=Biteback Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-849-54981-3|location=London|authorlink=Claire Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spec"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/generation-snowflake-how-we-train-our-kids-to-be-censorious-cry-babies/|title=Generation Snowflake: how we train our kids to be censorious cry-babies|last=Fox|first=Claire|date=4 June 2016|work=[[The Spectator]]|location=London|authorlink=Claire Fox|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confrontation arose after Christakis's wife, [[Erika Christakis]], a lecturer at the university, had suggested students should "relax a bit rather than labeling fancy dress Halloween costumes as culturally insensitive", according to Fox.&lt;ref name="GFox" /&gt; Fox described the video showing the students' reaction as a "screaming, almost hysterical mob of students".&lt;ref name="GFox" /&gt; Fox said the backlash to the viral video led to the disparaging moniker "generation snowflake" for the students.&lt;ref name="GFox" /&gt;

"Snowflake generation" was recognised as one of ''[[Collins English Dictionary|Collins Dictionary]]''{{'s}} 2016 words of the year.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; ''Collins'' defines the term as "the young adults of the 2010s, viewed as being less resilient and more prone to taking Offense than previous generations".&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/word-lovers-blog/new/top-10-collins-words-of-the-year-2016,323,HCB.html |title = Top 10 Collins Words of the Year 2016 |date = 3 November 2016 |work = Collins English Dictionary |accessdate = 18 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2016 the ''[[Financial Times]]'' included ''snowflake'' in their annual ''Year in a Word'' list, defining it as "a derogatory term for someone deemed too emotionally vulnerable to cope with views that challenge their own, particularly in universities and other forums once known for robust debate" and noting that the insult had been aimed at an entire generation.&lt;ref name=FT /&gt;

==Usage==
"Generation Snowflake" and ''snowflake'' have been used in relation to purported generational differences; ''snowflake'' and similar terms have also been used more broadly.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

===Generational differences===
According to Claire Fox, members of Generation Snowflake "are genuinely distressed by ideas that run contrary to their worldview"; they are more likely than previous generations of students to report that they have mental health problems.&lt;ref name="Spec" /&gt; Fox and journalist [[Bryony Gordon]] described these traits as being coupled with a strong sense of [[entitlement]].&lt;ref name="Spec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryony"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = Bryony Gordon |last = Gordon |first = Bryony |title = I feel sorry for the poor ickle millennials |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/04/08/bryony-gordon-why-i-feel-sorry-for-the-snowflake-generation/ |accessdate = 9 July 2016 |work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location = London |date = 8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article titled "The 'Snowflake' Generation: Real or Imagined?" from the [[John William Pope Center]]  reasons proposed by researchers for the reported increase in mental health problems among university students differ.&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Keaveney|first1 = Stephanie |title = The 'Snowflake' Generation: Real or Imagined? |url = http://www.popecenter.org/2016/12/snowflake-generation-real-imagined/ |accessdate = 29 December 2016 |publisher = The John William Pope Center |date = 19 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They vary from increased pressure on students, reduced self-reliance resulting from overuse of mental health services, to university authorities' expectations of student fragility.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;

Fox argues [[helicopter parents]] created Generation Snowflake, and argues the emphasis on self-esteem in childhood resulted in adults "tiptoeing around children's sensitivities" to avoid "damaging their wellbeing".&lt;ref name="Spec" /&gt; In the UK, Tom Bennett was recruited by the government to address behaviour in schools.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite news |last = Espinoza |first = Javier |date = 19 February 2016 |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/12165433/Expose-children-to-extremist-views-early-on-to-prepare-them-for-university-says-expert.html |title = Expose children to extremist views early on to prepare them for university, says expert |work = The Daily Telegraph |location = London |accessdate = 18 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented Generation Snowflake children at school can be over-protected, leading to problems when they progress to university and are confronted with "the harsher realities of life".&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt; Bennett argues being sheltered from conflict as children can lead to university students who react with intolerance towards people and things they believe may offend someone or toward people who have differing political opinions, leading to a phenomenon called "[[no-platforming]]", where speakers on controversial topics are prohibited from speaking on a university campus.&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt;

In 2016 some law lecturers at the [[University of Oxford]] began using [[trigger warnings]] to alert students to potentially distressing subject matter. This drew criticism from Fox and ''[[GQ]]'' writer Eleanor Halls, who related the phenomenon to Generation Snowflake, and questioned how well law students educated with trigger warnings would function as lawyers.&lt;ref name=GQ&gt;{{cite news |last = Halls |first = Eleanor |title = Millennials. Stop being offended by, like, literally everything |url = http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/millennials-created-generation-snowflake |accessdate = 9 July 2016 |work = [[GQ]] |date = 12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxStandard&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Fox |first1 = Claire |title = The fear of giving Offense is killing democracy and stifles truth |url = https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/claire-fox-the-fear-of-giving-offense-is-killing-democracy-and-stifles-truth-a3245226.html |accessdate = 18 December 2016 |publisher = [[Evening Standard]] |location = London |date = 11 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university had not adopted a formal policy on trigger warnings, leaving their use to the discretion of individual lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Ali |first1 = Aftab |title = Oxford University law students being issued with 'trigger warnings' before lectures |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/oxford-university-law-students-being-issued-with-trigger-warnings-before-lectures-a7022311.html |accessdate = 8 December 2016 |work = The Independent |location = London |date = 10 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative connotations of the term Generation Snowflake have been criticized for having been applied too widely; Bennett also commented: "It's true that, for some of these children, losing fast wi-fi is a crisis and being offended on the internet is a disaster.... But then I remember the other ones, and I reckon they all balance each other out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Bennett |first = Tom |date = 20 November 2015 |title = For every flaky child we have one with real guts |url = https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/every-flaky-child-we-have-one-real-guts |work = [[TES (magazine)|TES]] |accessdate = 18 November 2016 |subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Brooks wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that "students have always been instrumental in turning the tide of public opinion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Brooks |first1 = Richard |title = In defence of generation snowflake- everyone's favourite punching bag |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/11/14/in-defence-of-generation-snowflake--everyones-favourite-punching/ |accessdate = 19 November 2016 |work = The Daily Telegraph |location = London |date = 14 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mark Kingwell]], philosophy professor at [[University of Toronto]] has objected to the use of the term to characterize political protesting as "whining", in response to protests by [[Millennials]] following [[United States presidential election, 2016|Donald Trump's election as president of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Kingwell"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Kingwell |first1 = Mark |title = Generation Snowflake?

Historian [[Neil Howe]], who has written multiple books on generations, describes the term "Generation Snowflake" as part of a wider societal pattern of criticizing Millennials. Howe says this includes the 2013 article from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' titled ''Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation'' and ''The Millennials'' skit from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' which was shown in 2015.&lt;ref name=Howe1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generation Snowflake: Really? (Part 1 Of 3)|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2017/04/27/generation-snowflake-really-part-1-of-3/#6837ba629148|accessdate=2 July 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stein|first1=Joel|title=Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation|url=http://time.com/247/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation/|accessdate=2 July 2017|publisher=Time|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millennials|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/millennials/2916016?snl=1|accessdate=2 July 2017|issue=SNL Session 41|publisher=nbc.com|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a three part series written for ''[[Forbes]]'' titled ''Generation Snowflake: Really?'', Howe, who is known for [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]], disagrees with the negative characterizations of the term "generation snowflake", but he says it is based on "kernels of truth". Howe says "snowflake conjures up specialness and risk aversion" and he asserts "Millennials manifest a good deal of both." Howe attributes this to being raised during a time of [[moral panic]] over children, when protecting children was an increased societal priority. He says this cohort grew up with a "family fan club protecting and supporting them" resulting in high [[self-esteem]]. Howe says the term generation snowflake implies having high self-esteem is a negative quality, while he argues it is a positive quality associated with a reduction in youth violence and reduced young adult violent crime rate, as well as the reduction in [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] monitored youth risk behaviors such as: not wearing a bicycle helmet, not wearing a seatbelt, having sex, drinking alcohol, and smoking cigarettes. Howe says risk aversion extends to older Millennials as well, citing a reduction in gambling, reduction in investing in the stock market, and reduced attendance at bars/nightclubs. Instead of being a negative as portrayed by term "generation snowflake" Howe argues "one of the many benefits of having a high self-esteem is more prudent behavior".&lt;ref name=Howe1/&gt;

Howe notes that "generation snowflake" is also used to criticize young adults for living with their parents at higher rates than older generations. Howe attributes this partially to the [[Great Recession]], but says "that's clearly not the whole story, because the share of Millennials living with their parents is still rising eight years later". He attributes this to young adults being closer to their parents than previous generations saying "Millennials are emotionally much closer to their [[Baby boomer|Boomer]] parents than those Boomers ever were to their own parents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generation Snowflake: Really? (Part 2 Of 3)|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2017/05/01/generation-snowflake-really-part-2-of-3/#34e67e50257d|accessdate=2 July 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the criticism associated with the term "generation snowflake" Howe says "Every generation is shaped differently by history. Every rising generation brings with it new and different priorities. And every older generation feels threatened when they sense these new priorities could push their world in an unfamiliar direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generation Snowflake: Really?

===Broader usage===
In her syndicated column, [[Michelle Malkin]] criticized the provision of the [[Affordable Care Act]] which requires employer-based health coverage to extend to adult children up to 26 years of age, describing it as the "slacker mandate" and calling these young adults "precious snowflakes". Malkin argues the provision has "cultural consequences" in that it "reduces the incentives for 20-somethings to grow up and seek independent lives and livelihoods".&lt;ref name="Malkin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/2016/11/16/the-slacker-mandate-and-the-safety-pin-generation-n2246311|title=The Slacker Mandate and the Safety Pin Generation|date=16 November 2016|work=Townhall|last1=Malkin|first1=Michelle|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hakuzōsu'''(白蔵主), also written '''Hakuzousu''', is the name of a popular ''[[kitsune]]'' character who pretended to be a priest in [[Japanese folklore]].

==Legend==
The Buddhist monk Hakuzōsu lived in [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]] at the temple Shōrin-ji.

He was a believer in [[Inari Ōkami]] sama and kept a few kitsunes in his temple.

He used these kitsunes to foretell the future.

==Plays==
The legend of Hakuzōsu became a [[Kyōgen]] play, Tsurigitsune (‘Fox Trapping’) / Konkai (‘The Cry of the Fox’)

In this story, a hunter is visited by his uncle, the priest Hakuzōsu, who lectures his nephew on the evils of killing foxes. The hunter is nearly convinced, but after the priest departs, he hears the cry of the fox and realizes it wasn't his uncle at all but a fox in guise. The fox resumes his natural form and reverts to his wild ways, takes the bait in a trap and is captured.

== Comics ==
=== Marvel Comics (1979–2004) ===
Since 1979, [[Marvel Comics]] has published its own comic books based on ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Micronauts]]'', ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'', set in [[Earth-616]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. However, the ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'' series were later established non-canon (they set on Earth-91274). Some of the crossover series featuring both Hasbro and Marvel characters were ''The X-Men and the Micronauts'' (guest starring the [[X-Men]]) and ''[[New Avengers/Transformers]]'' (guest starring the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]). Despite the licensing rights reverting to Hasbro, indirect references to ''Rom'' and ''Micronauts'' have occurred since.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Dreamwave Productions (2004) ===
On 2004, [[Dreamwave Productions]] published ''Transformers/G.I. Joe'', another crossover set in the time of [[World War I]], and including a one-shot titled ''Transformers/G.I. Joe: Divided Front''. This series only lasted six issues, due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== IDW Publishing (2005–present) ===
{{Main|Hasbro Comic Book Universe|Hasbro Reconstruction}}

Between 2005 and 2008, [[IDW Publishing]] acquired the license to make comics based on ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'', but neither have ever shared the same [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] before. On 2016, IDW announced the [[Hasbro Reconstruction]] branding along with the crossover event ''[[Revolution (IDW Publishing)|Revolution]]'', which officially set ''[[The Transformers (IDW Publishing)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[G.I.

=== Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions (1983–1987) ===
From 1983 to 1987, [[Marvel Productions]] and [[Sunbow Productions]] developed the series ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[Jem (TV series)|Jem]]'' and ''[[Inhumanoids]]''. These series had been hinted to share the same universe, mostly due to the appearance of the character named [[Hector Ramirez (Sunbow)|Hector Ramirez]].{{Citation needed|reason=Ni official link to be|date=December 2016}}

=== ''Transformers: Aligned'' continuity (2010–2017) ===
The ''Transformers: Aligned'' continuity (comprising the animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'') features a reference to [[M.A.S.K.]] as a division of the United States military that developed a special vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' - Season 3: ''Beast Hunters'' - Episode 5: Project Predacon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'' - Season 1 - Episode 17: One of Our Mini-Cons is Missing&lt;/ref&gt;

The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Henri Bergson.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Henri Bergson|Bergson]]]]
The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

=== 11th century – 16th century ===

; 13th century
About 1275, in an early attempt to use [[logic]]al means to produce [[knowledge]], [[Ramon Llull]] designed a method of combining attributes selected from a number of lists, which he first published in full in his ''Ars generalis ultima'' or ''Ars magna'' (1305).  This used concept structures of the [[mind map|mind-map]] form.

;1470s
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]

=== 1500s–2000s ===

There was no real demand for such a science until the 19th century, when the [[Industrial Revolution]] started:
* [[William J. J. Gordon|William Gordon]] - [[Synectics]]
* [[Edward Matchett]] - [[Fundamental design method]] (1968)
* Idan Gafni - Association expansion cards ([[Object Pairing]])
* [[Edward de Bono]] - a complex of techniques
* [[L. D. Miles]] - [[Value engineering]] - a technique for operating with available knowledge

Following along Miles’ line of thought were:
* [[Fritz Zwicky]] - [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological Analysis]]
* [[Yoji Akoa]] - Quality Function Deployment
* beginning in the mid-1940s - start of ''knowledge-based'' creativity era by [[TRIZ]]

*[[Lawrence Delos Miles]] - [[Value engineering]] - technique for operating with available knowledge, Methods of collecting and organizing knowledge about a problem and the system. [[Functional analysis]]. Morphological approach.
*[[George Polya]]
;1950s
*[[Alex Osborn]] - Methods of reducing [[psychological inertia]]. [[Team work]].
*[[Sid Parnes]]
*[[Genrich Altshuller|Genrikh Altshuller]] - [[TRIZ]], [[Algorithm of Inventive Problems Solving|ARIZ]]
;1960s
*[[Carl Jung]] classified creativity as one of the five main instinctive forces in humans (Jung 1964)
*[[Edward Matchett]] - [[Fundamental design method]] (1968)
* [[Carl Rogers]]' essay, "Towards a Theory of Creativity" (1961):
*[[William J. J. Gordon|William Gordon]] - [[Synectics]]
*[[Edward de Bono]] - [[Lateral thinking]]
*[[J. P. Guilford]] - measuring creativity
;1970s

*[[Tony Buzan]] - [[mind map]]
*[[Idan Gafni]] - association expansion cards concept ([[Object Pairing]])
;2000s (decade)
*[http://www.crea.server.de/ Creative capabilities and the promotion of highly innovative research] - organizational factors fostering creativity in science
*[[Michel Weber]]'s [https://www.academia.edu/392183/Whiteheads_Pancreativism._Jamesian_Applications pancreativism]

=== Undated ===
* The [[Reviewed Dendrogram]] technique, relies on the experience of designers which may be limited to certain areas of expertise such as chemistry or electronics. Thus, a solution that might be simpler and cheaper using magnetism could be missed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48276">The [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]] from [[Eon Productions]] features numerous musical compositions since its inception in 1962, many of which are now considered classic pieces of British film music. The best known of these pieces is the ubiquitous "[[James Bond Theme]]". Other instrumentals, such as the "007 Theme" or "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", and various songs, such as [[Shirley Bassey]]'s "[[Goldfinger (Shirley Bassey song)|Goldfinger]]", [[Paul McCartney]]'s "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", [[Carly Simon]]'s "[[Nobody Does It Better]]", [[Sheena Easton]]'s "[[For Your Eyes Only (song)|For Your Eyes Only]]" and [[Duran Duran]]'s "[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]" have also become identified with the series. Two Bond songs have won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]: "[[Skyfall (Adele song)|Skyfall]]" by [[Adele]] and "[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]"  by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]].

=="James Bond Theme"==
{{main|James Bond Theme}}

=="James Bond Is Back"==
The briefest of "James Bond themes", this composition started off the "Opening Titles" music of ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''. It was heard in the ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' film [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]]. [[WLS (AM)]] used the theme in the mid-1960s for their secret agent radio serial "The Wild Adventures of Peter Fugitive" that appeared on "The Art Roberts Show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIWZNF0OhwoC&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=%22peter%20fugitive%22 |title=Chicago's WLS Radio – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="007 Theme"==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[007 (disambiguation)]] --&gt;
"'''007 Theme'''", not to be confused with the "[[James Bond Theme]]", is an adventure theme composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] in 1963 for the Bond film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/frwl_music.php3?t=mi6&amp;s=music |title=MI6 :: From Russia With Love (1963) :: James Bond 007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203024739/http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/frwl_music.php3?t=mi6&amp;s=music |archive-date=2010-02-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The John Barry Seven" had pop chart hit with a [[cover version]] of [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s theme to ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' that featured seven beats repeated throughout the theme. Barry used seven beats throughout the "007 Theme".

It became a secondary theme for the Bond films, being used throughout the series, primarily during action scenes. Here are its most notable appearances:
* ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' — Played during the gypsy camp gunfight and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoder from the Russian embassy in [[Istanbul]].
* ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' — Featured briefly in a climactic underwater fight and featuring on the film soundtrack album; a similar but different theme of seven beats is played when Bond runs from SPECTRE during a parade and during the climax.
* ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' — Played during the flight of "Little Nellie" before Bond battles four helicopters that attack him.
* ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' — Played during Bond's destruction of [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Blofeld's]] Headquarters.
* ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' — Played during the [[Amazon River]] chase.

The theme has not been featured in its entirety in a Bond film since its use in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.

This piece of music was also used by [[Al Primo]], the news director at [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] for its long-time theme to ''[[Eyewitness News]]'', and was adopted by other [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] stations in [[WJZ-TV|Baltimore]], [[KDKA-TV|Pittsburgh]], [[WBZ-TV|Boston]] and [[KPIX-TV|San Francisco]] as well as other non-Group W stations, including [[WLS-TV]] in [[Chicago]]. The theme was also [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] by [[Big Audio Dynamite]] for the 1986 song "[[No. 10, Upping St.|Sightsee M.C!]]"

=="Suspense" motif==
Like John Barry, David Arnold has left his own mark in the music of James Bond. In this case, he has established what can be called the "suspense motif", which is a descending, often repetitive four-note motif that can be heard in all of the Bond films he has scored. This motif can be heard in:
* ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' — "Station Break", "*-3-Send", "Underwater Discovery"
* ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' — "Pipeline", "Remember Pleasure", "Torture Queen", "Submarine"
* ''[[Die Another Day]]'' — "Death of Moon", "Iced Inc", "Antonov"
* ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' — "Miami International", "Dirty Martini", and very briefly in "African Rundown"
* ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' - briefly in "Time to Get Out", and twice in "Perla de las dunas"

==Composers (Eon Productions)==
The largest contributions to the Bond films, save for the "[[James Bond Theme]]", are works from [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. In addition to his uncredited contribution to ''Dr. No'', Barry composed eleven Bond soundtracks and is credited with the creation of "[[James Bond music#"007 Theme"|007]]" (dominated by [[Brass instrument|brass]] and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]) and the popular orchestral theme from ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.

Next to Barry, [[David Arnold]] is the series' most regular composer. He composed the scores for five Bond films: ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' through ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''. His Barry-esque orchestrations combined with electronic rhythm elements gave the [[Pierce Brosnan]] era its musical identity. Arnold was essentially Barry's anointed successor, Barry having recommended Arnold to Barbara Broccoli when she took over the Bond films from her father [[Albert R. Broccoli]].

Other major composers and record-producers include [[George Martin]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Michael Kamen]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Éric Serra]] and [[Thomas Newman]]. Each of these composed for only one Bond film, with the exception of Newman. The departures from John Barry had various causes. Sometimes Barry declined in order to avoid paying double income tax—US and UK. Sometimes the director had worked with the composer of his choice on other films—the latter happened to David Arnold with ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''.

==Music from Eon Productions==

===Title themes===
The "[[James Bond Theme]]" is the main theme for ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', and has featured in all the Eon Productions Bond films in different versions. The theme has also featured on the [[gun barrel sequence]]s at the beginning of the films. The original theme was written by [[Monty Norman]], and was performed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] and his orchestra in 1962. In the opening credits of ''Dr. No'', two other pieces were played: an untitled [[bongo drum|bongo]] interlude and a [[Calypso music|Calypso]]-flavored rendition of "[[Three Blind Mice]]", titled "Kingston Calypso". Due to this, ''Dr. No'' is the only film to have more than one opening theme. The "James Bond Theme" reached {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 13 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and remained in the charts for 13 weeks.&lt;ref name="UKCharts"&gt;Roberts, David (2006). ''[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]''. London: Guinness World Records Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening credits of ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' were accompanied by an instrumental version of the main theme, arranged by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] and written by [[Lionel Bart]]. A single by The John Barry Orchestra reached {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 39 in the U.K. At the film's end, a vocal version by English singer [[Matt Monro]] is heard. This song spent 13 weeks in the U.K. charts, peaking at {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 20.&lt;ref name="UKCharts"/&gt;

''[[Goldfinger (soundtrack)|Goldfinger]]'' was the third soundtrack composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], and this time [[Goldfinger (song)|the theme song]] had lyrics written by [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]]. The soundtrack reached {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spent 70 weeks on the charts.&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2006). The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Book of Top 40 Hits. Billboard Books&lt;/ref&gt; It also peaked at {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]],&lt;ref name="UKCharts"/&gt; and received the Bond series first [[Grammy Award]] nomination, [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Original Score from a Motion Picture or Television Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commanderbond.net/4708/bond-and-the-grammy-awards.html |title=Bond and The Grammy Awards – |publisher=Commanderbond.net |date= |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh singer [[Shirley Bassey]] has performed the most Bond themes – she recorded the themes to ''Goldfinger'', ''Diamonds Are Forever'', and ''Moonraker''. Bassey also recorded her own versions of "Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" for ''Thunderball'' and it was rumoured that "No Good About Goodbye" was intended for ''Quantum of Solace'', however David Arnold said 'No Good About Goodbye' was never intended as a Bond song.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=8079 link to MI6 article]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul McCartney]]'s performance of "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]" was the first Bond theme song to be nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]; it reached {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 2 as a U.S. single, and {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 9 on the U.K. charts.&lt;ref name="UKCharts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; George Martin's work in the song won the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)|Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burlingame, Jon|title=The Music of James Bond|page=113|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|ISBN=0199986762}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Hamlisch]]'s (music) and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]'s (lyrics) "[[Nobody Does It Better]]" (performed by [[Carly Simon]]) received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], as did  [[Bill Conti]]'s "[[For Your Eyes Only (Sheena Easton song)|For Your Eyes Only]]", which was performed by [[Sheena Easton]]. It was not until the 2013 Oscars that a Bond theme song finally won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], [[Skyfall (Adele song)|the theme song]] from ''[[Skyfall]]'' by [[Adele]]. [[Thomas Newman]]'s score also got the first nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in the series since Hamlisch's own for ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', while winning the Grammy for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Adele's song also won the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 January 2014 by AI &amp;amp; filed under SKYFALL. |url=http://www.007.com/adele-wins-grammy-for-skyfall/ |title=The Official James Bond 007 Website &amp;#124; ADELE WINS GRAMMY FOR SKYFALL |publisher=007.com |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith's]] "[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]" from ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' would also win the Oscar for Best Original Song.

[[Duran Duran]] and [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]'s "[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View To A Kill]]" topped the singles charts in the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the only Bond theme to hit {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 in the United States.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; No [[James Bond]] theme had topped the charts in the UK until Sam Smith's "Writing's on the Wall" entered the charts at number one on 2 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34425299|title=BBC Website; Sam Smith's James Bond theme makes UK chart history |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |date=2015-10-02 |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the later films have alternative theme songs, often during the [[closing credits]]. ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' featured [[The Pretenders]] performing "If There Was a Man," composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] with [[Chrissie Hynde]]. ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' has "[[If You Asked Me To]]" sung by [[Patti Labelle]]. ''[[GoldenEye]]'' featured [[Éric Serra]]'s "The Experience of Love". ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' included [[k.d. lang]]'s "Surrender" during the closing credits, a song which was originally proposed by composer [[David Arnold]] to be the title sequence theme instead of the [[Sheryl Crow]] title song. The "Surrender" theme is heard throughout the score while the melody of Sheryl Crow's song is not used again during the film. This hearkens back to the ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' soundtrack, where ''Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' was originally proposed as the opening credits music, only to be replaced by the eponymous title track as sung by [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1debbldqGc |title=Thunderball – alternate title seq. – Shirley Bassey – HD STEREO |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' featured an instrumental theme tune, something which remains unique amongst the post-''From Russia with Love'' films, and included a vocal theme in the form of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s performance of "[[We Have All the Time in the World]]", written by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] and [[Hal David]].

* A song titled "Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" sung by [[Shirley Bassey]] was originally slated to be the theme song of ''Thunderball''. It was re-recorded by [[Dionne Warwick]], but [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert Broccoli]] insisted the theme song must include the film's title and also decided that the lyrics should not start before the film's title ''Thunderball'' appears on-screen. A new song was composed and recorded at the eleventh hour titled "Thunderball", performed by Tom Jones. The melody of "Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" remains a major component of the film score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=1995 |title = The Making of Thunderball|location=Thunderball Ultimate Edition, Region 2, Disc 2 |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM/UA Home Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The songs "All Time High" (''[[Octopussy]]''), "[[You Know My Name]]" (''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''), "Another Way to Die" (''[[Quantum of Solace]]'') and "[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]" (''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'') do not feature the title of its film either in the song title or lyrics (although "Another Way to Die" features the word "solace" in the second stanza). While not named after the film, "Nobody Does It Better" does feature the line "the spy who loved me" in its lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultbritannia.co.uk/nobody-does-it-better-fifty-years-of-james-bond-music-4719/ |title=Nobody Does it Better: Fifty Years of James Bond Music |publisher=Cult Britannia |date= |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226142002/http://www.cultbritannia.co.uk/nobody-does-it-better-fifty-years-of-james-bond-music-4719/ |archivedate=2014-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary songs===
A number of Bond films include one (or more) additional songs in the soundtrack. Some of these pieces of music, such as "[[We Have All the Time in the World]]" by [[Louis Armstrong]], have gone on to become as well known as the main themes, while other songs remain exclusively linked to the film in which they appear.

* [[Dionne Warwick]]'s performance of "Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is never actually heard in ''Thunderball''; it was originally to have been the opening credits theme, but this was changed when Albert Broccoli decreed the theme had to include the film's title. The melody of "Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is heard throughout the film; Warwick's version was finally released in the 1990s.
* The original end title theme to ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' was "Only Myself to Blame", composed by David Arnold and Don Black, and sung by Scott Walker, but was left out of the final film and replaced by an Arnold arrangement of the "James Bond Theme". "Blame" was, however, left on ''The World Is Not Enough'' soundtrack album, and its melody, representing the [[Elektra King]] character, appears throughout the [[The World Is Not Enough (soundtrack)|score]], most prominently in the tracks "Casino" and "Elektra's Theme."
* Matt Monro's vocal rendition of "From Russia with Love" is often considered the official theme song for that film, even though the opening credits use an instrumental version that also incorporates the "James Bond Theme." Monro's version isn't heard until about 15 minutes into the film over a radio as source music, and again over the closing titles.

===Foreign songs===
Some songs have been dubbed for the foreign versions of the films.

* 'Goldfinger' was sung in Spanish by Karina (María Isabel Llaudes Santiago), a French version was sung by both John William and Catherine Elia and an Italian version was recorded by Vanna Scotti. It is unknown (to this editor) if either of these versions was used to replace the original in the movie.
* 'Feuerball' sung by Alan Corb was, in 1965, the German Cover version of 'thunderball' (sung by Tom Jones). It is unknown (to this editor) if the German version was used to replace the original in the German version of the movie. The B-side of the single contained a German version, also sung by Alan Corb, of Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with that title, creating the bizarre situation that a vocal 'cover' version of the song was published before the original vocal version(s) (sung by both by Shirley Bassey and Dionne Warwick), which were both published in the early 1990s with 'The Best of James Bond' 30th Anniversary and 30th Anniversary Limited Edition albums.
* 'Man Lebt Nur Zweimal' sung by Gissy André was, in 1967, the German Cover version of 'You Only Live Twice' (sung by Nancy Sinatra). It is unknown (to this editor) if the German version was used to replace the original in the German version of the movie.
* 'Tu vivras deux fois' sung by Lucky Blondo was, in 1967, the French Cover version of 'You Only Live Twice' (sung by Nancy Sinatra). It is unknown (to this editor) if the French version was used to replace the original in the French version of the movie, one source claims it was not.
* 'In Deinen Augen', sung by Sollie Nero, was, in 1981, the German Cover version of 'For Your Eyes Only' (sung by Sheena Easton). It is unknown (to this editor) if the German version was used to replace the original in the German version of the movie.

* The soundtrack to the 1967 spoof ''Casino Royale'' also included two short comedic songs sung in a 1920s style. One led into an instrumental version of "The Look of Love" and began with the line "James Bond playing at Casino Royale..."; later, this tune was reprised as "Seven James Bonds at Casino Royale" which lead into a lyrical version of the theme sung by Mike Redway that played over the closing credits.
* "The Look of Love" was the first song from any Bond film to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], six years before the first nomination from an Eon Bond film. It remains the only song from a non-Eon Bond film ever so nominated.

===Foreign songs===

* 'Les yeux de l'amour' sung by Mireille Mathieu was, in 1967, the French cover version of 'The Look of Love' (sung by Dusty Springfield). It is unknown (to this editor) if this version was used to replace the original in the movie.

===Rejected songs===

* A version of 'Never Say Never Again' was recorded by Phyllis Hyman, but was rejected in favour of Lani Hall's version.

==Unused songs==
A number of songs were written as potential Bond themes but went unused. These include:
* "Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" by [[Dionne Warwick]] / Shirley Bassey was written as the title theme for ''Thunderball''. Its title refers to a nickname given to Bond by an Italian journalist in 1962. Warwick and Bassey both recorded versions, but halfway through the scoring process, producer Albert Broccoli decided that the film's title must appear in the lyrics, so "Thunderball" was commissioned. The song's melody still plays a prominent role in the score and both singers' versions have appeared on compilations in the 1990s.
* "Thunderball" by [[Johnny Cash]], which was published on his 'official' Bootleg vol. II in 2011 ''From Memphis to Hollywood''.
* "Run James Run" by [[Brian Wilson]], intended as a Bond theme, but ultimately released as [[Pet Sounds (instrumental)|the eponymous track]] on the [[Beach Boys]]' album ''[[Pet Sounds]]''.
* "You Only Live Twice" by [[Julie Rogers (singer)|Julie Rogers]] is included on the 30th-anniversary release of ''The Best of James Bond''.
* "You Only Live Twice" by Lorraine Chandler appears on ''R(are) C(ollectable) A(nd Soulful) Volume 2''.
* "The Man with the Golden Gun" by [[Alice Cooper]] appears on his 1973 album ''[[Muscle of Love]]''
* "For Your Eyes Only" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] appears on their 1982 album ''[[The Hunter (Blondie album)|The Hunter]]''.
* "Never Say Never Again" by [[Phyllis Hyman]] was intended for ''Never Say Never Again''.
* "The Living Daylights" by [[Pet Shop Boys]] was adapted from a demo theme for ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', later reworked as "This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave". It appears on their 1990 album ''[[Behaviour (Pet Shop Boys album)|Behaviour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jude Rogers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/31/james-bond-songs |title=For your ears only &amp;#124; Music &amp;#124; '&amp;#39;The |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The Juvenile" by [[Ace of Base]] was originally written in 1995 as "The Goldeneye", then rewritten as "The Juvenile" and released in 2002 on [[Da Capo (Ace of Base album)|Da Capo]].
* "Tomorrow Never Lies" by [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], originally titled "Tomorrow Never Dies", was released as a B-side on their 1997 single "[[Help the Aged (song)|Help the Aged]]", and on the vinyl version of their 1998 album ''[[This Is Hardcore]]''.
* "Tomorrow Never Dies" by [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]] appears on their ''[[Built on Sand]]'' album. The liner notes state that [[Pierce Brosnan]] kept the master tape of the song. Other artists who submitted ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' themes include [[Marc Almond]], [[Swan Lee]], the [[The Cardigans|Cardigans]] and [[Space (indie rock band)|Space]].
* "[[Man of War (song)|Man of War]]" was written by the English band [[Radiohead]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/06/radiohead-share-video-for-previously-unreleased-song-man-of-war-watch/|title=Radiohead share video for previously unreleased song "Man of War" — watch|last=|first=|date=22 June 2017|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=29 July 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiohead submitted it for ''Spectre'', but it was rejected as it had not been written for the film.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09clppp|title=Sam Mendes, Sound and Vision - BBC Radio 6 Music|last=|first=|date=5 November 2017|website=BBC|access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover versions and spin-offs==
Bond music has inspired a number of [[cover album]]s in a variety of genres, including the 2007 album ''Mister Bond – A Jazzy Cocktail of Ice Cold Themes'' ([[lounge music|lounge]]), ''[[Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project]]'' featuring David Arnold collaborating with several contemporary artists. The [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]] recorded several albums with Bond music and performs in premieres and special events of Bond films. Britain's [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] released an album of several Bond songs performances called ''Best Of James Bond'', some of which were used on the "Ultimate Edition" DVD releases menus. Billy Strange released "Secret Agent File" in 1965. Death metal cover band [[Ten Masked Men]] has included at least one Bond theme on each of their albums. In 2004, The Cavaliers play a show titled "007" using Bond music, such as "GoldenEye", "For Your Eyes Only", "Live and Let Die", "Hovercraft Chase", "Welcome to Cuba" and "Paris and Bond". Some of them are [[Italo disco]]-like rhythms and soundtrack albums promote hits that matches the film's theme. In 2000 'An Electronika Tribute to James Bond' album was released adding yet another genre to the Bond fandom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3072">'''Kultintern''' was an international organisation set up to enable the Russian [[Proletkult]] organisation to work with an international network of contacts alongside the [[Comintern]]. Its goal was to spread "proletarian culture".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|200}} It was first proposed in an issue of ''[[Gorn]]'', publication of Proletkult, during the [[First Congress of the Communist International]], March 1919, but practical steps were only taken during the [[Second Congress of the Communist International]].&lt;ref name="AB &amp; Kultiintern"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biggart|first1=John|title=Alexander Bogdanov and the short history of the Kultintern|url=https://bogdanovlibrary.org/current-research/|website=Alexander Bogdanov Library|publisher=Historical Materialism|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisional International Bureau ==
This was set up on 12 August 1920 following the Comintern Congress. The president was [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and the General Secretary [[Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii]].&lt;ref name="AB &amp; Kultiintern"/&gt; The Bureau included several international delegates:
* [[Wilhelm Herzog]] and [[Max Barthel]] (Germany)
* [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] (USA)

* [[Nicola Bombacci]] (Italy)
* [[Haavard Langseth]] (Norway)
* [[Walther Bringolf]] and [[Jules Humbert-Droz]] (Switzerland).

== Criticism ==
[[Leo Pasvolsky]] was one of the first people to criticise the formation of Kultintern. First he portrayed the movement as generally exhibiting a heavy monotony with poetry which was both facile and pretentious. However he further claimed that the foundation of Kultintern would reduce the Proletkult movement "not primarily, but exclusively" to a weapon to promote the [[Bolshevik]] view of [[communism]].&lt;ref name="NAR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasvolsky|first1=Leo|title=Proletkult:Its Prentions and Fallacies|journal=North American Review|date=1921|volume=CCXIII|issue=April 1921|pages=539–550|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008970660;view=1up;seq=549|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Landscape mythology''' and '''anthropology of landscape''' (''Landschaftsmythologie'', ''Landschaftsethnologie'') are terms for a field of study advocated since about 1990 by Kurt Derungs (born 1962 in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]). Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to [[landscape]] combining [[archaeology]], [[ethnology]] and [[mythography|mythology]]. 

Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "[[totemism]], [[shamanism]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither [[esotericism]] nor as [[positivism]] but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a [[matriarchal]] structure of society and a cult of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]] in [[Neolithic Europe]], and he associates [[megalithic]] monuments and elements of traditional [[fairy tale]]s with these ideas.

Since 1994, Derungs manages the ''edition amalia'' publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in [[Neopaganism in Germany|German Neopagan]] circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Derungs (1996) is mentioned favourably as forwarding a feminist critique of [[C. G. Jung]]'s depiction of femininity in Kocku von Stuckrad, ''Constructing Femininity—the Lilith Case'', LAUD paper Universität Essen, Linguistic Agency: Series A; 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10619">The '''Mojo Triangle''', a geographical and cultural area located within a triangular connection between [[New Orleans]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], is the birthplace of [[Country music|country]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[rock 'n' roll]].  The Mojo Triangle has presented the world with an astonishing array of creative artists, not just in [[music]], but also in [[literature]] and films.

==Origins of the Mojo Triangle==
[[File:Natchez Trace swamp.jpg|thumb|alt=A swamp on the Natchez Trace.|Blues, rock 'n' roll, jazz and country—all potent brews of the swamp. This alligator-bearing cypress swamp bumps against the Natchez Trace just outside Jackson, Mississippi, in the heart of Mojoland.]]
The phrase "Mojo Triangle" was first coined by author James L. Dickerson in his award-winning 2005 book, Mojo Triangle: Birthplace of Country, Blues, Jazz and Rock 'n' Roll.&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Mojo Triangle," Schirmer Trade Books&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A [[fiddle]] tune named "Natchez Under the Hill," which originated in the joints along the docks in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], was one of the first original songs ever published in America, according to Dickerson. Published in 1834, it was re-titled "Old Zip Coon," only to later morph into "[[Turkey in the Straw]]."  With that song began a tradition that inspired the creation of a musical dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Mojo Triangle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Natchez  remained a musical cauldron throughout the 1800s, blending traditional folk music from Europe with the exotic rhythms and harmonies of the Choctaw and Chickasaw, and the unique phrasing vocalized by  slaves from Africa. But it was not until the late 1920s, when Jimmie Rodgers began recording what would later be recognized as America's first country music that the first blend of European/Native American/African music took hold.

Ten years later, Robert Johnson took the music recorded by Rodgers and moved it a step further by recording what we today call blues music. Both Rodgers and Johnson owe an enormous debt to the Choctaw. "Both use 6/4, 5/4, and 4/4 time signatures, and both use short 6/4 introductions that quickly change to 5/4 or 4/4 after one or two bars. For example Johnson's 'Little Queen of Spades' has a one bar introduction in 6/4 that changes to 4/4, an identical time signature to the Choctaw's 'Wedding Dance,' which also goes 6/4 to 4/4."&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Mojo Triangle: Birthplace of Country, Blues, Jazz and Rock 'n' Roll," p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicians in New Orleans incorporated the music of Natchez and added Caribbean influences to produce jazz, a free-flowing instrumental interpretation of the same influences that birthed blues and country.
In the mid-1950s, Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black took the work of Rodgers and Johnson and gave shape to rock 'n' roll, creating an unbroken circle of creativity that continues to this day.

==Writers who have explored the Mojo Triangle==

James L. Dickerson, a native of the [[Mississippi Delta]],&lt;ref&gt;"Who's Who in the South and Southwest" (1995-1996) 24th edition, Reed Reference Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  is the author of twenty-nine books. He has worked as a magazine editor and publisher, newspaper editor, reporter, columnist, book critic, and social worker. His book, Mojo Triangle, was the winner of a 2006 IPPY award (Independent Publisher Book Awards) in the non-fiction category. Two other books, Goin' Back to Memphis and That's Alright, Elvis, were finalists for the Gleason Award, given out annually by [[Rolling Stone]] magazine, [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], and [[New York University]]. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Dickerson was the publisher/editor of [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine]], the first magazine located in the Mojo Triangle to obtain newsstand circulation in all 50 states.  He co-owned and produced a radio syndication, Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland, which focused on the music produced in the Mojo Triangle.&lt;ref&gt;	Dickerson, James L. "Goin' Back to Memphis: A Century of Blues, Rock 'n' Roll, and Glorious Soul" (Schirmer/Simon &amp; Schuster/1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other music historians who have written about musicians from the Mojo Triangle are [[Stanley Booth]] (The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones, Rhythm Oil, and Furry's Blues); [[Peter Guralnick]] (Sweet Soul Music) and [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] ([[Deep Blues: A Musical Pilgrimage to the Crossroads|Deep Blues]]). None of those writers were born in the Triangle, but all wrote extensively on the blues. Palmer, who died in 1997, was a music writer for the [[New York Times]] and spent the last years of his life living in the Mojo Triangle. Booth, who lives in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], has contributed to Rolling Stone, [[Playboy]], and [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]. Guralnick is probably best known for his two-volume biography of [[Elvis Presley]].

A '''mosaic''' is a piece of [[art]] or image made from the assembling of small pieces of colored [[glass]], stone, or other materials. It is often used in [[Decorative arts|decorative art]] or as [[interior decoration]]. Most mosaics are made of small, flat, roughly [[square]], pieces of stone or glass of different colors, known as ''[[tesserae]]''. Some, especially floor mosaics, are made of small rounded pieces of stone, and called "pebble mosaics".

Mosaics have a long history, starting in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in [[Tiryns]] in [[Mycenean civilisation|Mycenean]] Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Early Christian [[basilica]]s from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in the 12th century, by the eastern-influenced [[Republic of Venice]], and among the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the [[Renaissance]], though artists like [[Raphael]] continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jewish artists to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the [[Middle East]] with floor mosaics.

Mosaic was widely used on religious buildings and palaces in early [[Islamic art]], including Islam's first great religious building, the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], and the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]]. Mosaic went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century.

Modern mosaics are made by professional artists, street artists, and as a popular craft. Many materials other than traditional stone and ceramic tesserae may be employed, including shells, glass and beads.

The earliest known examples of mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Abra, [[Mesopotamia]], and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BC. They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory. Excavations at [[Susa]] and [[Chogha Zanbil]] show evidence of the first glazed tiles, dating from around 1500 BC.&lt;ref name="HistoryOfIranianTile"&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/art/articles/tile_history1.php Iran: Visual Arts: history of Iranian Tile], Iran Chamber Society&lt;/ref&gt; However, mosaic patterns were not used until the times of [[Sassanid Empire]] and Roman influence.

Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Capizzi |first=Padre |title=Piazza Armerina: The Mosaics and Morgantina |year=1989 |publisher=International Specialized Book Service Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings, a far more prestigious artform, and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of [[Hellenistic]] [[villa]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] dwellings from Britain to [[Dura-Europos]]. Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek, suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves.  Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across [[North Africa]], in places such as [[Carthage]], and can still be seen in the extensive collection in [[Bardo Museum]] in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].

There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic: ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' used tiny ''[[tesserae]]'', typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. The tiny ''tesserae'' allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting.  Often small panels called ''emblemata'' were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work.  The normal technique was ''[[opus tessellatum]]'', using larger tesserae, which was laid on site.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=116–119}}  There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=121–123}}

In Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', built 64 AD, and wall mosaics are also found at [[Pompeii]] and neighbouring sites.  However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression. The Roman church of [[Santa Costanza]], which served as a [[mausoleum]] for one or more of the Imperial family, has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault, which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration.

The mosaics of the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]] are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics ''in situ'' in the world, and are protected as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The large ''villa rustica'', which was probably owned by Emperor [[Maximian]], was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the ''Circus Scene'', the 64m long ''Great Hunting Scene'', the ''Little Hunt'', the ''Labours of Hercules'' and the famous ''Bikini Girls'', showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century [[bikinis]]. The [[peristyle]], the imperial apartments and the [[thermae]] were also decorated with ornamental and [[mythological]] mosaics.&lt;ref name="UNESCO casale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/832 |title=Villa Romana del Casale |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in [[Palermo]] where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted are an [[Orpheus mosaic]], ''Alexander the Great's Hunt'' and the ''Four Seasons''.

In 1913 the [[Zliten mosaic]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests, hunting and everyday life, was discovered in the [[Libyan]] town of [[Zliten]].  In 2000 archaeologists working in [[Leptis Magna]], [[Libya]], uncovered a 30&amp;nbsp;ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD. The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue, staring at his slain opponent. The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a "masterpiece comparable in quality with the [[Alexander Mosaic]] in [[Pompeii]]."

A specific genre of Roman mosaic was called ''asaroton'' (Greek for "unswept floor"). It depicted in [[trompe l'oeil]] style the feast leftovers on the floors of wealthy houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/pdf/uploads/hesperia/147437.pdf | title=A mosaic floor from a Roman villa at Anaploga | accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian mosaics===

====Early Christian art====
{{Main article|Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy}}
[[File:Mosaico di cristo in trono tra gli apostoli e le ss. prudenziana e prassede, 410 dc ca. 06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Detail of a [[Paleochristian]] mosaic from the basilica of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome, c. 410 AD, depicting Saint [[Pudentiana]]]]
With the building of Christian [[basilica]]s in the late 4th century, wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses. The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of [[Santa Constanza]] and [[Santa Pudenziana]], both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the [[ambulatory]] of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of [[Bacchus]], which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building. In another great Constantinian basilica, the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called [[Tomb of the Julii]], near the crypt beneath [[St Peter's Basilica]], is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]], converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.

In the following century [[Ravenna]], the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). [[Milan]] also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the [[St Aquilinus]] Chapel of the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan|Basilica of San Lorenzo]], mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of [[Elijah]]; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]], which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.

[[Albenga|Albingaunum]] was the main Roman port of [[Liguria]]. The octagonal baptistery of the town was decorated in the 5th century with high quality blue and white mosaics representing the Apostles. The surviving remains are somewhat fragmented. [[Massilia]] remained a thriving port and a Christian spiritual center in Southern Gaul where favourable societal and economic conditions ensured the survival of mosaic art in the 5th and 6th centuries. The large baptistery, once the grandest building of its kind in Western Europe, had a geometric floor mosaic which is only known from 19th century descriptions. Other parts of the episcopal complex were also decorated with mosaics as new finds, that were unearthed in the 2000s, attest. The funerary [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|basilica of Saint Victor]], built in a quarry outside the walls, was decorated with mosaics but only a small fragment with blue and green scrolls survived on the intrados of an arch (the basilica was later buried under a medieval abbey).

A mosaic pavement depicting humans, animals and plants from the original 4th-century cathedral of [[Aquileia]] has survived in the later medieval church. This mosaic adopts pagan motifs such as the Nilotic scene, but behind the traditional naturalistic content is Christian symbolism such as the [[ichthys]]. The 6th-century early Christian basilicas of Sant' Eufemia [[:it:Basilica di Sant'Eufemia (Grado)]]  and Santa Maria delle Grazie in [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] also have mosaic floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Efthalia|last=Rentetzi |title=stylistic relationships between the mosaic flooring of s.

====Ravenna====
[[File:"The good Shepherd" mosaic - Mausoleum of Galla Placidia.jpg|thumb|[[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|The Good Shepherd]] mosaic in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]], [[Ravenna]]]]
[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Justinianus I]] in [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]]]]
In the 5th-century [[Ravenna]], the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], became the center of late Roman mosaic art. The [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430. The vaults of the small, cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background. The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky. Another great building established by [[Galla Placidia]] was the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna. The mosaics depicted the storm, portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna, [[Peter Chrysologus]]. They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ravenna|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12662b.htm|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ostrogoths]] kept alive the tradition in the 6th century, as the mosaics of the [[Arian Baptistry]], [[Baptistry of Neon]], [[Archbishop's Chapel, Ravenna|Archbishop's Chapel]], and the earlier phase mosaics in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] testify.

After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) and became the seat of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century. Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint [[Justinian I]] and [[Theodora (6th century)|Empress Theodora]] in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest. The mosaics of the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] were made around 549. The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of [[San Michele in Affricisco]], executed in 545–547 (largely destroyed; the remains in [[Berlin]]).

The last example of Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna was commissioned by bishop Reparatus between 673–79 in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe. The mosaic panel in the apse showing the bishop with Emperor [[Constantine IV]] is obviously an imitation of the Justinian panel in San Vitale.

====Butrint====
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of [[Butrint]], [[Albania]] appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation, dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century. The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures, birds, terrestrial beasts, fruits, flowers, trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation. Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets, tabulae ansatae, carrying inscriptions. A variety of fish, a crab, a lobster, shrimps, mushrooms, flowers, a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions, which reads: In fulfilment of the vow (prayer) of those whose names God knows. This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience.

The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation; some elements also have specific connotations. The [[kantharos]] vase and vine refer to the [[eucharist]], the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation. Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life. Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ: "As a heart desireth the water brook, so my souls longs for thee, O God." Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened.

====Late Antique and Early Medieval Rome====

[[File:RomaSantaMariaMaggioreArcoTrionfaleDxRegistro4.jpg|thumb|5th century mosaic in the triumphal arch of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome]]

Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome, gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period. Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings. In the apse mosaic of [[Sant'Agata dei Goti]] (462–472, destroyed in 1589) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him, six on either side. At [[Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara]] (468–483, destroyed in 1686) Christ appeared in the center, flanked on either side by three Apostles. Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ. The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the [[Santa Sabina]] was replaced by a very similar fresco by [[Taddeo Zuccari]] in 1559. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ flanked by male and female saints, seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet. All three mosaics had a similar iconography.

6th-century pieces are rare in Rome but the mosaics inside the triumphal arch of the basilica of [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] belong to this era. The ''Chapel of Ss. Primo e Feliciano'' in [[Santo Stefano Rotondo]] has very interesting and rare mosaics from the 7th century. This chapel was built by [[Pope Theodore I]] as a family burial place.

In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of [[Santa Prassede]], [[Santa Maria in Domnica]], [[Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura]], [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santi Nereo e Achilleo]] and the San Venanzio chapel of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]]. The great dining hall of [[Pope Leo III]] in the [[Lateran Palace]] was also decorated with mosaics. They were all destroyed later except for one example, the so-called [[Triclinio Leoniano]] of which a copy was made in the 18th century. Another great work of Pope Leo, the apse mosaic of [[Santa Susanna]], depicted Christ with the Pope and [[Charlemagne]] on one side, and SS. Susanna and Felicity on the other. It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585. Pope [[Paschal I]] (817–824) embellished the church of [[Santo Stefano del Cacco]] with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church (destroyed in 1607).

The fragment of an 8th-century mosaic, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] is one of the very rare remaining pieces of the medieval decoration of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], demolished in the late 16th century. The precious fragment is kept in the sacristy of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]. It proves the high artistic quality of the destroyed St. Peter's mosaics.

====Byzantine mosaics====

Mosaics were more central to Byzantine culture than to that of Western Europe. Byzantine church interiors were generally covered with golden mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries. The majority of Byzantine mosaics were destroyed without trace during wars and conquests, but the surviving remains still form a fine collection.{{sfn|Lowden|1997|pp=whole book}}

The great buildings of [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] like the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|Nea Church]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the rebuilt [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] were certainly embellished with mosaics but none of these survived.

Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] which was commissioned during [[Justinian]]'s reign. The figures, animals, plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background. The portrait of a moustached man, probably a Gothic chieftain, is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age. The so-called ''small sekreton'' of the palace was built during [[Justin II]]'s reign around 565–577. Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room. The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition. There are remains of floral decoration in the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos]] in [[Thessaloniki]] (5th–6th centuries).

[[File:St George as patron of two children. Mosaic, church of St Demetrios in Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A pre-[[Iconoclastic]] depiction of St. Demetrios at the Hagios Demetrios Basilica in Thessaloniki.]]
In the 6th century, [[Ravenna]], the capital of Byzantine Italy, became the center of mosaic making. [[Istria]] also boasts some important examples from this era. The [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Poreč|Parentium]] was built in the middle of the 6th century and decorated with mosaics depicting the [[Theotokos]] flanked by angels and saints.

Fragments remain from the mosaics of the [[Church of Santa Maria Formosa]] in [[Pula|Pola]]. These pieces were made during the 6th century by artists from Constantinople. Their pure Byzantine style is different from the contemporary Ravennate mosaics.

Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic]] destruction of the 8th century. Among the rare examples are the 6th-century ''Christ in majesty'' (or ''Ezekiel's Vision'') mosaic in the apse of the [[Church of Hosios David]] in [[Thessaloniki]] that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times. Nine mosaic panels in the [[Hagios Demetrios|Hagios Demetrios Church]], which were made between 634 and 730, also escaped destruction. Unusually almost all represent [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]], often with suppliants before him.

In the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic era]], figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry. The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the [[Hagia Irene]] in Constantinople (after 740). There were similar crosses in the apses of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki and in the [[Church of the Dormition, Nicaea|Church of the Dormition]] in [[Iznik|Nicaea]]. The crosses were substituted with the image of the [[Theotokos]] in both churches after the victory of the [[Iconodules]] (787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively,  the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922).

A similar Theotokos image flanked by two archangels were made for the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople in 867. The dedication inscription says: "The images which the impostors had cast down here pious emperors have again set up." In the 870s the so-called ''large sekreton'' of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] was decorated with the images of the four great iconodule patriarchs.

The post-Iconoclastic era was the heyday of Byzantine art with the most beautiful mosaics executed. The mosaics of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]] (867–1056) carefully mingled traditionalism with innovation. Constantinopolitan mosaics of this age followed the decoration scheme first used in Emperor [[Basil I]]'s [[Nea Ekklesia]]. Not only this prototype was later totally destroyed but each surviving composition is battered so it is necessary to move from church to church to reconstruct the system.

An interesting set of Macedonian-era mosaics make up the decoration of the [[Hosios Loukas]] Monastery. In the narthex there is the Crucifixion, the Pantokrator and the Anastasis above the doors, while in the church the Theotokos (apse), Pentecost, scenes from Christ's life and ermit St Loukas (all executed before 1048). The scenes are treated with a minimum of detail and the panels are dominated with the gold setting.
[[File:Meister der Nea-Moni-Kirche in Chios 002.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Detail of mosaic from [[Nea Moni]] Monastery]]
The [[Nea Moni]] Monastery on [[Chios]] was established by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] in 1043–1056. The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived (Theotokos with raised hands, four evangelists with seraphim, scenes from Christ's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos). In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures, detail, landscape and setting.

Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] between 1042 and 1048. Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel, who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description: "Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling, over the tribune. The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ. In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exaltation of Adam. In the apse the Ascension of Christ. The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.com/www1/jhs/TSspdest.html The Holy Sepulchre – The great destruction of 1009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Daphni Monastery]] houses the best preserved complex of mosaics from the early Comnenan period (ca. 1100) when the austere and hieratic manner typical for the [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian epoch]] and represented by the awesome [[Christ Pantocrator]] image inside the dome, was metamorphosing into a more intimate and delicate style, of which ''The Angel before St Joachim'' — with its pastoral backdrop, harmonious gestures and pensive lyricism — is considered a superb example.

The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks. The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets, saints and patriarchs. Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an ''Emperor kneeling before Christ'' (late 9th or early 10th century). Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the ''Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine''. [[Justinian I]] is offering the model of the church to Mary while [[Constantine I|Constantine]] is holding a model of the city in his hand. Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded. A mosaic panel on the gallery shows ''Christ with [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] and [[Zoe (empress)|Empress Zoe]]'' (1042–1055). The emperor gives a bulging [[money sack]] to Christ as a donation for the church.

The dome of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki is decorated with an ''Ascension'' mosaic (c. 885). The composition resembles the great baptistries in [[Ravenna]], with apostles standing between palms and Christ in the middle. The scheme is somewhat unusual as the standard post-Iconoclastic formula for domes contained only the image of the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]].

[[File:Christ Pantocrator mosaic from Hagia Sophia 2240 x 3109 pixels 2.5 MB.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]] from the ''Deesis'' mosaic.]]
[[File:Santa Sofia - Mosaic de Joan II Comnè i la seva esposa, Irene.JPG|thumb|A mosaic from the [[Hagia Sophia]] of [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul), depicting [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Jesus]], flanked by [[John II Komnenos]] (left) and his wife [[Irene of Hungary]] (right), c. 1118 AD]]
There are very few existing mosaics from the [[Komnenos|Komnenian period]] but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression. The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in [[Constantinople]] is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor [[John II Komnenos|John II]] and Empress [[Piroska of Hungary|Eirene]] with the [[Theotokos]] (1122–34). The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing. It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name, ''Piroska'' shows. The adjacent portrait of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] on a pier (from 1122) is similarly personal. The imperial mausoleum of the [[Komnenos]] dynasty, the [[Zeyrek Camii|Pantokrator Monastery]] was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed. The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent. There is only a "Communion of the Apostles" in the apse of the cathedral of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]].

A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious, miniature mosaic icons. In these icons the small tesserae (with sides of 1&amp;nbsp;mm or less) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel. These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion. The [[Louvre Transfiguration]] is a very fine example from the late 12th century. The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at [[Florence]] illustrates the more gentle, humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century.

The sack of Constantinople in 1204 caused the decline of mosaic art for the next five decades. After the reconquest of the city by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261 the Hagia Sophia was restored and a beautiful new ''[[Deesis]]'' was made on the south gallery. This huge mosaic panel with figures two and a half times lifesize is really overwhelming due to its grand scale and superlative craftsmanship. The Hagia Sophia ''Deesis'' is probably the most famous Byzantine mosaic in Constantinople.

The [[Pammakaristos Church|Pammakaristos Monastery]] was restored by [[Michael Doukas Glabas Tarchaneiotes|Michael Glabas]], an imperial official, in the late 13th century. Only the mosaic decoration of the small burial chapel ([[parekklesion]]) of Glabas survived. This domed chapel was built by his widow, Martha around 1304–08. In the miniature dome the traditional Pantokrator can be seen with twelve prophets beneath. Unusually the apse is decorated with a ''[[Deesis]]'', probably due to the funerary function of the chapel.

The [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki)|Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Thessaloniki]] was built in 1310–14. Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern. Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings. Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the [[Theotokos Paregoritissa Church]] in [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. The church was established by the Despot of [[Epirus]] in 1294–96. In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator, with prophets and cherubim below.

[[File:Chora Church interior March 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Mosaic of Theodore Metochites offering the Chora Church to Christ]]
The greatest mosaic work of the [[Palaeologan renaissance in art]] is the decoration of the [[Chora Church]] in Constantinople. Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia. They were executed around 1320 by the command of [[Theodore Metochites]]. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge [[turban]], offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. These panels show the influence of the Italian [[trecento]] on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings, landscapes, figures.

The last Byzantine mosaic work was created for the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople in the middle of the 14th century. The great eastern arch of the cathedral collapsed in 1346, bringing down the third of the main dome. By 1355 not only the big Pantokrator image was restored but new mosaics were set on the eastern arch depicting the Theotokos, the Baptist and Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] (discovered only in 1989).

In addition to the large-scale monuments several miniature mosaic icons of outstanding quality was produced for the Palaiologos court and nobles. The loveliest examples from the 14th century are ''Annunciation'' in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and a mosaic diptych in the Cathedral Treasury of [[Florence]] representing the ''Twelve Feasts of the Church''.

In the troubled years of the 15th century the fatally weakened empire could not afford luxurious mosaics. Churches were decorated with wall-paintings in this era and after the [[Fall of Constantinople|Turkish conquest]].

====Rome in the High Middle Ages====
[[File:Apse mosaic SM Maggiore.jpg|thumb|Apse mosaic in the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when [[Rome]] developed its own distinctive artistic style, free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space. Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], the façade of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and [[San Paolo fuori le Mura]]. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1140) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne, the first example of this iconographic scheme. A similar mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], decorates the apse of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. It is a work of [[Jacopo Torriti]] from 1295. The mosaics of Torriti and [[Jacopo da Camerino]] in the apse of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]] from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884. The apse mosaic of [[San Crisogono]] is attributed to [[Pietro Cavallini]], the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts at perspective. There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of [[San Tommaso in Formis]] showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave. The church belonged to the Order of the [[Trinitarians]] which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves.

The great [[Navicella (mosaic)|''Navicella'' mosaic]] (1305–1313) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter's is attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone]]. The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal [[Jacopo Stefaneschi]], was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in the 17th century. Navicella means "little ship" referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art.

====Sicily====
[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arabic]] arches and Byzantine mosaics in the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily]]]]

The heyday of mosaic making in [[Sicily]] was the age of the independent [[Normans|Norman]] kingdom in the 12th century. The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule. Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style, that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies. Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]],&lt;ref&gt;''Some Palatine Aspects of the Cappella Palatina in Palermo'', Slobodan Ćurčić, '''Dumbarton Oaks Papers''', Vol. 41, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Martorana]] church in [[Palermo]] and the cathedrals of [[cathedral of Cefalù|Cefalù]] and [[Monreale]].

The Cappella Palatina clearly shows evidence for blending the eastern and western styles. The dome (1142–42) and the eastern end of the church (1143–1154) were decorated with typical Byzantine mosaics i.e. Pantokrator, angels, scenes from the life of Christ. Even the inscriptions are written in Greek. The narrative scenes of the nave (Old Testament, life of Sts Peter and Paul) are resembling to the mosaics of the Old St. Peter's and St. Paul's Basilica in [[Rome]] (Latin inscriptions, 1154–66).

The Martorana church (decorated around 1143) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished. The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina, with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed, elongated angels. The Greek inscriptions, decorative patterns, and evangelists in the [[squinches]] are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina. The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily, dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ, was originally in the demolished [[narthex]] together with another panel, the [[Theotokos]] with Georgios of Antiochia, the founder of the church.

In [[Cefalù]] (1148) only the high, French Gothic presbytery was covered with mosaics: the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] on the semidome of the apse and [[cherubim]] on the vault. On the walls are Latin and Greek saints, with Greek inscriptions.

[[File:Dedication mosaic - Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015 (crop).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Monreale]] mosaics: William II offering the [[Monreale Cathedral]] to the [[Virgin Mary]]]]
The [[Monreale]] mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy, covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae. This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King [[William II of Sicily]]. The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina. The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor. Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos.

The [[Cathedral of Palermo]], rebuilt by Archbishop Walter in the same time (1172–85), was also decorated with mosaics but none of these survived except the 12th-century image of ''Madonna del Tocco'' above the western portal.

The cathedral of [[Messina]], consecrated in 1197, was also decorated with a great mosaic cycle, originally on par with Cefalù and Monreale, but heavily damaged and restored many times later. In the left apse of the same cathedral 14th-century mosaics survived, representing the Madonna and Child between Saints Agata and Lucy, the Archangels Gabriel and Michael and Queens Eleonora and Elisabetta.

Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the [[Otranto Cathedral]] from 1166, with mosaics tied into a tree of life, mostly still preserved. The scenes depict biblical characters, warrior kings, medieval beasts, allegories of the months and working activity. Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of [[Amalfi]]'s Norman Cathedral. The mosaic ambos in the churches of [[Ravello]] prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries.

The palaces of the Norman kings were decorated with mosaics depicting animals and landscapes. The secular mosaics are seemingly more Eastern in character than the great religious cycles and show a strong Persian influence. The most notable examples are the ''Sala di Ruggero'' in the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], [[Palermo]] and the ''Sala della Fontana'' in the [[Zisa, Palermo|Zisa]] summer palace, both from the 12th century.

====Venice====

In parts of [[Italy]], which were under eastern artistic influences, like [[Sicily]] and [[Venice]], mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages. The whole interior of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice is clad with elaborate, golden mosaics. The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries. The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century. One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark's were based directly on the miniatures of the [[Cotton Genesis]], a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople (1204). The mosaics were executed in the 1220s.

Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the [[Torcello Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta]] in [[Torcello]] from the 12th century, and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in [[Murano]] with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement (1140). The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary, St John and the two patron saints, Cipriano and Cipriana. When the church was demolished in the 19th century, the mosaic was bought by [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]]. It was reassembled in the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche]] of [[Potsdam]] in the 1840s.

[[Trieste]] was also an important center of mosaic art. The mosaics in the apse of the [[Cathedral of San Giusto, Trieste|Cathedral of San Giusto]] were laid by master craftsmen from [[Veneto]] in the 12th–13th centuries.

====Medieval Italy====
The monastery of [[Grottaferrata]] founded by Greek [[Basilian monks]] and consecrated by the Pope in 1024 was decorated with Italo-Byzantine mosaics, some of which survived in the narthex and the interior. The mosaics on the triumphal arch portray the Twelve Apostles sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ's ascent to Heaven. It is a Byzantine work of the 12th century. There is a beautiful 11th-century Deesis above the main portal.

The Abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], [[Pope Victor III|Desiderius]] sent envoys to [[Constantinople]] some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler [[Leo of Ostia]] the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). "The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts" – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.

[[File:Florenca133b.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Baptistry]]]]
In [[Florence]] a magnificiant mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] decorates the dome of the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery]]. The earliest mosaics, works of art of many unknown Venetian craftsmen (including probably [[Cimabue]]), date from 1225. The covering of the ceiling was probably not completed until the 14th century.

The impressive mosaic of Christ in Majesty, flanked by the Blessed Virgin and St. John the Evangelist in the apse of the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|cathedral of Pisa]] was designed by [[Cimabue]] in 1302. It evokes the Monreale mosaics in style. It survived the great fire of 1595 which destroyed most of the mediveval interior decoration.

Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice (mainly from the 17th–19th centuries, but the oldest one from 1270–75, "The burial of St Mark in the first basilica"), the [[Duomo di Orvieto|Cathedral of Orvieto]] (golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century, many times redone) and the [[Basilica di San Frediano]] in [[Lucca]] (huge, striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below, designed by [[Berlinghiero Berlinghieri]] in the 13th century). The [[Cathedral of Spoleto]] is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the ''Blessing Christ'' (signed by one Solsternus from 1207).

====Western and Central Europe====
[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.arp.jpg|thumb|left|A “painting” made from tesserae in [[St Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican State]], Italy]]

Beyond the [[Alps]] the first important example of mosaic art was the decoration of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], commissioned by [[Charlemagne]]. It was completely destroyed in a fire in 1650. A rare example of surviving Carolingian mosaics is the [[apse]] [[semi-dome]] decoration of the oratory of [[Germigny-des-Prés]] built in 805–806 by [[Theodulf]], [[bishop of Orléans]], a leading figure of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This unique work of art, rediscovered only in the 19th century, had no followers.

Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages. The Abbey of Saint-Martial in [[Limoges]], originally an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the [[French Revolution]] except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the [[Basilica of Saint-Quentin]] in [[Picardy]], where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors. The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at [[Lyon]] have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at [[Poitiers]] which might be from the 6th or 9th century.

Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe, although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals. The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in [[Székesfehérvár]] (Alba Regia) had a mosaic decoration in the apse. It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen, executed in the first decades of the 11th century. The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century. The Golden Gate of the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]] got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] above the portal. It was executed by Venetian craftsmen.

[[File:Germigny Jplm.jpg|thumb|right|Carolingian mosaic in [[Germigny-des-Prés]]]]
The [[Crusaders]] in the [[Holy Land]] also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence. During their 12th-century reconstruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones. Almost nothing of them survived except the "Ascension of Christ" in the Latin Chapel (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics). More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]]. The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor, the [[king of Jerusalem]] and the Latin Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Art and Colonialism: The mosaics of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (1169) and the problem of the ''crusader'' art |author=Lucy-Anne Hunt |date= |work= |publisher=  |jstor=1291693 |pages=69–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the [[Frumuşeni Mosaics|Bizere Monastery]] near the River [[Mureș River|Mureş]] in present-day [[Romania]]. The panels depict real or fantastic animal, floral, solar and geometric representations. Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church, built some time between the 10th and 11th century. Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence. The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

====Renaissance and Baroque====
Although mosaics went out of fashion and were substituted by frescoes, some of the great Renaissance artists also worked with the old technique. [[Raphael]]'s [[Creation of the World (Raphael)|Creation of the World]] in the dome of the [[Chigi Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] is a notable example that was executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi di Pace.

During the papacy of [[Clement VIII]] (1592–1605), the “Congregazione della Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro" was established, providing an independent organisation charged with completing the decorations in the newly built [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Instead of frescoes the cavernous Basilica was mainly decorated with mosaics. Among the explanations are:
# The old St. Peter's Basilica had been decorated with mosaic, as was common in churches built during the early Christian era; the 17th century followed the tradition to enhance continuity.
# In a church like this with high walls and few windows, mosaics were brighter and reflected more light.
# Mosaics had greater intrinsic longevity than either frescoes or canvases.
# Mosaics had an association with bejeweled decoration, flaunting richness.

The mosaics of St. Peter's often show lively [[Baroque]] compositions based on designs or canvases from like [[Ciro Ferri]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Carlo Maratta]], and many others. [[Raphael]] is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting, the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]. Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter's, including [[Giovanni Battista Calandra]], [[Fabio Cristofari]] (died 1689), and [[Pietro Paolo Cristofari]] (died 1743).&lt;ref&gt;DiFederico, F. R. (1983), ''The mosaics of Saint Peter's Decorating the New Basilica'', University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts.

====The Christian East====
{{Main article|Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East}}

[[File:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|[[Jerusalem]] on the [[Madaba Map]]]]
The eastern provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] and later the [[Byzantine Empire]]s inherited a strong artistic tradition from the [[Late Antiquity]]. Similarly to [[Italy]] and [[Constantinople]] churches and important secular buildings in the [[region of Syria]] and [[Egypt]] were decorated with elaborate mosaic panels between the 5th and 8th centuries. The great majority of these works of art were later destroyed but archeological excavations unearthed many surviving examples.

The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the [[Madaba Map]], made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at [[Madaba]], [[Jordan]]. It was rediscovered in 1894. The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the [[Holy Land]]. It depicts an area from [[Lebanon]] in the north to the [[Nile Delta]] in the south, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to the [[Arabian Desert|Eastern Desert]]. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is [[Jerusalem]], at the center of the map. The map is enriched with many naturalistic features, like animals, fishing boats, bridges and palm trees

One of the earliest examples of [[Dionysus mosaic, Samatya|Byzantine mosaic art]] in the region can be found on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], an important place of pilgrimage in the Byzantine era where [[Moses]] died. Among the many 6th-century mosaics in the church complex (discovered after 1933) the most interesting one is located in the baptistery. The intact floor mosaic covers an area of 9 x 3 m and was laid down in 530. It depicts hunting and pastoral scenes with rich Middle Eastern flora and fauna.
[[File:Nebo05(js).jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic floor from the church on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]] (baptistery, 530)]]
The Church of Sts. Lot and Procopius was founded in 567 in Nebo village under Mount Nebo (now [[Khirbet Mukhayyat]]). Its floor mosaic depicts everyday activities like grape harvest. Another two spectacular mosaics were discovered in the ruined Church of Preacher John nearby. One of the mosaics was placed above the other one which was completely covered and unknown until the modern restoration. The figures on the older mosaic have thus escaped the iconoclasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm|title=Khirbet al Mukhayat|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512160152/http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm|archivedate=12 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Madaba]] remained an important center of mosaic making during the 5th–8th centuries. In the Church of the Apostles the middle of the main panel Thalassa, goddess of the sea, can be seen surrounded by fishes and other sea creatures. Native Middle Eastern birds, mammals, plants and fruits were also added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanjubilee.com/history/mosaics.htm The mosaics of Jordan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103213852/http://www.jordanjubilee.com/history/mosaics.htm |date=3 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Catherine's Transfiguration.jpg|thumb|The Transfiguration of Jesus in the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]]]
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine's Monastery is exceptional. On the upper wall [[Moses]] is shown in two panels on a landscape background. In the apse we can see the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] on a golden background. The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets, and two contemporary figure, "Abbot Longinos" and "John the Deacon". The mosaic was probably created in 565/6.

[[Jerusalem]] with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called "Armenian Mosaic" which was discovered in 1894 on the [[Street of the Prophets]] near [[Damascus Gate]]. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: "For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows." Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a [[mortuary]] chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-armenian-mosaic.htm |title=Armenian Mosaic, Jerusalem |year=2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in [[al-Eizariya|Bethany]], the early Byzantine church of the [[Tomb of Lazarus (al-Eizariya)|Lazarium]] which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET04byz.html Bethany in Byzantine times I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor.

[[File:Masada Byzantine Church floor mosaic by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from the mosaic floor of the Byzantine church of in [[Masada]]. The monastic community lived here in the 5th–7th centuries.]]
The [[monastic]] communities of the [[Judean Desert]] also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors. The [[Monastery of Martyrius]] was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85. The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/The%20Monastery%20of%20Martyrius The Monastery of Martyrius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaics in the church of the nearby [[Monastery of Euthymius]] are of later date (discovered in 1930). They were laid down in the Umayyad era, after a devastating earthquake in 659. Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features.

[[File:Petra-Mosaic-2-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail from the mosaic floor of the [[Petra|Petra Church]]]]
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian [[Petra]] where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mosaicartsource.wordpress.com/2007/01/21/petra-church-mosaic-floors-petra-jordan/ Petra Church – Mosaic Floors – Petra, Jordan « Mosaic Art Source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab conquest of the [[Middle East]] in the 7th century did not break off the art of mosaic making. Arabs learned and accepted the craft as their own and carried on the classical tradition. During the Umayyad era Christianity retained its importance, churches were built and repaired and some of the most important mosaics of the Christian East were made during the 8th century when the region was under Islamic rule.

The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now [[Umm ar-Rasas]]) were made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) "Church of Bishop Sergius." Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.

The last great mosaics in Madaba were made in 767 in the Church of the Virgin Mary (discovered in 1887). It is a masterpiece of the geometric style with a Greek inscription in the central medallion.

With the fall of the [[Umayyad dynasty]] in 750 the Middle East went through deep cultural changes. No great mosaics were made after the end of the 8th century and the majority of churches gradually fell into disrepair and were eventually destroyed. The tradition of mosaic making died out among the Christians and also in the Islamic community.

====Orthodox countries====
[[File:Michael of salonica.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Early 12th-century [[Kiev]]an mosaic depicting [[St. Demetrius]].]]

The craft has also been popular in early medieval [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition. [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav]], the Grand Prince of the [[Kievan Rus']] built a large cathedral in his capital, [[Kiev]]. The model of the church was the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], and it was also called [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]]. It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen, sent by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]], between 1037 and 1046. Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics. In the dome we can see the traditional stern [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] supported by angels. Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives. The apse is dominated by an orant [[Theotokos]] with a [[Deesis]] in three medallions above. Below is a Communion of the Apostles.
[[File:Gelati conch mosaic.JPG|thumb|left|Apse mosaic "Glory of the Theotokos" in [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. c. 1125–1130.]]
Prince [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] built [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] in [[Kiev]] in 1108. The mosaics of the church are undoubtedly works of Byzantine artists. Although the church was destroyed by Soviet authorities, majority of the panels were preserved. Small parts of ornamental mosaic decoration from the 12th century survived in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Novgorod]] but this church was largely decorated with frescoes.

Using mosaics and frescoes in the same building was a unique practice in Ukraine. Harmony was achieved by using the same dominant colors in mosaic and fresco. Both Saint Sophia Cathedral and Saint Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kiev use this technique.&lt;ref name="Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/Art.asp|title=The art of fresco painting in Ukraine|work=Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaics stopped being used for church decoration as early as the 12th century in the eastern Slavic countries. Later Russian churches were decorated with frescoes, similarly then orthodox churches in the Balkan.

The apse mosaic of the [[Gelati Monastery]] is a rare example of mosaic use in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Began by king [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] and completed by his son [[Demetrius I of Georgia]], the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels. The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids. The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople. Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other, lesser known sites. The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the [[Pitsunda Cathedral]] have been inspired by Roman prototypes. In [[Tsromi]] the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme. Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text.

===Jewish mosaics===
[[File:ZodiacMosaicTzippori.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zodiac]] wheel on the floor of the [[synagogue]] in [[Sepphoris]]]]
Under Roman and Byzantine influence the Jews also decorated their [[synagogue]]s with classical floor mosaics. Many interesting examples were discovered in [[Galilee]] and the [[Judean Desert]].

The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in [[Sepphoris]], which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews, Christians and pagans. The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. In the center of the floor the [[zodiac]] wheel was depicted. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot, and each [[zodiac]] is matched with a [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish month]]. Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes, such as the binding of [[Isaac]], as well as traditional rituals, including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains.

Another zodiac mosaic decorated the floor of the [[Beit Alfa]] synagogue which was built during the reign of [[Justin I]] (518–27). It is regarded one of the most important mosaics discovered in Israel. Each of its three panels depicts a scene – the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. In the center of the zodiac is [[Helios]], the sun god, in his chariot. The four women in the corners of the mosaic represent the four seasons.

A third superbly preserved zodiac mosaic was discovered in the [[Severus synagogue]] in the ancient resort town of [[Tiberias|Hammat Tiberias]]. In the center of the 4th-century mosaic the Sun god, Helios sits in his chariot holding the celestial sphere and a whip. Nine of the 12 signs of the zodiac survived intact. Another panel shows the Ark of Covenant and Jewish cultic objects used in the Temple at Jerusalem.

In 1936, a synagogue was excavated in [[Jericho]] which was named [[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]] after an inscription on its mosaic floor ("Peace on Israel"). It appears to have been in use from the 5th to 8th centuries and contained a big mosaic on the floor with drawings of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a [[Shofar]] and a [[Lulav]]. Nearby in [[Naaran]], there is another synagogue (discovered in 1918) from the 6th century that also has a mosaic floor.

The synagogue in [[Eshtemoa synagogue|Eshtemoa]] ([[As-Samu]]) was built around the 4th century. The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns. The synagogue in [[Khirbet Susiya]] (excavated in 1971–72, founded in the end of the 4th century) has three mosaic panels, the eastern one depicting a [[Torah]] shrine, two [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]s, a [[lulav]] and an [[Etrog (ritual)|etrog]] with columns, deer and rams. The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion’s den. The Roman synagogue in [[Ein Gedi]] was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels. The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center. It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community.

The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area. Its mosaic floor depicts [[King David]] as [[Orpheus]], identified by his name in Hebrew letters. Near him were lion cubs, a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre. A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves, each of which contains an animal: a lioness suckling her cub, a giraffe, peacocks, panthers, bears, a zebra and so on. The floor was paved in 508/509. It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon (Menois) and the Christian church at [[Shellal (Palestine)|Shellal]], suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places.

The House of Leontius in [[Bet She'an]] (excavated in 1964–72) is a rare example of a synagogue which was part of an inn. It was built in the Byzantine period. The colorful mosaic floor of the synagogue room had an outer stripe decorated with flowers and birds, around medallions with animals, created by [[vine trellises]] emerging from an amphora. The central medallion enclosed a menorah (candelabrum) beneath the word shalom (peace).
[[File:Mosaic of Menorah.05.27.jpg|thumb|right|Mosaic of Menorah from Hammam Lif synagogue, Tunisia, 6th c. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
A 5th-century building in [[Huldah]] may be a [[Samaritan]] synagogue. Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols (menorah, lulav, etrog) but the inscriptions are Greek. Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an (excavated in 1960). The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule (shrine) with cultic symbols. The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town (see above). The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue. One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script.

In 2003, a synagogue of the 5th or 6th century was uncovered in the coastal Ionian town of [[Saranda]], [[Albania]]. It had exceptional mosaics depicting items associated with Jewish holidays, including a menorah, ram's horn, and lemon tree. Mosaics in the basilica of the synagogue show the facade of what resembles a [[Torah]], animals, trees, and other biblical symbols. The structure measures 20 by 24 m. and was probably last used in the 6th century as a church.

=== Middle Eastern and Western Asian art ===

====Pre-Islamic Arabia====
In South Arabia two mosaic works were excavated in a Qatabanian from the late 3rd century, those two plates formed geometric and grapevines formation reflecting the traditions of that culture. In the [[Ghassanid]] era religious mosaic art flourished in their territory, so far five churches with mosaic were recorded from that era, two built by Ghassanid rulers and the other three by the Christian Arab community who wrote their names and dedications.

[[File:Bishapur zan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor pavement representing female dancers, Shapur palace, [[Bishapur]]]]

====Pre-Islamic Persia====
Tilework had been known there for about two thousand years when cultural exchange between [[Sassanid Empire]] and Romans influenced [[Persian people|Persian]] artists to create mosaic patterns. [[Shapur I]] decorated his palace with tile compositions depicting dancers, musicians, courtesans, etc. This was the only significant example of [[figurative art|figurative]] Persian mosaic, which became prohibited after [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] and arrival of [[Islam]].

====Islamic art====

=====Arab=====
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 690 002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Islamic mosaics inside the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (c. 690)]]

[[Islamic architecture]] used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the [[Muslim conquests]] of the eastern provinces of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art. During the [[Umayyad Dynasty]] mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of [[zellige]] and [[azulejo]] in various parts of the Arab world, although [[tile]] was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration.

The first great religious building of [[Islam]], the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], which was built between 688–692, was decorated with glass mosaics both inside and outside, by craftsmen of the Byzantine tradition. Only parts of the original interior decoration survive. The rich floral motifs follow Byzantine traditions, and are "Islamic only in the sense that the vocabulary is syncretic and does not include representation of men or animals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacredsites.com/middle_east/israel/jerusalem.html Jerusalem, Israel]. sacredsites.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabischer Mosaizist um 735 001.jpg|thumb|The Umayyad mosaics of [[Hisham's Palace]] closely followed classical traditions]]
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], then capital of the [[Arab Caliphate]]. The mosque was built between 706 and 715. The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works. The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard, called the "Barada Panel" after the river [[Barada]]. It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world, at over 4 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively, and many mosaics were lost, although some have been restored since.

The mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque gave inspiration to later Damascene mosaic works. The Dome of the Treasury, which stands in the mosque courtyard, is covered with fine mosaics, probably dating from 13th- or 14th-century restoration work. The style of them are strikingly similar to the Barada Panel. The mausoleum of Sultan [[Baibars]], [[Az-Zahiriyah library|Madrassa Zahiriyah]], which was built after 1277, is also decorated with a band of golden floral and architectural mosaics, running around inside the main prayer hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 Zahiriyya Madrasa and Mausoleum of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108224216/http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 |date=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of [[Hisham's Palace]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]], [[Lebanon]]. The luxurious desert residence of [[Al-Walid II]] in [[Qasr al-Hallabat]] (in present-day [[Jordan]]) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill. The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by "good" animals on one side and "bad" animals on the other. Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a leopard, pairs of partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions and a snake. At [[Qastal, Jordan|Qastal]], near [[Amman]], excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day [[Jordan]], dating probably from the caliphate of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (685–705). They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor. The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns, trees, animals, fruits and rosettes. Except for the open courtyard, entrance and staircases, the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198701/mosaic.country.htm Saudi Aramco World : Mosaic Country]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cordoba moschee innen5 dome.jpg|thumb|right|Golden mosaics in the dome of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]], Moorish Spain (965–970)]]

Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in [[Moorish]] [[Spain]]. The golden mosaics in the [[mihrab]] and the central dome of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]] have a decidedly Byzantine character. They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen, supervised by a master mosaicist from [[Constantinople]], who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain. The decoration is composed of colorful floral [[arabesques]] and wide bands of Arab [[calligraphy]]. The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus, which was lost for the Umayyad family.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Barrucand – Achim Bednorz: Moorish Architecture in Andalusia, Taschen, 2002, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosaics generally went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century. Similar effects were achieved by the use of painted tilework, either geometric with small tiles, sometimes called mosaic, like the [[zillij]] of [[North Africa]], or larger tiles painted with parts of a large decorative scheme ([[Qashani]]) in Persia, Turkey and further east.

Noted 19th-century mosaics include those by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] at St Pauls within the Walls in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/bj/mosaic/index.html |title=Photos of Burne-Jones mosaics in Rome at The Victorian Web |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another modern mosaic of note is the world's largest mosaic installation located at the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], located in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorestlouis.com/visit-explore/discover/25-things-to-do-in-st-louis/|title=25 Things to Do in St. Louis|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern example of mosaic is the [[81st Street – Museum of Natural History (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Museum of Natural History]] station of the [[New York City Subway]] (there are many [[New York City Subway tiles|such works of art]] scattered throughout the New York City subway system, though many [[Independent Subway System|IND]] stations are usually designed with bland mosaics.) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the [[rest area]]s along some Texas interstate highways.

Some modern mosaics are the work of ''[[modernisme]]'' style architects [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Josep Maria Jujol]], for example the mosaics in the [[Park Güell]] in [[Barcelona]]. Today, among the leading figures of the mosaic world are [[Emma Biggs]] (UK), [[Marcelo de Melo]] (Brazil), [[Sonia King]] (USA) and [[Saimir Strati]] (Albania).

===Mosaics as a popular craft===
[[File:Bottlecap mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail of mosaic mural made of modern bottle screw tops. A high school in Jerusalem, Israel]]
Mosaics have developed into a popular craft and art, and are not limited to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to... Mosaic |url=http://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/supplyimages/wf1002/how-to-mosaic-tiles.pdf |publisher=Hobbycraft |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's artisans and crafters work with stone, ceramics, shells, art glass, mirror, beads, and even odd items like doll parts, pearls, or photographs. While ancient mosaics tended to be architectural, modern mosaics are found covering everything from park benches and flowerpots to guitars and bicycles. Items can be as small as an earring or as large as a house.

===Mosaics in street art===
[[File:Space Invader - 2007 - Shoreditch - 1.jpg|thumb|left|A work by [[Invader (artist)|Invader]] in [[Emaux de Briare]].]]
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic, street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork. The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]. He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles, the first of which are small "traditional" tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character, installed in cities across the globe, and the second of which are a style he refers to as "Rubikcubism", which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik's Cubes. Although he is the most prominent, other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well.

===Calçada Portuguesa===
{{Main article|Portuguese pavement}}
[[File:CopacabanaPavement.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)]]]]
Portuguese pavement (in [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], ''Calçada Portuguesa'') is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal, and common throughout the [[Lusosphere]]. Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex, it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design. In Portuguese-speaking countries, many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even, though far more occasionally, streets done in this mosaic form. [[Lisbon]] in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Portuguese Pavements A Calçada Portuguesa |url=http://www.lisbonlux.com/culture/calcada-portuguesa.html |publisher=Lisbon Lux |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosaic art at Bonifacio High Street.jpg|thumb|Mosaic art at [[Bonifacio High Street]] in [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Philippines]]]]
Despite its prevalence and popularity throughout Portugal and its former colonies, and its relation to older art and architectural styles like [[Azulejo]], Portuguese and Spanish painted tilework, it is a relatively young mosaic artform, its first definitive appearance in a modernly recognizable form being in the mid-1800s. Among the most commonly used stones in this style are [[basalt]] and [[limestone]].

==Terminology==
[[File:Fernand Léger - Grand parade with red background (mosaic) 1958 made.jpg|thumb|[[:en:Fernand Léger|Fernand Léger]] – Grand parade with red background, mosaic 1958 (designed 1953). [[:en:National Gallery of Victoria|National Gallery of Victoria]] (NGV), [[:en:Australia|Australia]]]]
Mosaic is an art form which uses small pieces of materials placed together to create a unified whole. The materials commonly used are marble or other stone, glass, [[pottery]], mirror or foil-backed glass, or shells.

The word ''mosaic'' is from the Italian ''mosaico'' deriving from the Latin ''mosaicus'' and ultimately from the Greek ''mouseios'' meaning ''belonging to the [[Muses]]'', hence artistic. Each piece of material is a [[Tessera]] (plural: ''tesserae''). The space in between where the grout goes is an interstice. [[Andamento]] is the word used to describe the movement and flow of [[Tesserae]]. The 'opus', the Latin for ‘work’, is the way in which the pieces are cut and placed.

Common techniques include:
* [[Opus regulatum]]: A grid; all tesserae align both vertically and horizontally.
* [[Opus tessellatum]]: Tesserae form vertical or horizontal rows, but not both.
* [[Opus vermiculatum]]: One or more lines of tesserae follow the edge of a special shape (letters or a major central graphic).
* [[Opus musivum]]: Vermiculatum extends throughout the entire background.
* [[Opus palladianum]]: Instead of forming rows, tesserae are irregularly shaped.  Also known as "crazy paving".
* [[Opus sectile]]: A major shape (e.g. heart, letter, cat) is formed by a single tessera, as later in [[pietra dura]].
* [[Opus classicum]]: When vermiculatum is combined with tessellatum or regulatum.
* [[Opus circumactum]]: Tesserae are laid in overlapping semicircles or fan shapes.
* [[Micromosaic]]: using very small tesserae, in [[Byzantine]] [[icon]]s and Italian panels for jewellery from the Renaissance on.

==Three techniques==
[[File:Ancient Roman Mosaics Villa Romana La Olmeda 021 Pedrosa De La Vega - Saldaña (Palencia).JPG|thumb|upright|Tool table for ancient Roman mosaics at Roman villa of [[La Olmeda]] in [[Pedrosa de la Vega]], [[Province of Palencia]] ([[Castile and León]], [[Spain]]).]][[File:Hammer and hardie.jpg|thumb|These are the hammer and hardie, mosaic tools used for cutting stone by Italian mosaic artists]]
There are three main methods: the direct method, the indirect method and the double indirect method.

===Direct method===
[[File:Li Jiang Guesthouse.jpg|right|thumb|A 'Direct Method' mosaic courtyard made from irregular pebbles and stone strips, [[Lijiang City|Li Jiang]], [[Yunnan]], [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] (China)]]

The direct method of mosaic construction involves directly placing (gluing) the individual [[tessera]]e onto the supporting surface. This method is well suited to surfaces that have a three-dimensional quality, such as vases.  This was used for the historic European wall and ceiling mosaics, following [[underdrawing]]s of the main outlines on the wall below, which are often revealed again when the mosaic falls away.

The direct method suits small projects that are transportable. Another advantage of the direct method is that the resulting mosaic is progressively visible, allowing for any adjustments to tile color or placement.

The disadvantage of the direct method is that the artist must work directly at the chosen surface, which is often not practical for long periods of time, especially for large-scale projects. Also, it is difficult to control the evenness of the finished surface. This is of particular importance when creating a functional surface such as a floor or a table top.

A modern version of the direct method, sometimes called "double direct," is to work directly onto fiberglass mesh. The mosaic can then be constructed with the design visible on the surface and transported to its final location. Large work can be done in this way, with the mosaic being cut up for shipping and then reassembled for installation. It enables the artist to work in comfort in a studio rather than at the site of installation.

===Indirect method===
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects, projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes. Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive, and later transferred onto walls, floors or craft projects. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses. Mosaic murals, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method, as it results in a smoother and more even surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mosaiclegs.com/ |title=Indirect Method Mosaic studio |year=1999 |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double indirect method===
{{Disputed section|date=October 2017}}
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed. The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, sticky plastic or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved.
This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use (patent n. [http://www.uibm.gov.it/uibm/dati/Codice.aspx?load=info_list_uno&amp;id=127474&amp;table=UtilityModel 0000222556]) under the name of his company, Sicis International Srl, now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl.

==Mathematics==
{{further information|tessellation|mathematics and art}}

The best way to arrange variously shaped tiles on a surface leads to the mathematical field of [[tessellation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | authorlink=H.S.M. Coxeter | last=Coxeter | first=H.S.M. | titlelink=Regular Polytopes (book) | title=Regular Polytopes, Section IV : Tessellations and Honeycombs | publisher=Dover | year=1973 | isbn=0-486-61480-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by Moorish mosaics to begin his investigations into tessellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roza |first=Greg |title=An Optical Artist: Exploring Patterns and Symmetry |year=2005 |publisher=Rosen Classroom |isbn=978-1-4042-5117-5 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--should also discuss [[Girih tiles]] here--&gt;

==Digital imaging==
A mosaic in [[digital imaging]] is a plurality of non-overlapping images, arranged in some [[tessellation]]. A [[photomosaic]] is a picture made up of various other pictures (pioneered by Joseph Francis), in which each "[[pixel]]" is another picture, when examined closely. This form has been adopted in many modern media and digital [[image search]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thudit.com/|title=Search Pictures In Mosaic Format|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613180134/http://www.thudit.com/|archivedate=13 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tile mosaic is a [[digital image]] made up of individual [[tile]]s, arranged in a non-overlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is {{convert|1|x|1|in|mm|abbr=on}}, as for example, on the floor of the [[University of Toronto]] pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as {{convert|2|x|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} are used). These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.

Recent developments in digital image processing have led to the ability to design physical tile mosaics using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software. The software typically takes as inputs a source [[bitmap]] and a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of colored tiles.  The software makes a [[best-fit]] match of the tiles to the source image.

==Robotic manufacturing==
With high cost of labor in developed countries, production [[automation]] has become increasingly popular. Rather than being assembled by hand, mosaics designed using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software can be assembled by a robot. Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy.  But these "computer" mosaics have a different look than hand-made "artisanal" mosaics.  With robotic production, colored tiles are loaded into [[wikt:buffer|buffers]], and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artaic.com/ |title=Automated Custom Mosaics |year=2011 |accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational history==

such as Ireland&lt;ref name=IT/&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

The group has 3000 volunteer photographers around the world&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{cite news | last = McMahon| first =Aine| title =Charity offers remembrance photos for bereaved parents: Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep gives service to parents who have suffered loss of baby| newspaper =[[The Irish Times]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =January 11, 2015 | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/charity-offers-remembrance-photos-for-bereaved-parents-1.2062208| accessdate =December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has provided services to more than 30,000 families.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; The group is headquartered in [[Centennial, Colorado]].

==Cultural context==
In the late 19th century, [[post-mortem photography]] was popular and culturally accepted, though it fell out of style early the next century. This cultural shift was accompanied by a rejection of emotional bonding with [[stillborn]] babies, and infants who had died. One journalist observed "In years past, stillbirths and other perinatal deaths were swept under the carpet. Mothers did not see their children, and were urged not to dwell on them or their deaths."&lt;ref name=OC&gt;{{cite news | last = Deachman| first =Bruce | title =Photographers give grieving parents something to hold onto| newspaper =[[Ottawa Citizen]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =August 3, 2015 | url =http://ottawacitizen.com/health/family-child/photographers-give-grieving-parents-something-to-hold-onto| accessdate =December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change in attitudes began in the 1970s and 1980s, and "the medical and psychological thinking about stillbirth began to evolve when researchers started studying the impact of a baby's death and parents began telling their stories. From silence and detachment came acknowledgment and remembrance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Kalb | first = Claudia| title =Stillbirths: How a New Openness Helps Parents Cope| newspaper = [[Newsweek]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 8, 2009| url = http://www.newsweek.com/stillbirths-how-new-openness-helps-parents-cope-82471| accessdate = December 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep is part of this increased concern for the emotional needs of grieving parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ohikere| first =Onize| title = Photographer Michelle Warren captures first and final moments  | newspaper =[[World (magazine)|World]]| location = [[Asheville, North Carolina]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =October 31, 2015 | url =https://www.worldmag.com/mobile/article.php?id=35516| accessdate =December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing their photos, one mother wrote "They are not gruesome, they are not offensive, they are not graphic, nor are they violent".

'''Passive learning''' is a [[Teaching method|method of learning or instruction]] where students receive information from the instructor and internalize it, and "where the learner receives no feedback from the instructor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/passive-learning.html BusinessDirectory.com, definition].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRQ"&gt;[http://www.units.miamioh.edu/celt/events/docs/CFLING/active%20vs%20passive.pdf Norbert Michel, John James Cater III, Otmar Varela:  ''Active Versus Passive Teaching Styles: An Empirical Study of Student Learning Outcomes'',  Human Resource Development Quarterly, DOI: 10.1002/hrdq, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. / Business].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is often used together with ''[[direct instruction]]'' and ''[[lecture|lecturing]]'', with passive learning being the result or intended outcome of the instruction. This style of learning is [[Traditional education|teacher-centered]] and contrasts to [[active learning]], which is [[student-centered]], whereby students take an active or participatory role in the learning process, and to the [[Socratic method]] where students and instructors engage in cooperative argumentative dialogue.  Passive learning is a traditional method utilized in [[factory model school]]s and modern schools, as well as historic and contemporary religious services in churches ([[sermons]]), [[mosque]]s, and [[synagogue]]s.

Passive learning is not simply the outcome of an educational model.  Passive learners may quietly absorb information and knowledge without typically engaging with the information received or the learning experience. They may not interact with others, share insights, or contribute to a dialogue. An estimated 60 percent of people are passive learners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clomedia.com/2013/01/10/engage-passive-learners/ Engage Passive Learnings, Chief Learning Officer, January 10, 2013].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive vs. active learning==
The effectiveness of traditional instruction and passive learning methods have been under debate for some time.&lt;ref name="HRQ"/&gt;  The modern origins of [[progressive education]], with active learning as a component, can be traced back to the 18th century works of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by 20th century theorists such as [[John Dewey]]. Locke wrote that "truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas".&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The progressive education movement: Is it still a factor in today's schools?
|first=William
|last=Hayes
|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education
|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
Advantages of passive learning include: exposure to new material, greater control by the instructor over the classroom, audience, or students; opportunity for a structured and engaging format; ensuring a complement to the subject matter outside of the [[learning environment]] and [[learning space]]; the ability to clarify course material; presentation of a large amount of information in a short time; instructional materials (lecture notes, handouts, audiovisual media, etc.) can be prepared in advance; important concepts and content can be identified and presented in an organized, structured, and meaningful manner; the potential to facilitate large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  This format can also permit dissemination of materials not yet published or readily available.

A randomized, controlled trial comparing passive (60-minute lecture) and active (30-minute lecture along with interactions between student pairs) showed no differences between the two methods in students' knowledge or attitudes. However, the perception of engagement with the delivered content was lower for the passive learning group.&lt;ref name="Haidet"&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=14739758 | doi=10.1023/B:AHSE.0000012213.62043.45 | volume=9 | title=A controlled trial of active versus passive learning strategies in a large group setting | year=2004 | journal=Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract | pages=15–27 | last1 = Haidet | first1 = P | last2 = Morgan | first2 = RO | last3 = O'Malley | first3 = K | last4 = Moran | first4 = BJ | last5 = Richards | first5 = BF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Disadvantages of passive learning include the required assumption that for learning to be successful, the students will receive the subject matter with "open minds, like empty vessels or sponges"; the instructor will fill the minds of the students with knowledge in order to obtain better examination results.&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;[https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/McManus_v49n5p423.pdf Dean A. McManus, ''The Two Paradigms of Education and the Peer Review of Teaching'',  Journal of Geoscience Education, V.49, n.5, November 2001, P423-434].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt; Passive learning allows limited opportunity to assess how well students are learning content and for questions, clarification, or discussion.  Students may be reticent about letting instructors know they do not understand key information and they may be reluctant to ask questions in class.  With no opportunity for application, it does not consistently engage students' use of higher-level cognitive skills.  A standard model is lecture-format with one-way communication which does not engage the listener.  It also requires the instructor to have effective speaking and presentation skills. Students are expected to wait for information to be provided and then to follow directions on what to do with that information. Emphasis is placed on repeating information without reflecting or demonstrating an understanding.  This can result in ''surface processing'' instead of [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], less ability to use what is learned, and the study being deemed irrelevant by the students.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The disadvantages of passive learning can be compared to the advantages of active learning.  It has been suggested that while active ''engagement'' with material, students, instructors, etc. might be critical to learning, active ''participation'' may not be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurodl.org/?p=archives&amp;year=2014&amp;halfyear=2&amp;article=649 Donna Smith and Katy Smith, ''The Case for 'Passive’ Learning – The 'Silent’ Community of Online Learners'', European Journal of Open,  Distance, and E-Learning].

{{Refimprove|date=June 2018}}
The '''picaresque novel''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''picaresca'', from ''pícaro'',  for "[[rogue (vagrant)|rogue]]" or "rascal") is a genre of [[Novel|prose fiction]] that depicts the [[adventure]]s of a roguish, but "appealing hero", of low [[social class]], who lives by his or her wits in a corrupt society.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Picaresque novels typically adopt a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] style, with elements of [[comedy]] and [[satire]].  This style of [[novel]] originated in [[Spain]] in 1554 and flourished throughout [[Europe]] for more than 200 years, though the term  "picaresque novel" was only coined in 1810. It continues to influence modern literature. The term is also sometimes used to describe works, like Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and Charles Dickens' ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'', which only contain some of the genre's elements.

==Defined==

According to the traditional view of Thrall and Hibbard (first published in 1936), seven qualities distinguish the picaresque novel or narrative form, all or some of which an author may employ for effect:&lt;ref&gt;
Thrall, William and Addison Hibbard. ''A Handbook to Literature''. The Odyssey Press, New York. 1960.
&lt;/ref&gt;

* A picaresque narrative is usually written in [[First-person narrative|first person]] as an autobiographical account. 
* The main character is often of low character or social class. He or she gets by with wit and rarely deigns to hold a job. 
* There is no [[plot (narrative)|plot]]. The story is told in a series of loosely connected adventures or episodes. 
* There is little if any character development in the main character. Once a pícaro, always a pícaro. Their circumstances may change but they rarely result in a change of heart. 
* The pícaro's story is told with a plainness of language or [[Literary realism|realism]]. 
* [[Satire]] is sometimes a prominent element. 
* The behavior of a picaresque hero or heroine stops just short of [[criminality]]. Carefree or immoral rascality positions the picaresque hero as a sympathetic outsider, untouched by the false rules of society.

In the English-speaking world, the term "picaresque" is often used loosely to refer to novels that contain some elements of this genre; e.g. an episodic recounting of adventures on the road.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==History==

===Etymology=== 
The word ''pícaro'' first starts to appear in Spain with the current meaning in 1545, though at the time it had no association with literature.&lt;ref&gt;
Best, O. F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/40297681 ''Para la etimología de pícaro''], in ''Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica'', Vol. 17, No. 3/4 (1963/1964), pp. 352-357&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''pícaro'' does not appear in ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' (1554), the novella credited by modern scholars with founding the genre. The expression ''picaresque novel'' was coined in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&amp;pg=PA936 Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary By Merriam-Webster, Inc] p.936&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09NEuGHh2R8C&amp;pg=PA36 Spanish loanwords in the English language: a tendency towards hegemony reversal By Félix Rodríguez González] p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it has any validity at all as a generic label in the Spanish sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—and Cervantes certainly used "picaresque" with a different meaning than it has today—has been called into question. There is unresolved debate within Hispanic studies about what the term means, or meant, and which works were, or should be, so called. The only work clearly called "picaresque" by its contemporaries was [[Mateo Alemán]]'s ''[[Guzmán de Alfarache]]'' (1599), which to them was the ''Libro del pícaro'' (The Book of the Pícaro).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg, "Does the Picaresque Novel Exist?", ''Kentucky Romance Quarterly'', 26, 1979, pp. 203-219, http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/Other_Hispanic_Topics/does_the_picaresque.pdf, retrieved 2014-08-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lazarillo de Tormes'' and its sources===
While elements of [[Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] have a picaresque feel and may have contributed to the style,&lt;ref name="Neachtain2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Seán Ó Neachtain|title=The History of Éamon O'Clery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2hX-AhmR04C&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=30 May 2013|year=2000|publisher=Clo Iar-Chonnacht|isbn=978-1-902420-35-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern picaresque begins with ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'',&lt;ref name="TurnerNez2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Turner|author2=Adelaida L Pez De Mart Nez|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Spanish Novel: From 1600 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUD5rWJufkoC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=11 September 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77815-2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published anonymously in 1554 in Burgos, Medina del Campo, and Alcalá de Henares in Spain, and also in [[Antwerp]], which at the time was under Spanish rule as a major city in the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. It is variously considered either the first picaresque novel or at least the antecedent of the genre.

The protagonist, Lázaro, lives by his wits in an effort to survive and succeed in an impoverished country full of hypocrisy. As a ''pícaro'' character, he is an alienated outsider, whose ability to expose and ridicule individuals compromised with society gives him a revolutionary stance.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Anne J. (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIwLAQAAMAAJ ''Approaches to teaching Lazarillo de Tormes and the picaresque tradition'']. p.19 ("The ''pícaro''{{'}}s revolutionary stance, as an alienated outsider who nevertheless constructs his own self and his world").&lt;/ref&gt; Lázaro states that the motivation for his writing is to communicate his experiences of overcoming deception, hypocrisy, and falsehood (''engaño'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=08wGHT9iug8C&amp;pg=PA138 ''Textual confrontations: comparative readings in Latin American literature''] by Alfred J. Mac Adam, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

The character type draws on elements of [[characterization]] already present in [[Latin literature|Roman literature]], especially [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]''. Lázaro shares some of the traits of the central figure of [[Satyricon#Principal characters|Encolpius]], a former gladiator,&lt;ref name="Chaytor1922pvii"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8lAAAAAYAAJ ''The life of Lazarillo de Tormes: his fortunes and adversities''] (1962) p.18&lt;/ref&gt; though it is unlikely that the author had access to Petronius' work.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, René (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=rY9fAAAAMAAJ ''Le Satyricon: Pétrone''] p.105&lt;/ref&gt; From the comedies of [[Plautus]], ''Lazarillo'' borrows the figure of the parasite and the supple slave. Other traits are taken from [[Apuleius]]'s ''[[The Golden Ass]]''.&lt;ref name="Chaytor1922pvii"&gt;Chaytor, Henry John (1922)[https://books.google.com/books?id=eRJKAAAAIAAJ ''La vida de Lazarillo de Tormes''] p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Ass'' and ''Satyricon'' are rare surviving samples of the "[[Milesian tale]]", a popular genre in the classical world, and were revived and widely read in Renaissance Europe.

The principal episodes of ''Lazarillo'' are based on Arabic folktales that were well-known to the Moorish inhabitants of Spain. The Arabic influence may account for the negative portrayal of priests and other church officials in ''Lazarillo''.&lt;ref&gt;Fouad Al-Mounir, "The Muslim Heritage of ''Lazarillo de Tormes''," ''The Maghreb Review'' vol. 8, no. 2 (1983), pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic literature]], which was read widely in Spain in the time of [[Al-Andalus]] and possessed a literary tradition with similar themes, is thus another possible influence on the picaresque style. [[Al-Hamadhani]] (d.1008) of Hamadhan (Iran) is credited with inventing the literary genre of [[Maqama|''maqamat'']] in which a wandering vagabond makes his living on the gifts his listeners give him following his extemporaneous displays of rhetoric, erudition, or verse, often done with a [[trickster]]'s touch.&lt;ref&gt;[[James T. Monroe]], ''The art of Badi'u 'l-Zaman al-Hamadhani as picaresque narrative'' (American University of Beirut c1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Astarkuwi or al-Ashtarkuni (d.1134) also wrote in the genre ''maqamat'', comparable to later European picaresque.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Monroe, translator, ''Al-Maqamat al-luzumiyah, by Abu-l-Tahir Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Tamimi al-Saraqus'i ibn al-Astarkuwi'' (Leiden: Brill 2002).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The curious presence of Russian [[loan-word]]s in the text of the ''Lazarillo'' also suggests the influence of medieval Slavic tales of tricksters, thieves, itinerant prostitutes, and brigands, who were common figures in the impoverished areas bordering on Germany to the west. When diplomatic ties to Germany and Spain were established under the emperor Charles V, these tales began to be read in Italian translations in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;S. Rodzevich, "K istorii russkogo romantizma", ''Russky Filologichesky Vestnik'', 77 (1917), 194-237 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

As narrator of his own adventures, Lázaro seeks to portray himself as the victim of both his ancestry and his circumstance. This means of appealing to the compassion of the reader would be directly challenged by later picaresque novels such as ''Guzmán de Alfarache'' (1599/1604) and the ''Buscón'' (composed in the first decade of the 17th century and first published in 1626) because the idea of determinism used to cast the ''pícaro'' as a victim clashed with the Counter-Reformation doctrine of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff, David A: “Free Will, the Picaresque, and the Exemplarity of Cervantes’s ''Novelas ejemplares'',” ''M L N'' [''Modern Language Notes''] 124, 2 (2009), pp. 372-403.&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th and 17th centuries===
[[Image:Grabado Guzmán Alfarache.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of the book ''Guzmán de Alfarache'' (1599)]]
An early example is [[Mateo Alemán]]'s ''Guzmán de Alfarache'' (1599), characterized by religiosity. Guzmán de Alfarache is a fictional character who lived in San Juan de Aznalfarache, [[Seville]], [[Spain]].

[[Francisco de Quevedo]]'s ''[[El buscón]]'' (1604 according to Francisco Rico; the exact date is uncertain, yet it was certainly a very early work) is considered the masterpiece of the subgenre by A. A. Parker, because of his [[baroque]] style and the study of the delinquent psychology. However, a more recent school of thought, led by [[Francisco Rico]], rejects Parker's view, contending instead that the protagonist, Pablos, is a highly unrealistic character, simply a means for Quevedo to launch [[Classism|classist]], [[Racism|racist]] and [[Sexism|sexist]] attacks. Moreover, argues Rico, the structure of the novel is radically different from previous works of the picaresque genre: Quevedo uses the conventions of the picaresque as a mere vehicle to show off his abilities with conceit and rhetoric, rather than to construct a satirical critique of [[Spanish Golden Age]] society.

[[Miguel de Cervantes]] wrote several works "in the picaresque manner, notably ''[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]'' (1613) and ''[[El coloquio de los perros]]'' (1613; “Colloquy of the Dogs”)". "Cervantes also incorporated elements of the picaresque into his greatest novel, ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605, 1615)",&lt;ref&gt;"Picaresque", Britannica online [https://www.britannica.com/art/picaresque-novel]&lt;/ref&gt; the "single most important progenitor of the modern novel", that [[M. H. Abrams]] has described as a "quasi-picaresque narrative".&lt;ref&gt; ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition, Harcourt Brace, 1985, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Here the hero is not a rogue but a foolish knight.

In order to understand the historical context that led to the development of these paradigmatic picaresque novels in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries, it is essential to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the lives of ''conversos,'' whose ancestors had been Jewish, and whose New Christian faith was subjected to close scrutiny and mistrust.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of scholarship on the role of conversos in the development of the picaresque novel in 16th- and 17th-century Spain, see Yael Halevi-Wise, “The Life and Times of the Pícaro Converso from Spain to Latin America” in Sephardism: Spanish Jewish History in the Modern Literary Imagination (Stanford UP, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In other European countries, these Spanish novels were read and imitated. In [[Germany]], [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]] wrote ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimmelshausen|first=H. J. Chr.|title=Der abentheurliche Simplicissimus|trans-title=The adventurous Simplicissimus|language=de|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/grimmelshausen_simplicissimus_1669|author-link=Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|publication-place=Nuremberg|publisher=J. Fillion|year=1669|oclc=22567416}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1669), the most important of non-Spanish picaresque novels. It describes the devastation caused by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. [[Alain-René Le Sage|Le Sage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' (1715) is a classic example of the genre,&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Ronald [https://www.jstor.org/pss/27714644 ''Reviewed work(s): Rogue's Progress: Studies in the Picaresque Novel by Robert Alter''], The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, Vol. 64, No. 2 (Apr., 1965), p.303&lt;/ref&gt; which in [[France]] had declined into an aristocratic adventure.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the first example is Thomas Nashe's ''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]'' (1594) in which a court page, Jack Wilson, exposes the underclass life in a string of European cities through lively, often brutal descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael. ''The Novel: A Biography'. Cambridge:Belknap Press. 2014.'&lt;/ref&gt; The body of [[Tobias Smollett]]'s work, and [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' (1722) are considered picaresque, but they lack the sense of religious redemption of delinquency that was very important in Spanish and German novels.  The triumph of Moll Flanders is more economic than moral. While the morés of the early 18th Century wouldn't permit Moll to be a heroine per se, Defoe hardly disguises his admiration for her resilience and resourcefulness.

====Works with some picaresque elements====

The autobiography of [[Benvenuto Cellini]], written in [[Florence]] beginning in 1558, also has much in common with the picaresque.

The classic [[China|Chinese]] novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'' is considered to have considerable picaresque elements. Having been written in 1590, it is contemporary with much of the above—but is unlikely to have been directly influenced by the European genre.

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[Henry Fielding]] proved his mastery of the form in ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742), ''[[The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great]]'' (1743) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' (1749), though Fielding attributed his style to an "imitation of the manner of [[Cervantes]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]''".&lt;ref&gt;The title page of the first edition of ''Joseph Andrews'' lists its full title as: ''The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, and of His Friend Mr. Abraham Adams. Written in Imitation of the Manner of Cervantes, Author of Don Quixote''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] is the master of the 19th Century English picaresque.  Like Moll Flanders, Thackeray's best-known work, ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]] A Novel Without a Hero'' (1847-1848) (a title ironically derived from [[John Bunyan]]'s Puritan allegory of redemption ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678)) follows the career of fortune-hunting adventuress [[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]].  His earlier novel ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (1844) recounts the rise and fall of an Irish arriviste conniving his way into the 18th century English aristocracy. 

====Works influenced by the picaresque====
In the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, the term "picaresque" has referred more to a [[literary technique]] or model than to the precise genre that the Spanish call ''picaresco''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The English-language term can simply refer to an episodic recounting of the adventures of an [[anti-hero]] on the road.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

[[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1761-1767) and ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'' (1768) each have strong picaresque elements. Voltaire's French novel ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) contains elements of the picaresque. An interesting variation on the tradition of the picaresque is ''[[The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan]]'' (1824), a satirical view on early 19th-century [[Persia]], written by a British diplomat, [[James Morier]].

Elements{{clarify|date=July 2018}} of the picaresque novel are found in [[Charles Dickens]]’s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1836–37).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"Picaresque", Britannica online.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gogol]] occasionally used the technique, as  in ''[[Dead Souls]]'' (1842–52).&lt;ref&gt;Striedter, Jurij. Der Schelmenroman in Russland: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Russischen Romans vor Gogol, Berlin 1961&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) also has some elements of the picaresque novel.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Osstapp1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Ostap Bender]] in [[Elista]]]]

''[[Kvachi Kvachantiradze]]''  is a novel written by [[Mikheil Javakhishvili]] in 1924.This is, in brief, the story of a swindler, a Georgian [[Confessions of Felix Krull|Felix Krull]], or perhaps a cynical [[Don Quixote]], named Kvachi Kvachantiradze: womanizer, cheat, perpetrator of insurance fraud, bank-robber, associate of Rasputin, filmmaker, revolutionary, and pimp.

''[[The Twelve Chairs]]'' (1928) and its sequel, ''[[The Little Golden Calf]]'' (1931), by [[Ilya Ilf]] [[Ilf and Petrov|and]] [[Yevgeni Petrov (writer)|Yevgeni Petrov]] became classics of the 20th century [[Russian literature|Russian]] satire and basis for [[The Twelve Chairs (disambiguation)|numerous film adaptations]]. 

[[Camilo José Cela]]'s ''La familia de Pascual Duarte'' (1942). [[The Adventures of Augie March]] by [[Saul Bellow]] (1953). [[John A. Lee]]'s ''[[Shining with the Shiner]]'' (1944) tells amusing tales about New Zealand folk hero Ned Slattery (1840–1927) surviving by his wits and beating the [[Protestant work ethic]]', So too is [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Confessions of Felix Krull]]'' (1954), which like many novels emphasizes the theme of a charmingly roguish ascent in the social order. [[Günter Grass]]'s ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' (1959) is a German picaresque novel.

[[William S. Burroughs]] was a devoted fan of picaresque novels, and gave a series of lectures involving the topic in 1979 at [[Naropa University]] in Colorado. In these he says it is impossible to separate the [[anti-hero]] from the Picaresque novel, that most of these are funny, and they all have protagonist who are outsiders by their nature. His list of picaresque novels includes Petronius' novel ''[[Satyricon]]'' (54-68 AD), ''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]'' (1594) by [[Thomas Nashe]], (1911), both ''A Maiden Voyage'' (1943) and ''[[A Voice Through a Cloud]]'' (1950) by [[Denton Welch]], ''[[Two Serious Ladies]]'' (1943) by [[Jane Bowles]], ''[[Death on Credit]]'' (1936) by [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], and even himself. He also relates a series of real life newspaper stories that Burroughs himself had collected, in which people abandoned their jobs in order to save their own skin, leaving numbers of people to die. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d3fDtxCiAQ|title=Class On Creative Reading - William S.

====Works influenced by the picaresque====
[[Jaroslav Hašek]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'' (1923) is an example of a work from [[Central Europe]], that has picaresque elements.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[J. B. Priestley]] made use of the form in his ''[[The Good Companions]]'' (1929) which won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for Fiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22222">In [[financial regulation]], "'''politically exposed person'''" ('''PEP''') is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and '''senior foreign political figure''' are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.  [[Foreign official]] is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably.  The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.

==Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering==
While there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) standard, as for example the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|Swiss financial market regulator]] in 2011, which quoted it as "the international standard"&lt;ref name="FINMA Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of "politically exposed persons".|url=http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Documents/bericht_pep-abkl%C3%A4rung_20111110_e.pdf|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Eidgenoessische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian government in 2015.&lt;ref name="Austrac Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft guidance note 15/01. Key terms used in 'politically exposed person' definition.|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/draft-gn1501-pep.docx|date=January 2015|publisher=Australian government|author=Australian Transaction reports and Analysis Center(Austrac)|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
FATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the [[G7]] and hosted by the [[OECD]], to set standards and promote implementing measures against [[money laundering]], [[financing of terrorism]] and financing of proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to preserve the integrity of the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref name="FATF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM &amp; PROLIFERATION|author=FATF|publisher=ATF/OECD|date=15 February 2012|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows:&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 
*''Foreign PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example [[Head of state|Heads of state]] or [[Head of government|Heads of government]], senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. 
*''Domestic PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. (Not all countries subscribe to the concept of domestic PEPs with respect to regulatory requirements/application of due diligence. For example, US law, specifically Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act and its implementing regulations provide for enhanced due diligence for SFPFs (Senior Foreign Political Figure) only, defined as: "a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a 'foreign' government...a senior official of a major 'foreign' political party; and a senior executive of a 'foreign' government-owned commercial enterprise.)
*Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by a [[state owned enterprise]] or an [[international organisation]] refers to members of [[senior management]], i.e. directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions.

Requirements for a PEP apply to [[family member]]s or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|18}}
"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals."&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

A forerunner definition was by the 1997 [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.

==Implementation==
Most of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened [[scrutiny]].  
The FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it ''de facto'' makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.&lt;ref name="Ukraine Crisis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=The $70 Billion Missing From the Ukraine: Does it Demonstrate a Whopping Failure of Global Anti-Money Laundering and Corruption Laws? Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/2014/02/the-ukrainian-crisis-means-for-banks-funds-and-bitcoin.html|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Under Australia's AML/CTF Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/legislation/amlctf-act|title=AML/CTF Act|first=Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|last=(AUSTRAC)|date=30 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.

The AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:

* Domestic PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an Australian government body
* Foreign PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in a government body of a foreign country.
* International organisation PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an international organisation.

A reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.

===Canada===
Canada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk.&lt;ref name="Politically Exposed Persons"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=Politically Exposed Persons, Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/politically-exposed-person|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/pep-screening-and-monitoring-in-canada/|title=PEP Screening &amp; Monitoring in Canada|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{See also|Banco de Chile#Controversies{{!}}Banco de Chile}}

In Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. {{As of| 2015}}, 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' 22 February 2015, [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2015/02/655-617858-9-pep-asi-opera-la-vigilancia-financiera-a-la-clase-politica.shtml PEP: así opera la vigilancia financiera a la clase política] Fernando Vega, retrieved on 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.

===UK===
{{As of |January 2015}} likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2003 FATF definition, i.e. without the 2012 update to include domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 Section 14(5)&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|title=The Money Laundering Regulations 2007|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2157/regulation/14/made|work=No. 2157 PART 2 Enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, Regulation 14|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:

* A foreign person who has held any time in the preceding year a prominent public function outside the United Kingdom, in a state or international institution
* Members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks
* Ambassadors, chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces
* Members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises
* Heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant ministers
* Members of parliaments
* Members of supreme courts, constitutional courts or of other high-level judicial bodies
The definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.

PEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.

The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-fca.org.uk/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing|title=FCA Information on Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMLD4 and Domestic PEPS

|url=http://www.lkshields.ie/publications/the-fourth-anti-money-laundering-directive|publisher=LK Shields}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term [[foreign official]] has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}} It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]'s [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a [[suspicious activity report]] to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/pdf/faq/Wolfsberg_PEP_FAQs_(2008).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The designation "politically exposed person" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the "Abacha Affair." [[Sani Abacha]] was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="senat.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html|date=30 June 2004|title=Proposition de directive du Parlement européen et du Conseil relative à la prévention de l'utilisation du système financier aux fins du blanchiment de capitaux, y compris le financement du terrorisme|language=French|author=French Senate,Justice et affaires intérieures|publisher=French Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200108080222.html|title=Nigeria: Abacha Loot: Swiss Govt to Dock 60 Bankers, Lawyers|first=Chidi|last='Uzor|date=8 August 2001|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the [[Federal Office of Police]] of [[Switzerland]] which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&amp;msg-id=22828|title=Switzerland provides mutual legal assistance in the Abacha case - To date, USD 645 million have been frozen in Switzerland|author=|date=21 January 2000|publisher=Federal Office of Justice Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, the concept of "politically exposed person" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention against Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html#UNCACfulltext|publisher=UN office of drugs and crime (UNODC)|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become [[European Union law]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="senat.fr"/&gt;

PEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between [[government corruption]], [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref name="FATF Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Guidance on PEP Legislation.|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-PEP-Rec12-22.pdf|publisher=FATF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of [[Riggs Bank]].&lt;ref name="Riggs Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=At Riggs Bank, A Tangled Path Led to Scandal.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/19/us/at-riggs-bank-a-tangled-path-led-to-scandal.html|publisher=New York Times|date=19 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of regulation, political leaders like [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] have made news in 2013 for having [[Toxic asset|frozen assets]] in US banks that did not follow [[due diligence]].&lt;ref name="Mubarak Asset Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Mubarak assets worth around $1bn.|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/17/efsa-frozen-mubarak-assets-worth-around-1bn/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk screening and PEP datasets==
Most financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called initial [[due diligence]] or [[know your customer]] (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.

There are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. 

Due diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} No 'official' PEP list exist. The [[CIA]] and [[United Nations|UN]] have lists of [[heads of state]]s, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. 

Vendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers.  The world's largest PEP database of 1.6 million counterparts gives Accuity [4] part of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) [5] a strong market position.

Geneva based Polixis&lt;ref&gt;http://polixis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as a challenger solution since it offers an AI-driven database of PEPs with a peculiarity that the data can be linked to a much larger set of economic data through their ARDIS software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdg.ch/geneve/geneve-bureau-polixis-robotise-controle-clients-fortunes-banques/story/19614383&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.

In Chinese, Japanese and Korean cooking, the fruit of the tree is used in juices, as a flavouring for alcohol, as a pickle and in sauces. It is also used in traditional medicine.

The tree's flowering in late winter and early spring is highly regarded as a seasonal symbol.

The plant is known by a number of different names in [[English language|English]], including Chinese plum&lt;ref name=RBGKew/&gt; and Japanese apricot. An alternative name is ''ume'',&lt;ref name=RBGKew/&gt; from Japanese, or ''mume'', from the scientific name.&lt;ref name=RBGKew/&gt; Another alternative name is  ''mei'', from the Chinese name.&lt;ref name=eflora/&gt;

The flower is known as the ''meihua'' (梅花) in Chinese, which came to be translated as "plum blossom"&lt;ref name="kilpatrick-jane"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kilpatrick|first=Jane|title=Gifts from the Gardens of China|year=2007|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Ltd]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-7112-2630-2|pages=16–17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgsfa13J2OIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes as "flowering plum".&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt; The term "winter plum" may be used too, specifically with regard to the depiction of the flower with its early blooming in [[Chinese painting]].

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] it is called ''mei'' ([[wiktionary:梅|梅]]) and the fruit is called ''meizi'' ([[wikt:梅子|梅子]]). The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name is ''ume'' (kanji: [[wiktionary:梅|梅]]; hiragana: [[wiktionary:うめ|うめ]]), while the [[Korean language|Korean]] name is ''maesil'' (hangul: [[wiktionary:매실|매실]]; hanja: [[wiktionary:梅實|梅實]]). The Japanese and Korean terms derive from [[Middle Chinese]], in which the pronunciation is thought to have been ''muəi''.&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Y., ed.: "''Kurashi no kotoba: Gogen Jiten''", page 103. Kodansha, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] name is ''mai'' or ''mơ'' (although ''mai vàng'' refers to a different plant, ''[[Ochnaceae|Ochna integerrima]]'', in southern Vietnam).

In mainland China and Taiwan, ''[[suanmeitang]]'' ({{lang|zh|酸梅汤/酸梅湯}}; "sour plum juice") is made from [[smoked plum]]s, called ''wumei'' ({{lang|zh|乌梅/烏梅}}).&lt;ref name=leung&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Ikhlas A.|title=Leung's encyclopedia of common natural ingredients: used in food, drugs, and cosmetics|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-471-46743-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8rZzaHOrZsC|edition=3rd|author2=Abourashed, Ehab A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plum juice is extracted by boiling smoked plums in water and sweetened with sugar to make ''suanmeitang''.&lt;ref name=leung/&gt; It ranges from light pinkish-orange to purplish black in colour and often has a smoky and slightly salty taste. It is traditionally flavoured with [[sweet osmanthus]] flowers, and is enjoyed chilled, usually in summer.

In Korea, both the flowers and the fruits are used to make tea. ''[[Maehwa-cha]]'' ({{lang|ko|매화차}}; "plum blossom tea") is made by infusing the flowers in hot water. ''[[Maesil-cha]]'' ({{lang|ko|매실차}}; "plum tea") is made by mixing water with ''[[maesil-cheong]]'' (plum syrup) and is served either hot or cold. In Japan, similar drink made from green plums, tastes sweet and tangy, is considered a cold, refreshing drink and is often enjoyed in the summer.

A thick, sweet Chinese sauce called ''meijiang'' ({{lang|zh|梅酱}}) or ''meizijiang'' ({{lang|zh|梅子酱}}), usually translated as "plum sauce", is also made from the plums,&lt;ref name="kilpatrick-jane"/&gt; along with other ingredients such as sugar, vinegar, salt, ginger, chili, and garlic.  Similar to [[duck sauce]], it is used as a [[condiment]] for various Chinese dishes, including poultry dishes and [[egg roll]]s.

In Korea, ''[[maesil-cheong]]'' ({{lang|ko|매실청}}, "plum syrup"), an [[anti-microbial]] syrup made by [[sugaring]] ripe plums, is used as a [[condiment]] and [[sugar substitute]]. It can be made by simply mixing plums and [[sugar]] together, and then leaving them for about 100 days.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3017901|title=A taste of Korea with three regional delights|last=Baek|first=Jong-hyun|date=23 April 2016|newspaper=[[JoongAng Ilbo|Korea JoongAng Daily]]|access-date=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make syrup, the ratio of sugar to plum should be at least 1:1 to prevent [[fermentation]], by which the liquid may turn into [[plum wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201606011806422|title=청(淸)과 발효액은 어떻게 다를까?|last=Han|first=Dongha|date=1 June 2016|newspaper=[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]|language=ko|trans-title=What's the difference between cheong(syrup) and fermented liquor?|access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plums can be removed after 100 days, and the syrup can be consumed right away, or mature for a year or more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Korea, ''[[hwajeon]]'' ({{lang|ko|화전}}; "flower pancake") can be made with plum blossoms. Called ''[[maehwa-jeon]]'' ({{lang|ko|매화전}}; "plum blossom pancake"), the pancake dish is usually sweet, with honey as an ingredient.

Plum liquor, also known as [[plum wine]], is popular in both Japan and Korea, and is also produced in China. ''[[Umeshu]]'' ({{lang|ja|梅酒}}; "plum wine") is a Japanese alcoholic drink made by steeping green plums in [[shōchū]] (clear liquor). It is sweet and smooth. A similar liquor in Korea, called ''[[maesil-ju]]'' ({{lang|ko|매실주}}; "plum wine"), is marketed under various brand names, including Mae hwa soo, Matchsoon and Seoljungmae.  Both the Japanese and Korean varieties of plum liquor are available with whole plum fruits contained in the bottle. In China, plum wine is called ''méijiǔ'' ({{lang|zh|梅酒}}).

In [[Taiwan]], a popular 1950s innovation over the Japanese-style plum wine is the ''wumeijiu'' ({{lang|zh|烏梅酒}}; "smoked plum liquor"), which is made by mixing two types of plum liquor, ''meijiu'' ({{lang|zh|梅酒}}) made of ''P. mume'' and ''lijiu'' ({{lang|zh|李酒}}) made of ''[[Prunus salicina|P. salicina]]'', and [[oolong]] tea liquor.&lt;ref&gt;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation - Department of Liquor [http://liquor.ttl.com.tw/07products/products_view.aspx?sn=2384 烏梅酒] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120234755/http://liquor.ttl.com.tw/07products/products_view.aspx?sn=2384 |date=2008-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, ripe plums are macerated in sticky rice liquor. The resulting liquor is called ''{{lang|vi|[[rượu mơ]]}}''. A brands selling plum liquor is [[Sơn Tinh (liquor)|Sơn Tinh]].

In Chinese cuisine, plums pickled with vinegar and salt are called ''[[suanmeizi]]'' ({{lang|zh|酸梅子}}; "sour plum fruits"), and have an intensely sour and salty flavour. They are generally made from unripe plum fruits. ''[[Li hing mui|Huamei]]'' ({{lang|zh|话梅}}) are Chinese preserved plums and refers to Chinese plums pickled in sugar, salt, and herbs. There are two general varieties: a dried variety, and a wet (pickled) variety.

''[[Umeboshi]]'' ({{lang|ja|梅干}}) are pickled and dried plums. They are a Japanese specialty. Pickled with coarse salt, they are quite salty and sour, and therefore eaten sparingly. They are often red in colour when purple [[shiso]] leaves are used.  Plums used for making ''umeboshi'' are harvested in late May or early June, while they are still green, and layered with salt.  They are weighed down with a heavy stone (or some more modern implement) until late August.  They are then dried in the sun on bamboo mats for several days (they are returned to the salt at night). The [[flavonoid]] pigment in shiso leaves gives them their distinctive colour and a richer flavour. ''Umeboshi'' are generally eaten with rice as part of a [[bento]] (boxed lunch), although they may also be used in [[Sushi#Makizushi|makizushi]] (rolled sushi). ''Umeboshi'' are also used as a popular filling for [[Onigiri|rice ball]]s (onigiri) wrapped in [[laver (seaweed)|laver]]. Makizushi made with plums may be made with either ''umeboshi'' or ''bainiku'' (''umeboshi'' paste), often in conjunction with green shiso leaves. A byproduct of ''umeboshi'' production is ''umeboshi'' vinegar, a salty, sour condiment.

The plum blossom, which is known as the ''meihua'' (梅花), is one of the most beloved flowers in China and has been frequently depicted in Chinese art and poetry for centuries.&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt; The plum blossom is seen as a symbol of winter and a harbinger of spring.&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt; The blossoms are so beloved because they are viewed as blooming most vibrantly amidst the winter snow, exuding an ethereal elegance,&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npm-intro&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Friends of Winter: Paintings of Pine, Plum, and Bamboo from the Museum Collection (Introduction)|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh91/3friends/english/infor.htm|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while their fragrance is noticed to still subtly pervade the air at even the coldest times of the year.&lt;ref name=npm-intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=caizq/&gt; Therefore, the plum blossom came to symbolize perseverance and hope, as well as beauty, purity, and the transitoriness of life.&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt; In [[Confucianism]], the plum blossom stands for the principles and values of virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartók|first1=Mira|last2=Ronan|first2=Christine|title=Ancient China|year=1994|publisher=Good Year Books|isbn=0-673-36180-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hSIQpK4myMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has also been used as a metaphor to symbolize revolutionary struggle since the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ip|first=Hung-yok|title=Intellectuals in revolutionary China, 1921-1949: leaders, heroes and sophisticates|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxfordshire|isbn=0-415-35165-0|pages=103, 110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eazcy0Zrt7QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it blossoms in the cold winter, the plum blossom is regarded as one of the "[[Three Friends of Winter]]", along with pine, and bamboo.&lt;ref name="kilpatrick-jane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heinrich-sally"/&gt; The plum blossom is also regarded as one of the "[[Four Gentlemen]]" of flowers in Chinese art together with the orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo.&lt;ref name="heinrich-sally"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Sally|title=Key into China|year=2007|publisher=Curriculum Press|isbn=978-1-86366-697-8|pages=28, 80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GchvhEH7BHIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the "Flowers of the Four Seasons", which consist of the orchid (spring), the lotus (summer), the chrysanthemum (autumn) and the plum blossom (winter).&lt;ref name="heinrich-sally"/&gt; These groupings are seen repeatedly in the Chinese aesthetic of art, painting, literature, and garden design.&lt;ref name=forsyth&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=Holly|title=Gardens of Eden: Among the World's Most Beautiful Gardens|year=2010|publisher=The Miegunyah Press|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I62swaaPP3oC|isbn=9780522857764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the plum blossom's literary significance is found in the life and work of poet [[Lin Bu]] (林逋) of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).

As with the literary culture amongst the educated of the time, Lin Bu's poems were discussed in several Song dynasty era commentaries on poetry. Wang Junqing remarked after quoting the third and fourth line: "''This is from Lin Hejing's [Lin Bu's] plum blossom poem. Yet these lines might just as well be applied to the flowering apricot, peach, or pear.''"—a comparison of the flowers with the plum blossom to which the renowned Song dynasty poet [[Su Dongpo]]&lt;!-- also known as Su Shi or Su Zizhan --&gt; (蘇東坡) replied, "''Well, yes, they might.

The largest hospital in Hanoi is named [[Bạch Mai Hospital|Bạch Mai]] (white plum blossom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bach Mai - Trang chủ|url=http://bachmaihospital.org/|publisher=Bach Mai Hospital|accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; another hospital in Hanoi is named [[Mai Hương Hospital|Mai Hương]] ("the scent of plum"), situated in Hong Mai (pink plum blossom) street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mai Huong Hospital|url=http://www.maihuong.gov.vn/Default.asp?mnz=39&amp;mno=0&amp;Languageid=1|publisher=Mai Huong Day Psychiatric Hospital|accessdate=27 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726163905/http://www.maihuong.gov.vn/Default.asp?mnz=39&amp;mno=0&amp;Languageid=1|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoàng Mai District|Hoàng Mai]] (yellow plum blossom) is the name of a district in [[Hanoi]]. Bạch Mai is also a long and old street in Hanoi. All these places are located in the south part of Hanoi, where, in the past, many ''P. mume'' trees were grown.

[[Method acting]] is employed by actors to evoke realistic emotions into their performance by drawing on personal experiences. Raymond Hamden, doctor of Clinical and Forensic Psychology, defines the purpose of method acting as “compartmentalizing their own feelings while playing another character [so] they could bring the emotions of that personal feeling to cry if they needed to with that character.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when these emotions are not compartmentalized, they can encroach on other facets of life, often seeming to disrupt the actor’s psyche. This occurs as the actor delves into previous emotional experiences, be they joyful or traumatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological effects, like emotional fatigue, comes when suppressed or unresolved raw emotions are unburied to add to the character,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; not just from the employing personal emotions in performance. The question becomes whether the actor calls up resolved or unresolved emotions in their acting.

== Psychological effects ==
The psychological effects of method acting vary in intensity from individual to individual. Some common effects include; 
*Fatigue
*Fear
*Anxiety
*Shame
*Sleep deprivation
*Personality changes
*Psychotic disorders.

Fatigue, or emotional fatigue, comes mainly when actors “create dissonance between their actions and their actual feelings.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A mode of acting referred to as “surface acting” involves only changing one’s actions without altering the deeper thought processes. Method acting, when employed correctly, is mainly deep acting, or changing thoughts as well as actions, proven to generally avoid excessive fatigue. Surface acting is statistically “positively associated with a negative mood and this explains some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idJudge|Judge, Timothy A. “Is Emotional Labor More Difficult for Some than for Others? A Multi-level, Experience-sampling Study.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; This negative mood that is created leads to fear, anxiety, feelings of shame and sleep deprivation.

Raw emotion or unresolved emotions conjured up for acting, may result in a sleep deprivation and the cyclical nature of the ensuing side effects. [[Sleep deprivation]] alone can lead to impaired function, causing some individuals to “acute episodes of psychosis.” Sleep deprivation initiates chemical changes in the brain that can lead to behavior similar to psychotic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes can lead to more lasting psychological damage. In cases where raw emotion that has not been resolved, or traumas have been evoked before closure has been reached by the individual, the emotion can result in greater emotional instability and increased sense of anxiety, fear or shame.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem seen in method acting comes from the inability of actors to compartmentalize the emotions of the character from their own in daily life. Generally the actors who suffer personality changes and psychotic disorders already have some psychotic tendencies or are emotionally unstable. Those who have [[dissociative identity disorder]] “can’t recognize that the role isn’t theirs” and, even though these individuals appear normal, they have psychotic disorders that sometimes take months to identify.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Dissociative identity disorder is a chemically based disorder that results from “high stress and trauma.” What these individuals experience psychologically can further detriment their chemical and physiological makeup.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor that is rarely discussed when observing the emotional effects of method acting is that the individuals that practice method acting may already be emotionally unstable. Dr. Hamden notes that “many actors have had a traumatic life, [and] acting gives [them] the opportunity to be someone else.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are already emotionally unstable and so the effects of method acting are more severe for them. It is only a minority of people, about 32%, that will have extreme traumatic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
In the professional acting field, most companies have a psychoanalyst that consults on films to give analysis and characteristics for characters. Their responsibility lies in aiding actors in understanding how the character would act. These professionals help when actors cannot relate. Their responsibility is to draw connections and pull raw emotions from the actor to connect with the character.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Under professional supervision, method acting proves safe and effective. Many actors find the practice of method acting cathartic, similar to psychiatrist Jacob L. Moreno’s [[psychodrama]]. In this technique, a professional aids in keeping the individual in alignment while they achieve closure for traumatic emotional damage. The harmful situations in method acting arise when there is no professional supervising the process, such as in “cult-like” weekend courses&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   provided by unqualified individuals that cannot monitor the individuals and keep them in alignment psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

This would be evident in weekend courses where the instructor promises to instruct method acting to a large public class, sometimes as many as one hundred people. The instructor would then be incapable of meeting the psychological needs of each individual in the class. Harmful psychological effects arise “when control of necessary skill falls short, [and] the balance [shifts] to the negative.” This occurs “because the [psychological] risks are in fact greater than anticipated, or because unanticipated obstacles or hurdles arise.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The acting situation then becomes threatening and results in the unpleasant feelings of fear, anxiety or shame.

=== Correlation between acting and physiology ===
It is commonly believed that there is a strong correlation between acting and the physiological reaction to acting. According to the task-emotion theory, “the positive emotions of the actor should be coupled with a specific physiological activation. In particular, excited physical reactions were expected to co-exist with task-emotions such as tension, excitement, and challenge.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The emotion-task theory proposes that “the ‘action tendencies’ in characters occupy a special place and differ somewhat from [the] impulses in general behavior.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, studies have been done that show that the correlation between emotions and physical reactions are moderately weak. .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger comes when control precedence “manifests itself by sudden interruptions of behavior, changes in behavior or by persistence of [character’s] behavior.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   “Control precedence” by emotions is the “feelings, thoughts, impulses, actions or activation going along with aroused emotion that takes precedence over other planned or half executed thoughts, feelings, impulses, etc.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Control precedence is the main concern for method acting. It proves a challenge for actors to come out of character after employing method acting techniques, sometimes altering their behavior, urging them to follow impulses that would be foreign to their own personal nature. This difficulty of returning to one’s own behavior is the common concern linked with method acting.

[[File:Vatican-ChapelleSixtine-Plafond.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A post-restoration section of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel that includes the fresco shown above]]

The '''conservation-restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel''' was one of the most significant [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation-restorations]] of the 20th century.

The [[Sistine Chapel]] was built by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] within the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] immediately to the north of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and completed in about 1481. Its walls were decorated by a number of [[Italian Renaissance painting|Renaissance painters]] who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy, including [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]].&lt;ref name=JS/&gt; The Chapel was further enhanced under [[Pope Julius II]] by the painting of [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|the ceiling]] by [[Michelangelo]] between 1508 and 1512 and by the painting of the ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]'', commissioned by [[Pope Clement VII]] and completed in 1541, again by Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Giacometti, editor, ''The Sistine Chapel'', (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tapestry|tapestries]] on the lowest tier, today best known from the [[Raphael Cartoons]] (painted designs) of 1515–16, completed the ensemble.

Together the paintings make up the greatest pictorial scheme of the Renaissance. Individually, some of Michelangelo's paintings on the ceiling are among the most notable works of western art ever created.{{ref label|a|a|none}} The [[fresco]]es of the Sistine Chapel and in particular the ceiling and accompanying [[lunette]]s by Michelangelo have been subject to a number of restorations, the most recent taking place between 1980 and 1994. This most recent restoration had a profound effect on art lovers and historians, as colours and details that had not been seen for centuries were revealed. It has been claimed that as a result "Every book on Michelangelo will have to be rewritten".&lt;ref&gt;University of Victoria art scholar, John Osborne, in the ''Queen's Quarterly'', as quoted in: {{cite news | first=Fulford| last=Robert| title =Robert Fulford's column about art restoration in Italy | work =[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=11 February 1998 | url =http://www.robertfulford.com/restore.html | accessdate = 2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the art historian [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]] of [[ArtWatch International]], have been extremely critical of the restoration, saying that the restorers have not realised the true intentions of the artist. This is the subject of continuing debate.

==Previous restorations==
The frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel had a number of interventions prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980&lt;!--doesn't make sense in the context of the rest of the article otherwise--&gt;. Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above. In about 1547 [[Paolo Giovio]] wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] and cracks. The effect of saltpetre is to leave a white [[efflorescence]].  Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay ''Michelangelo's colours rediscovered'',&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of [[linseed oil|linseed]] or [[walnut oil]] which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.

In 1625, a restoration was carried out by Simone Lagi, the "resident gilder",  who wiped the ceiling with linen cloths and cleaned it by rubbing it with bread. He occasionally resorted to wetting the bread to remove the more stubborn accretions. His report states that the [[fresco]]es "were returned to their previous beauty without receiving any harm".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vatican Library]], Vat. Capponiano 231, f 238 and Chigiano  G. III 66. f 108.  as cited by Colalucci&lt;/ref&gt; Colalucci states that Lagi "almost certainly" applied layers of  glue-varnish to revive the colours but does not state this in his report in the interests of "preserving the secrets of their [the restorers'] craft".&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Between 1710 and 1713 a further restoration was carried out by the painter [[Annibale Mazzuoli]] and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke.{{ref label|b|b|none}} Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the [[lunette]]s.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

The penultimate restoration was undertaken by the Restoration Laboratory of the [[Vatican Museum]] between 1935 and 1938. The scope of the work was to consolidate some areas of the [[intonaco]] at the eastern end of the building and partially remove the soot and dirt.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

==Modern restoration==
[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 014.jpg|thumb|200px|The Sistine Chapel before the restoration. {{ref label|c|c|none}}]]
The preliminary experimentation for the modern restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others,&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; who took as their guidelines the ''Rules for restoration of works of art'' as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study and analysis of the artwork.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer [[Takashi Okamura (photographer)|Takashi Okamura]] for [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]].&lt;ref name=FM/&gt;

Between June 1980 and October 1984 the first stage of restoration, the work upon Michelangelo's lunettes, was achieved. The focus of the work then transferred to the ceiling, which was completed in December 1989 and from there to the [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]. The restoration was unveiled by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 8 April 1994.&lt;ref name=jp94&gt;{{cite web

===Aims of the conservators===
The aims of the conservators were as follows:

* To study the frescoes progressively, to analyse any discoveries and utilise the appropriate technical responses.
* To record every step of the operation in archival reports, photographs and film.
* To use only those procedures and materials which were simple, extensively tested, not harmful, and reversible.
* To repair cracks and structural damage that threatened the stability of the plaster.
* To remove layers of grime consisting of candle wax and soot that had been deposited by the burning of candles in the chapel for 500 years.
* To remove repainting by previous restorers that attempted to counteract the effects of soot and other accretions.
* To remove oil and animal fat used to counteract salination of areas where water had leaked through.
* To remove crystalline accretions of salt that had whitened areas where water had leaked through.
* To conserve surfaces that were in danger of further deterioration because of bubbling, and flaking.
* To restore sympathetically those areas where deterioration of one sort or another had obliterated details and caused loss of integrity to the whole, for example, filling a bad crack and painting the plaster in a colour matching the original.
* To maintain in small defined areas a physical historical record of the previous restorations that had taken place.

In 1979 Colalucci undertook a series of experiments to discover the right approach for the restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, ''Conflict over the Body of [[Moses]]'' by [[Matteo de Lecce]], which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a small portion of the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Because of the height of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the problems that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.&lt;ref name=GC&gt;Gianluigi Colalucci's essay, ''Michelangelo's Colours Rediscovered'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti. (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the decision to undertake a total restoration was taken&lt;!--if you know who took it some of the passive voice can go--&gt;. [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]] of Japan provided major funding of US$4.2 million in exchange for the filming rights.

===Scaffold===
The team of restorers completed the first stage of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved [[spandrel]]s around the upper sections of the windows, from [[aluminium]] [[scaffolding]] projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved [[cantilever]]ing a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement along the length of the building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.&lt;ref name=FM&gt;Fabrizio Mancinelli's essay, ''Michelangelo at Work'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti, (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pietrangeli, Hirst and Colalucci, eds. ''The Sistine Chapel: A Glorious Restoration'', (1994) Harry N Abrams, {{ISBN|0-8109-8176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of the frescoes===
The findings of the investigation of 1979 were that the entire interior of the chapel, but particularly the ceiling, was covered with a grime of candle smoke comprising [[wax]] and [[soot]] ([[amorphous carbon]]). Above the windows (the main source of ventilation), the lunettes were particularly stained from the smoke and exhaust fumes of the city, being "much dirtier than the ceiling proper".&lt;ref name=FM/&gt;
The building was a little unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo's work of 1508, causing cracking of the ceiling, the crack in the "Judith" [[pendentive]] being so large that it had to be filled with bricks and mortar before painting. The upper part of the ceiling provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage.&lt;ref name=JS&gt;[[John Shearman]], essay ''The Chapel of Sixtus IV'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti, (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued ingress of water from the roof and from unroofed exterior walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Earlier restorations had all left their marks on the frescoes. To counteract the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small [[putti]] which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly the case for the lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Close examination revealed that apart from smoky deposits, seepage deposits and structural cracks, the thin "pictorial skin" of Michelangelo's frescoes was in excellent condition.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; Colalucci describes Michelangelo as having employed the best possible fresco techniques, as described by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;Milanesi ed. Vasari, ''Vite...'' Book I, Chapter V, p.182, ed. Milanesi, Florence (1906), as cited by Colalucci.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the paint was well adhered and required little retouching. The plaster, or [[intonaco]], on which the paintings were executed was found, for the most part, to be secure, as previous restorers had fixed it in places with [[bronze]] pins.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

===Interventions===
Prior to the restoration the team spent six months investigating the composition and condition of the frescoes, questioning members of the team that had restored the frescoes in the 1930s and making a detailed scientific study to ascertain which solvents and methods were best employed upon particular painted surfaces.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;
[[File:Gardenbeforeandafter.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A composite image of ''The Fall and Expulsion of Adam and Eve'' by [[Michelangelo]]. The upper left is shown unrestored, the lower right is shown restored.]]
The first stage of the physical restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick) that were in danger of separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a [[polyvinylacetate]] [[resin]]. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

The restorers washed the surfaces using a variety of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of [[calcium carbonate]] were treated by the application of a solution of [[dimethylformamide]]. The final step was the application of a weak solution of [[acryl group|acrylic]] [[polymer]] to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Where necessary some areas were retouched in [[watercolor painting|watercolour]], to integrate the pictorial material. These areas are distinctively textured with vertical brushstrokes, not visible from a distance but easily discernible as restoration work when viewed close up.&lt;ref name=GC /&gt;

Certain small areas were left unrestored, in order to maintain a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with overpainting and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract salination with oil.

==Environmental protection of the frescoes==
Once the many layers of candle wax, varnish, and animal glue were removed from the surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, they became subject to dangers that could not have been predicted by previous restorers.

One of the major dangers to the frescoes is [[exhaust fumes|automotive exhaust]], and they are also vulnerable to the effects of the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and [[bacteria]] (the latter of which can biodegrade paints and pigments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciferri|first=Orio|date=1999-03-01|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings | journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=65|issue=3|pages=879–885|issn=0099-2240|pmc=91117|pmid=10049836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered with a layer of smoky wax.&lt;ref name="Carrier"&gt;Carrier, United Technologies, ''Sistine Chapel'', [http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp_i=1&amp;sp_q=Sistine+Chapel&amp;sp_a=sp100368b9&amp;sp_k=global&amp;sp_p=any&amp;sp_f=utf-8&amp;x=11&amp;y=9] Retrieved on 2007-09-28. NOTE: This page is no longer available.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] was from its windows in the upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown [[Air pollution|pollutants]] from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an [[air conditioning]] system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the [[United Technologies Corporation]] and was developed with the cooperation of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]]'s Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and [[humidity]] that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. [[Bacteria]] and chemical [[pollutant]]s are filtered out.

Environmental specifications:&lt;ref name= Carrier /&gt;
* [[Air filtration]] units: remove particles down to 0.1 micrometre
* [[Air temperature]]: {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} in summer, moving gradually to {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} in winter.

==Response to the restoration==

===Criticism and praise===
When the restoration of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]], of [[ArtWatch International]], who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in ''Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.''&lt;ref&gt;James Beck and Michael Daley, ''Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal'', W.W. Norton, 1995. {{ISBN|0-393-31297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 027.jpg|thumb|''[[Jeremiah]] lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem''.]]
{{quote|In the rhetoric of this conversation, [the conservators] say that the previous restoration was no good&amp;nbsp;– now we're going to make a really good one. It's like having a facelift.

While James Beck became "embroiled in a public debate" with Gianluigi Colalucci, Ronald Feldman, a New York art dealer, started a petition supported by 15 well-known artists including [[Robert Motherwell]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Christo]] and [[Andy Warhol]] asking Pope John Paul II to call a halt to the procedure and also the restoration of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck, ''Halt Urged in Work on Sistine and "Last Supper"'', ''New York Times'', 1987-03-06 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF1F39F935A35750C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print]. Retrieved 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

An undertaking of the restoration team was that everything would be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]], had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of the restoration of the ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.

According to Kimmelman, the reason for their reluctance to produce the detailed photos, which could have put to rest the worst fears of many of the interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book ("as large as a coffee table"). This book, when produced&lt;!--when?--&gt; retailed for US$1,000. Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as "ungenerous" and "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As the work was progressively completed, there were those who were delighted; [[Pope John Paul II]] spoke an inaugural [[homily]] after each stage. In December 1999, after the completion of the wall frescoes, he said:

{{quote|It would be difficult to find a more eloquent visual commentary on this biblical image than the Sistine Chapel, whose full splendour we can enjoy today thanks to the recently completed restoration. Our joy is shared by the faithful throughout the world, who not only cherish this place because of the masterpieces it contains, but also for the role it plays in the Church's life.|Pope John Paul II&lt;ref name=jp99/&gt;}}

Cardinal [[Edmund Szoka]], governor of [[Vatican City]], said: "This restoration and the expertise of the restorers allows us to contemplate the paintings as if we had been given the chance of being present when they were first shown."&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, ''Sistine Chapel Restored'' 1999-12-11, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/560315.stm]. Retrieved 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers were less flattering. Andrew Wordsworth of ''[[The Independent]]'', London, expressed the major point of concern:

{{quote|There seems little doubt that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was in part painted [[fresco-secco|a secco]] (that is, once the plaster was dry), but the restorers none the less decided that radical cleaning was necessary, given the amount of dirt that had accumulated (in particular from candle smoke).

This crucial matter was also emphasised by Beck and defined in very clearly expressed terms on the website of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.&lt;ref name= PLA&gt;{{cite web

===Issues raised by critics===
That part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by [[Michelangelo]]. The emergence of the brightly coloured [[Ancestors of Christ]] from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, the work on the ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.&lt;ref name= PLA /&gt;&lt;ref name= Beck&gt;{{cite web

The cause for dissent lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to their understanding of those techniques. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in "[[buon fresco]]"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work "a secco"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.&lt;ref&gt;See reference to Colalucci's conflicting report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and "lamp black", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted "buon fresco" would remain.&lt;ref name= PLA /&gt;

[[File:Sistine Chapel Daniel beforandafter.jpg|upright=2|centre|thumb|{{centre|''Daniel'', before and after restoration.}}]]

According to critics, the inherent problem with this approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted ''buon fresco'', that he was always satisfied with the result at the end of the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.

A summary of the relevant statements of Colalucci, in the order that they occur in the Appendix entitled ''Michelangelo's colours uncovered'' is as follows:

{{quote|The elderly restorers who had taken part in the restoration of the 1930s were interviewed as part of the preparatory process. They claimed that Michelangelo worked over the frescoes ''a secco'' using ''velature'' or glazes as a binder. Colalucci rejects this, stating that Michelangelo worked exclusively in ''buon fresco''. Colalucci then contradicts this by stating that Michelangelo had worked ''a secco'', but "to a minimal degree" and "not at all in the lunettes".

Colalucci then talks of Michelangelo's "rigorous maintenance" of ''buon fresco'' technique, contradicting this by describing the ''a secco'' retouchings that Michelangelo made to the shoulder of Eleazar and the foot of Reboam, both of which are in the lunettes. He then says that Michelangelo worked in ''buon fresco'' with "no ''pentimenti'' proper", ([[pentimenti]] means the changes) but only small corrections in fresco.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;}}

The ongoing criticism has been that the restorers presumed to know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling, and by what method he sought to achieve it. The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved.&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;&lt;ref name= Beck/&gt;

====Carbon black problem====
The restorers took for granted that all of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and numerous artists have suggested that Michelangelo used [[carbon black]] in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, ''a secco''. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Colalucci refers to this opinion in his Appendix quoted above&lt;/ref&gt;

On some of the figures, however, there still remains clear evidence of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation for this is that over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular ''giornata'' include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.

There are still intense areas of shadow which throw the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] into relief. But it is more than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see in the work of the man who sculpted Moses.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; Critics of the restoration claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over ''a secco'' to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.&lt;ref name= PLA/&gt;

Consistently missing from the restored ceiling is the crisp ''a secco'' detailing of the architecture: the [[scallop]] shells, [[acorn]]s and "bead and reel" ornament which Michelangelo possibly would have left for completion by an assistant, when he moved on to the next panel. The treatment of these details varied considerably. In a few places, around the Ezekias spandrel, for example, the architectural detailing was painted ''buon fresco'' and remains intact.
[[File:Sistine Chapel TwoSpandrels.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|centre|alt=A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states.|Different post-restoration states in two similar spandrels. In the left spandrel, black detailing of robes, eyes and architecture is intact. In the right spandrel, these details have been lost in the cleaning.]]

A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The one on the left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the [[fictive architecture]] each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.

On the corner pendentives, each of which depicts a violent subject, the removal of the carbon black has diminished the dramatic intensity of all four scenes. This is particularly noticeable in the loss of depth in the ''Punishment of [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]''. Where once the figure projected starkly against the darkly shadowed interior, now foreshortening, definition and drama is lost in the pastel monotone that remains.&lt;!--are the restorers admitting all this? Seems a little unbalanced in favour of the critics--&gt;

====Colour====
The curator, Fabrizio Mancinelli, quotes the 18th-century French traveller [[Jérôme Lalande|De Lalande]] in saying that the colouring of the ceiling was, by that time, monotonous, "tend[ing] towards dull red and grey". Mancinelli writes that the restoration reveals "a new Michelangelo" as a colourist and that this "new character makes much better sense of his historical position".&lt;ref name=FM/&gt; He goes on to say that perceptive viewers of the Sistine Chapel ceiling have always been aware that the range of colours used was very different from that which could be seen,&lt;ref&gt;Fabrizio Mancinelli, in the essay "Michelangelo at Work" (''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Giacometti) cites Wilson, Biagetti and Wilde.&lt;/ref&gt; and included the same pinks, apple greens, oranges, yellows and pale blues that were employed by Michelangelo's teacher, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], one of the most competent fresco painters of the Renaissance.

The brilliant palette ought to have been expected by the restorers as the same range of colours appears in the works of [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Piero della Francesca]], as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]. The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster.  The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo's ceiling, but not ''The Last Judgment'', is the intense blue of [[lapis lazuli]]. This colour, achieved by grinding semi-precious stone, was always applied as a secondary, ''a secco'' stage, along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes.{{ref label|e|e|none}}
[[File:Daniel project 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Daniel's right hand and knee. On the unrestored fresco, the intense red underpainting shows through the black ''a secco'' wash adding luminescence to the shadows. The form under the garment is achieved by the black wash.{{ref label|f|f|none}}]]
The aspect of the colouring which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the [[Libyan Sibyl]] and the [[Prophet Daniel]], which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, there is no such gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the ''Mathan'' lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.

In some instances, the colour combinations look garish: this is particularly the case with the [[Prophet Daniel]]. A comparison of the "restored" and "unrestored" figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned.&lt;ref&gt;as detailed in Arguimbau's article&lt;/ref&gt; The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as they still are on the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both [[oil painting]] and [[tempera]]. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.{{ref label|d|d|none}}
[[File:Jonah B.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|''Jonah'', restored. Much of the dramatic tonality of the figure has disappeared in the cleaning, diminishing the effect of the foreshortening.]]
There is absolutely no doubt that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau,&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.

The painter and biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]], in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', describes the figure of [[Jonah]] as it appeared in the mid-16th century:
{{quote|Then who is not filled with admiration and amazement at the awesome sight of Jonah, the last figure in the chapel? The vaulting naturally springs forward, following the curve of the masonry; but through the force of art it is apparently straightened out by the figure of Jonah, which bends in the opposite direction; and thus vanquished by the art of design, with its lights and shades, the ceiling even appears to recede.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Michelangelo'' from ''Lives of the Artists'',(1568) translated by George Bull, Penguin Classics, (1965) {{ISBN|0-14-044164-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The large figure of Jonah is of great significance to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The [[foreshortening]] described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme left side of the painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.

====Eyes====
[[File:Jesse spandrel beforeandafter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Losses of a sort which are deemed "travesties" by critics of the restoration. The Jesse spandrel, before and after restoration. The eyes are now missing, as they are in numerous other figures, particularly among the ancestors.]]
The missing depth is not the only factor that the critics deplore. An important feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted ''buon fresco''. Wherever they have not been painted [[buon fresco]] but added ''a secco'', they have been removed by the restorers.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

They are an essential part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the ''Creation of Adam''. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.

Arguimbau says:

{{quote|Have you ever felt that some things never fade and remain an inspiration for all time? That was the Sistine Chapel, now chemically stripped down of divine inspiration and looking shockingly out of place.&amp;nbsp;... It is the duty of the restorer not to alter the intent of the artist, but the scientist cannot help himself. Who cares if Colalucci discovered Michelangelo as a colorist and can explain the Colorist trends of Pontormo and Rossi. His job is to make sure the thing is stuck on there and leave it alone. In comparing before and after photos there is much proof that Colalucci removed 'a secco' passages and left many areas sketchy and thin and.{{sic}} Proof of one single change of the artist's intent is negligence of which there are many.|Arguimbau&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;}}

Richard Serrin, in an essay entitled ''Lies and Misdemeanors: Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisited'' says:

{{quote|The [so-called] Glorious Restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes has destroyed them forever. What we say now cannot bring them back to life. We can only speak out to document the accountability of the Vatican restorers so that it does not pass unrecognized.|Richard Serrin&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web| last =Serrin| first =Richard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Lies and Misdemeanors, Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisted| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://mimsstudios.com/richardserrinarticle.pdf| format =PDF| doi =| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070202045650/http://www.mimsstudios.com/richardserrinarticle.pdf| archivedate =2007-02-02| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Restoring the light==
Carlo Pietrangeli, former Director General of the Vatican Museums&lt;!--at the time of the restoration?--&gt;, writes of the restoration: "It is like opening a window in a dark room and seeing it flooded with light."&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; His words resonate with those of Giorgio Vasari who, in the 16th century, said of the Sistine Chapel ceiling:

{{quote|There is no other work to compare with this for excellence ... The ceiling has proved a veritable beacon for our art, of inestimable benefit to all painters, restoring light to a world that for centuries had been plunged into darkness.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt;}}

Pietrangeli, in his foreword to ''The Sistine Chapel'', written after the restoration of the lunettes, but prior to the restoration of the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;Carlo Pietrangeli, Foreword to ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed.

[[File:Robert-the-Devil-1Q-15c-782909.jpg|thumb|350px|Robert commits one of his crimes (left) and is knighted (right), 15th century illustration from the ''Chronique de Normandie'']]
'''Robert the Devil''' ({{Lang-la|Robertus Diabolus}}) is a [[legend]] of [[medieval]] origin about a Norman knight who discovers he is the son of [[Satan]]. His mother, despairing of heaven's aid in order to obtain a son, had asked for help from the devil. Robert's satanic instincts propel him into a violent and sinful life, but he eventually overcomes them to achieve repentance.

It is not known whether or not the legend is based on the life of a real individual. It originated in France in the 13th century and has since provided the basis for many literary and dramatic works, most notably the [[Meyerbeer]] opera ''[[Robert le diable]]''.

== Literature and legend ==

===Story===
The 19th century Italian writer [[Arturo Graf]] gives this version of the legend in his 1889 book ''Il Diavolo'' : &lt;blockquote&gt;There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have children and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, for the first time in his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Graf  Edward Noble Stone (trans), ''The Story of the Devil'', Macmillan, New York, 1931, pp.119-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Literary history===
[[File:Louis Guéymard as Robert le Diable by Gustave Courbet - The Metropolitan Museum of Art 436015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Louis Guéymard]] in the Meyerbeer opera]]
The oldest known account of this legend is a [[Latin]] prose narrative by a [[Dominican friar]], [[Etienne de Bourbon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1250), in which no information on Robert's family is given. Then it appears in a French metrical [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] of the thirteenth century, in which Robert is described as the son of the duchess of Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, [https://archive.org/details/medivalromancein00loom ''Medieval Romance in England: A Study of the Sources and Analogues of the Non-Cyclic Metrical Romances''] (New York: Oxford University Press, 1924), p. 50.  Samuel N. Rosenberg, "Robert the Devil: The First Modern English Translation of Robert le Diable, an Anonymous French Romance of the Thirteenth Century" (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation by Samuel N. Rosenberg of the thirteenth-century French romance was published in 2018 by [[Penn State University Press]]. It appears also in a "dit" of somewhat later date, and in a [[miracle play]] of the fourteenth century. A French prose version was also prefixed to the old ''Croniques de Normandie'' (probably of the thirteenth century). But the legend owes its popularity to the story-books, of which the earliest known appeared at Lyons in 1496, and again at Paris in 1497, under the title ''La Vie du terrible Robert le dyable''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crm.revues.org/1472 Élisabeth Gaucher (1998) "La Vie du terrible Robert le dyable", ''Cahiers de recherches médiévales'' Vol. 5 pp 153-164]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the sixteenth century the legend was often printed together with that of Richard sans Peur ([[Richard I, Duke of Normandy]]); it was published in completely recast form in 1769 under the title ''Histoire de Robert le Diable, duc de Normandie, et de Richard Sans Peur, son fils''.

From France the legend spread to Spain, where it was very popular. In England, the subject was treated in the metrical romance, ''[[Sir Gowther]]'', probably written around the end of the fourteenth century (though in this version the devil disguises himself as the mother's husband).&lt;ref&gt;Corinne Saunders, ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England'', D.S. Brewer, Rochester, NY. 2001. p.223; E. M. Bradstock, `Sir Gowther: Secular Hagiography or Hagiographical Romance or Neither?', AUMLA: Journal of the Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association 59 (1983), 26-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  An English translation from the French [[chapbook]] was made by [[Wynkyn de Worde]], [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s assistant, and published without date under the title ''Robert deuyll''. Another version, not based on the preceding, was written by [[Thomas Lodge]] in his book on ''Robin the Divell'', in which Robert is the "second Duke of Normandy" (London, 1591).&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama", p. 424 ''Oxford History of English Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, the romance of ''Robrecht den Duyvel'' was put on the index of forbidden books by the [[Bishop of Antwerp]] in 1621.

In Germany, the legend never attained much of a vogue; not until the nineteenth century did it pass into the ''[[Joseph Görres#Early life|Volksbücher]]'', being introduced by [[Joseph Görres|Görres]]. It was treated in [[epic poetry|epic]] form by [[:de:Viktor von Strauß und Torney|Victor von Strauß]] (1854), in dramatic form by [[Ernst Raupach|Raupach]] (1835) and [[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|in comic travesty]] (after the 1831 [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] opera ''[[Robert le diable]]'') by [[W. S. Gilbert]] in 1868.

The villain in [[Erich Kästner]]'s  1931  children's story ''Pünktchen und Anton'', a petty criminal and thief, is rather facetiously nicknamed "Robert the Devil".

==Historicity==
Various attempts have been made to identify Robert with a historical individual, generally a Norman aristocrat of the 11th century. [[F. J. Furnivall]], following earlier writers, argued that [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] was the source of the story, writing that, "The original of Robert the Devil was Robert, father of William the Conqueror, and sixth Duke of Normandy. Part of the legends about him have been transferred to a different person, [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert, King of Sicily]] (and Jerusalem), Duke of Apulia etc., who tried to make peace between Edward III and the French king, and whom Froissart and others tell us of."&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Furnivall (ed), ''Robert Laneham's Letter: Describing a Part of the Entertainment Unto Queen Elizabeth at the Castle of Kenilworth in 1575'', Chatto and Windus, London, 1907, p.cxxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have dismissed this. Charles Homer Haskins says that it is nothing more than "an unwarranted confusion with this hero, or rather villain, of romance and grand opera".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Homer Haskins, ''The Normans in European History'', Constable, London, 1916, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Norman aristocrat, [[Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert of Bellême]], has also been suggested as the original. According to William Hunt in the [[Dictionary of National Biography]], various stories of his sadistic cruelty were circulated after his death. In Maine "his abiding works are pointed to as the works of Robert the Devil, a surname that has been transferred from him to the father of the Conqueror."&lt;ref&gt;Freesman, ''William Rufus'', i. 181-3, quoted in ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1885, volume 04, p.182.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Norman castle near Rouen, known as [[Château de Robert-le-Diable]], is associated with the legend. The Elizabethan statesman [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] was called "Robert the devil" by his enemies, but this was with reference to the existing legend.&lt;ref&gt;[[P. M. Handover]], ''The Second Cecil:The Rise to Power, 1563-1604 of Sir Robert Cecil, Late First Earl of Salisbury'', Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, London, 1959, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shutter''''' ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]]: ชัตเตอร์ กดติดวิญญาณ)&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{IMDb title|0440803|Shutter}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2004 Thai [[horror film]] by [[Banjong Pisanthanakun]] and [[Parkpoom Wongpoom]]; starring [[Ananda Everingham]], [[Natthaweeranuch Thongmee]], and Achita Sikamana. It focuses on mysterious images seen in developed pictures. The film was a huge box office success, making it one  of the best horror movies of Thailand recognized worldwide. 

An English-language remake under the [[Shutter (2008 film)|same title]] was released in 2008.The film was also remade in Hindi as [[Click (2010 film)|Click]].

==Plot==
After celebrating at a drinking party with his close friends, Tun ([[Ananda Everingham]]), a photographer, and his girlfriend Jane ([[Natthaweeranuch Thongmee]]), get into a car accident. Jane runs over a young woman that she didn't see. With much fear, Tun prohibits her from getting out of the car: they drive away, leaving the girl lying on the road.

Tun begins to discover mysterious white shadows and what appear to be faces in his photographs. A suspicious Jane thinks these images may be the ghost of the girl they hit on the road. Tun, who has been experiencing severe neck pains since the accident, visits a specialist and is dismayed to find that his weight is double his regular weight. Unconvinced of the existence of the supernatural, Tun dismisses the idea of being haunted although his friends are also being disturbed by this mysterious girl.

Jane discovers that the girl was Natre (Achita Sikamana), a shy young woman who had attended the same college as Tun. After confronting Tun, Tun admits that he and Natre were in a relationship, which Tun had kept secret from his friends. Natre loved Tun dearly and threatened to commit suicide when Tun abruptly broke off the relationship. Tun witnesses his friend, Tonn, committing suicide, and discovers that his two other close friends from college have also committed suicide. Believing that they have been coerced into doing so by Natre's ghost, Tun becomes convinced that he will be next.

The haunting of Tun by Natre's ghost escalates, so he and Jane visit Natre's mother. At her house, they discover the decaying body of Natre in her bedroom. They learn that Natre had committed suicide, but her mother could not bear to have her cremated. Natre's funeral is held the following day, after which Jane hopes that everything will return to normal. Tun and Jane spend the night in a hotel, where Tun wakes up and is confronted by Natre's ghost. Tun tries to escape but is pursued; ultimately, while trying to get away, he falls off a fire escape and is injured.

However, on returning to [[Bangkok]], Jane collects some photographs. One of the films shows a series of images of Natre crawling towards the bookcase in Tun's apartment. Jane finds a set of negatives hidden behind the bookcase. She develops the negatives to find photographs in which Tun's friends—the ones who committed suicide—are sexually assaulting Natre. Utterly disgusted by her findings and now convinced that Natre tried to warn her, a teary Jane confronts Tun. Tun admits that he witnessed the rape but did nothing to stop his friends, and that he was the one who had taken those photos. He says he did it out of peer pressure and has never forgiven himself, but Jane leaves him.

Knowing that he is still haunted by Natre, Tun begins taking pictures of every room in his house, but does not see Natre in any of the photos. He throws the camera across the room in a rage, only for it to go off, taking a photograph of Tun, revealing Natre sitting on Tun's shoulders. In the ensuing confrontation, Natre covers Tun's eyes making him unable to see, making him lose balance and fall out of the window.

The final scene shows a badly bandaged Tun slumping over in a hospital bed while Jane visits him. As the door swings closed behind Jane, the glass reflection shows Natre still sitting on his shoulders.

The game was released in Japan on September 7, 2011 and was localized in North America and [[PAL region]] in August 2013.&lt;ref name="Release date"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NA date gem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EU collectors"/&gt; The game takes place in a fictional world called Rieze Maxia where humans and ethereal spirits live in harmony.

==Gameplay==
''Tales of Xillia'' consists primarily of two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the [[player character]] traverses and interacts with [[non-player character]]s, [[Item (gaming)|items]], or [[Mob (video gaming)|mob]] [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]].&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; On the field map, character interactions between the [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] can also be viewed in the form of a [[sketch story]]; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt;

[[File:Xillia gameplay.png|left|thumb|''Tales of Xillia'' uses the ''Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System'' during battles. From left to right, the bottom screen displays the Linked Artes Gauge, character portraits and status, and the link supporting character.]]
During battle sequences, the game uses the ''Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System'', a variation of the ''Linear Motion Battle'' used in the [[Tales (video game series)|''Tales'' series]].&lt;ref name="UK Xillia site"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bandainamcogames.co.uk/product/tales-of-xillia/playstation-3#tab-description |title=''Tales of Xillia'' official United Kingdom website |publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]] |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802122219/http://www.bandainamcogames.eu/product/tales-of-xillia/playstation-3 |archivedate=August 2, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four characters from the party are chosen to battle and characters not controlled by a player are controlled by [[artificial intelligence]] with instructions set by the players beforehand.&lt;ref name="OPMUK review"/&gt; The enemy mob's number, appearances, behavior, vary and are dependent on the mob's avatar. Both sides' objective is to deplete the other side's [[Health (gaming)|health points]] (HP) using attacks and [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|skills]]. When a party member's health falls to zero, the party member faints until revived with items, by a [[Healer (gaming)|healer]], or resting at an inn on the field map; Mobs with zero HP disappear from the arena. Killing all the mobs will yield [[experience point]]s, items, and allows the player to return to the field map. If all four participating party members are defeated, a [[game over]] will occur. Skill and [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Attributes|attribute]] development is based on a system of orbs placed on the nodes of a hexagonal web called the Lilium Orb. When characters level up, they receive GP which can then be allocated to the orbs on the web in a uni-linear path.

Battles take place in [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time]]. Player actions include moving, dashing, standard attacks, and artes; artes are special attacks which consume "Technical Points" (TP), the in-game synonym for [[magic point]]s. Dashing, standard attacks, and artes usage are also restricted by the "Assault Counter" (AC), a synonym for [[action point (video gaming)|action point]]s.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Tutorial speech balloon:''' "Your AC (Assault Counter) shows the number of consecutive attacks you can use. [...] Artes consume both AC and TP (Technical Point) numbers. As long as you have AC and TP left, you can use attacks continuously."&lt;/ref&gt; Party members are able to link to each other to perform unified attacks called linked artes.&lt;ref name="UK Xillia site"/&gt; While linked, the supporting partner provides unique abilities to the character, while also increasing the Linked Artes Gauge. When the Linked Artes Gauge is full, the player character can enter Over Limit which gives them immunity to stagger, unlimited AC, and allows them to use linked artes in succession.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Tutorial speech balloon:''' "Once you have filled all five segments of the Linked Artes Gauge, use a linked arte to go into Over Limit! While in Over Limit, your AC number will not drop and enemy attacks do no stagger you. What's more, you can use as many linked artes as you want!"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Tales of Xillia characters}}

Two millennia ago, humans developed spyrix, a power source which absorbs spirits to supply power. In response, the spirit [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Maxwell|Maxwell]] gathered humans, who share a symbiotic relationship with spirits, onto an isolated land protected by a barrier; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios. As spirits are needed to sustain nature, Maxwell waits for the day all humans on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Maxwell:''' Two millennia ago, spyrix appeared in the world. Spirits Perished. Nature withered and died. Humans began following the path of annihilation. So I saved all the spirits and animals as I could, and I gathered humans born with the ability to produce mana. It was then I created Rieze Maxia and sealed them all inside it, to provide a haven from the spyrix. The world is an ark that must sail until Elympios falls.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years prior to the present, an Elympion cruise ship becomes trapped in Rieze Maxia, eventually forming a terrorist group known as [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Exodus|Exodus]]. Exodus works with the Elympios military to find a way to destroy the barrier. In the present era, Rieze Maxia is ruled by two countries called Rashugal and Auj Oule. While the two countries appear to live in harmony, they both initiate [[black operations]] in attempts to conquer the other in hopes of uniting Rieze Maxia as a single country.

In the present, medical student [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Jude Mathis|Jude Mathis]] investigates a military research facility in order to search for his missing professor. There he witnesses a spyrix-powered weapon called the Lance of Kresnik absorb his professor. The military prep Jude as the next victim, but he is saved by [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Milla Maxwell|Milla Maxwell]], Maxwell's successor. In response, the military activates the lance which absorbs Milla's spirit companions forcing her and Jude to retreat.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Event List (Secret of the Research Center):''' "She discovers the Lance of Kresnik, but the girl they defeated before has set a trap for them. Milla loses The Four Great Spirits, but thanks to their quick thinking, Milla and Jude are unharmed. Milla and Jude are able to escape the research center"&lt;/ref&gt; Jude and Milla decide to confront Rashugal's king who had endorsed the Lance's creation. During their travel, they are joined by [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Alvin|Alvin]], [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Elize Lutus|Elize Lutus]], [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Rowen J. Illbert|Rowen J. Illbert]] and [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Leia Rolando|Leia Rolando]]. After Rashugal's king is defeated, Exodus obtains and uses the Lance to temporarily disable the barrier protecting Rieze Maxia, allowing Elympios' army to invade.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Event List (Mounting Anxiety and The Mysterious Voice):''' "Through Milla's disclosure that Rieze Maxia is covered by a grand arte known as the schism, our heroes learn that these mysterious soldiers come from a separate world named Elympios."&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted by Auj Oule's king, [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Gaius|Gaius]], the party defeats Exodus at the cost of Milla's life.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Event List (An Intention):''' "Jude tries to stop Milla, who is hell-bent on using the Lance of Kresnik by herself. [...] The Lance of Kresnik repeals the arte. Milla is killed in the collapse of the Zenethra."&lt;/ref&gt;

After mourning her death, Jude leads the party to meet Maxwell and attempts to persuade him to dispel the barrier and save Elympios.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Event List (Freedom of Choose&lt;!-- Game misspells this. --&gt;):''' "The party meets the real Maxwell at last on the Temporal Crossroads, the space that connects the human world to the spirit realm. Jude tells Maxwell hat the schism should be destroyed. At this, Maxwell flies into a rage, believing that Jude is a traitor who would destroy Rieze Maxia."&lt;/ref&gt; Reunited with Milla, who has been reborn as a spirit, they convince Maxwell of their cause. However, Gaius and the spirit named [[List of Tales of Xillia characters#Muzét|Muzét]] seal Maxwell within the Lance of Kresnik, intent on sustaining the barrier until all spyrixs are destroyed; Maxwell sends the party to Elympios before he is completely subdued.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Event List (Freedom of Choose&lt;!-- Game misspells this. --&gt;):''' "Maxwell promises to dispel the schism, but he is prevented by Gaius and Muzét. With the help of Maxwell, our heroes are spirited away to Elympios to recoup and find time to retaliate against Gaius and Muzét."&lt;/ref&gt; There, the party learns about Elympios' dependence on spyrix and an ongoing research on spyrite, a power source harmless to spirits.&lt;ref group="Game"&gt;'''Event List (New Possibilities):''' "Our heroes learn about spyrite from the rescued Balan. It may be possible to control the spyrite and save both worlds."&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed conviction, the party confronts and defeats Gaius and Muzét. Maxwell dispels the barrier and disperses its energy to temporarily power spyrixes until the completion of spyrites. The party returns to their daily lives with Jude joining a spyrite research team, Milla resuming her role as Maxwell, and Gaius uniting Rieze Maxia under his rule.

'''''The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion''''' is a 1915 novel by English novelist [[Ford Madox Ford]].  It is set just before [[World War I]] and chronicles the tragedy of Edward Ashburnham, the soldier to whom the title refers, and his own seemingly perfect marriage and that of two American friends.  The novel is told using a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]] in non-chronological order, a literary technique that formed part of Ford's pioneering view of literary impressionism. Ford employs the device of the [[unreliable narrator]]&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Kenneth and William Baker, eds. ''The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion.'' Broadview Press, 2003.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISGzVIjrHmIC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=ford+madox+ford+good+soldier+unreliable+narrator&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uQ5Oj6a3-0&amp;sig=DhgM5wqnVE0OgIt5L-flHOWvfm0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eEBTSvWiK-qvtwe0zeWsCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2]&lt;/ref&gt; to great effect as the main character gradually reveals a version of events that is quite different from what the introduction leads the reader to believe. The novel was loosely based on two incidents of adultery and on Ford's messy personal life.

The novel's original title was ''The Saddest Story'', but after the onset of World War I, the publishers asked Ford for a new title. Ford suggested (sarcastically) ''The Good Soldier'', and the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Madox Ford |authorlink=Ford Madox Ford |title=''The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion'' |editors=Kenneth Womack and William Baker |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview Press |location=New York |ISBN=1-55111-381-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''The Good Soldier'' 30th on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]]. In 2015, the [[BBC]] ranked ''The Good Soldier'' 13th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ciabattari|first1=Jane|title=The 100 greatest British novels|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20151204-the-100-greatest-british-novels|accessdate=11 December 2015|publisher=BBC|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
{{Wikisource}}
''The Good Soldier'' is narrated by the character John Dowell, half of one of the couples whose dissolving relationships form the subject of the novel. Dowell tells the story of those dissolutions and the deaths of three characters and the madness of a fourth, in a rambling, non-chronological fashion. As an unreliable narrator, the reader can consider whether they believe Dowell and his description of how the events unfolded, including his own role in the "saddest story ever told".

===Events as narrated===
The novel opens with the famous line, "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." Dowell explains that, for nine years, he, his wife Florence, and their friends Captain Edward Ashburnham (the "good soldier" of the book's title) and his wife Leonora had an ostensibly normal friendship while Edward and Florence sought treatment for their heart ailments at a spa in [[Bad Nauheim|Nauheim]], Germany.

As it turns out, nothing in the relationships or in the characters is as it first seems. Florence's heart ailment is a fiction she perpetrated on John to ensure that he did not seek intimacy from her as it would seemingly be too stressful for her heart, and to keep him out of her bedroom at night so that she could continue her affair with a French artist named Jimmy. Edward and Leonora have an imbalanced marriage broken by his constant infidelities (both of body and heart) and Leonora's attempts to control Edward's affairs (both financial and romantic). Dowell is an innocent and is coming to realise how much he has been fooled, as Florence and Edward had an affair under his nose for nine years without John knowing until Florence was dead.

Dowell tells the story of Edward and Leonora's relationship, which appears normal to others but which is a power struggle that Leonora wins. Dowell narrates several of Edward's affairs and peccadilloes, including his possibly innocent attempt to comfort a crying servant on a train; his affair with the married Maisie Maidan, the one character in the book whose heart problem was unquestionably real, and his bizarre tryst in [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Antibes]] with a kept woman known as La Dolciquita. Edward's philandering ends up costing them a fortune in bribes, blackmail and gifts for his lovers, leading Leonora to take control of Edward's financial affairs. She gradually gets him out of debt.

Florence's affair with Edward leads her to commit suicide when she realises both that Edward is falling in love with his and Leonora's young ward, Nancy Rufford, and that Dowell has found out about her affair with Jimmy. Florence sees Edward and Nancy in an intimate conversation and rushes back to the resort, where she sees John talking to a man she used to know (and who knows of her affair with Jimmy). Assuming that her relationship with Edward and her marriage to John are over, Florence takes [[prussic acid]]—which she has carried for years in a vial that John thought held her heart medicine—and dies.

Edward's last affair is his most scandalous, as he becomes infatuated with Nancy. Nancy came to live with them after leaving a convent where her parents had sent her; her mother was a violent alcoholic, and her father (it is later suggested that this man may not be Nancy's biological father) may have abused her. Edward, tearing himself apart because he does not want to spoil Nancy's innocence, arranges to have her sent to India to live with her father, even though this frightens her terribly.  Once Leonora knows that Edward intends to keep his passion for Nancy chaste, but only wants Nancy to continue to love him from afar, she torments him by making this wish impossible. She pretends to offer to divorce him so he can marry Nancy, but informs Nancy of his sordid sexual history, destroying Nancy's innocent love for him.  After Nancy's departure, Edward receives a telegram from her  that reads, "Safe [[Brindisi]]. Having a rattling good time. Nancy." He asks Dowell to take the telegram to his wife, pulls out his pen knife, says that it's time he had some rest and slits his own throat. When Nancy reaches [[Aden]] and sees the obituary in the paper, she becomes [[catatonia|catatonic]].

The novel's last section has Dowell writing from Edward's old estate in England, where he takes care of Nancy, whom he cannot marry because of her mental illness. Nancy is only capable of repeating two things—a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "I believe in an omnipotent God" and the word "shuttlecocks." Dowell states that the story is sad because no one got what they wanted. Leonora wanted Edward but lost him and ended in marrying the normal (but dull) Rodney Bayham. Edward wanted Nancy but gave her up, then lost her. Dowell wanted a wife but ended up a nurse to two women.

Dowell ends up generally unsure about where to lay the blame but expressing sympathy for Edward, because he believes himself similar to Edward in nature. The fact is he has been disengaged, a voyeur. While the other characters are flawed, he has never participated in life and is revealed as less than the foolish innocent he represents himself as when he walks way leaving Edward to slit his throat with a very small pen knife.

The novel has potential narrative inconsistencies that suggest different, hidden plot elements. For example, Dowell marries an heiress who ostensibly has a bad heart. He states repeatedly that he has no need or interest in her money—one might argue that he protests his lack of interest rather too much. Florence eventually dies, stated by Dowell to be suicide. If readers suspend their trust in the narrator, some may be left with the impression that the narrator is obfuscating, happy his wife dies and not doing anything to prevent it; just as he does little throughout the entire book. Thus, behind the more or less explicit narrative lurks a possible counter-narrative in which Dowell is something of a sociopath, caring for no one but himself, an observer of others who are living more fully while never actively engaging very intensely in life himself, and indeed, perhaps a voyeur relishing the demise of others. This would be the story of a manipulative man trying to elicit the sympathy of the audience he speaks/writes to, which must decide whether he is a deluded victim or a heartless manipulator of the reader's emotions.

Florence supposedly poisons herself in a possibly painful manner, and Edward supposedly cuts his own throat, but as always in this novel, we only have Dowell's word for it, and he epitomises the "unreliable narrator." The reader must decide just how much of the truth Dowell reveals. Some commentators have even suggested that Dowell, who presents himself as considered by all to be passive, murders both Florence and Edward. In this view the entire story is his justification for doing so without his admitting his guilt.

==Major characters==

'''John Dowell:''' The narrator, husband to Florence. Dowell is an American [[Quakers|Quaker]], either a gullible and passionless man who cannot read the emotions of the people around him or a master manipulator who plays the victim.

'''Florence Dowell:''' John Dowell's wife and a scheming, manipulative, unfaithful woman who uses Dowell for his money while pursuing her affairs on the side. She fakes a heart ailment to get what she wants out of her husband and has a lengthy affair with Edward Ashburnham.

'''Edward Ashburnham:''' Friend of the Dowells and husband of Leonora. Ashburnham is a hopeless romantic who keeps falling in love with the women he meets; he is at Nauheim for the treatment of a heart problem, but the ailment is not real, he used it as an excuse to follow a female heart patient to Nauheim. He is Dowell's opposite, a virile, physical, passionate man.

'''Leonora Ashburnham:''' Edward's wife by a marriage that was more or less arranged by their fathers. Leonora comes to resent Edward's [[promiscuity|philandering]] as much for its effect on her life as on her marriage and asserts more and more control over Edward until he dies.

'''Nancy Rufford:''' The young ward of the Ashburnhams; Edward falls in love with Nancy after he tires of Florence. Eventually, Edward arranges for Nancy to be sent to India to live with her father, but she goes mad en route when she learns of Edward's death.

'''La Dolciquita:''' A Spanish dancer (The Grand Duke's mistress) who is Edward's first sexual affair. Although he believes himself to be romantically attached to her, he quickly becomes disillusioned by her thirst for his money. 

'''Maisie Maidan:'''  A young, pretty, married woman with whom Edward fell in love. Leonora pays for her treatment for a weak heart at Nauheim, knowing that Edward would follow her there. Maisie's heart gives way after she hears Florence and Edward talking about her disparagingly and she dies.

== Character analysis ==
How well can we judge the characterisations the novel when Dowell was such an unreliable narrator? A question to consider is whether he presented himself in a true light, or manipulated his description of events to prevent the reader from discovering his true character. However&lt;blockquote&gt;"by the end of the novel Dowell has tested the limits of rational explanation. He has interpreted character by religion, by nationality, by gender, and by the calendar…Dowell's disillusionment follows the arc of modernism. He begins with presuppositions typical of much Victorian characterization: the individual conditioned by circumstance, composed of intelligible motives, susceptible to moral analysis-the justified self. Then, confronted with the singularity of desire, his 'generalizations' totter and fall."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levenson|first=Michael|year=1984|title=Character in The Good Soldier|journal=Twentieth Century Literature|volume=30|pages=373–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dowell admits that his assumptions and characterisations of people in his life may be flawed. Whether that is because of guilt, or an attempt to reshape history in his favour, there is no clear answer.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted into the television film of [[The Good Soldier (1981 film)|the same title]] by [[Granada Television]] in 1981. It starred [[Jeremy Brett]], [[Vickery Turner]], [[Robin Ellis]] and [[Susan Fleetwood]]. It was directed by [[Kevin Billington]] and written by [[Julian Mitchell]]. In the US it aired as part of the ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' series.

The novel was adapted as a [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Book at Bedtime]] by [[Ross Kemp]] in 2008, read by [[Toby Stephens]] and produced by [[Kirsty Williams (drama)|Kirsty Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009twgj BBC – Book at Bedtime – ''The Good Soldier'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d1fff9f8a1c6432994b3f62ae57bd696 BBC Genome Project – Book at Bedtime – ''The Good Soldier'']&lt;!-- This page has somewhat more info that previous link, including identity of author of adaptation ("abridged by")--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Immortal''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television series]], starring [[Christopher George]] as a man whose blood chemistry and resistance to almost all diseases (including old age) makes him both almost immortal and a target of several wealthy men who would basically use him as a personal blood bank, aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 24, 1970 to January 14, 1971. The series is based on a pilot film of the same name, which aired on September 30, 1969 as an [[ABC Movie of the Week]]. The pilot is based on the science fiction novel ''[[The Immortals (Gunn novel)|The Immortals]]'', by [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]]. The series music was composed by [[Dominic Frontiere]], who is primarily known for scoring the sci-fi anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Although ''The Immortal'' was canceled at midseason, [[episode]]s were [[rerun]] by ABC in the summer of 1971. It was later rerun on the [[Armed Forces Network]] in Europe in the 1980s and on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] in the 1990s.

==Opening narration==
''This man has a singular advantage over other men. Ben Richards is immune to every known disease, including old age. Periodic transfusions of his blood can give other men a second, a third lifetime, perhaps more.''
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Voice #1:''' Find Ben Richards!&lt;br /&gt;'''Voice #2:''' The effects of the transfusion are only temporary. I must therefore control Ben Richards' life permanently.&lt;br /&gt;'''Voice #3:''' He's the most valuable man in the world, but he's no good to me dead.&lt;br /&gt;'''Voice #4:''' His brother may have the same kind of blood. We've got to find him before Richards does!&lt;br /&gt;'''Voice #5:''' If you had million dollar blood, where would you hide?&lt;br /&gt;'''Ben Richards:''' I didn't ask for this. I was a test driver. I liked the job. One day, the doctor told me I had some kind of...special blood. I don't understand it, but I know this: everything they're offering...I don't want. I gotta live free!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Ben Richards will live longer than anyone has ever lived, but a transfusion to the wrong man could make him a prisoner for all time. And so he runs from the hunters, the human hounds who would cage him.''

==Series overview==
Ben Richards is a test car driver for a large corporation owned by billionaire Jordan Braddock. He is 42 years old, but looks young enough to pass for 25—and he has never been sick a day in his life. Ben's life changes when he donates a pint of blood. When Braddock, who is dying, is given a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] of his donated blood, and is brought back from the brink of death, Ben's physician, Dr. Matthew Pearce, determines that his O-negative blood contains all known antibodies and immunities. This gives Ben immunity to every known disease and an estimated lifespan five to ten times that of other humans, making him, in the doctor's words, "virtually [[Immortality|immortal]]". The billionaire decides that he has to control Richards' life so he can access his life-saving blood.

When Richards rejects all of Braddock's offers to remain with him, the billionaire has him imprisoned, but he ultimately escapes. Richards tells his fiancé Sylvia Cartwright that they can never marry because she would also be imprisoned by Braddock (in the episode "Sylvia" Richards puts himself in danger to visit Cartwright at her wedding to another man). Richards is now on the run because when Braddock dies (shown in the flashback episode "To The Gods Alone" which resolved plot points between the pilot and the series), one of his former employees, Fletcher (who did not appear in the pilot), is hired by another billionaire, Arthur Maitland, who also wants access to Richards' blood.

The series' dramatic tension is based on the idea that Richards would probably never lose his life if he were to live quietly, since he would never succumb to any known diseases. But his flight from Fletcher puts his life at great risk, constantly engaging in dangerous efforts to avoid capture, and his "immortal" blood did not make him immune to losing his life from [[Physical trauma|trauma]].

The series primarily focuses on Richards' journeys and the people he meets while trying to avoid Fletcher. A secondary plot involved Richards' search for a brother he has never known, with the implication that that brother may share his gift and thus be at risk from unscrupulous billionaires as well. Ben Richards is imprisoned by a young billionaire, Simon Brent, in an episode titled "The Queen's Gambit." In the episode "Man On A Punched Card" Maitland hires computer programmer Terry Kerwin to track and predict Richards' movements using a mainframe computer. Kerwin was played by Christopher George's real-life wife [[Lynda Day George]], who would co-star on another Paramount TV series ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' from 1971 to 1973.

The plotline of ''The Immortal'' is quite different from that of the book on which it is based (the protagonist of the book was a vagrant, not a test driver, who discovers his immortality when he sells his blood). Instead, ''The Immortal'' bears more than a superficial resemblance to the then-recent, very popular TV series, ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which still aired in syndicated reruns.  That series had ended its four-season run three years before''The Immortal'' began. It is also the mirror of the series ''[[Run for Your Life (TV series)|Run for Your Life]]'' about a man suffering from a terminal disease who wants to experience everything because he is going to die soon, while Richards has to run because he will live virtually forever. ''The Immortal'' was cancelled before a finale episode was filmed.

'''''The Ripping Friends: The World's Most Manly Men!''''' (also known as '''''The Ripping Friends''''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] animated television series, created by [[John Kricfalusi]], who was well known for creating ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show premiered September 22, 2001 on [[Fox Kids]], but was cancelled  in September 2002. [[Adult Swim]] later picked up the show. The series occasionally airs in Canada on [[Teletoon]]. The series also aired briefly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on the [[CNX (TV channel)|CNX channel]] and on [[ABC Television|ABC]] in Australia. The show was rated TV-Y7 on [[Fox Kids]] and TV-PG on [[Adult Swim|[adult swim]]] in the United States, and C8 to 14+ on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.

==History==
Kricfalusi and his long-time partner [[Jim Smith (animator)|Jim Smith]] created the ''Ripping Friends'' before they created the similar superhero [[Powdered Toast Man]] for ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]''. After Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi from ''The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show'' in September 1992, he had plans to make a feature film starring the world's "manliest men".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abc.net.au/fly/tvfreak/feature/johnk_1.htm Ripping Friends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804224604/http://www.abc.net.au/fly/tvfreak/feature/johnk_1.htm |date=2011-08-04 }}", ''[[ABC (Australia)|ABC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature film plan was scrapped, but the characters were used in ''The Ripping Friends''. Also, as early as a 1987 story session for the ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'', Kricfalusi had proposed using a wad of gum as a character, an idea which was employed to create the first villain for the new series, the Indigestible Wad.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZzjh1PgIbs Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures Story meeting]", [[YouTube]] clip of an episode of [[The MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ripping Friends'' lasted for thirteen episodes.

==Description==
The show centred on a group of four [[superhuman]] brothers who attempt to fight crime from their base, RIPCOT (the Really Impressive Prototype City Of (Next) Tuesday): '''Crag''', '''Rip''', '''Slab''', and '''Chunk''', Crag being the leader. Friends of the four include [[Jimmy The Idiot Boy]], a mentally-challenged drooling child, and their foster mother He-Mom (the name speaks for itself). The villains range from the Indigestible Wad (a wad of [[chewing gum|gum]] who sucks moisture out of people), to Flathead (an [[invertebrate]] in search of a [[vertebral column|spine]]), to their own underpants.

Each episode was usually tagged with a short episode which Kricfalusi says was composed of "left overs".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2006/07/ripping-friends-satire.html Ripping Friends Satire]", ''All Kinds of Stuff'' at [[Blogspot]]&lt;/ref&gt; These segments were called "Rip Along with the Ripping Friends" and usually portrayed the Ripping Friends solving the problems of fans. These included: addressing the fact that hot dogs come in packs of 12 and the buns in packs of 8; "ripping" the man who creates insane video game controllers and the man who writes the instructions for them; and finding out why toys no longer come in cereal boxes, among others. In each segment viewers (referred to as "kids") are asked to "rip along" with the action by ripping pieces of paper up in front of the television when coaxed to.

'''Turkification''', or '''Turkicization''' ({{lang-tr|Türkleştirme}}), is a cultural shift whereby populations or states adopted a historical [[Turkic people|Turkic]] culture, such as in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As the [[Turkic states]] developed and grew, there were many instances of this cultural shift.

Diverse people were effected by Turkification including [[Anatolia]]n, [[Balkan]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] and [[Middle Eastern]] peoples from different [[ethnic origin]]s, such as [[Albanians]], [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Slavs]],  [[Kurdish People|Kurds]] living in Anatolia, as well as [[Laz people|Lazs]] from all the regions of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge history of Islam"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lambton|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Bernard |title=The Cambridge history of Islam |date=1977 |publisher=Cambridge Univ.

== Etymology ==
Prior to the 20th century the region underwent [[Ottomanization]]. These terms started being used interchangeably after the rise of [[Turkish nationalism]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-1-5261-0334-5 |last=Göl |first=Ayla |title=Turkey facing east: Islam, modernity and foreign policy |date=2015-11-01 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pb0SDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used in the [[Greek language]] since the 1300s or late-Byzantine era as "εκτουρκισμός", or "τούρκεμα". It literally means "becoming Turk". Apart from persons, it may refer also to cities that were conquered by Turks or churches that were converted to mosques. It is more frequently used in the form of the verb "τουρκεύω" (''turkify'', ''become Muslim or Turk'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=00NDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA408&amp;dq=%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%89#v=onepage&amp;q=%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%89&amp;f=false |title=Skarlatos D.

By 750 the Turkification of [[Kashgar]] by the [[Qarluq Turks]] was underway.

=== Arrival of Turks in Anatolia ===
{{Main|Turkic migration}}
[[File:Janissary Recruitment in the Balkans-Suleymanname.jpg|thumb|250px|"Devshirme" (book illustration from [[Topkapı Palace Museum]])]]
Anatolia was home to many different peoples in ancient times who were either natives or settlers and invaders. These different people included the Armenians, [[Anatolian peoples]], [[Persia]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raditsa|first=Leo|chapter=Iranians in Asia Minor|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 3 (1): The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983|pages=100–115|isbn=978-1139054942|ref=harv| editor-given1 = Ehsan | editor-surname1 = Yarshater | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurrians]], Greeks, [[Cimmerians]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Colchian]]s, [[Iberians]],  [[Arameans]], Assyrians, [[Corduene]]s, and scores of others. The presence of many Greeks, and the process of [[Hellenization]], gradually caused many of these peoples to abandon their own languages in favor of Greek, especially in cities and along the western and southern coasts, a process reinforced by [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]]. Nevertheless, in the north and east, especially in rural areas, many of the native languages continued to survive, including both many extinct and a few extant languages such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian Aramaic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Stephen. 1993. ''Anatolia: land, men and gods in Asia Minor. Vol. 1, The Celts, and the impact of Roman rule.'' Clarendon Press. pp.172–176.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine]] authorities routinely conducted large-scale population transfers in an effort to impose religious uniformity and the Greek language. After the subordination of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in 1018, for instance, much of its army was resettled in [[Eastern Anatolia]]. The Byzantines were particularly keen to assimilate the large Armenian population. To that end, in the eleventh century, the Armenian nobility were removed from their lands and resettled throughout western Anatolia. An unintended consequence of this resettlement was the loss of local military leadership along the eastern frontier, opening the path for the inroads of Turkish invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=177624 |doi=10.1017/S0010417500012093 |title=The Transfer of Population as a Policy in the Byzantine Empire |year=2009 |last1=Charanis |first1=Peter |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=140–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the eleventh century, war with Turks led to the deaths of many in the native population, while others were enslaved and removed.&lt;ref&gt;(Vryonis 1971: 172)&lt;/ref&gt; As areas became depopulated, Turkic nomads moved in with their herds.&lt;ref&gt;(Vryonis 1971: 184–194)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Number of Pastoralists of Turkic origin in Anatolia ====

The number of nomads of Turkic origin that migrated to Anatolia is a matter of discussion. According to [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]], there were 200,000 Turkmen tents in [[Denizli]] and its surrounding areas, 30,000 in [[Bolu]] and its environment, and about 100,000 in [[Kastamonu]] and its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=NnGvHLvUYEoC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=200.000+Turkmen+tents&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JzYv9tDVMA&amp;sig=n1xizk3jyzFHQZkEU58To47lS7A&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU89iX3sLcAhWbbysKHUxtCoUQ6AEwBnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=boli&amp;f=false |title= Peter Thonemann, The Maeander Valley: A Historical Geography from Antiquity to Byzantium, p. 7|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=6xsuDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34&amp;lpg=PT34&amp;dq=30,000+turkmen+tents+in+bolu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zF3RJd1HDT&amp;sig=6-kcZWElSd4ZUS4sXP6pVTc-K6k&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiY_KLL3sLcAhXGhywKHXo2CeEQ6AEwAHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=30%2C000%20turkmen%20tents%20in%20bolu&amp;f=false |title=Rudi Paul Lindner, Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia|accessdate=2008-05-15|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Latin source at the end of the 12th century there were 100,000 nomadic tents in the regions of [[Denizli]] and [[Isparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to Ottoman tax archives, in modern-day Anatolia, in [[Anatolia Eyalet]], [[Karaman Eyalet]], [[Dulkadir Eyalet]] and [[Rûm Eyalet]] provinces there were about 872,610 households in 1520s and 1530s; 160,564 of those households were nomadic, and the remainder were sedentary. Of four provinces, [[Anatolia Eyalet|province of Anatolia]] had the largest nomadic population with 77,268 households. (note: province of Anatolia does not include entire Anatolia, it includes Western Anatolia and some parts of Northwestern Anatolia only) Between 1570 and 1580, 220,217 households of the total 1,360,474 households in the four provinces were nomadic which means, at least 20% of Anatolia was still nomadic in the 16th century. The province of [[Anatolia Eyalet|Anatolia]], which had the largest nomadic population with 77,268, saw an increase in its nomadic population. 116,219 households in those years in [[Anatolia Eyalet|province of Anatolia]] were nomadic. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== Devşirme ====
{{Main|Devşirme}}

'''Devşirme'''{{Cref2|a}} (literally "collecting" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), also known as the ''blood tax'', was chiefly the annual practice by which the Ottoman Empire sent military to press second or third sons of their Christian subjects ([[Rum millet]]) in the villages of the Balkans into military training as janissaries.&lt;ref name="Anderson1979"&gt;{{cite book |author=Perry Anderson |title=Lineages of the Absolutist State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7Wz4b4JTC8C&amp;pg=PA366 |year=1979 |publisher=Verso |isbn=978-0-86091-710-6 |pages=366–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then converted to [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Ed. Cyril Glassé, (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008), 129.&lt;/ref&gt; with the primary objective of selecting and training the ablest children for the military or civil service of the Empire, notably into the [[Janissaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Basgoz, I. &amp; Wilson, H. E. (1989), The educational tradition of the Ottoman Empire and the development of the Turkish educational system of the republican era. Turkish Review 3(16), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Started by [[Murad I]] as a means to counteract the growing power of the Turkish nobility, the practice itself violated Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alexander Mikaberidze]] |title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia &amp;#91;2 volumes&amp;#93;: A Historical Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C&amp;pg=PA273 |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-337-8 |pages=273– |quote=This effectively enslaved some of the sultan's own non-Islamic subjects and was therefore illegal under Islamic law, which stipulated that conquered non-Muslims should be demilitarized and protected}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet by 1648, the practice was slowly drawing to an end. An attempt to re-institute it in 1703 was resisted by its Ottoman members who coveted its military and civilian posts. Finally in the early part of [[Ahmet III]]'s reign, the practice of [[devshirme]] was abolished.

=== Late Ottoman era ===

The late Ottoman government sought to create "a core identity with a single Turkish religion, language, history, tradition, culture and set of customs", replacing earlier Ottoman traditions that had not sought to assimilate different religions or ethnic groups.The [[Ottoman Empire]] had an ethnically diverse population that included Turks, Arabs, Albanians, Greeks, Persians, [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]], Armenians, Kurds, [[Zazas]], Circassians, Assyrians, Jews and Laz people. [[Turkish nationalist]]s claimed that only Turks were loyal to the state. Ideological support for Turkification was not widespread in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-10615-9 |last=Tas |first=Latif |title=Legal Pluralism in Action: Dispute Resolution and the Kurdish Peace Committee |date=2016-04-22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuIGDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of its main supporters was sociologist and political activist [[Ziya Gokalp]] who believed that a modern state must become homogeneous in terms of culture, religion, and national identity.&lt;ref name=akcam&gt;Akcam, Taner. ''A Shameful Act''. 2006, page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of national identity was augmented by his belief in the primacy of Turkishness, as a unifying virtue. As part of this belief, it was necessary to purge from the territories of the state those national groups who could threaten the integrity of a modern Turkish nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Bloxham. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TSRkGNoEPFwC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;sig=ACfU3U09_Sjo0a0T4KpiS6QfG-94noUmdg p. 150]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levene&gt;Levene (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkfication sought to loosen ties between the Empire's Turk and ethnically non-Turkish populations through efforts to purify the Turkish language of Arabic influences. In this nationalist vision of Turkish identity, language was supreme and religion relegated to a subordinate role. Arabs responded by asserting the superiority of [[Arabic language]], describing Turkish as a "mongrel" language that had borrowed heavily from the Persian and Arabic languages. Through the policy of Turkification, the Young Turk government suppressed Arabic language. Turkish teachers were hired to replace Arabic teachers at schools.&lt;ref name=suleiman&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-54656-0| last = Suleiman| first = Yasir| title = A War of Words: Language and Conflict in the Middle East| date = 2004-06-10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Neu3q8Vt01sC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who supported Turkification were accused of harming Islam.  [[Rashid Rida]] was an advocate who supported Arabic against Turkish.&lt;ref name=suleiman /&gt; Even before the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908, the Syrian Reformer Tahrir al-Jazairi had convinced [[Midhat Pasha]] to adopt Arabic as the official language of instruction at state schools. The language of instruction was only changed to Turkish in 1885 under Sultan [[Abdulhamid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-317-37126-7| last = Çiçek| first = M. Talha| title = Syria in World War I: Politics, economy, and society| date = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though writers like [[Ernest Dawn]] have noted that the foundations of [[Second Constitutional Era]] "Arabism" predate 1908, the prevailing view still holds that Arab nationalism emerged as a response to the Ottoman Empire's Turkification policies.&lt;ref name=kayali /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-512558-0| editors = John L.

European critics who accused the CUP of depriving non-Turks of their rights through Turkification saw Turk, Ottoman and Muslim as synonymous, and believed Young Turk "Ottomanism" posed a threat to [[Ottoman Christians]]. The British ambassador [[Sir Gerard Lowther, 1st Baronet|Gerard Lowther]] said it was like "pounding non-Turkish elements in a Turkish mortar", while another contemporary European source complained that the CUP plan would reduce "the various races and regions of the empire to one dead level of Turkish uniformity." Rifa'at 'Ali Abou-El-Haj has written that "some Ottoman cultural elements and Islamic elements were abandoned in favor of Turkism, a more potent device based on ethnic identity and dependent on a language based nationalism".&lt;ref name=kayali&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-91757-6 |last=Kayali |first=Hasan |title=Arabs and Young Turks: Ottomanism, Arabism, and Islamism in the Ottoman Empire, 1908-1918 |date=1997-09-03 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NX2fICZGh80C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Young Turk]] government launched a series of initiatives that included forced assimilation. [[Ümit Üngör]] writes that "Muslim Kurds and Sephardi Jews were considered slightly more 'Turkifiable' than others", noting that many of these nationalist era "social engineering" policies perpetuated persecution "with little regard for proclaimed and real loyalties." These policies culminated in [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian genocide]]s.&lt;ref name=ungor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Üngör |first=Uğur Ümit |authorlink=Uğur Ümit Üngör |title=Geographies of Nationalism and Violence: Rethinking Young Turk ‘Social Engineering’ |journal=European Journal of Turkish Studies |year=2008 |issue=7 |url=http://ejts.revues.org/2583 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, the Ottoman government established orphanages throughout the empire which included Armenian, Kurdish and Turkish children. Armenian orphans were given Arabic and Turkish names.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=51}} By October 1918, with the Ottoman army retreating from Lebanon, a Father Sarlout sent the Turkish and Kurdish orphans to Damascus, while keeping the Armenian orphans in Antoura. He began the process of reversing the Turkification process by having the Armenian orphans recall their original names.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=53}} It is believed by various scholars, that at least two million Turks have at least one Armenian grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Demirdjian |first1=Alexis |title=The Armenian Genocide Legacy |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=1137561637 |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1L3tCwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1.5 million Ottoman Greeks remained in the Ottoman Empire after loses of 550,000 during WWI. Almost all, 1,250,000, except for those in Constantinople, had fled before or were forced to go to Greece in 1923 in the population exchanges mandated by the League of Nations after the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).&lt;ref&gt;Peoples on the Move, Pertti Ahonen, page 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The lingual Turkification of Greek-speakers in 19th-century Anatolia is well documented. According to [[Speros Vryonis]] the [[Karamanlides]] are the result of partial Turkification that occurred earlier, during the Ottoman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39065646/Vryonis-Decline-of-Medieval-Hellinism-in-Asia-Minor |title=Vryonis Sp.

== Turkification in Golden Horde ==
{{Expand Russian||Тюркизация#Тюркизация в Сибири и Центральной Азии|date=December 2015}}
{{See also|Turco-Mongol|Turko-Persian tradition|Turkification of Xinjiang}}
A process of turkification of Mongol conquerors and Iranian locals in Central Asia, as Turkic language used both by conquerors and locals as [[lingua franca]].

The Turkic peoples have influenced and assimilated neighboring peoples also elsewhere. Examples include the [[Qaratays]] (a [[Tatar people|Tatarized]] former group of the [[Moksha people]]), the [[Besermyans]] (a partially Tatarized subgroup of the [[Udmurt people]]), and the [[Koibals]] (a [[Khakassians|Khakassized]] former group of the [[Samoyedic peoples]]).

== Imprecise meaning of ''Türk'' ==
During the 19th century, the word ''Türk'' was a derogatory term used to refer to Anatolian villagers; the Ottoman elite identified themselves as [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]], not as Turks.&lt;ref&gt;(Kushner 1997: 219; Meeker 1971: 322)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, as European ideas of nationalism were adopted by the Ottoman elite, and as it became clear that the Turkish-speakers of Anatolia were the most loyal supporters of Ottoman rule, the term ''Türk'' took on a much more positive connotation.&lt;ref&gt;(Kushner 1997: 220-221)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Ottoman times, the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system defined communities on a religious basis, and a residue remains today in that Turkish villagers will commonly consider as Turks only those who profess the [[Sunni]] faith, and they consider Turkish-speaking Jews, Christians, or even [[Alevis]] to be non-Turks.&lt;ref name="Meeker 1971: 322"&gt;(Meeker 1971: 322)&lt;/ref&gt;

The imprecision of the appellation ''Türk'' can also be seen with other ethnic names, such as ''Kürt'', which is often applied by western Anatolians to anyone east of Adana, even those who speak only Turkish.&lt;ref name="Meeker 1971: 322" /&gt; On the other hand, Kurdish-speaking or Arabic-speaking Sunnis of eastern Anatolia are often considered to be Turks.&lt;ref&gt;(Meeker 1971: 323)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the category ''Türk'', like other ethnic categories popularly used in Turkey, does not have a uniform usage. In recent years, centrist Turkish politicians have attempted to redefine this category in a more multicultural way, emphasizing that a ''Türk'' is anyone who is a citizen of the Republic of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;(Kushner 1997: 230)&lt;/ref&gt; Now, article 66 of the [[Turkish Constitution]] defines a "''Turk''" as anyone who is "bound to the Turkish state through the bond of [[citizenship]]".

{{OR section|date=November 2017}}
The region of the [[Anatolia]] represents an extremely important area with respect to ancient population migration and expansion, and the spread of the [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic languages]], as well as the extinction of the local [[Anatolian languages]]. During the late Roman Period, prior to the Turkic conquest, the population of Anatolia had reached an estimated level of approximately 4 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3596052 |title=Late Medieval Balkan and Asia Minor Population |first=Josiah C. |last=Russell |journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient |volume=3 |issue=3 |date=October 1960 |pages=265–74 |doi=10.1163/156852060X00106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=280733 |title=Estimating Population at Ancient Military Sites: The Use of Historical and Contemporary Analogy |first1=P.

In 2014, however, the largest autosomal study on Turkish genetics (on 16 individuals) concluded the weight of East Asian (presumably Central Asian) migration legacy of the Turkish people is estimated at 21.7%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The authors conclude on the basis of previous studies that "South Asian contribution to Turkey's population was significantly higher than East/Central Asian contributions, suggesting that the genetic variation of medieval Central Asian populations may be more closely related to South Asian populations, or that there was continued low level migration from South Asia into Anatolia." They note that these weights are not direct estimates of the migration rates as the original donor populations are not known, and the exact kinship between current East Asians and the medieval [[Oghuz Turks]] is uncertain. For instance, genetic pools of Central Asian Turkic peoples is particularly diverse and modern Oghuz [[Turkmens]] living in Central Asia are with higher West Eurasian genetic component than East Eurasian.&lt;ref&gt;The mtDNA composition of Uzbekistan: a microcosm of Central Asian patterns {{doi|10.1007/s00414-009-0406-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=large&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0076748.g003 |title=Map |website=journals.plos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0076748 |title=Afghan Hindu Kush: Where Eurasian Sub-Continent Gene Flows Converge |first1=Julie Di |last1=Cristofaro |first2=Erwan |last2=Pennarun |first3=Stéphane |last3=Mazières |first4=Natalie M. |last4=Myres |first5=Alice A. |last5=Lin |first6=Shah Aga |last6=Temori |first7=Mait |last7=Metspalu |first8=Ene |last8=Metspalu |first9=Michael |last9=Witzel|first10=Roy J.|last10=King |first11=Peter A. |last11=Underhill |first12=Richard |last12=Villems |first13=Jacques |last13=Chiaroni |date=18 October 2013 |publisher= |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=e76748 |via=PLoS Journals |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0076748 |pmid=24204668 |pmc=3799995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings are consistent with a [[Scientific modelling|model]] in which the [[Turkic languages]], originating in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]]-[[Sayan Mountains|Sayan]] region of [[Central Asia]] and northwestern [[Mongolia]], were imposed on the [[indigenous peoples]] with genetic admixture, shows both ethnic mixing and [[Language shift|linguistic replacement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3056514 |title=The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=98 |issue=18 |date=August 2001 |pages=10244–9 |doi=10.1073/pnas.171305098 |last1=Wells |first1=R.

A 2011 [[haplogroup]] study concluded "that the profile of Anatolian populations today is the product not of mass westward migrations of Central Asians and Siberians, or of small-scale migrations into an emptied subcontinent, but instead of small-scale, irregular punctuated migration events that engendered large-scale shifts in language and culture among the diverse" indigenous inhabitants (p.&amp;nbsp;32).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2753/AAE1061-1959500101 |title=Who Are the Anatolian Turks? |year=2011 |last1=Schurr |first1=Theodore G. |last2=Yardumian |first2=Aram |journal=Anthropology &amp; Archeology of Eurasia |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=6–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[haplogroup]] study in 2017 concluded that "the modern Turks are a hybrid population, comprising the original Anatolian stock, Turkic people, as well as other ethnicities from regions of the former Ottoman Empire".&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"/&gt; Results of a 2012 genetic study by Hodoğlugil and Mahley showed the admixture of Turkish people, which were primarily European (French, Italian, Sardinian) and Middle Eastern (Druze, Palestinian), with a Central Asian (Uyghur, Kyrgyz, Hazara) (9%-15%) component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2011.00701.x |title=Turkish Population Structure and Genetic Ancestry Reveal Relatedness among Eurasian Populations |year=2012 |last1=Hodoğlugil |first1=Uğur |last2=Mahley |first2=Robert W. |journal=Annals of Human Genetics |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=128–41 |pmid=22332727 |pmc=4904778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation's mission is to cultivate a general public informed by science, inspired by its wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future.

== History ==
The festival was founded and created by [[Brian Greene]], professor of mathematics and physics at [[Columbia University]] and author of several science books (including ''[[The Elegant Universe]]'', and ''[[The Hidden Reality]]''); and [[Tracy Day]], a four-time National News [[Emmy Award]]-winning journalist, who has produced live and documentary programming for the nation's preeminent television news divisions. Greene now serves as chairman of the World Science Foundation, and Day is chief executive of the World Science Festival.&lt;ref name="Musser"&gt;Cf. {{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The festival's events are rooted in science, but also conform to the production standards of professional television and live theatrical events. The founding benefactors were the [[Simons Foundation]], the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], and the [[John Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/sponsors/].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inaugural festival ==
{{Main|World Science Festival, 2008}}
The inaugural festival took place from May 28 to June 1, 2008, at 22 venues throughout New York City. Hailed a "new cultural institution" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', the festival included 46 events, a street fair and, on its first day, the one-day World Science Summit at [[Columbia University]]. Of the 150+ participants, speakers and performers were 11 Nobel Prize winners. Venues included the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]], and [[New York University]]'s [[Skirball Center for the Performing Arts]]. Total audience numbered more than 120,000.&lt;ref&gt;– Venues and event numbers: {{Cite web

'''Yene''' are small wooden statues found throughout the [[Leti Islands]], in the southeastern part of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku archipelago]] in eastern [[Indonesia]]. Yene are believed to act as a vessel where the ancestor spirit would reside temporarily before departing to the land of the dead. 

==Form==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten voorouderbeeld TMnr 1468-167a.jpg|thumb|left|This yene, seated on a western-style chair, may have indicated that the owner had converted to Christianity after a contact with the Westerners.]]Three kinds of statues are found throughout the [[Maluku Islands]]: Statues of ancestors; statues of progenitors (linked to the origin and foundation of the descendants), and statues of the cosmos (heaven and earth) represented as male and female, respectively.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}}

In the [[Leti Islands]], yene are small-sized statues of the ancestors, usually depicted seated. The statues represent deceased family members.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/316114 |title=Ancestor Figure (Yene) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 8, 2017 |website=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=November 8, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posture of the yene indicates the gender of the deceased. Male ancestors are shown in a [[squatting position]], while females are shown with crossed-legs.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Yene statues have been recorded since the 17th century, with some showing signs of contact with the west. Some male ancestors statues show a squatting figure on top of a western-style chair, which may indicate that the deceased has been converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}}

At places where a [[Caste|caste system]] existed, leti statues also indicate the rank of the deceased. Members of the highest caste are represented with jewelry, such as earrings and headgear that look like bishops' mitres. Lower caste yene are usually represented without jewelry or complex ornaments. Feather ornamentation indicates the deceased was a warrior.

==Function==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten voorouderbeeld TMnr A-1033.jpg|thumb|right|A yene of a female ancestor, depicted with the legs crossed.]]
The yene functioned as a sort of temporary vessel for the spirit of the deceased before they depart to the land of the dead. The Leti Islanders believed that a human has both a physical body and an abstract "shadow", somewhat comparable to a soul or mind. The "shadow" is believed to persist even after death. After death, his or her "shadow" wanders for a few days in the village before it leaves for the land of the dead, which is said to be situated on an uninhabited island, such as a reef or a cape, not far from the world of the living. 

The yene sculpture allowed the relatives of the departed to communicate with the departed spirit, either for consultation on important matters or to be given offerings during annual ceremonies.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}} The Leti society are strongly dependent on the ancestor spirits for many things, such as fertility. Generally the yene statues are offered [[betel|sirih]] and [[areca nut|pinang]]. Sometimes [[palm wine]] is combined with the offering.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}} 

Yene sculptures are arranged in the attic of house of Leti Islanders. The spirits are thought to reach the attic through specially-fitted hatches in the facade.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}}

'''''Yes''''' and '''''no''''', or word pairs with a similar usage, are expressions of [[affirmative and negative|the affirmative and the negative]], respectively, in several languages including [[English language|English]]. Some languages make a distinction between answers to affirmative versus negative questions, thus they may have triplets or quadruplets of words instead. English originally used a four-form system up to and including [[Early Middle English]] but [[Modern English]] has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'. It exists in eye blink communication, Morse Code, sign language, and maybe in color coded flag communication.  

Some languages do not answer [[yes–no question]]s with single words meaning 'yes' or 'no'. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are among several languages that typically employ echo answers (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form) rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though both languages do also have words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'. Other languages have systems named two-form, three-form, and four-form systems, depending on how many words for yes and no they employ. Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems.

The words ''[[wikt:yes#English|yes]]'' and ''[[wikt:no#English|no]]'' are not easily classified into any of the eight conventional [[parts of speech]]. Although sometimes classified as [[interjection]]s, they do not qualify as such, and they are not [[adverb]]s. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right, [[sentence words]], [[word sentences]], or [[pro-sentence]]s, although that category contains more than ''yes'' and ''no'' and not all linguists include them in their lists of sentence words. Sentences consisting solely of one of these two words are classified as [[minor sentence]]s.

The differences among languages, the fact that in different languages the various words for ''yes'' and ''no'' have different parts of speech and different usages, and that some languages lack a 'yes-no' word system, makes idiomatic translation difficult.

== Classification of English grammar ==
Although sometimes classified as [[interjection]]s, these words do not always express emotion {{dubious|date=May 2013}} or act as calls for attention; they are not [[adverb]]s because they do not qualify any verb, adjective, or adverb. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right: sentence words or word sentences.&lt;ref name=Sonnenschein&gt;{{cite book|title=A New English Grammar Based on the Recommendations of the Joint Committee on Grammatical Terminology|author=E. A. Sonnenschein|publisher=READ BOOKS|year=2008|chapter=Sentence words|isbn=978-1-4086-8929-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BloomfieldHockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Language|author1=Leonard Bloomfield  |author2=Charles F. Hockett |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=176–177|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0-226-06067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements Of English Grammar|author=Alfred S. West|chapter=Yes and No. What are we to call the words ''Yes'' and ''No''?|page=173|isbn=978-1-4086-8050-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the position of [[Otto Jespersen]], who states that "'Yes' and 'No' [...] are to all intents and purposes sentences just as much as the most delicately [[balanced sentence]]s ever uttered by [[Demosthenes]] or penned by [[Samuel Johnson]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discourse, Interaction, and Communication|author1=Xabier Arrazola |author2=Kepa Korta |author3=Francis Jeffry  |last-author-amp=yes |page=11|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7923-4952-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georg von der Gabelentz]], [[Henry Sweet]], and [[Philipp Wegener]] have all written on the subject of sentence words. Both Sweet and Wegener include ''yes'' and ''no'' in this category, with Sweet treating them separately from both imperatives and interjections, although Gabelentz does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=200 Years of Syntax|author=Giorgio Graffi|page=121|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|year=2001|isbn=1-58811-052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics Across Historical and Geographical Boundaries|editor1=Dieter Kastovsky |editor2=A. J. Szwedek |editor3=Barbara Płoczińska |editor4=Jacek Fisiak |author=Richard J. Watts|page=166|chapter=Generated or degenerate?|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1986|isbn=978-3-11-010426-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; classifies ''yes'' and ''no'' as [[grammatical particle]]s, in particular ''response particles''. He also notes their relationship to the interjections ''[[wikt:oh#English|oh]]'' and ''[[wikt:ah#English|ah]]'', which is that the interjections can precede ''yes'' and ''no'' but not follow them. ''Oh'' as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms ''oh yes'' and ''oh no'' merely acts as an [[intensifier]]; but ''ah'' in the combined forms ''ah yes'' and ''ah no'' retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement. The forms ''*yes oh'', ''*yes ah'', ''*no oh'', and ''*no ah'' are grammatically ill-formed. Aijmer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Emotion in Dialogic Interaction|editor=Edda Weigand|page=102|authorlink1=Karin Aijmer|author=Karin Aijmer|chapter=Interjections in a Contrastive Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58811-497-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly categorizes the ''yes'' and ''no'' as ''response signals'' or ''reaction signals''.

Ameka classifies these two words in different ways according to context. When used as [[Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channel]] items, he classifies them as interjections; but when they are used as the responses to a [[yes-no question]], he classifies them as formulaic words. The distinction between an interjection and a formula is, in Ameka's view, that the former does not have an addressee (although it may be directed at a person), whereas the latter does. The ''yes'' or ''no'' in response to the question is addressed at the interrogator, whereas ''yes'' or ''no'' used as a back-channel item is a ''feedback usage'', an utterance that is said to oneself. However, Sorjonen criticizes this analysis as lacking empirical work on the other usages of these words, in addition to interjections and feedback uses.&lt;ref name=Sorjonen&gt;{{cite book|title=Responding in Conversation|author=Marja-Leena Sorjonen|page=19|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2001|isbn=978-90-272-5085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomfield and Hockett classify the words, when used to answer yes-no questions, as ''special completive interjections''. They classify sentences comprising solely one of these two words as [[minor sentence]]s.&lt;ref name=BloomfieldHockett /&gt;

Sweet classifies the words in several ways. They are sentence-modifying adverbs, adverbs that act as modifiers to an entire sentence. They are also sentence words, when standing alone. They may, as question responses, also be absolute forms that correspond to what would otherwise be the ''not'' in a negated echo response. For example, a "No." in response to the question "Is he here?" is equivalent to the echo response "He is not here." Sweet observes that there is no correspondence with a simple ''yes'' in the latter situation, although the sentence-word "Certainly." provides an absolute form of an emphatic echo response "He is certainly here." Many other adverbs can also be used as sentence words in this way.&lt;ref name=Sweet&gt;{{cite book|title=A New English Grammar|author=[[Henry Sweet]]|chapter=Adverbs|pages=126–127|year=1900|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn= 1-4021-5375-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ''yes'', ''no'' can also be an adverb of degree, applying to adjectives solely in the comparative (e.g. ''no greater'', ''no sooner'', but not ''no soon'' or ''no soonest''), and an adjective when applied to nouns (e.g. "He is no fool." and Dyer's "No clouds, no vapours intervene.").&lt;ref name=Sweet /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Lines of English Grammar|author1=Henry Kiddle  |author2=Goold Brown |lastauthoramp=yes |page=102|location=New York|publisher=William Wood and Co.|year=1867|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Brown%2C%20Goold%2C%201791-1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammarians of other languages have created further, similar, special classifications for these types of words. Tesnière classifies the French ''oui'' and ''non'' as ''phrasillons logiques'' (along with ''[[wikt:voici#French|voici]]''). Fonagy observes that such a classification may be partly justified for the former two, but suggests that ''pragmatic holophrases'' is more appropriate.&lt;ref name=Fonagy /&gt;

== The Early English four-form system ==
While Modern English has a ''two-form system'' of ''yes'' and ''no'' for affirmatives and negatives, earlier forms of English had a ''four-form system'', comprising the words ''yea'', ''[[wikt:nay#Early Modern English|nay]]'', ''yes'', and ''no''. In essence, ''yes'' and ''no'' were the responses to a question posed in the negative, whereas ''yea'' and ''nay'' were the responses to positively framed questions.

:Will he/she not go? — Yes, he/she will.
:Will he/she not go? — No, he/she will not.
:Will he/she go? — Yea, he/she will.
:Will he/she go? — Nay, he/she will not.

This is exemplified by the following passage from [[Much Ado about Nothing]]:&lt;ref name=Furness&gt;{{cite book|title=Much Ado about Nothing|author=William Shakespeare|editor=Horace Howard Furness|location=Philadelphia|year=1900|publisher=J. B. Lippincott Co.|page=25}} (editorial footnotes)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
'''Claudio:''' Can the world buie such a iewell? [buy such a jewel]
'''Benedick:''' Yea, and a case to put it into, but speake you this with a sad brow?
&lt;/poem&gt;|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]|source=''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'', Act I, Scene I}}

Benedick's answer of ''yea'' is a correct application of the rule, but as observed by W. A. Wright "Shakespeare does not always observe this rule, and even in the earliest times the usage appears not to have been consistent." Furness gives as an example the following, where Hermia's answer should, in following the rule, have been ''yes'':&lt;ref name=Furness /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsh /&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
'''Demetrius:''' Do not you thinke, The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?
'''Hermia:''' Yea, and my Father.
&lt;/poem&gt;|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]|source=''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''&lt;ref name=Furness /&gt;}}

This subtle grammatical feature of Early Modern English is recorded by Sir [[Thomas More]] in his critique of [[William Tyndale]]'s translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English, which was then quoted as an authority by later scholars:&lt;ref name=Furness /&gt;

{{quote|I would not here note by the way that Tyndale here translateth ''no'' for ''nay'', for it is but a trifle and mistaking of the Englishe worde : saving that ye shoulde see that he whych in two so plain Englishe wordes, and so common as in ''naye'' and ''no'' can not tell when he should take the one and when the tother, is not for translating into Englishe a man very mete. For the use of these two wordes in aunswering a question is this. ''No'' aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative. As for ensample if a manne should aske Tindall himselfe: ys an heretike meete to translate Holy Scripture into Englishe ? Lo to thys question if he will aunswere trew Englishe, he must aunswere ''nay'' and not ''no''. But and if the question be asked hym thus lo: is not an heretike mete to translate Holy Scripture into Englishe ? To this question if he will aunswere trewe Englishe, he must aunswere ''no'' and not ''nay''. And a lyke difference is there betwene these two adverbs ''ye'' and ''yes''. For if the question bee framed unto Tindall by the affirmative in thys fashion. If an heretique falsely translate the New Testament into Englishe, to make his false heresyes seem the word of Godde, be his bokes worthy to be burned ? To this questyon asked in thys wyse, yf he will aunswere true Englishe, he must aunswere ''ye'' and not ''yes''. But now if the question be asked him thus lo; by the negative. If an heretike falsely translate the Newe Testament into Englishe to make his false heresyee seme the word of God, be not hys bokes well worthy to be burned ? To thys question in thys fashion framed if he will aunswere trewe Englishe he may not aunswere ''ye'' but he must answere ''yes'', and say yes marry be they, bothe the translation and the translatour, and al that wyll hold wyth them.|sign=[[Thomas More]]|source=''The Confutation of Tyndale's Answer'', pp. 430&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English language|author=[[Robert Gordon Latham]]|page=497|location=London|publisher=Taylor, Walton, and Maberly|year=1850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Answer to Sir Thomas More's Dialogue|author=[[William Tyndale]]|editor=[[Henry Walter (antiquarian)|Henry Walter]]|location=Cambridge|publisher=The University Press|year=1850}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In fact, More's exemplification of the rule actually contradicts his statement of what the rule is. This went unnoticed by scholars such as [[Horne Tooke]], [[Robert Gordon Latham]], and Trench, and was first pointed out by [[George Perkins Marsh]] in his ''Century Dictionary'', where he corrects More's incorrect statement of the first rule, "''No'' aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative.", to read ''nay''. That even More got the rule wrong, even while himself dressing down Tyndale for getting it wrong, is seen by Furness as evidence that the four word system was "too subtle a distinction for practice".

Marsh found no evidence of a four-form system in [[Moesogoths|Mœso-Gothic]], although he reported finding "traces" in [[Old English]]. He observed that in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels,
*positively phrased questions are answered positively with ''[[wikt:gea#Old English|gea]]'' (John 21:15,16, [[King James Version]]: "Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee" etc.)
*and negatively with ''[[wikt:ne#Old English|ne]]'' (Luke 12:51, KJ: "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division"; 13:4,5, KJ: "Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."), ''[[wikt:nese#Old English|nese]]'' (John 21:5 "Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No."; Matthew 13:28,29, KJ: "The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them."), and ''[[wikt:nic#Old English|nic]]'' meaning "not I" (John 18:17, KJ: "Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.");
*while negatively phrased questions are answered positively with ''[[wikt:gyse#Old English|gyse]]'' (Matthew 17:25, KJ: "they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? He saith, Yes.")
*and negatively for example with ''[[wikt:na#Old English|nâ]]'', meaning "no one" (John 8:10,11, "he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord.").&lt;ref name=Marsh&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures on the English Language|author=[[George Perkins Marsh]]|location=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner &amp;amp; Co.|year=1867|pages=578–583|chapter=Affirmative and Negative Particles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsh calls this four-form system of Early Modern English a "needless subtlety". Tooke called it a "ridiculous distinction", with Marsh concluding that Tooke believed Thomas More to have simply made this rule up and observing that Tooke is not alone in his disbelief of More. Marsh, however, points out (having himself analyzed the works of [[John Wycliffe]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Gower]], [[John Skelton]], and [[Robert of Gloucester (historian)|Robert of Gloucester]], and ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' and ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'') that the distinction both existed and was generally and fairly uniformly observed in Early Modern English from the time of Chaucer to the time of Tyndale. But after the time of Tyndale, the four-form system was rapidly replaced by the modern two-form system.&lt;ref name=Marsh /&gt;

== Three-form systems ==
Several languages have a ''three-form system'', with two affirmative words and one negative. In a three-form system, the affirmative response to a positively phrased question is the [[markedness|unmarked]] affirmative, the affirmative response to a negatively phrased question is the [[markedness|marked]] affirmative, and the negative response to both forms of question is the (single) negative. For example, in Norwegian the affirmative answer to "Snakker du norsk?" ("Do you speak Norwegian?") is "Ja", and the affirmative answer to "Snakker du ikke norsk?" ("Do you not speak Norwegian?") is "Jo", while the negative answer to ''both'' questions is "Nei".&lt;ref name=Marsh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Norwegian|author1=Åse-Berit Strandskogen  |author2=Rolf Strandskogen |lastauthoramp=yes |page=146|year=1986|publisher=Oris Forlag|isbn=0-415-10979-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HolmesHinchliffe1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Armstrong&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation, Linguistics, Culture|author=Nigel Armstrong|page=95|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85359-805-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Germany|author=Greg Nees|page=74|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=2000|isbn=978-1-877864-75-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[French language|French]] all have three-form systems. Swedish and Danish have ''[[wikt:ja#Swedish|ja]]'', ''[[wikt:jo#Swedish|jo]]'', and ''[[wikt:nej#Swedish|nej]]''. Norwegian has ''[[wikt:ja|ja]]'', ''[[wikt:jo|jo]]''/''[[wikt:jau|jau]]'', and ''[[wikt:nei|nei]]''. Icelandic has ''[[wikt:já#Icelandic|já]]'', ''[[wikt:jú#Icelandic|jú]]'' and ''[[wikt:nei#Icelandic|nei]]''. Faroese has ''[[wikt:ja#Faroese|ja]]'', ''[[wikt:jú#Faroese|jú]]'' and ''[[wikt:nei#Faroese|nei]]''. Hungarian has ''[[wikt:igen#Hungarian|igen]]'', ''[[wikt:de#Hungarian|de]]'', and ''[[wikt:nem#Hungarian|nem]]''. German has ''[[wikt:ja#German|ja]]'', ''[[wikt:doch#German|doch]]'', and ''[[wikt:nein#German|nein]]''. Dutch has ''[[wikt:ja#Dutch|ja]]'', ''[[wikt:jawel#Dutch|jawel]]'', and ''[[wikt:nee#Dutch|nee]]''. French has ''[[wikt:oui#French|oui]]'', ''[[wikt:si#French|si]]'', and ''[[wikt:non#French|non]]''.

Swedish, and to some extent Danish and Norwegian, also has additional forms ''[[wikt:javisst#Swedish|javisst]]'' and ''[[wikt:jovisst#Swedish|jovisst]]'', analogous to ''ja'' and ''jo'', to indicate a strong affirmative response. Swedish (and Danish slang) also have the forms ''joho'' and ''nehej'', which both indicate stronger response than ''jo'' or ''nej''. ''Jo'' can also be used as an emphatic contradiction of a negative statement.&lt;ref name=HolmesHinchliffe1&gt;{{cite book|title=Swedish|author1=Philip Holmes  |author2=Ian Hinchliffe |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Interjections|page=121|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=978-0-415-16160-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HolmesHinchliffe2&gt;{{cite book|title=Swedish|author1=Philip Holmes  |author2=Ian Hinchliffe |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=428–429|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-27883-6|chapter=Ja, nej, jo, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other languages with four-form systems ==
Like Early Modern English, the [[Romanian language]] has a four-form system. The affirmative and negative responses to positively phrased questions are ''[[wikt:da#Romanian|da]]'' and ''[[wikt:nu#Romanian|nu]]'', respectively. But in responses to negatively phrased questions they are prefixed with ''[[wikt:ba#Romanian|ba]]'' (i.e. ''ba da'' and ''ba nu''). ''nu'' is also used as a negation adverb, infixed between subject and verb. Thus, for example, the affirmative response to the negatively phrased question "N-ai plătit?" ("Didn't you pay?") is "Ba da." ("Yes."—i.e. "I did pay."), and the negative response to a positively phrased question beginning "Se poate să ...?" ("Is it possible to ...?") is "Nu, nu se poate." ("No, it is not possible."—note the use of ''nu'' for both ''no'' and negation of the verb.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Romanian|author=Ramona Gönczöl-Davies|page=135|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-33825-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rumanian|author=Graham Mallinson|chapter=answers to yes-no questions|page=21|isbn=0-7099-3537-4|publisher=Croom Helm Ltd|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clitics Between Syntax and Lexicon|author=Birgit Gerlach|page=60|chapter=The status of Romance clitics between words and affixes|publisher=John Benjamins BV|year=2002|isbn=90-272-2772-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomfield and Hockett observe that not all languages have ''special completive interjections''. [[Finnish language|Finnish]] does not generally answer yes-no questions with either adverbs or interjections but answers them with a repetition of the verb in the question,&lt;ref name="Aveneca_Yes_No systems"&gt;{{cite web |title=Yes/No systems |url=http://aveneca.com/yesno.html |website=Aveneca |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; negating it if the answer is the negative. (This is an [[echo response]].) The answer to "Tuletteko kaupungista?" ("Are you coming from town?") is the verb form itself, "Tulemme." ("We are coming.")

Negative questions are answered similarly. Negative answers are just the negated verb form. The answer to "Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?" ("Do you know Mr Lehto?") is "En tunne" ("I don't know.") or simply "En." ("I don't.").&lt;ref name=BloomfieldHockett /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English-Russian Grammar|author=Carl Philipp Reiff|page=134|chapter=The Adverb and the Gerund|year=1862|location=Paris|publisher=Maisonneuve and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Questions and Questioning|editor=Michel Meyer|author1=Wendy G.

The complex semantics of a simple question|author=Cliff Goddard|format=PDF|editor1=Peter Collins |editor2=Mengistu Amberber |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Finnish also has particle words for "yes": "Kyllä" (formal) and "joo" (very colloquial). A yes-no question can be answered "yes" with either "kyllä" or "joo", which are not conjugated according to the person and plurality of the verb. "Ei", however, is always conjugated and means "no".

Up until the 16th century [[Latvian language|Latvian]] also didn't have a word for "yes" and the common way of responding affirmatively to a question was by repeating the question's verb, just like in Finnish. The modern day "jā" was borrowed from [[Middle High German]] "ja" and first appeared in 16th-century religious texts, especially [[catechism]]s, in answers to questions about faith. At that time such works were usually translated from German by non-Latvians that had learned Latvian as a foreign language. By the 17th century "jā" was being used by some Latvian speakers that lived near the cities, and more frequently when speaking to non-Latvians, but they would revert to agreeing by repeating the question verb when talking among themselves. By the 18th century the use of "jā" was still of low frequency, and in Northern Vidzeme the word was almost non-existent till the 18th and early 19th century. Only in the mid-19th century did "jā" really become usual everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite-book |last=Karulis |first=Konstantīns |title=Latviešu Etimoloģijas Vārdnīca |trans-title=The Etymological dictionary of Latvian |language=Latvian |location=Rīga |publisher=Avots |year=1992 |page= |isbn=9984-700-12-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often said falsely that [[Welsh language|Welsh]] has no words at all for ''yes'' and ''no''. It has ''[[wikt:ie#Welsh|ie]]'' and ''[[wikt:nage#Welsh|nage]]''. However, these are used only in specialized circumstances and are but some of the ''many'' ways in Welsh of saying yes or no. As in Finnish, the main way to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. So the answers to "''{{lang|cy|Ydy Ffred yn dod?}}''" ("Is Ffred coming?") are either "''{{lang|cy|Ydy}}''" ("He is (coming).") or "''{{lang|cy|Nac ydy}}''" ("He is not (coming)"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with ''[[wikt:nag#Welsh|nag]]''. As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned ''yes'' means in response to a negative question. While a ''yes'' response to the question "You don't like strawberries?" is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response ''{{lang|cy|ydw}}'' has no ambiguity. The same would apply for Finnish, where the question would be answered with ''{{lang|fi|en}}'' (I don't). For more information on ''yes'' and ''no'' answers to yes-no questions in Welsh, see Jones, listed in [[#Further reading|further reading]].&lt;ref name=Goddard /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Welsh|author=Gareth King|chapter=Yes/no answers|page=111|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-0-415-12096-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to say "Yes" and "No"|work=A Welsh Course|author=Mark H Nodine|date=2003-06-14|url=http://cs.cf.ac.uk./fun/welsh/Lesson02.html|publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science, [[Cardiff University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Goidelic languages]] ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]) do not have words for "yes" or "no" at all. Instead, an echo response of the main verb used to ask the question is used. Sometimes, one of the words meaning "to be" (Irish ''{{lang|ga|tá}}'' or ''{{lang|ga|is}}'', see [[Irish syntax#The forms meaning "to be"|Irish syntax § The forms meaning "to be"]]; Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|tha}}'' or ''{{lang|gd|is}}'' see [[Scottish Gaelic grammar#verbs|Scottish Gaelic grammar § verbs]]; Manx ''{{lang|gv|ta}}'' or ''{{lang|gv|is}}'') is used. For example, the Irish question "''{{lang|ga|An '''bhfuil''' sé ag teacht?}}''" ("'''Is''' he coming?") may be answered ''"{{lang|ga|Tá}}"'' ("Is") or ''"{{lang|ga|Níl}}"'' ("Is not"). More frequently, another verb will be used. For example, to respond to "''{{lang|ga|Ar '''chuala''' sé?}}''" ("Did he '''hear'''?"), "''{{lang|ga|Chuala}}''" ("Heard") or "''{{lang|ga|Níor chuala}}''" ("Did not hear") are used. Irish people frequently give echo answers in English as well, e.g. "Did you hear?" Answer "I heard/I did". This also happens in the [[Galician language]].

[[Latin language|Latin]] has no single words for ''yes'' and ''no''. Their functions as [[intensifier]]s and interjections are taken up by using the [[vocative case]]. Their functions as word sentence responses to yes-no questions are taken up by ''sentence adverbs'', single adverbs that are sentence modifiers and also used as word sentences. There are several such adverbs classed as [[truth-value]] adverbs—including ''[[wikt:certe#Latin|certe]]'', ''[[wikt:fortasse#Latin|fortasse]]'', ''[[wikt:nimirum#Latin|nimirum]]'', ''[[wikt:plane#Latin|plane]]'', ''[[wikt:vero#Latin|vero]]'', ''[[wikt:etiam#Latin|etiam]]'', ''[[wikt:sane#Latin|sane]]'', ''[[wikt:minime#Latin|minime]]'', and ''[[wikt:videlicet#Latin|videlicet]]''. They express the speaker's/writer's feelings about the truth value of a proposition. They, in conjunction with the negator ''[[wikt:non#Latin|non]]'', are used as responses to yes-no questions.&lt;ref name=BloomfieldHockett /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Latin Grammar|author=Dirk G.

Speakers of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] use echo responses as well.&lt;ref name=Mishra /&gt; In all languages, yes-no questions are often posed in [[A-not-A]] form, and the replies to such questions are [[echo answer]]s that echo either ''A'' or ''not A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cantonese|author1=Stephen Matthews  |author2=Virginia Yip |lastauthoramp=yes |page=311|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=978-0-415-08945-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Languages and Their Status|author=Timothy Shopen|chapter=Dialectal variations|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-8122-1249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mandarin Chinese]], the closest equivalents to ''yes'' and ''no'' are to state "[[wikt:是|是]]" (''shì''; lit. "is") and "[[wikt:不是|不是]]" (''búshì''; lit. "not is").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mandarin Chinese|author=Lexus, Lexus, Lexus|publisher=Rough Guides|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85828-607-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Colloquial Chinese|author1=Bingzheng Tong |author2=Ping-cheng T'ung |author3=David E.

The phrase 不要 (buyào; lit. "(I) do not want") may also be used for the interjection "no".

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] also lacks words for ''yes'' and ''no''. The words "[[wikt:はい|はい]]" (''hai'') and "[[wikt:いいえ|いいえ]]" (''iie'') are mistaken by English speakers for equivalents to ''yes'' and ''no'', but they actually signify agreement or disagreement with the proposition put by the question: "That's right." or "That's not right."&lt;ref name=Mishra&gt;{{cite book|title=Interactive Multimedia in Education and Training|editor=Sanjaya Mishra|page=85|author=Yoshii, Bork, Milne, Katada, &amp;amp; Zhang|chapter=Reaching Students of Many Languages and Cultures|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|year=2004|isbn=978-1-59140-394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese|author=John Hinds|chapter=Words for 'yes', 'no', 'maybe'|page=45|publisher=Routledge|year=1988|isbn=978-0-415-01033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: If asked, "行かないのですか" ("ikanai no desu ka" / "Are you not going?"), answering with the affirmative "はい" would mean "Right, I am ''not'' going"; whereas in English, answering "yes" would be to contradict the negative question. Echo responses are not uncommon in Japanese.

The words for ''yes'' and ''no'' in some languages originate from a process of devaluation and semantic erosion. The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] strong affirmative ''[[wikt:persze#Hungarian|persze]]'' was originally the Latin phrase ''per se intelligitur'' (''it stands to reason''), for example. German ''[[wikt:nein#German|nein]]'' similarly is derived from the [[Old High German]] ''ni ein'', which means ''not a single one''. (In Latin, ''[[wikt:non#Latin|non]]'' similarly devolved from ''[[wikt:noenum#Latin|noenum]]'', which also means ''not one''.) The French ''oui'' was formerly ''[[wikt:oïl#Old French|oïl]]'' (after which [[Langue d'oïl]] is named), which, in turn, came from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''hoc ille'', meaning ''this one'' (''it is'' this one).&lt;ref name=Fonagy&gt;{{cite book|title=Languages Within Language|author=Ivan Fonagy|page=66|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|year=2001|isbn=0-927232-82-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the words ''sí'' (yes) and ''no'' (no) are unambiguously classified as adverbs: not only do they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative ''sí'' can replace the verb after a negation (''Yo no tengo carro, pero él '''sí''''' = ''I don't own a car, but he '''does''''') or intensify it (''I don't believe he owns a car. / He '''does''' own one!'' = ''No creo que él tenga carro. / ¡'''Sí''' lo tiene!''). The word ''no'' is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it (''Yo '''no''' tengo carro'' = ''I '''don't''' own a car''). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation (''No tengo ningún carro'' = ''I own no car'').

These differences between languages make translation difficult. No two languages are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], even at the elementary level of words for ''yes'' and ''no''. Translation from two-form to three-form systems is something that English-speaking schoolchildren learning French or German soon encounter. But the mapping is not even as simple as converting two forms into three. There are many idioms, such as reduplication (in French, German, and Italian) of affirmatives for emphasis (the German ''ja ja ja'').

Furthermore, the mappings are one-to-many in both directions. The German ''ja'' has no fewer than 13 English equivalents that vary according to context and usage (''yes'', ''yeah'', and ''no'' when used as an answer; ''well'', ''all right'', ''so'', and ''now'', when used for segmentation; ''oh'', ''ah'', ''uh'', and ''eh'' when used an interjection; and ''do you'', ''will you'', and their various inflections when used as a marker for [[tag question]]s) for example. Moreover, both ''ja'' and ''doch'' are frequently used as [[German modal particle|additional particle]]s for conveying nuanced meaning where, in English, no such particle exists. Straightforward, non-idiomatic, translations from German to English and then back to German can often result in the loss of all of the modal particles such as ''ja'' and ''doch'' from a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Starting English Teaching|author=Robert Jeffcoate|page=213|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=0-415-05356-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deaf Way|author1=Carol Erting |author2=Robert C.

Translation from languages that have word systems to those that do not, such as Latin, is similarly problematic. As Calvert says, "Saying yes or no takes a little thought in Latin".&lt;ref name=Calvert /&gt;

== Colloquial forms ==
There are many variants of "yes" and "no" in English. Two such spoken forms are transcribed into writing as "uh-huh" or "mm-hmm" ("yes", with a rise in pitch on the second syllable) and "uh-uh" or "mm-mm" ("no", with a fall in pitch on the second syllable). Their sounds are a nasal or non-nasal sound interrupted by a voiceless breathy interval for "yes", and by a [[glottal stop]] for "no". These forms are particularly useful for speakers who are at a given time unable to articulate the actual words "yes" and "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grammar|author=James R. Hurford|chapter=Interjections|pages=111–112|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-45627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mm-hmm may be a [[loanword]] from an African language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/08/17/606002607/ready-for-a-linguistic-controversy-say-mhmm| author=Kumari Devarajan| title=Ready For A Linguistic Controversy?

===Aye===
The word ''"aye"'' ({{IPAc-en|aɪ}}, like ''eye'') is a frequent synonym for "yes", particularly in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Northern England]], although not always officially acknowledged as such. In December 1993, a witness in a Scottish court who had answered "aye" to confirm he was the person summoned was told by the Sheriff that he must answer either "yes" or "no". When his name was read again and he was asked to confirm it, he answered "aye" again, and was imprisoned for 90 minutes for [[contempt of court]]. On his release he said, "I genuinely thought I was answering him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/sheriff-judges-aye-aye-a-contemptible-no-no-1.728980|title=Sheriff judges aye-aye a contemptible no-no|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=11 December 1993|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aye" is also a common word in [[parliamentary procedure]]. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]], [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MPs]] or [[Members of the House of Lords|Lords]] [[voice vote|vote orally]] on debates or legislations by saying "aye" or "no" to indicate they approve or disapprove of the measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/traditions/ |title=Rules and traditions of Parliament  |website=UK Parliament Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parliament of Canada]], the terms "yea" and "nay" are used instead. These and other [[Westminster system]] parliaments including those of [[Parliament of Australia|Australia]] and [[Parliament of New Zealand|New Zealand]] generally use the same or similar terms to designate positions during a formal [[division of the assembly]] that generally follows a challenged vote.

In naval language, the phrase [[Aye aye, sir]] is used to acknowledge a direct order, and indicates the speaker both understands the order and will comply with it; a single "aye" is a synonym for "yes" and simply indicates agreement.

Another affirmative phrase is "why-aye man" (alternatively "whey-aye" or "wey-aye") which is commonly found in [[Tyne and Wear]], but can be heard well up into the north of [[Northumberland]], south as far as [[Bishop Auckland]] and west into the [[Tynedale|Tyne Valley]]. It is an informal phrase used to express affirmation in situations where a simple ''"aye"'' would not be enough.

''Aye'' is not to be confused with the archaic term ''"ay"'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ}}, as in ''[[hay]]''), which is used poetically to mean "for ever" or "[[eternity|eternally]]". 
It is also sometimes also spelled ''aye''; the spelling of ''aye'' and ''ay'' for the two meanings "yes" or "for ever" varies according to different authorities, and may be interchangeable in common usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=H.

A '''župa''' (or '''zhupa''', '''[[županija]]''') is a historical type of administrative division in [[Central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]], that originated in medieval [[List of Slavic cultures|Slavic culture]], often translated into "county" or "district".{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=225, 227}} It was mentioned for the first time in the 8th century. It was initially used by the [[South Slavs|South]] and [[West Slavs]], denoting various territorial units of which the leader was the '''[[župan]]'''. In modern Croatian and Slovenian, the term ''župa'' also means an ecclesiastical [[parish]].{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713}}

==Etymology==
The word "župa" ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] Жупа; adopted into {{lang-hu|ispán}} and rendered in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''ζουπανία'' (zoupania, "land ruled by a župan") is derived from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]. Its medieval Latin equivalent was ''comitatus''. It is mostly translated into "county" or "district".{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=304}} According to Kmietowicz, it seems that the territorial organization had been created in Polish territories before the [[Slav Migrations]].&lt;ref name=Kmietowicz&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Slavs |author=Frank A.

Co. |year=1976 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amTxAAAAMAAJ |page=185, footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Slavic nations changed its name into "opole", "okolina" and "vierw", but it has survived in ''župan''.&lt;ref name=Kmietowicz/&gt; Some scholars consider the word's older meaning was "open area in the valley".{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713}} This interpretation is confirmed by the Bulgarian ''župa'' (tomb), Polish ''zupa'' and Ukrainian ''župa'' (salt mine), and [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''župište'' (tomb).{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713}} As such, the Proto-Slavic ''*župa'' wouldn't derive from ''*gheu-p-'' (with ''*gheu-'' meaning "bend, distort"),{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713}} yet from Indo-European ''*g(h)eup-/*gheub-'' meaning "cavity, pit",{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713-714}} which derives from [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] ''*gopa'' meaning "hollow, empty".{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=714}} However, [[Albert Bruckner]] suggested the opposite evolution; ''župa'' as a [[back formation]] from title ''[[župan]]'' (for the etymology see corresponding article),{{sfn|Alemany|2009|p=7}} which is a borrowing from [[Iranian languages]] (*''fsu-pāna'', "shepherd").{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=228}}

==Usage of the division==
The division had a widespread distribution, and did not always had a concrete institutional definition.&lt;ref name="Biliarsky"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ivan |last=Biliarsky |date=2011 |title=Word and Power in Mediaeval Bulgaria |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=O-j66lYzINEC |publisher=Brill |pages=368 |isbn=9789004191457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''župa'' signified the territorial and administrative unit of a tribe, and later only an administrative unit without tribal feature.{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=227}}{{sfn|Gluhak|1993|p=713}} The South Slavs that settled in Roman lands to a certain degree adopted Roman state organization, but retained their own tribal organization.&lt;ref name=ZU-Zupan&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yugoslav village|author=Zagreb. Universitet. Institut za ekonomiku poljoprivrede i sociologiju sela. SOUR za sociologiju sela|publisher=Dept. of Rural Sociology|year=1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQBPAQAAIAAJ|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic tribes were divided into fraternities, each including a certain number of families.&lt;ref name=ZU-Zupan/&gt; The territory inhabited by a tribe was a ''župa'', and its leader was the ''župan''.&lt;ref name=ZU-Zupan/&gt;

The ''zhupa'' (plural ''zhupi'') was an administrative unit in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], a subdivision of a larger unit called ''comitatus''.  In these countries, the equivalent of "county" is "[[judet]]" (from Latin ''judicium'').{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The [[Croats]] and the [[Slovaks]] used the terms županija and župa for the counties in the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and [[Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]]. German language translation of the word for those counties was ''[[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|komitat]]'' (from Latin ''comitatus'', "countship") during the Middle Ages, but later it was ''gespanschaft'' (picking up the ''span'' root that previously came from ''župan'').{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Croatia===
{{Main|Duchy of Croatia|Counties of Croatia}}

The Croatian word župa signifies both a secular unit (county) and a religious unit (parish), ruled over by a "župan" (count) and "župnik" (parish priest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medioevo: la chiesa e il palazzo : atti del convegno internazionale di studi, Parma, 20-24 settembre 2005 |author=Arturo Carlo Quintavalle, Università di Parma. Centro di studi medioevali, [[Fondazione Cariparma]] |editor=Arturo Carlo Quintavalle |edition=illustrated |publisher=Electa |year=2007 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian medieval state was divided into eleven ''ζουπανίας'' (zoupanias; župas), and the [[Ban (title)|ban]] ruled over additional three župas [[Krbava]], [[Lika]], and [[Gacka]]).{{sfn|Živković|2012|p=144}}

Today the term ''županija'' is the name for the Croatian regional government, the [[counties of Croatia]]. Mayors of counties hold the title of ''župan'' (pl. ''župani''), which is usually translated as "county prefect". In the 19th century, the counties of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] were called ''županija''. The Croats preserved the term ''župa'' until the modern times as the name for local clerical units, parishes of the Catholic Church and of the Protestant churches. The parish priest is called ''župnik''.

===Hungary===
{{Main|Ispán}}

In c. 1074, the župa is mentioned in Hungary as ''-spán'', also as ''határispánságok'' (march, frontier county). The derivative titles were ''ispán'', nominated by the king for not defined time, and gradually replaced by ''főispán'' in the 18-19th century; ''megyésispán'', also nominated by the king but could be expelled anytime; ''alispán'' was the leader of the jurisdiction in the county if the 'megyésispán' was not available; ''várispán'' was more linked to the "vár" (fortress) in Hungary in the times of [[Árpád]].

===Serbia===
{{see also|Serbia in the Middle Ages}}

The Serbs in the Early Middle Ages were organized into ''župe'', a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; headed by a local ''župan'' (a magistrate or governor).&lt;ref name=Evansxxi&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2007|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the title of [[Grand Župan]] in [[Grand Principality of Serbia|Raška]] in 11th-12th century meant "supreme župan" of župans who ruled over župas.{{sfn|Gluhak|1990|p=227}}

''[[Dušan's Code]]'' (1349) named the administrative hierarchy as following: "lands, cities, župas and krajištes", the župas and krajištes were one and the same, with the župas on the borders were called krajištes (''frontier'').&lt;ref&gt;Radovanović 2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent ''sebri'', the equivalent of Greek ''[[paroikoi]]''; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree.&lt;ref name=Anderson290&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=sP_2-y9zKfgC&amp;pg=PA290 p. 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the territorial unit today is unused, there are a number of traditional župe in [[Kosovo]], around [[Prizren]]: [[Sredačka Župa]], [[Sirinićka Župa]], [[Gora (region)|Gora]], [[Opolje]] and Prizrenski Podgor. The Serbian language maintains the word in toponyms, the best known being that of the [[Aleksandrovac|Župa Aleksandrovačka]].

===Slovakia===
The term ''župa'' was popularized in Slovak professional literature in the 19th century as a [[synonym]] to contemporary Slovak term ''stolica'' (county).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.komunal.eu/images/pdf/Terminologia_verejnej_spravy_na_Slovensku.pdf |title=Terminológia verejnej správy na Slovensku |website=Komunálne výskumné a poradenské centrum |access-date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, it was used as the official name of administrative units of Slovakia within [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1919 - 1928 and then again in the [[WWII Slovak Republic|Slovak Republic during WWII]] in 1940-1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acta Universitatis Carolinae: Geographica, Volume 38, Issue 1|author=Univerzita Karlova|publisher=Universita Karlova.|year=2005|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the term is used semi-officially as a short alternative name for the [[Regions of Slovakia|self-governing regions]] of Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domov.sme.sk/c/5045338/slovo-zupa-je-praslovanskeho-povodu-aj-tak-ho-nechceme.html |title=Slovo župa je praslovanského pôvodu, aj tak ho nechceme |website=Sme |date= 3 October 2009 |access-date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the self-governing region is semi-officially called ''župan''.

===Slovenia===
During [[World War II]], when [[Slovenia]] was partitioned between Italy, Hungary, and Germany on 17 April 1941, in the Italian portion, named province of [[Ljubljana]], the new administration was led by an Italian High Commissioner, but there also were Presidents of the Council of Zhupans of Ljubljana: [[Marko Natlačen]] (1941), [[Leon Rupnik]] (1942-1943).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
