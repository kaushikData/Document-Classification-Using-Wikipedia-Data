{{Criminal law}}
Under the English [[common law]], an '''accomplice''' is a person who actively participates in the commission of a crime, even if they take no part in the actual [[criminal offense]].  For example, in a bank robbery, the person who points the gun at the teller and asks for the money is guilty of [[armed robbery]].  Anyone else directly involved in the commission of the crime, such as the [[lookout]] or the getaway car driver, is an accomplice, even if in the absence of an underlying offense keeping a lookout or driving a car would not be an offense.

An accomplice differs from an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] in that an accomplice is present at the actual crime, and could be prosecuted even if the main criminal (the ''[[principal (criminal law)|principal]]'') is not charged or convicted. An accessory is generally not present at the actual crime, and may be subject to lesser penalties than an accomplice or [[principal (criminal law)|principal]].

At law, an accomplice has lesser guilt than the person he or she is assisting, is subject to lesser [[prosecution]] for the same crime, and faces the smaller criminal penalties.  As such, the three accomplices to the bank robbery above can also to a degree be found guilty of armed robbery even if only one stole money.

The fairness of the doctrine that the accomplice is still guilty has been subject to much discussion, particularly in cases of [[Capital punishment|capital crimes]].  Accomplices have been prosecuted for [[felony murder]] even if the actual person who committed the murder died at the crime scene or otherwise did not face [[capital punishment]].

In jurisdictions based on the common law, the concept of an accomplice has often been heavily modified by statute, or replaced by new concepts entirely.

== Canada ==

Criminal law in Canada is governed by the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], a federal statute.  Parliament has abolished the concepts of accomplice and accessory, and instead created a single statutory concept, namely being party to an offence:

:'''21.''' (1) Everyone is a party to an offence who

::(a) actually commits it;

::(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or

::(c) abets any person in committing it.

:(2) Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-7.html#h-5 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 21.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929194039/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-7.html#h-5 |date=September 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person can become a party to an offence where they ''encourage'' another (the principal) with words or acts, and intend to encourage.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Greyeyes'' [1997] 2 SCR 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mere presence at the scene of an offence  is not sufficient grounds for liability. More involvement is needed, such as: 
* encouragement of the principal
* an act or omission that facilitates the commission of the offence
* an act or omission which tends to prevent or hinder interference with the accomplishment of the offence. 

However, presence at the commission of the offence is ''evidence'' of aiding or abetting if accompanied by other factors.&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Dunlop v R]]'' [1979] 2 SCR 881.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
One of the most notorious cases of this type was the 1952 case in England involving [[Derek Bentley]], a mentally challenged man who was in [[police]] custody when his sixteen-year-old companion, [[Christopher Craig]], shot and killed a [[police constable]] during a botched break-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/134951.stm|title=BBC News - UK - Let him have justice, say campaigners|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Craig was sentenced to be detained [[at Her Majesty's Pleasure]], since as a [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]] offender he could not be sentenced to death (he was released after serving ten years), but Bentley was [[capital punishment|hanged]] despite popular protest.  The incident was dramatized in the film ''[[Let Him Have It]]'', which is what Bentley allegedly said to Craig during the incident, which can be interpreted either as telling Craig to shoot the policeman, or to give him the gun.  The [[hanging]] of Bentley led to public outrage and sparked the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Sydney Silverman]]'s campaign to abolish [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom]], achieved c. 1965.

==United States==
[[Aiding and abetting]] is a provision in United States [[criminal law]], for situations where it cannot be shown the party personally carried out the criminal offense, but where another person may have carried out the illegal act(s) as an agent of the charged, working together with or under the direction of the charged party, who is an [[accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guam v. Dela Rosa]]'', 644 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/644/1257/358943/ 1257, 1260-61] (9th Cir. 1981) ([[per curiam]]) defining an accomplice as “one who could have been indicted for the same offense either as an accessory or principal.”&lt;/ref&gt;

It is derived from the [[United States Code]] (U.S.C.), section two of title 18:
*(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States is punishable as a principal.
*(b) Whoever knowingly and willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Where the term "principal" refers to [[Principal (criminal law)|any actor who is primarily responsible for a criminal offense]].

An accomplice was often referred to as an [[abettor]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., [[United States v. Peoni]]'', 100 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/100/401/1485475/ 401] (2d Cir. 1938), applying a prior statute that penalized any person who "aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures" the commission of a crime.&lt;/ref&gt; This term is not in active use in the United States, having been replaced by ''accomplice''.

'''Anandghan''' was a 17th-century [[Jain monk]], mystical poet and hymnist. Though very little is known about his life, his collection of hymns about philosophy, devotion and spirituality in vernacular languages are popular and still sung in [[Jain temple]]s.

==Life==
There is no historical information available about life of Anandghan. The majority of information is based in hagiographies and [[oral history]].&lt;ref name=bf&gt;{{cite book|author1=Imre Bangha|author2=Richard Fynes|title=It’s a City-showman’s Show!: Transcendental Songs of Anandghan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8s4zQr6uH1wC|date=15 May 2013|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-985-3|pages=x–xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bandopadhyay1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manohar Bandopadhyay|title=Lives And Works Of Great Hindi Poets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OZjAAAAMAAJ|date=1 September 1994|publisher=B.

He was born in [[Rajputana]] (now [[Rajasthan]], India). His dates differs according to sources. Generally 1603 or 1604 is accepted but he could have born before 1624 according to some estimation.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bangha and Fynes 2013: xxvii–xxx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bf/&gt;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; His childhood name was Labhanand.

He might have lived as ascetic not associated with any organized ascetic branches. He stayed in the area of present-day north [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]] in India. Legends associate him with [[Mount Abu]] and [[Jodhpur]]. He is associated with [[Yashovijay]] also and said to have met him. He could have died in [[Merta City|Medata]] in Rajasthan as a hall is dedicated to him is there. His death dates varies according to sources.

==Works==
His language is mix of vernacular languages like [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] and [[Braj language|Braj]]. It follows Rajasthani style of diction but is written in medieval Gujarati. It was the time when [[Bhakti movement]] was at peak and majority of devotional poets of time wrote in such vernacular languages. His works are focused [[bhakti]] (devotion) as well as internal spirituality.&lt;ref name=bf/&gt;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"/&gt;

''Anandghan Chauvisi'' is the philosophical treatises which supposed to contain twenty four hymns but contains twenty two. Other two hymns were later added by others. Each verse is dedicated to one of twenty four Jain [[tirthankara]]s. The legend tells that he composed these hymns in Mount Abu during his meet with Yashovijay who memorised them.&lt;ref name=bf/&gt;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malabari1882"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cort2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cort|title=Framing the Jina: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDBpq23-0QoC&amp;pg=PA102|date=16 November 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973957-8|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anandghan Bahattari'' is the anthology of hymns which differs in a number of hymns according to different manuscripts. This anthology was formed by 1775 and was transmitted orally as well as the written manuscripts. It contains ''pada'' (verses) with different [[raga]]s. Some of these verses drawn from other poets like [[Kabir]], [[Surdas]], [[Banarasidas]] and others.&lt;ref name=bf/&gt;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"/&gt;

==Legacy ==
[[Yashovijay]], the philosopher Jain monk, was influenced by him. He wrote commentary on ''Chauvisi'' and also wrote eight verse ''Ashtapadi'' dedicated to him.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name="YagnikSheth2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Achyut Yagnik|author2=Suchitra Sheth|title=Ahmedabad: From Royal city to Megacity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivMAUx6Hdl8C&amp;pg=PT52|date=2 February 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-473-5|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt6-YXE2aUwC&amp;pg=PA238|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-26606-2|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His hymns are still popular in followers of Jainism as well as non-Jains because they are nonsectarian in nature and put emphasis on internal spirituality. They are sung in Jain temples. They are found in religious hymn collections especially in the collection of [[Digambara]] hymns even though he is associated with Svetambara sects. A religious camp organized by [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] Mission of [[Rakesh Jhaveri]] in 2006 at Dharampur, Gujarat had lectures on ''Chauvisi''. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] included his hymn, "One may say Rama, Rahman, Krishna or Shiva, then" in ''Ashram Bhajanavali'', his prayer book.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

A Gujarai play ''Apoorava Khela'' (2012) based on his life was produced by Dhanvant Shah and directed by Manoj Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gujaratimidday.com/entertainment/television/gujarati-natak-apurav-khela|title=નવું નાટક : આજે ઓપન થાય છે : અપૂરવ ખેલા|last=|first=|date=2012-04-01|work=Gujarati Midday|access-date=2018-08-22|language=gu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WomanHomeopathy.jpg|thumb|250px|Woman looking at Bach flower remedies]]

'''Bach flower remedies''' ('''BFRs''') are solutions of [[brandy]] and water—the water containing [[Homeopathic dilutions|extreme dilutions]] of [[flower]] material developed by [[Edward Bach]], an English [[homeopath]], in the 1930s. Bach claimed that dew found on flower petals retain imagined healing properties of that plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bach flower remedies : a comprehensive study |author=D. S. Vohra |location=New Delhi |publisher=Health Harmony |year=2002 |oclc=428012690 |page=258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systematic review]]s of [[clinical trial]]s of Bach flower solutions have found no efficacy beyond a [[placebo]] effect.&lt;ref name="Thaler2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Thaler K, Kaminski A, Chapman A, Langley T, Gartlehner G |title=Bach Flower Remedies for psychological problems and pain: a systematic review |journal=BMC Complement Altern Med |date=26 May 2009 |volume=9 |pmid=19470153 |pmc=2695424 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-9-16|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst2002" /&gt;

The solutions, which contain a 50:50 mix of water and brandy, are called mother tincture.&lt;ref&gt;The full making process is described in detail in ''Bach Flower Remedies: Illustrations and Preparations'' by Nora Weeks and Victor Bullen, The CW Daniel Co, 2nd edition 1990, {{ISBN|9780852072059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stock remedies—the solutions sold in shops—are dilutions of mother tincture into other liquid. Most often the liquid used is alcohol, so that the alcohol level by volume in most stock Bach remedies is between 25 and 40%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ: Do your essences contain alcohol?|url=http://feelbach.com/faq.asp?qid=5344790&amp;act=bq|website=feelbach.com|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (50 to 80 [[Alcohol proof|proof]]). The solutions do not have a characteristic scent or taste of the plant because of dilution. The dilution process results in the statistical likelihood that little more than a single molecule may remain; it is claimed that the remedies contain ''[[Energy (esotericism)|energetic]]'' or ''vibrational'' nature of the flower and that this can be transmitted to the user.&lt;ref name="Thaler2009"/&gt; The solutions are described by some as [[vibrational medicine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bach-flowers.co.uk/bach_remedies.asp |title=About the Bach Flower Remedies |publisher=bach-flowers.co.uk |accessdate=14 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which implies they rely on the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] concept of [[water memory]]. They are often labeled as [[homeopathic]] because they are extremely diluted in water, but are not homeopathy as they do not follow other homeopathic ideas such as the [[Homeopathy#Law of similars|law of similars]].

== Effectiveness ==
In a 2002 database review of randomized trials [[Edzard Ernst]] concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hypothesis that flower remedies are associated with effects beyond a placebo response is not supported by data from rigorous clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Ernst2002"&gt;{{cite journal

All randomized double-blind studies, whether finding for or against the solutions, have suffered from small [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] sizes but the studies using the best methods were the ones that found no effect over [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="WalachRilling"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most likely means of action for flower remedies is as [[placebo]]s, enhanced by [[introspection]] on the patient's emotional state, or simply being listened to by the practitioner. The act of selecting and taking a remedy may act as a calming [[ritual]].&lt;ref name="Ernst2002" /&gt;

A systematic review in 2009 concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most of the available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of BFRs has a high risk of bias. We conclude that, based on the reported adverse events in these six trials, BFRs are probably safe. Few controlled prospective trials of BFRs for psychological problems and pain exist. Our analysis of the four controlled trials of BFRs for examination anxiety and [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] indicates that there is no evidence of benefit compared with a placebo intervention.&lt;ref name="Thaler2009" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A newer systematic review published in 2010 by Ernst concluded &lt;blockquote&gt;All placebo-controlled trials failed to demonstrate efficacy. It is concluded that the most reliable clinical trials do not show any differences between flower remedies and placebos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Flower remedies are sometimes promoted as being capable of boosting the immune system, but "there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Use==
Each solution is used alone or in conjunction with other solutions, and each flower is said by advocates to impart specific qualities. The solutions are also used on [[pet]]s and domestic animals. Remedies are usually taken orally.

The solutions may be recommended by a [[naturopath]] or by a trained Bach flower practitioner after an interview. Some vendors recommend [[dowsing]] to select a solution.

The best known solution product is the ''Rescue Remedy'' combination,&lt;ref name="RescueRemedy"&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Bach believed that illness was the result of a conflict between the purposes of the [[soul]] and the personality's actions and outlook. This internal war, according to Bach, leads to negative moods and to "energy blocking", thought to cause a lack of "harmony", thus leading to physical diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|oclc=16651016 |title=Heal thyself : an explanation of the real cause and cure of disease |author=Bach, Edward |publisher=C.W.

The result of this process Bach termed the "mother tincture", which is then further diluted before sale or use.

Bach was satisfied with the method, because of its simplicity, and because it involved a process of combination of the [[Classical element|four elements]]:

[[File:Mastribartolomeo.png|thumb|fra Bartolomeo Mastri]]
[[File:Mastri - Theologia moralis, 1709 - 265.tif|thumb|''Theologia moralis'', 1709]]
[[Image:Mastri - Theologia moralis, 1683 - 4330407.tif|thumb|''Theologia moralis'', 1683]]
'''Bartholomew Mastrius''' (Bartholomaeus, Bartolomeo Mastri) ([[Meldola]], near [[Forlì]], 7 December 1602 – Meldola, 11 January 1673) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Conventual Franciscan]] philosopher and theologian.

==Life==

Born at [[Meldola]], near [[Forlì]], in 1602, he was a Conventual Franciscan. He received his early education at [[Cesena]] and took degrees in [[Rome]]. He also frequented the 'studia' of his religious order in [[Bologna]] and [[Naples]] before assuming the duties of lecturer in Cesena, Perugia and Padua. He died in [[Meldola]] in 1673.

He acquired a profound knowledge of scholastic philosophy and theology, being deeply versed in the writings of [[Duns Scotus]]. Nevertheless, he was an open-minded and independent scholar. As a controversialist he was harsh and arrogant towards his opponents, mingling invective with his arguments. His opinions on some philosophical questions were fiercely combatted by many of his contemporaries and especially by [[Matthew Ferchi]] and the Irish Franciscan [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]]. When presenting the second volume of his work on the "Sentences" to Alexander VII, to whom he had dedicated it, the pope asked him where he had learned to treat his opponent Ferchi in such a rough manner: Mastrius answered,

:"From St. Augustine and St. Jerome, who in defence of their respective opinions on the interpretation of Holy Scripture fought hard and not without reason":

the pope smilingly remarked, "From such masters other things could be learned".

==Works==

He was one of the most prominent writers of his time on philosophy and theology. His "Philosophy" in five volumes folio, his "Commentaries" on the "Sentences" in four volumes, and his Moral Theology "ad mentem S. Bonaventurae" in one volume were all published in Venice.

Ponce in his treatise on Logic holds that with qualifying explanations God may be included in the Categories. Mastrius in combatting this opinion characteristically says, "Hic Pontius male tractat Deum sicut et alter".

Mastrius had a well-ordered intellect which is seen in the clearness and precision with which he sets forth the subject-matter of discussion. His arguments for and against a proposition show real critical power and are expressed in accurate and clear language. His numerous quotations from ancient and contemporary authors and various schools of thought are a proof of his extensive reading. His works shed light on some of the difficult questions in Scotistic philosophy and theology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4272">In [[machine learning]], '''Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS)''', Bayesian Programs write (synthesize) new Bayesian programs.  This is in contrast to the field of [[Probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programs]] where humans write new probabilistic (Bayesian) programs.

[[Bayesian probability|Bayesian probabilities]] is a strategy to learn distributions over Bayesian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603542/ai-software-juggles-probabilities-to-learn-from-less-data/|title=AI Software Juggles Probabilities to Learn from Less Data|last=Knight|first=Will|date=|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-03-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian Program Synthesis can be compared to the work on Bayesian Program Learning by Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum's,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where probabilistic program components were hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lake|first=Brenden M.|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|last3=Tenenbaum|first3=Joshua B.|date=2015-12-11|title=Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1332|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6266|pages=1332–1338|doi=10.1126/science.aab3050|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26659050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The framework ==
Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0216/Startup-pairs-man-with-machine-to-crack-the-black-box-of-neural-networks|title=Startup pairs man with machine to crack the 'black box' of neural networks|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=2017-02-16|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-03-04|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy allows more automatic synthesis of new programs via inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. 

The modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robohub.org/talking-machines-probabilistic-programming-with-ben-vigoda/|title=Talking Machines: Probabilistic programming, with Ben Vigoda {{!}} Robohub|website=robohub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian methods and models are frequently used to incorporate prior knowledge. When good prior knowledge can be incorporated into a Bayesian model, effective inference can often be performed with much less data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ais-factions-get-feisty-really-theyre-team/|title=AI’s Factions Get Feisty. But Really, They’re All on the Same Team|last=Metz|first=Cade|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This framework can be also be contrasted with the family of automated [[program synthesis]] fields, including program synthesis, [[programming by example]], and [[programming by demonstration]]. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian Program Synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Bianhua''''' meaning "transformation, metamorphosis" was a keyword in both [[Daoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Daoists used ''bianhua'' describing things transforming from one type to another, such as from a caterpillar to a butterfly. Buddhist translators used ''bianhua'' for Sanskrit ''nirmāṇa'' "manifest through transformations", such as the ''nirmāṇa-kaya'' "transformation body" of a Buddha's reincarnations.

==Terminology==
In Chinese linguistic morphology, ''biànhuà'' 變化 (lit. "change change") "change (esp. in form or character); variation; transformation; metamorphosis; reincarnation" is categorized as a "synonymic compound" whose parts are [[synonyms]], e.g., ''jiannan'' [[wikt:艱難|艱難]] "difficult; hard" [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''jian'' [[wikt:艱|艱]] "difficult; arduous" and ''nan'' [[wikt:難|難]] "difficult; troublesome" (Chao 1968:375).

For the [[Old Chinese]] etymologies, Axel Schuessler (2007: 166, 222) has ''bian'' 變 &lt; *''prans'' "to change" cognate with [[Tai languages|Tai]] ''plian'' "to change" and perhaps  [[Classical Tibetan|Written Tibetan]] ''sprul-ba'' or ''ˈpʰrul-ba'' "juggle; appear; change; transform"; and ''hua'' &lt; ''hŋrôih '' 化 "to transform' change", e.g., from a fish into a bird; people through education; raw food through cooking", cognate with ''e'' &lt; *''ŋôi'' 吪 "to move; act; change", with possible [[Tibeto-Burman]] etymological links to [[Kinnauri language|Kinnauri]] ''skwal'' "to change" or [[Khaling]] ''kʰwaal'' "to shift; move". Walter Simon (1957) proposed the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] etymological link between Chinese ''bian'' "change; transform" and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] ''sprul'' "juggle; perform tricks of illusion; change", and noted that the Chinese and Tibetan Buddhists chose these words to translate the Sanskrit technical vocabulary meaning "change; illusory transformation", such as, both ''sprul-sku'' and ''bianhuashen'' 變化身 translate ''nirmāṇa-kaya'' "transformation body".

In [[Modern Standard Chinese]] usage, ''biàn'' [[wikt:變|變]] or [[wikt:变|变]] means "change; become, change into; transform; perform (magic/etc.)"; and ''huà'' [[wikt:化|化]] means "change, transform, convert; melt; dissolve, thaw; digest, remove; burn up, incinerate; disguise; [religion] die, pass away" (DeFrancis 2003: 40, 374). Some common ''[[chengyu]]'' "four-character idioms" based upon ''bianhua'' are: ''biànhuàduōduān'' 變化多端 (with "many kinds") "changeable", ''biànhuàmòcè'' 變化莫測 (with "unmeasurable") "changeable; unpredictable", ''biànhuàwúcháng'' 變化無常 (with "changeable") "constantly changing; unending changes", and ''qiānbiànwànhuà'' 千變萬化 (with "1000" and "10,000") "ever-changing (esp. tides and fortunes)".

The modern [[Chinese character]] 變 for ''bian'' is classified as a [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic graph]], combining the semantically significant [[Radical 66|"strike" radical]] {{linktext|攴}} or {{linktext|攵}} at the bottom with the phonetic indicator ''luan'' {{linktext|䜌}} (from {{linktext|言}} "words" between two {{linktext|糸|}} "silk threads") at the top. ''Bian'' was first recorded on [[Zhou dynasty]] [[bronze script]]; "The meaning of the drawing is uncertain, but it contains two hanks of silk, and [[Xu Shen]] [in his ca. 100 CE ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''] said that it meant 'to bring into order', as in spinning or reeling" (Mair 1989: 44). The modern character 化 for ''hua'' is classified as a [[Chinese character classification#Compound ideograph|compound-ideograph]], combining [[Radical 9|the "person" radical]] {{linktext|亻}} or {{linktext|人}} on the left and [[Radical 21|"spoon" radical]] {{linktext|匕}} on the right. However, in earlier [[bronze script]] and [[oracle script]] forms of 化, the right side was originally a 人 "person" upside-down, depicting "a person who flips, changes" (Wenlin 2012).

Chinese has a rich lexicon of words meaning "change", including ''bian'', ''hua'', ''fan'' 反 "turn over;  return; counter; oppose", ''huan'' 還 "go/come back; give back; return; repay", ''yi'' 易 "change" (as in the ''Yijing''), and ''yi'' 移 "shift; adapt; modify; adjust"; and [[Joseph Needham]] (1956 : 74) notes, "the exact meaning of which are sometimes difficult to differentiate".

Semantically distinguishing between ''bian'' and ''hua'' is multifaceted. Compare these explanations.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The exact difference between [''bian''] and ''hua'' is perhaps more uncertain [than ''fan'' "reaction" and ''huan'' "return"]. In modern Chinese usage, [''bian''] tends to signify gradual change, transformation or metamorphosis; while ''hua'' tends to mean sudden and profound transmutation or alteration (as in a rapid chemical reaction)—but there is no very strict frontier between the words. [''Bian''] could be used of weather changes, insect metamorphosis, or slow personality transformations; ''hua'' may refer to the transition points in dissolving, liquefying, melting, etc., and to profound decay. [''Bian''] tends to be associated with form (''xing'') and ''hua'' with matter ([''zhi'']). When a snowman melts, the form changes ([''bian'']) as the snow melts (''hua'') to water. In the Sung dynasty, [Cheng Yi] explained ''bian'' as implying inward change with full or partial conservation  of the external Gestalt or form, and ''hua'' as fundamental change in which the outward appearance is also altered. (Needham 1956: 74) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Hua'' 化 denotes a fundamental and essential change—a transformation. However, sometimes one also encounters the word [''bian''], denoting external, momentary, or apparent change. A ''locus classicus'' for this distinction is in the [''Guanzi''] ...: "The exemplary man ([''shengren'']) changes ([''bian'']) in accordance with the times without transforming [the essence of his being]" ... This in turn permits us to understand the passage in the [''Huangdi neijing suwen''] ...: "When the beings take rise (''sheng'' 生 ...), this is called ''hua'' (transformation); when the beings have reached their full development [極] ... [and consequently have taken on a different appearance], this is called [''bian''] (change). (Porkert 1978: 44, quoted by Mair 1989: 44) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bian'' has the sense of alteration among states of being (for example, from a ''yin'' to a ''yang'' state, or vice versa) or of variation within defined parameters. It differs from ''hua'' 化, "transformation", in implying alternation or variation rather than fundamental and lasting change. The change from a caterpillar to a butterfly, for example, which is both substantive and irreversible, is a frequently cited instance of ''hua'' in the earlier literature. By contrast, a change that involves the realignment of constituent parts in a dynamic system (and that may be or is regularly reversed), such as that from day to night and back again, would be considered an instance of ''bian''. (Major et al. 2010: 871) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Wing-Tsit Chan]] (1952: 166) lists ''bianhua'' "transfiguration and transformation" as a basic Chinese philosophical concept. ''Bianhua'' has very diverse meanings, from basic "change and transformation" to "universal life" or "creation", even referring to the Daoist "science of metamorphosis" and generically "supernatural powers obtained by either magical practices or meditation exercises" (Robinet 1993: 153).

==Early usages==
The (c. 4th century) encyclopedic ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' text uses ''bianhua'' 5 times (3 in the ''Xinshu'' 心術 "Mind Techniques" chapters). Where the ''Xingshi'' 形勢 "Conditions and Circumstances" chapter says "The Way brings about the transformation of the self", the corresponding 形勢解 "Explanation" chapter elucidates (tr. Rickett 1998: 82) "The Way is the means by which the self is transformed so a person will adhere to correct principles."

The ancient ''Yijing'' or ''[[Book of Changes]]'' has 12 usages of ''bianhua'' describing the manifestation of everything in heaven and on earth. All occur in the (c. 3rd century BCE) [[Ten Wings]] commentaries, and none in the (c. 7th century BCE) core hexagram and line statements.

For hexagram 1 ''Qian'' 乾 "The Creative", the Commentary on the Decision (彖傳傳) says:
*The way of the Creative works through change and transformation, so that each thing receives its true nature and destiny and comes into permanent accord with the Great Harmony; this is what furthers and what perseveres. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967: 371). 
[[Kong Yingda]]'s sub-commentary (from Nielsen 2013: 115) distinguishes ''bian'' and ''hua'': "'Alternation' refers to afterwards changing from a former state, it has gradually changed. This is called 'alteration'. 'Transformation' refers to existence in one moment and absence of existence in the next, it has suddenly changed. This is called 'transformation'."

''Bianhua'' occurs most often (8 times) in the Appended Judgments Commentary (繫辭傳) or Great Commentary (大傳). Three contexts mention the work of divine sages.
*The holy sages were able to survey all the confused diversities under heaven. They observed forms and phenomena and made representations of things and their attributes [which became the basis for the ''Yijing'']... Through observation and discussion they [the holy sages] perfected the changes and seasons. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967: 304)
*The Master [presumably Confucius] said: Whoever knows the tao of the changes and transformations, knows the action of the gods". (tr. Wilhelm &amp; Baynes 1967: 313)
*Heaven creates divine things; the holy sage takes them as models. Heaven and earth change and transform; the holy sage imitates them. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967: 320)

In [[written Japanese]], 変化 can be pronounced ''henka'' "change (state)" (in ''[[Kan-on]]'' reading) or the Buddhist ''henge'' 変化 "incarnation" (''[[Go-on]]'' reading). The ''[[Nihon Kokugo Daijiten]]'' (2001) notes both pronunciations were first recorded during the [[Nara period]]; ''henge'' 変化 "A god, Buddha, spirit, etc. that temporarily appearing in human form, or such a thing. Avatar. Reincarnation" (神仏, 天人などが仮に人間の姿になって現われること. また, そのもの. 神仏の化身 (けしん). 権化 (ごんげ).; c. 810-824 ''[[Nihon Ryōiki]]''); and ''henka'' 変化 "A change from one nature, state, etc. to another, or, such changeability" (ある性質, 状態などが他の性質や状態に変わること, または, 変えること.; 827 ''[[Keikokushū]]'').

==Daoist usages==
The Daoist idea of ''bianhua'' (metamorphosis, or "change and transformation"), "that the certainty that the world is in flux leaves open the possibility that things may transform from one type to another" (Csikszentmihalyi 2008: 229), can be traced from the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' through the [[Shangqing School]].

The (c. 3rd century BCE) ''Zhuangzi'' was the first Daoist text to explain ''bianhua'' "transformation and metamorphosis". The word occurs five times (all in the Outer Chapters), referring to the ability of things to change from one category to another. For instance, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Spring and summer precede, autumn and winter come after—such is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things evolve and develop; even twisted little shoots have their own special shapes—such are the gradations of fullness and decline, the flow of transformation and evolution [''bianhua'']. (13, tr. Mair 1994: 123) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Zhuangzi'' text begins with a parable about interspecific metamorphosis.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the darkness of the Northern Ocean, there is a fish named K'un. The K'un is so big that no one knows how many thousands of tricents [three hundred paces] its body extends. After it metamorphoses [''hua''] into a bird, its name becomes P'eng. The P'eng is so huge that no one knows how many thousands of tricents its back stretches. Rousing itself to flight, its wings are like clouds suspended in the sky. (1, tr. Mair 1994: 3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Zhuangzi'' uses the closely related word ''wuhua'' 物化 "transformation of things" ten times, most famously in the story of [[Zhuangzi (book)#.22The Butterfly Dream.22|Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once upon a time Chuang Chou dreamed that he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting about happily enjoying himself. He didn't know that he was Chou. Suddenly he awoke and was palpably Chou. He did not know whether he was Chou who had dreamed of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming that he was Chou. Now, there must be a difference between Chou and the butterfly. This is called the transformation of things. (2, tr. Mair 1994: 24) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A ''Zhuangzi'' passage explains change in the sense of evolutionary continuity.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In seeds there are germs [幾]. When they are found in water they become filaments. When they are found at the border of water and land they become algae. When they germinate in elevated places they become plantain. When the plantain is found in fertile soil it becomes crow's foot. The crow's foot's roots become scarab grubs and its leaves become butterflies. The butterflies soon evolve into insects that are born beneath the stove. They have the appearance of exuviae and are called "house crickets:" After a thousand days the house crickets become birds called "dried surplus bones." The spittle of the dried surplus bones becomes a misty spray and the misty spray becomes mother of vinegar. Midges are born from mother of vinegar; yellow whirligigs are born from fetid wine; blindgnats are born from putrid slimebugs. When goat's-queue couples with bamboo that has not shooted for a long time, they produce greenies. The greenies produce panthers; panthers produce horses; horses produce men; and men return to enter the wellsprings of nature [機]. The myriad things all come out from the wellsprings and all reenter the wellsprings. (18, tr. Mair 1994: 172-173) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Liu An]]'s (c. 139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' uses ''bianhua'' 17 times. For instance, this hunchback story about Ziqiu 子求 "Master Seek", adapted from the ''Zhuangzi'' (6, tr. Mair 1994:58) description of Ziyu 子輿 "Master Chariot".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ziqiu had lived for fifty-four years when an injury made him hunchbacked. The arch of his spine was higher than his forehead; his chin pressed down on his chest; his two buttocks were on top; his rectum pointed to the sky. He crawled over to peer at himself in a well: "Amazing! That which fashions and transforms us! How has it turned me into this crumpled thing?" This shows that from his viewpoint, alterations and transformation [''bianhua''] are the same. (7, tr. Major et al. 2010: 252) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' describes transformations in nature (tr. Major et al. 2010: 399): "Now the frog becomes a quail, [and] the water scorpion becomes the dragonfly. These give rise to what is not their own kind. Only the sage understands their transformations." To know the ''bianhua'' of things is the hallmark of spiritual knowledge (Robinet 1993: 155).

While the ''[[Daodejing]]'' text does not use ''bianhua'', its (c. 2nd century CE) commentary attributed to [[Heshang Gong]] 河上公 (lit. "Riverbank Elder") uses the word twice, explaining the transformations of [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[Shen (Chinese religion)|spirits]]. The text and commentary for Section 26 (重德) says:
:Gravity is the root of lightness.
::If a prince is not grave, then he is not honoured. If asceticism is not taken seriously, then the spirits are lost. The blossoms and leaves of the herbs and trees are light, therefore they are perishable. The root is heavy, therefore it is lasting.
:Quietness is the master of motion.
::If a prince is not quiet, then he loses his dignity. If the ascetic is not quiet, then he endangers himself. The dragon is quiet, therefore he is able to transform [''bianhua'']. The tiger is restless, therefore he strives for heavenly faults. (tr. Erkes 1945: 170-171)
Section 39 (法本) says:
:The spirits acquired unity. Thereby they are magic-endowed.
::This means: The spirits acquired unity. Thereby they are able to change [''bianhua''] and to become formless.
:The valley-streams acquired unity. Thereby they are filled out.
::This means: The valley-streams acquired unity. Therefore they may be filled without ceasing to exist. (tr. Erkes 1945: 190)

The (c. 2nd century CE) ''Laozi bianhua jing'' 老子變化經 "Scripture of the Transformations of Laozi", which is preserved in a fragmentary (612 CE) [[Dunhuang manuscript]] discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]], uses ''bianhua'' to describe the many historical reincarnations of [[Laozi]] 老子, deified as [[Three Pure Ones#Daode Tianzun|Laojun]] 老君 "Lord Lao". This text (tr. Robinet 1993: 157) says Laozi "can make himself bright or dark, disappear and then be present, enlarge or diminish himself, coil up or extend himself, put himself above or below, can be vertical or horizontal, (and) can go forward or backward." In every generation, this Master of Emperors cosmically "transforms his own body" in order to teach humanity, through the incarnate power of the Dao, he assumes numerous identities, and leaves behind adapted writings with his teaching (Kohn 2008: 617). The transformations of Laojun began with the first mythical ruler [[Fu Xi]], included [[Gautama Buddha]], the [[Yellow Emperor]]'s teacher Guangzhengzi 廣成子 "Master Broadly Complete" (mentioned in the ''Zhuangzi''), and ended with a 155 CE manifestation in the [[Sichuan]] region.

Mark Csikszentmihalyi distinguishes between early Daoist discussions that tended to emphasize the way in which ''bianhua'' applies to human beings in the same way it does to the natural world (Sivin 1991), and later Daoism that stressed the potential for the adept to harness ''bianhua'', particularly in the eschatological picture of the Shangqing tradition. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like Laozi, the diverse spirits of the Shangqing tradition are able to transform themselves, and the adept had to be able to identify their different manifestations. Adepts, in turn, might use ''bianhua'' to transform themselves. The Shangqing text ''Shenzhou qizhuan qibian wutian jing'' 神州七轉七變舞天經 (Scripture of the Divine Continent on the Dance in Heaven in Seven Revolutions and Seven Transformations; CT 1331) describes methods for transforming into clouds, light, fire; water, and dragons. (2008: 229-230) &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Isabelle Robinet (2000: 219) notes that "the powers of metamorphosis had always been a key characteristic of the immortals, but these powers came to be even more central in Shangqing where they were synonymous with deliverance and salvation."

''Bianhua'' was employed by both Daoist mystics and ''[[Fangshi]]'' magicians. The Daoist adept practices metamorphosis both internally through meditation on colored breaths and gods within the body, and externally using magic to change the appearances of things (Robinet 1979: 43-46). [[Ge Hong]]'s (c. 320 CE) ''[[Baopuzi]]'' explains these extraordinary powers of Daoists. Describing the [[multilocation]] technique called ''[[Fenshen|fenxing]]'' "divide/multiply the body", Ge Hong says his uncle [[Ge Xuan]] could be in several dozen places at once (18, tr. Ware 1966: 306): "When guests were present there could be one host speaking with the guests in the house, another host greeting guests beside the stream, and still another host making casts with his fishing line, but the guests were unable to distinguish which was the true one." ''Yinxing'' 隱形 "invisibility" is another manifestation of ''bianhua''. The ''Baopuzi'' (16, tr. Ware 1966: 262-263) says: "What is it that the arts of transformation cannot do? May I remind my readers that the human body, which is normally visible, can be made to disappear. Ghosts and gods are normally invisible, but there are ways and means to make them visible. Those capable of operating these methods and prescriptions will be found to abound wherever you go."

Several centuries after Chinese Buddhists borrowed the Daoist meaning of ''bianhua'' or ''hua'' "manifest through transformation; incarnate", early [[Tang dynasty]] Daoists elaborated the Buddhist doctrine about a Buddha's "three bodies" (see below) into a theory that the True Body of the Dao, the Supreme Truth, assumes different metaphoric "bodies" in order to manifest as specific deities, including those in the ''Laozi bianhuajing''. The (late 8th century) Daoist ''Sanlun yuanzhi'' 三論元旨 (tr. Robinet 1993: 157) explains that: "The saint responds to all things, but his essence is distinct from them. Therefore, since his transcendent root is immobile, he is called the "true body" [''zhenshen'' 真身] and since he propagates the form of the Law, he is called the "responsive body" [''yingshen'' 應身]. This text further contrasts the True Body with the "transformation body" [''huashen'' 化身 or ''bianhuashen'', used for ''nirmāṇa-kāya''] and the "trace body" [''jishen'' 跡身], in the sense that all teachings are traces of Truth (Robinet 1979: 42).

==Buddhist usages==
Early Buddhist translators chose Chinese ''bianhua'' 變化 as the equivalent for Sanskrit ''nirmāṇa'' "transformation; supernatural manifestation; reincarnation".

[[Charles Muller]]'s ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'' (2014) defines ''bianhua'' as basically meaning "transformation of things", and distinguishes four senses:
#(Skt. ''nirmāṇa'') The transformation of myriad forms in manifesting appearances, especially the mutation of buddhas and bodhisattvas, e.g. 變化人 becoming men; also 變化土 the land where they dwell, whether the Pure Land or any impure world where they live for its enlightenment.
#To transform, change, change into, become. To manifest through supernormal power. 
#The mind that discriminates all objects as having inherent existence (sixth and seventh consciousnesses). 
#The third of the four kinds of reality-bodies of the Buddha, according to Yogâcāra. 
[[Monier Monier-Williams]]'s ''Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' (1899) translates ''nirmāṇa'' निर्माण as "measuring, measure, reach, extent", "forming, making, creating", "(Buddhist literature) transformation", "essence, essential/best part of anything" (''sāra''), and  "unconformity, impropriety, unbecomingness" (''asamañjasa'').

The common Buddhist term ''bianhuashen'' 變化身 or ''huashen'' 化身 (translating ''nirmāṇakāya'') "transformation-body; manifested-body" refers to one of the ''sanshen'' 三身 (''[[trikāya]]'') "three bodies [of a buddha]" doctrine, along with the ''fashen'' 法身 (''[[dharmakāya]]'') "dharma-body; truth-body", and ''baoshen'' 報身 (''saṃbhogakāya'') "reward-body; bliss-body". Contexts describing Buddhas manifesting as animals and humans use the related terms ''bianhuaren'' 變化人 (''nirmita'') "magically manifested human body", ''bianhuatu'' 變化土 (''nirmāṇa-kṣetra'') "transformation land where the inhabitants reincarnate", and *''bianhuasheng'' 變化生 (''upapāduka'') "birth by transformation; miraculous materialization".

Besides ''bianhua'' 變化, Buddhist translators used other Chinese ''bian'' compounds for Sanskrit words dealing with supernatural manifestations (Mair 1989: 68). This semantic complex includes ''bianxian'' 變現 (with "appearance") translating both ''vikurvaṇa'' "manifestation through transformation" and ''prātihārya'' "miraculous", and ''shenbian'' 神變 (with "god; divine") translating ''prātihārya'' "supernatural/miraculous powers; magical feats" and ''vikurvana'' "manifestation; transformation".

Victor Mair (1989: 43-45) traced the historical semantics of Chinese ''bian'' before and after the (c. 2nd-3rd century) introduction of Buddhism, when it started being used as to translate Sanskrit ''nirmāṇa'' meaning "discontinuity or break with reality (illusion)". The pre-Buddhist concept of Chinese ''bian'' referred to "change (from one state to another)", through which one thing becomes another thing. The post-Buddhist concept extended ''bian'' to mean "strange" in the sense of "transformation from nothing to something; magically creative power to conjure". The early "strange incident; supernatural transformation" sense of ''bian'' became popular during the early [[Tang dynasty]] period, for instance, the (c. 668) ''[[Fayuan Zhulin]]'' "Pearl Grove in the Garden of the Dharma" used ''bianhua'' "[miraculous] transformation" to describe strange incidents.

==Later usages==
The [[Neo-Confucian]] philosopher [[Zhu Xi]]'s interpretations of the [[Chinese classics]], which scholars and officials from the 12th to 19th centuries considered to be canonical, differentiated between two types of "change": sudden, transformational ''bian'' and gradual, evolutionary ''hua''.

For instance, Zhu explained an ambiguous ''Yijing'' statement within the [[Ten Wings|Xici zhuan]] 繫辭傳 "Commentary on the Appended Phrases" (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967: 323), "That which transforms things and fits them together is called change [化而裁之謂之變]; that which stimulates them and sets them in motion is called continuity", with a lunar analogy (tr. Kim 2000: 128): "[The progression] from the first day to the thirtieth day [of a lunar month] is ''hua'' (transformation). Having reached this thirtieth day, concluded and made one month, the next day belongs to the next month. This is ''pien'' (change)."  This "change" distinction also applied to lines in the ''Yijing'' [[Hexagram (I Ching)|hexagrams]], which are either unbroken, solid  [[Yin and yang|Yang]] lines or broken, open [[Yin and yang|Yin]] ones: "''Pien'' is from a yin [line] to a yang [line]. [It] changes suddenly. Therefore, it is called "change" (''pien''). [The change] from yin to yang naturally grows to become sudden. This is called change. From yang to yin, it gradually goes on vanishing and wearing out."

Zhu Xi used the ''bian''/''hua'' distinction to explain a difficult passage in the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'' (tr. Kim 2000: 129) – "When moved, it is change; when changed, it is transformed [動則變，變則化]" – "When changed, its old conventions have already been altered, but there still are traces. When transformed, they have completely vanished and transformed, and there are no longer any traces."

''Bianhua'' continues to be a [[Productivity (linguistics)|linguistically productive]] word, as evident in Chinese technical neoloigisms like ''bianhuali'' "paradigm", ''bianhuaqiu'' 變化球 "[[breaking ball]]", ''bianhuayu'' 變化語 "[[inflective language]]", and ''bianhuamangshi'' 變化盲視 "[[change blindness]]".

It quickly broadened, at the behest of conflicting parties in Aceh,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The discreet charms of the international go-betweens&lt;/ref&gt; to include the resolution of the conflict through mediation and conflict prevention.

In July 2015, in recognition of its important role in the mediation of armed conflicts, HD was granted a special status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Conseil fédéral conclut un accord sur les privilèges et immunités avec le Centre pour le dialogue humanitaire|url=https://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=fr&amp;msg-id=58018|website=Confederation Suisse|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] of Switzerland. Through this status, HD was awarded certain privileges and immunities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Council concludes agreement with Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue on privileges and immunities|url=http://www.noodls.com/viewNoodl/28941994/federal-department-of-foreign-affairs-of-the-swiss-confedera/federal-council-concludes-agreement-with-centre-for-humanita|accessdate=22 August 2015|agency=Noodls}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
intended to enable its peacemaking efforts worldwide.

===Leadership===
The Founding Executive Director of HD was Martin Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Griffiths|url=http://www.inter-mediate.org/martin_griffiths.html|website=Intermediate|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our staff|url=http://www.eip.org/en/people/staff|website=European Institute for Peace|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the organization for more than 10 years, from 1999 to July 2010, when he stepped down from his position. Griffiths was replaced for a brief period (July 2010 to March 2011) by [[Angelo Gnaedinger]], former Director General of the [[ICRC]] and the then HD Regional Director for the Middle East. Following this transitional period, [[David Harland]] was appointed as HD's new Executive Director in April 2011.

==Work==
Glymour is the founder of the Philosophy Department at Carnegie Mellon University, a Guggenheim Fellow, a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences a [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] lecturer, and is a Fellow of the statistics section of the AAAS. Glymour and his collaborators created the causal interpretation of Bayes nets.&lt;ref&gt;P. Spirtes, C. Glymour, R. Scheines, Causation, Prediction and Search, Springer Lecture Notes in Statistics, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; His areas of interest include [[epistemology]]&lt;ref&gt;http://loriweb.org/?p=2154&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epistemology: 5 Questions
Edited by Vincent F. Hendricks and Duncan Pritchard, September 2008, {{ISBN|87-92130-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly [[Android epistemology]]), [[machine learning]], [[automated reasoning]], [[psychology]] of judgment, and [[mathematical psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihmc.us/groups/cglymour/&lt;/ref&gt; One of Glymour's main contributions to the philosophy of science is in the area of [[Bayesian probability]], particularly in his analysis of the Bayesian "problem of old evidence".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glymour, C.; Theory and evidence (1981), pp. 63-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Glymour, in collaboration with Peter Spirtes and Richard Scheines, also developed an automated causal inference algorithm implemented as software named [[TETRAD]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/tetrad/publications.html&lt;/ref&gt; Using multivariate statistical data as input, TETRAD rapidly searches from among all possible causal relationship models and returns the most plausible causal models based on conditional dependence relationships between those variables. The algorithm is based on principles from statistics, graph theory, philosophy of science, and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Glymour, Clark; Scheines, Richard; Spirtes, Peter; Kelly, Kevin. "TETRAD: Discovering Causal Structure" Multivariate Behavioral Research 23.2 (1988). 10 July 2010 http://www.informaworld.com/10.1207/s15327906mbr2302_13&lt;/ref&gt;

Glymour earned undergraduate degrees in [[chemistry]] and [[philosophy]]. He did graduate work in [[chemical physics]] and obtained a Ph.D in History and Philosophy of Science from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in 1969.

'''Common employment''' was an historical defence in [[English tort law]] that said workers implicitly undertook the risks of being injured by their co-workers, with whom they were in "common employment". The [[US labor law]] terminology was the "'''fellow servant rule'''".

==Development==
The operation of the doctrine [[Precedent|was seen first]] in ''[[Priestly v Fowler]]'' in the United Kingdom. In the United States the doctrine was seen in ''[[Farwell v. Boston &amp; Worcester R.R. Corp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;45 Mass. 49 (1842)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fellow-Servant+Rule freedictionary.com's article].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bunker Hill Mining Company]] operated by the fellow servant doctrine.  According to Katherine Aiken, "persons engaged in the same common pursuit for the same employer were fellow servants and companies were not liable for injuries where a fellow servant was at fault.  Thus, either the miner himself or his coworker was ultimately responsible for accidents."  Between March 1893 and Feb. 1894, 15 fatalities occurred at the mine.&lt;ref name="Aiken"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aiken |first1=Katherine |title=Idaho's Bunker Hill: the rise and fall of a great mining company, 1885-1981 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman |isbn=9780806138985 |pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was abolished altogether by the [[Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948]] in the United Kingdom.

The doctrine has been superseded in the United States by [[worker's compensation]] laws, by which a worker can file for a [[quasi-tort]], regardless of their co-worker's fault.

{{nihongo|'''Daian-ji'''|大安寺}} was founded during the [[Asuka period]] and is one of the [[Nanto Shichi Daiji|Seven Great Temples]] of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]].

==History==
The [[Nihon Shoki]] records the founding of the {{nihongo|Kudara Dai-ji|百済大寺}}, predecessor of the Daian-ji, in 639 during the reign of [[Emperor Jomei]]. A nine-story pagoda was added shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Four Great Temples (''vid.'' pp. 90, 83–153) |author=McCallum, Donald F. |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=2009 |ISBN=978-0-8248-3114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moved during the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]], excavations have uncovered the foundations of the site of the {{nihongo|Daikandai-ji|大官大寺}}, as it was then known, seven hundred metres to the south of Mount Kagu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web |url=http://www.daianji.or.jp/02-garan.html |title=Temple |publisher=Daian-ji |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Yakushi-ji]], and [[Gangō-ji]], the temple relocated to the new capital of [[Heijō-kyō]] in 716–17, and it was rebuilt as the Daian-ji in 729.&lt;ref name="Heibonsha"&gt;{{cite book |title=Temples of Nara and their Art (''vid.'' pp. 33 f.) |author=Ooka, Minoru |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |year=1973 |ISBN=0-8348-1010-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its importance declined when the capital moved again to [[Kyoto]] at the end of the [[Nara period]]. A succession of fires, a typhoon in 1459 and earthquakes in 1585 and 1596 destroyed most of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daianji.or.jp/03-reki.html |title=History |publisher=Daian-ji |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone bases of the former twin pagodas were removed for reuse at [[Kashihara Shrine|Kashihara Jingū]] in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Buddhist Japan (''vid.'' p. 114) |author=Kidder, J. Edward |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=1972 |ISBN=0-500-02078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ruins of the other buildings lie in adjacent properties.&lt;ref name="Heibonsha"/&gt;

==Treasures==
The temple houses nine statues in a style known as Daianji-yoshiki, but the acclaimed statue of [[Sakyamuni]], said by the twelfth-century Oe no Chikamichi in ''[[Nanto Shichi Daiji|Shichidaiji]] [[Junrei]] Shiki'' to have been the finest work in Nara, is now lost.&lt;ref name="Heibonsha"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/nara_e/dd_aspx_menuid-1260.htm |title=Daianji Temple |publisher=[[Nara Prefecture]] |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following [[Nara period]] statues have been designated [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]]: a [[Jūichimen Kannon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=4068 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kannon|Senjū Kannon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=4064 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kannon|Fukūkensaku Kannon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=4065 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kannon|Yōryū Kannon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=4066 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kannon|Shō Kannon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=4069 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a set of [[Four Heavenly Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=4067 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple records of the [[Tenpyō]] era (747) have also been designated an [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]] and are now held in [[Chiba Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=9161 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denis Lerrer Rosenfield''' is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] writer and columnist. Along with [[Patrícia Carlos de Andrade]], co-founded the [[Instituto Millenium]] (as ''Instituto de Estudos da Realidade Nacional'' - IERN) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://porcaeparafuso.blogspot.com.br/2005/03/debate-sobre-realidade-nacional-carlos.html|title=Debate sobre a realidade nacional|author=Carlos Alberto Teixeira|date=2005-03-16|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Rosenfield has a [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[philosophy]] from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], and in 1982 he earned a [[doctorate]] in philosophy from [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University|Université Paris 1 (Panthéon-Sorbonne)]].&lt;ref name="Falada"/&gt; In 1999, he obtained a [[post-doctorate]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines]] (Fontenay/St Cloud).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lattes.cnpq.br/9382801569626465|title=Curriculum Lattes|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is [[Professor]] of Philosophy at the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]].&lt;ref name="UFRGS"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
A defender of [[Individual rights|individual liberties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imil.org.br/destaque/liberdade-avessas/|title=Liberdade às avessas|date=2012-05-13|publisher=Instituto Millenium|author=Denis Rosenfield|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the right to [[private property]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imil.org.br/artigos/a-criacao-de-quilombos/|title=A criação de quilombos|publisher=Instituto Millenium|author=Denis Rosenfield|language=Portuguese|date=2010-02-16|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenfield has positioned himself against state interference in citizens' lives - even in those cases where the established [[common good]] is at stake, like the [[smoking ban]] in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniad.org.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8648:envio-a-voces-a-mensagem-que-enviei-ao-denis-rosenfield-depois-de-ler-as-paginas-amarelas-de-veja1&amp;catid=29:dependencia-quimica-noticias&amp;Itemid=94|title=Resposta ao Denis Rosenfield sobre o tabagismo|author=Prof. Dr. Sérgio Luís Boeira|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview to "[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]"'s magazine in 2011, he presents [[National Health Surveillance Agency|ANVISA]] (a Brazilian [[government agency]] similar to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)) as "the great tutor of the Brazilian citizen, one who knows everything and to whom we owe blind obedience." According to Rosenfield, ANVISA was being run by "[[Schizophrenia|schizophrenics]]" whose sole purpose is to meddle in the lives of the Brazilians.&lt;ref name="Veja"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pedroivosebbaramalho.blogspot.com.br/2011/05/o-estado-nao-pode-tudo.html|title=O estado não pode tudo|publisher=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|date=2011-05-06|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenfield sees no problem in being called a "[[Right-wing politics|rightist]]", since it means "the defense of [[personal freedom]], of the state and of the [[Private property|property rights]]."&lt;ref name="Veja"/&gt;

The '''Divine Life Society''' ('''DLS''') is a [[Hindu]] spiritual organisation and an [[ashram]], founded by [[Swami Sivananda]] Saraswati in 1936, at [[Muni Ki Reti]], [[Rishikesh]], [[India]]. Today it has branches across the world, the headquarters being situated in Rishikesh. Also, many disciples of Swami Sivananda have started independent organisations in Mauritius, the US, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, South Africa, South America, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166607/Divine-Life-Society Divine Life Society] [[Britannica.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBVyeRnJ64oC&amp;pg=RA1-PA164&amp;dq=%22Divine+Life+Society%22&amp;as_brr=0#PRA1-PA164,M1 Divine Life Society] ''Divine enterprise: Gurus and the Hindu Nationalist Movement'', by Lise McKean.

==Aims==
[[File:Ashrams on the banks of Ganges, Rishikesh.jpg|right|250px|thumb|''Sivananda Kutir'' at Sivananda Ghat, and Sivananda Ashram above, [[Rishikesh]]]]
Its aim is to disseminate spiritual knowledge in the following ways:

* through publication of books, pamphlets and magazines on the subjects of Yoga and Vedanta
* holding and arranging spiritual conferences and discourses ([[Satsang]])
* establishing training centers for the practice of Yoga
* enabling aspirants to develop their spiritual lives via systematic training in yoga and philosophy
* establishing charitable organisations
* through the preservation of the ancient traditions and cultural practices of India

===History===
In 1936, after returning from a pilgrimage, Swami Sivananda stayed in an old hut on the banks of the Ganges in Rishikesh.  Other disciples desirous of his company stayed with him in difficult circumstances.  Eventually, he started the Divine Life Society to serve mankind. The King of [[Tehri Garhwal district|Tehri Garhwal]] granted him a plot of land to construct the present day Shivanandashram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://divinelifesociety.org/graphics/information/divine_life_society/introduction.html Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026004802/http://divinelifesociety.org/graphics/information/divine_life_society/introduction.html |date=26 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chidananda Saraswati]] served as president of the society from August 1963 to 28 August 2008, while [[Krishnananda Saraswati]] served as the General-Secretary of the Society in Rishikesh from 1958 until 2001.

'''Elias Durand''' (January 25, 1794 – August 15, 1873), born '''Élie Magloire Durand''', was an [[United States|American]] [[pharmacy|pharmacist]] and [[botany|botanist]].&lt;ref name=MAB&gt;Makers of American Botany, [[Harry Baker Humphrey]], Ronald Press Company, Library of Congress Card Number 61-18435&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}} He was born in [[France]].

Durand was born in [[Mayenne]], [[France]], apprenticed as a chemist and pharmacist in Mayenne from 1808–1812, studied [[pharmacy]] in Paris, and on his graduation in 1813 joined the medical corps of [[Napoleon]]'s army. He served for 14 months, and was present at the battles of [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]], [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]], [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]], [[Battle of the Katzbach|Katzbach]], and [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. In 1814 he resigned his commission, and became an apothecary in [[Nantes]] where he studied [[botany]] intensively for two years. After Napoleon's downfall, he was suspected of Napoleonic tendencies, and sailed to [[New York City]] in 1816.

After intervals in [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Baltimore]], he ultimately settled in Philadelphia, where he established a drugstore employed by many of the most eminent physicians of the day. In 1825 he became a member of [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] in Philadelphia, and in 1832 was elected a corresponding member of the ''Societé de Pharmacie'' in [[Paris]]. In 1835 he was the first to begin bottling [[mineral water]]s in the United States, and in 1854 was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]].

Durand actively devoted himself to botany, and became thoroughly familiar with the flora of [[North America]], collecting an [[herbarium]] that included a remarkable 10,000 [[species]] of North American plants. This, the work of nearly forty years, he presented to the museum of the [[Jardin des Plantes]] in Paris in 1868. A separate gallery has been devoted to the collection in that institution, and it was called "Herbaria Durandi" after the donor. Dr. Durand was a contributor to scientific journals, and a member of scientific societies in the United States and Europe. He died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 15, 1873.

'''Epistemological pluralism''' is a term used in [[philosophy]], [[economics]], and virtually any field of study to refer to different ways of knowing things, different [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[methodology|methodologies]] for attaining a fuller description of a particular field.&lt;ref name=Kellert/&gt; A particular form of epistemological pluralism is [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], for example, the separation of methods for investigating mind from those appropriate to matter (see [[mind–body problem]]). By contrast, [[monism]] is the restriction to a single approach, for example, [[reductionism]], which asserts the study of all phenomena can be seen as finding relations to some few basic entities.&lt;ref name=Schaffer/&gt;

Epistemological pluralism is to be distinguished from [[ontological pluralism]], the study of different modes of being, for example, the contrast in the mode of existence exhibited by "numbers" with that of "people" or "cars".&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt;

In the [[philosophy of science]] epistemological pluralism arose in opposition to [[reductionism]] to express the contrary view that at least some natural phenomena cannot be fully explained by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach.&lt;ref name=Kellert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;&lt;ref name=note/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the variety of possible epistemological approaches includes [[Platonism#Modern Platonism|platonism]] ("mathematics as an objective study of abstract reality, no more created by human thought than the galaxies") [[Intuitionism|radical constructivism]] (with restriction upon logic, banning the proof by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' and other limitations), and many other schools of thought.&lt;ref name=Hellman/&gt;

In [[economics]] controversy exists between a single epistemological approach to economics and a variety of approaches. "At midcentury, the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical approach]] achieved near-hegemonic status (at least in the United States), and its proponents sought to bring all kinds of social phenomena under its uniform explanatory umbrella. The resistance of some phenomena to neoclassical treatment has led a number of economists to think that alternative approaches are necessary for at least some phenomena and thus also to advocate pluralism."&lt;ref name=Kellert/&gt; An extensive history of these attempts is provided by Sent.&lt;ref name=Sent/&gt;

'''''Fields of Force: The Development of a world view from Faraday to Einstein''''' (1974) is a book by William Berkson, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons. It is an extension of his doctoral thesis, which was supervised by [[Karl Popper]] and examined by [[A.I. Sabra]]. Berkson credits the book with an influence from [[Joseph Agassi]].

==Summary==

''Fields of Force'' has a preface, an introduction, ten chapters, a [[Historiography|historiographical]] appendix on field theory, and name and subject indexes. The introduction and the ten chapters all consist of 6 or more sections.

==Berkson on Field Theory==

The book reconstructs theoretical frameworks originally used in building up the concept of a field. It shows that the field of [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]]'s electricity and the field of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s relativity are distinct; although both make different assumptions about physical reality, Berkson suggests that the assumptions of either conception of the field still remain as plausible today as when first conceived. These separate field theories share at least one significant and testable difference in comparison with Newtonian physics: whereas Newton's [[speed of gravity|action-at-a-distance occurs instantaneously]], the field theories predict a propagation delay. Berkson explains that Faraday's prediction of a physically measurable propagation delay (finite velocity) from his own conception of a physical field permeating space is one important difference separating this idea from that of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s (infinite velocity).
:All these field theories (Eintstein's, Faraday's, and [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s) remain inconsistent with [[quantum mechanics]]. For they assume nature to be continuous, while quantum theory assumes it to be discrete.

* [[Prediction]] - Informed or uninformed [[guesses]] regarding future events
* [[Prognosis (disambiguation)|Prognostication]] - Typically informed predictions about future events in a confined context
* [[Prophecy]] - Religious concept of divine knowledge, often with a consideration of future trends or events, and to some degree regarding events of an imminent, or [[divine plan|divinely planned]] nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Franciszek Fiszer''' (better known as '''Franc Fiszer'''; March 25, 1860 – April 9, 1937) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[bon-vivant]], gourmand, erudite and philosopher, a friend of the most notable writers and philosophers of contemporary [[Warsaw]] and one of Warsaw's semi-legendary people. He is best remembered for a large number of anecdotes, jokes and sayings coined by him and about him. 

==Biography==

Franciszek Józef Marian Fiszer was born in 1860 in the Ławy manor near [[Ostrołęka]], to Teresa née Glinczanka and Józef Fiszer. His father was from among the German nobility, [[polonization|polonised]] in the 18th century and a distant relative of General [[Stanislaw Fiszer|Stanisław Fiszer]], while his mother was a member of the [[szlachta|Polish gentry]] and owner of the said manor and village. Very little is known of Fiszer's childhood apart from the fact that he was a late child (both of his parents being over 40 at his birth) and that he became an orphan relatively soon. 

In the 1880s Fiszer moved to Warsaw, where he started spending most of his time in Warsaw's cafes, restaurants and some of the most notable clubs of the era. With time, he became a characteristic part of the Warsaw's social panorama and became friends with most of the contemporary Polish writers, poets, artists and politicians. Renowned for his existential monologues and anecdotes, Fiszer's only pastime was the restaurants. In the interbellum, Fiszer became one of the most notable members of Warsaw's high society. Frequent guest at balls and parties, he became a living legend. His family village became neglected and soon had to be parcellated for debts. However, Fiszer's lifestyle did not suffer, as he barely ever had to pay for his meals, since he was seen by the gastronomers as an advertisement for their restaurants. That is why he often was a guest of ''[[Udziałowa]]'', ''[[Ziemiańska]]'', ''[[IPS (restaurant)|IPS]]'', Oaza, Astoria or ''[[Blikle]]''. 
{{wikiquote}}
Among the closest friends of Franc Fiszer were [[Bolesław Leśmian]] (Fiszer is said to have invented his pen-name), [[Stefan Żeromski]], [[Władysław Reymont]], the ''[[Skamander|Skamandrites]]'' [[Antoni Słonimski]] and [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Jan Lechoń]], [[Zenon Przesmycki|Miriam]], [[Artur Rubinstein]] and [[Antoni Lange]]. Although Fiszer never published any book himself, he is mentioned in nearly all memoirs by Warsaw's artists of the inter-war period. Also, he became the only person never to publish a book to be mentioned in both [[Stanislaw Tatarkiewicz|Stanisław Tatarkiewicz's]] ''Polish Biographical Dictionary'' and [[Leszek Kołakowski]]'s ''Philosophy in Poland; Dictionary of Writers''. 

In 1985, most of the memoirs mentioning Franciszek Fiszer were collected by [[Roman Loth]] in a book titled ''Na rogu świata i nieskończoności'' (''At the Crossing of World and Infinity'').

'''George Ripley''' (October 3, 1802 – July 4, 1880) was an American [[social reformer]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, and journalist associated with [[Transcendentalism]]. He was the founder of the short-lived [[Utopia]]n community [[Brook Farm]] in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]].

Born in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]], George Ripley was pushed to attend [[Harvard College]] by his father and completed his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the [[Harvard Divinity School]] and the next year married [[Sophia Ripley|Sophia Dana]]. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the [[Transcendental Club]] and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put [[Transcendentalism|Transcendental]] beliefs in practice by founding an experimental [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model based on the work of [[Charles Fourier]], although the community was never financially stable in either format.

After Brook Farm's failure, Ripley was hired by [[Horace Greeley]] at the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. He also published the ''[[New American Cyclopaedia]]'', which made him financially successful. He built a national reputation as an arbiter of taste and literature before his death in 1880.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Ripley's ancestors had lived in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] for 140 years before Jerome Ripley moved his family to [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], a town in the western part of the state, in 1789.&lt;ref name=Golemba15&gt;Golemba, 15&lt;/ref&gt; He was moderately successful as the owner of a general store and tavern&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 3&lt;/ref&gt; and was a prominent member of the community.&lt;ref name=Rose49&gt;Rose, 49&lt;/ref&gt; His son George Ripley was born in Greenfield on October 3, 1802,&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 48. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ninth child in the family.&lt;ref name=Golemba15/&gt;

George Ripley's early life was heavily influenced by women. His nearest brother was thirteen years older than he was and he was raised primarily by his conservative mother, who was distantly related to [[Benjamin Franklin]], and his sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to a private academy run by a Mr. Huntington in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]] to prepare for college.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Before going to college, he spent three months in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]] with [[Ezra Ripley]], a distant relative who was also the stepfather of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 18&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ripley wanted to attend the religiously conservative [[Yale University]], his [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] father pushed him to attend [[Harvard College]], then known as a hotbed of liberal Unitarianism.&lt;ref name=Rose49/&gt; Ripley was a good and dedicated student,&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 26&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not popular with students because of his trust of the establishment. Early in his time at Harvard, he had sided with the administration during a student-led protest against poor food, and his attempts at reconciling the two sides prompted ridicule from his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley, seeking a socially useful role, found work as a teacher in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]] during winter vacation of his senior year.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 27&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1823.&lt;ref name=Rose49/&gt;

During his time at the school, Ripley became disenchanted with his father and his home town, admitting "no particular attachment to Greenfield".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped to enroll at [[Phillips Academy|Andover]]&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 29&lt;/ref&gt; but his father convinced him to stay in Cambridge to attend [[Harvard Divinity School]].&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 22&lt;/ref&gt; There, he was influenced by Levi Frisbie, Professor of Natural Religion, who was largely interested in moral philosophy, which he termed "the science of the principles and obligations of duty".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 34&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley was becoming very interested in more "liberal" religious views, what he wrote to his mother as "so simple, scriptural, and reasonable".&lt;ref name=Rose49/&gt; He graduated in 1826. A year later, on August 22, 1827, he married [[Sophia Ripley|Sophia Dana]], a fact which he originally kept a secret from his parents. He asked his sister Marianne to inform them shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===

Ripley officially became a minister at Boston's Purchase Street Church on November 8, 1826, and became influential in the developing the Unitarian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 26&lt;/ref&gt; These ten years of his tenure there were quiet and uneventful,&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 123&lt;/ref&gt; until March 1836, when Ripley published a long article titled "[[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] as a Theologian" in the ''Christian Examiner''. In it, Ripley praised Schleiermacher's attempt to create a "religion of the heart" based on intuition and personal communion with God.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 54&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he published a review of British theologian [[James Martineau]]'s ''The Rationale of Religious Enquiry'' in the same publication.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 51&lt;/ref&gt; In the review, Ripley charged Unitarian church elders with religious intolerance because they forced the literal acceptance of [[miracle]]s as a requirement for membership in their church.&lt;ref name=Delano5&gt;Delano, 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrews Norton]], a leading theologian of the day, responded publicly and insisted that disbelief in [[miracle]]s ultimately denied the truth of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Norton, formerly Ripley's teacher at the Divinity School, had been labeled by many as the "hard-headed Unitarian Pope", and began his public battle with Ripley in the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'' on November 5, 1836, in an open letter charging Ripley with academic and professional incompetence.&lt;ref name=Delano5/&gt; Ripley contended that to insist upon the reality of miracles was to demand material proof of spiritual matters, and that faith needed no such external confirmation; but Norton and the mainstream of Unitarianism found this tantamount to heresy. This dispute laid the groundwork for the separation of a more extreme [[Transcendentalism]] from its liberal Unitarian roots. The debate between Norton and Ripley, which earned allies on both sides, continued until 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendental Club===

Ripley met with Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Frederic Henry Hedge]], and [[George Palmer Putnam|George Putnam]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on September 8, 1836, to discuss the formation of a new club.&lt;ref name=Packer47&gt;Packer, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, on September 18, 1836, Ripley hosted their first official meeting at his house. The group at this first meeting of what would become known as the "[[Transcendental Club]]" included [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Orestes Brownson]], [[James Freeman Clarke]], and [[Convers Francis]] as well as Hedge, Emerson, and Ripley.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Future members would include [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[William Henry Channing]], [[Christopher Pearse Cranch]], [[Sylvester Judd]], and [[Jones Very]].&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Female members included [[Sophia Ripley]], [[Margaret Fuller]], and [[Elizabeth Peabody]].&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''Emerson''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003: 32. {{ISBN|0-674-01139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group planned its meetings for times when Hedge was visiting from [[Bangor, Maine]], leading to the early nickname "Hedge's Club".&lt;ref name=Packer47/&gt; The name Transcendental Club was given to the group by the public and not by its participants. Hedge wrote: "There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women", earning the nickname "the brotherhood of the 'Like-Minded'".&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1839, Ripley edited ''Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature'': fourteen volumes of translations meant to demonstrate the breadth of Transcendental thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation from church===

Amid the [[Panic of 1837]], many began to criticize social institutions. That year, Ripley gave a sermon titled "The Temptations of the Times", suggesting that the major problem in the country was "the inordinate pursuit, the extravagant worship of wealth".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley had been asked by church proprietors to avoid controversial topics in his sermons. He said, "Unless a minister is expected to speak out on all subjects which are uppermost in his mind, with no fear of incurring the charge of heresy or compromising the interests of his congregation, he can never do justice to himself, to his people, or the truth which he is bound to declare".&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 84&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1840, he offered his resignation from the Purchase Street Church but was convinced to stay. He soon decided he should leave the ministry altogether and, on October 3, 1840, he read a 7,300-word lecture, ''Letter Addressed to the Congregational Church in Purchase Street'', expressing his dissatisfaction with Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his experience with the ''Specimens'' translations,&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley was chosen to be the managing editor of the Transcendental publication ''[[The Dial]]'' at its inception, working alongside its first editor Margaret Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Abby. ''In Search of Margaret Fuller''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 61–62. {{ISBN|0-440-03944-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to overseeing distribution, subscriptions, printing, and finances, Ripley also contributed essays and reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 59&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1841, he resigned his post with ''The Dial'' as he prepared for an experiment in communal living.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 119&lt;/ref&gt; As he told Emerson, although he was happy seeing all the Transcendental thoughts in print, he could not be truly happy "without the attempt to realize them".&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brook Farm===
[[Image:Brook Farm08.JPG|thumb|Former site of Brook Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts]]
{{American socialism}}
In the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in "[[Associationism]]", an early [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]]ist socialist movement. In October 1840 he announced to the Transcendental Club his plan to form an Associationist community based on Fourier's Utopian plans.&lt;ref name=Packer133&gt;Packer, 133&lt;/ref&gt; His goals were lofty. As he wrote, "If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star."&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley and his wife formed a [[joint stock company]] in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors.&lt;ref name=Hankins34&gt;Hankins, 34&lt;/ref&gt; Shares of the company were sold for $500 apiece with a promise of five percent of the profits to each investor.&lt;ref name=Packer133/&gt; The founding membership of the original community included [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].&lt;ref name=Hankins34/&gt; They chose the Ellis Farm in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]] as the site of their experiment, which they named [[Brook Farm]]. Its {{convert|170|acre|km2}} were about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} from Boston; a pamphlet described the land as a "place of great natural beauty, combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 39&lt;/ref&gt; The land, however, turned out to be difficult to farm and the community struggled with financial difficulties as it built [[greenhouse]]s and craft shops.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook Farm was initially based mostly on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits.&lt;ref name=Hankins34/&gt; The experiment meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world, established on the principles of "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity".&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Philip. ''Hawthorne in Concord''. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 83. {{ISBN|0-8021-1776-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all".&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 135&lt;/ref&gt; In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating.&lt;ref name=Hankins34/&gt; Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. He wrote to his wife-to-be [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia Peabody]], "labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified".&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Philip. ''Hawthorne in Concord''. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 84. {{ISBN|0-8021-1776-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many outside the community were also critical, especially in the press. The New York ''Observer'', for example, suggested that, "The Associationists, under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the 'passions' as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes", concluding that they were "secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 275–276&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, the community, perpetually struggling financially, drafted an entirely new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 157&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many left.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Many were disappointed that the new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time that had been a trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 127&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 1846, troubled by the financial difficulties at Brook Farm, Ripley had made an informal split from the community.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  By its closure a year later, Brook Farm had amassed a total debt of $17,445.&lt;ref name=Rose136&gt;Rose, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley was devastated at the failure of his experiment and told a friend, "I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 283&lt;/ref&gt; His personal life was also taxed. His wife had converted to Catholicism in 1846, encouraged by [[Orestes Brownson]], and had become doubtful of his Associationist politics;&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 172&lt;/ref&gt; the Ripleys' relationship became strained by the 1850s.&lt;ref name=Rose209&gt;Rose, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:George Ripley cph.3a02324.jpg|right|thumb|220px|George Ripley as he appeared in his later years.]]

After Brook Farm, George Ripley began to work as a freelance journalist. In 1849 he was employed by [[Horace Greeley]] at the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', taking the role left vacant by Margaret Fuller.&lt;ref name=Miller249&gt;Miller, 249&lt;/ref&gt; Greeley had been a proponent of Brook Farm's conversion to Fourierism.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, 35&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley started his role with the ''Tribune'' at $12 a week and, at this wage, was not able to pay off the debt of Brook Farm until 1862.&lt;ref name=Rose209/&gt; As a critic, he believed in high moral standards for literature but offered good-natured praise in the majority of his reviews.&lt;ref name=Rose210&gt;Rose, 210&lt;/ref&gt; Greeley took advantage of Ripley's cheerful style of writing to boost circulation amid significant competition. Ripley wrote a "Gotham Gossip" column and many articles discussing local personalities and notable public events, including speeches by [[Henry Clay]] and [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 232&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed away from philosophy of theology, despite some efforts to persuade him to write on the subject. As he told a friend, he had "long since lost... immediate interest in that line of speculation".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley then edited ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. Together with [[Bayard Taylor]] he compiled a ''Handbook of Literature and the Fine Arts'' (1852).

With [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]], he edited the 16 volume ''The New American Cyclopaedia'' (1857–1863), reissued as ''The American Cyclopaedia'' (1873–1876). It sold in the millions and its immediate earnings amounted to over $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 341&lt;/ref&gt;

He also continued his critical work and in 1860 reviewed ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]]. He was one of the few contemporary critics to be sympathetic to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===

In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, and was a part of the [[Gilded Age]] New York literary scene for the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time.&lt;ref name=Miller249/&gt; He became a public figure with a national reputation&lt;ref name=Rose210/&gt; and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 150&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with [[influenza]] in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from [[gout]] and [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley was found dead at his desk on July 4, 1880, slumped over his work.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 262&lt;/ref&gt; Pallbearers at his funeral included [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]], [[George William Curtis]], and [[Whitelaw Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1880/07/08/archives/the-funeral-of-george-ripley-simple-but-impressive-services-at-the.html The Funeral of George Ripley: Simple but impressive services at the Church of the Messiah]". ''The New York Times''. July 8, 1880. Accessed November 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Ripley had become financially successful; the ''New American Cyclopaedia'' had earned him royalties of nearly $1.5 million.&lt;ref name=Rose210/&gt; A biography entitled ''[https://archive.org/details/georgeripley00frotuoft George Ripley]'' (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1882) was written by [[Octavius Brooks Frothingham]].

==Critical assessment==
Ripley built a wide reputation as a critic. Contemporary publications rated him as one of the most important critics of the day, including the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', the ''[[Springfield Republican]]'', the New York ''[[New York Evening Gazette|Evening Gazette]]'', and the Chicago ''[[Daily Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Theodore Tuckerman]] commended Ripley as "a scholar and an aesthetic as well as technical critic: [he] knows public taste and the laws of literature".&lt;ref&gt;England, Eugene. ''Beyond Romanticism: Tuckerman's Life and Poetry''. New York: SUNY Press, 1991: 231. {{ISBN|0-7914-0791-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Albert''' (born 8 February 1921) is a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. Born in [[Cologne]], he lives in [[Heidelberg]].

His fields of research are Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods. He is a [[critical rationalist]], paying special attention to rational [[heuristics]]. He is a strong critic of the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] [[hermeneutic]] tradition coming from [[Heidegger]] and [[Gadamer]].

==Albert's critical rationalism==
Albert held the chair of Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods at the [[University of Mannheim]]. He is also a much-cited philosopher. Most importantly, he developed [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s critical rationalism into a concise, broad-ranging maxim, thereby extending it from a method to progress in science to one equally applicable in day-to-day heuristics.

To substantiate his approach, he provided evidence for his thesis that there is no field of human activities where one should not be critical. Consequently, he advocated applying critical rationalism to the social sciences, especially to economics, politics, jurisprudence, and religion.

In his view the attitude of criticism is one of the oldest European traditions (going back to the [[pre-Socratics]]) in comparison with other less critical traditions.

Before his many books were published, Hans Albert was already known to a broader audience for his contributions to the [[positivism dispute]] arguing against his opponents of the so-called [[Frankfurt School]] (school of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] at Frankfurt's Institute of Sociology). His contributions included
:* differentiating between [[critical rationalism]] and [[positivism]];
:* arguing against some strains of sociology opposing the application of methods used in natural sciences;
:* suggesting that the role of values and the scientific handling of values has to be given new thought and
:* interpreting [[Max Weber]] not as supporting value-free science but as demonstrating that scientists can 'be free of any value judgement', even for research in the fields of values.

Albert observed that new insights are often difficult to spread or proliferate. He ascribed this phenomenon's cause to ideological obstacles, for which Albert coined the phrase 'immunity against criticism'.

Albert's well known [[Münchhausen trilemma]] is ironically named after [[Baron Munchausen]], who allegedly pulled himself out of a swamp seizing himself by his shock of hair. This trilemma rounds off the classical problem of [[Theory of justification|justification in the theory of knowledge]]. It concludes that all attempts to rationally justify or rather ultimately verify a thesis must inherently fail. This verdict concerns not only deductive justifications, as many of his critics believe, but also inductive, causal, transcendental, and all otherwise structured justifications. As Albert reasons, they all will be in vain, since a justification inevitably faces one of three flaws:
# All justification in pursuit of ''certain'' knowledge simultaneously has to justify the means of justification or rather the validity of its premises - an effort which leads to an [[infinite regress]].
# One can cut the chain of reasons short, for instance, by pointing to self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or another basic premise that shall not be further questioned. But in doing so the intention to arrive at a universally valid justification is abandoned, because the reasoning cannot be accepted, unless one (irrationally) accepts the validity of one premise for its own sake.
# The third horn of the trilemma is the equally unsatisfying application of a circular argument.

Albert stressed repeatedly that there is no limitation of the Münchhausen trilemma to deductive conclusions. Hence, Albert points out, justification is rendered virtually impossible regardless of the specific content of a thesis, justification is impossible at all. From this notion, Albert draws the conclusion that progress in science can only be achieved by means of [[Falsifiability|falsification]] rather than inductive verification.

To observe and criticize the endeavors made to escape from the quagmire of certain justification became an instructive part of Hans Albert's philosophy. A prominent example of these efforts  his discussion of the ideas of [[Karl-Otto Apel]], one of Germany's leading philosophers (see Albert's ''Transzendentale Träumereien...'' meaning ''Transcendental Reveries. Karl-Otto Apels Language Games and His Hermeneutical God'', which is not yet translated).

Still, Albert argues that critical rationalists have to accept that those attempts of rigorous justification (like Apel's) are not entirely futile, since only as long as alternative methods are without success can critical rationalism be called successful.

==Albert's style of writing and criticizing==
Albert's plea is for [[critical rationalism]]. He avoids solemn preaching in favor of serious, serene discussion with people of different faith and thinking. While Popper always warned not to follow one's opponent into the mire,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Albert follows them into their favored field of thinking on their own terms.  So he criticized [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger's]] "being in the abyss" ("Sein im Ab-Grund"),&lt;ref&gt;Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &amp;ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. I&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] "horizons melting together",&lt;ref&gt;Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &amp;ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. II&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas's]] "consensual theoretical truth in the ideal discourse",&lt;ref&gt;Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &amp;ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl-Otto Apel| Karl-Otto Apel's]] transcendental arguments,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Albert, ''Transzendentale Träumereien. Karl-Otto Apels Sprachspiele und sein hermeneutischer Gott'', Hamburg (Hoffmann und Campe) 1975; Hans Albert, ''Kritik des transzendentalen Denkens. Von der Begründung des Wissens zur Analyse der Erkenntnispraxis'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the theologian [[Hans Küng| Hans Küng's]] "absolute-relative, this-life-and-hereafter, transcendental-immanent, allconcerning-allcontrolling most real reality in the very heart of things".&lt;ref&gt;Hans Albert, ''Das Elend der Theologie. Kritische Auseinandersetzung mit Hans Küng'', Hamburg (Hoffmann und Campe)1979; 2nd ed. Aschaffenburg (Alibri) 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Albert meticulously follows their arguments&lt;ref&gt;Much of the mentioned criticism is repeated in the English written Hans Albert, ''Between Social Science, Religion, and Politics. Essays on Critical Rationalism'', Amsterdam-Atlanta (Rodopi) 1999&lt;/ref&gt; to uncover:
* undiscovered premises
* new and often fatal consequences
* new and often better alternatives.

Underlying suppositions and injunctions of Albert's method are: {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} 
* Only if all currently proposed alternatives to critical rationalism are untenable may one live with critical rationalism.
* There is value in keeping an open mind and learning from discussion. Other people may be right; thus give credit to their thinking.
* One should keep away from solemn gravity.
* One should avoid the moralising know-it-all but not conceal one's preferred way of life.

==The intellectual life of Hans Albert==
In 1950 Hans Albert earned his first degree as a 'Diplom-Kaufmann', followed by an Academic degree of a Dr. rer.pol. 1952.&lt;ref&gt;This and the following facts are taken from the books referred in the precedent chapter 'Biographical Books'.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1952&amp;ndash;1958 he worked as an assistant at the 'Forschungsinstitut für Sozial- und Verwaltungswissenschaften' of the University of Cologne. In 1957 he got the degree of a 'Dr. habil. for Social Politics' at the University of Cologne. As a lecturer he read logic, theory of science and economics of the welfare state. Since 1958 he has been participating the Alpbacher Hochschulwochen (a summer conference in the Austrian alpine village of [[Alpbach]]). It was there he made the acquaintance of [[Karl Popper]] after having studied Popper's philosophy and having mostly accepted it long ago. After 1955 he had exciting discussions with [[Paul Feyerabend]], who in those times was a critical rationalist and an admirer of Karl Popper. Their letters later were published. In 1963 Albert finally got the chair of 'Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods' (later dubbed 'Sociology and Studies of Economics') at the Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim (later University of Mannheim).

1961&amp;ndash;1969 was the time of the so-called 'Positivismusstreit' ([[positivism dispute]]), i.e. the debate between Karl Popper and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] concerning [[positivism]] within German [[sociology]] during the 1960s. Albert participated at this meanwhile famous ''Conference of the German Society of Sociology'' ('Tagung der deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie') 1961 in Tübingen. In the beginning there was no dispute on [[positivism]], because Adorno as well as Popper were opposed to positivism. The debate was more about the differences between social sciences and natural sciences and the status of values in the social sciences. 1963 The debate was continued by [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the ''Festschrift für Adorno''. 1964 On the ''Soziologentag'' (conference on sociology) in Heidelberg the debate grew up into an excited discussion between Habermas and Albert. The famous dispute culminated in a collection of essays published in 1969, translated into several languages, also into English (1976, see booklist below). This dispute gained a broad audience.

In 1989 Hans Albert was discharged from active service as  [[Professor Emeritus]] but continued writing books and giving lectures at many universities, such as the 1990 lectures at the University of Graz on Critical Rationalism, the 1995 'Walter Adolf Lectures' at the Hochschule St. Gallen, and the 1998 Wittgenstein-Lectures at the University of Bayreuth (with Prof. Rainer Hegselmann) about Critical Rationalism.

He was honored with the 'Vits prize' 1976 and with the 'Arthur Burckhard prize' 1984. He was decorated with the Austrian 'Ehrenkreuz für Kunst und Wissenschaft der Republik Österreich' (1994) and got honorary doctorates of the universities of [[Linz]]/Austria (1995), [[Athens]]/Greece (1997), [[Kassel]]/Germany (2000), [[Graz]]/Austria (2006), and [[Klagenfurt]]/Austria (2007).

'''Harold Arthur Prichard''' (1871–1947), usually cited as '''H. A. Prichard''', was an English philosopher. He was born in London in 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett Prichard (a solicitor) and his wife Lucy. Harold Prichard was a scholar of [[Clifton College]] from where he won a scholarship to [[New College, Oxford]], to study mathematics. But after taking First Class honours in mathematical moderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he studied [[Greats]] (ancient history and philosophy) taking First Class Honours in 1894. He also played tennis for Oxford against Cambridge. On leaving Oxford he spent a brief period working for a firm of solicitors in London, before returning to Oxford where he spent the rest of his life, first as Fellow of [[Hertford College]] (1895–98) and then of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] (1898–1924). He took early retirement from Trinity in 1924 on grounds of ill health, but recovered and was elected [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] in 1928 and became a fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]].  He retired in 1937.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dancy|first=Jonathan|title=Harold Arthur Prichard|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prichard/#PriMor|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

Prichard gave an influential defence of [[ethical intuitionism]] in his "Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?" (1912), wherein he contended that moral philosophy rested chiefly on the desire to provide arguments, starting from non-[[normative]] premises, for the principles of obligation that we pre-philosophically accept, such as the principle that one ought to keep one's promises or that one ought not steal. This is a mistake, he argued, both because it is impossible to derive any statement about what one ought to do from statements not concerning obligation (even statements about what is good), and because there is no need to do so since common sense principles of moral obligation are self-evident. The essay laid a groundwork for ethical intuitionism and provided inspiration for some of the most influential moral philosophers, such as [[John Rawls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rawls|first=John|title=A Theory of Justice|year=1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00077-3|pages=30,307–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

===Criticism of Utilitarianism===

Prichard attacks [[Utilitarianism]] as not being capable of forming obligation. He states that one cannot justify an obligation by pointing to the consequences of the obligated action because pointing to the consequences only shows that the action is desirable or advisable, not that it is obligatory. In other words, he claims that, while Utilitarianism may encourage people to do actions which a moral person would do, it cannot create a moral obligation to do those actions.&lt;ref name="Prichard 1912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prichard|first=Harold Arthur|title=Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake? |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |year=1912 |volume=21 |issue=81 |pages=21–37 |url= |doi=10.1093/0199250197.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deriving moral obligation===

H. A. Prichard is an [[Ethical intuitionism|ethical intuitionist]], meaning he believed that it is through our moral intuitions that we come to know right and wrong. Further, while he believes that moral obligations are justified by reasons, he does not believe that the reasons are external to the obligation itself. For instance, if a person is asked why he ought not torture chipmunks, the only satisfying answer that could be given is that he ought not torture chipmunks.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

Prichard, along with other intuitionists, adopts a foundationalist approach to morality. [[Foundationalism]] is a theory of [[epistemology]] which states that there are certain fundamental principles which are the basis for all other knowledge. In the case of ethics, foundationalists hold that certain fundamental moral rules are their own justification. [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The deepest challenge in moral epistemology, as in general epistemology, is raised by a skeptical regress argument: Someone is justified in believing something only if the believer has a reason that is expressible in an inference with premises that the believer is already justified in believing. This requires a chain of inferences that must continue infinitely, close into a circle, or stop arbitrarily. Academic skeptics reject all three options and conclude that there is no way for anyone to be justified in believing anything. The same regress arises for moral beliefs . . . The simplest way to stop this regress is simply to stop. If a believer can work back to a premise that the believer is justified in believing without being able to infer that premise from anything else, then there is no new premise to justify, so the regress goes no further. That is how foundationalists stop the regress in general epistemology. Moral intuitionists apply foundationalism to moral beliefs as a way to stop the skeptical regress regarding moral beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinnott-Armstrong|first=Walter|title=Moral Intuitionism Meets Empirical Psychology|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, Prichard concludes that just as observation of other people necessitates that other people exist, the observation of a moral obligation necessitates that the obligation exists. Prichard finishes his essay by answering a few obvious problems. Most notably, he explains how people should guarantee the accuracy of their moral intuitions. Clearly, observations can be misleading. For instance, if someone sees a pencil in water, he may conclude that the object in the water is bent. However, when he pulls the pencil from the water, he sees that it is straight. The same can occur with moral intuition. If one begins to doubt one's intuition, one should try to imagine oneself in the moral dilemma related to the decision. If the intuition persists, then the intuition is accurate. Prichard further supports these claims by pointing out how it is illegitimate to doubt previously believed moral intuitions:&lt;ref name="Prichard 1912"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With these considerations in mind, consider the parallel which, as it seems to me, is presented though with certain differences by Moral Philosophy. The sense that we ought to do certain things arises in our unreflective consciousness, being an activity of moral thinking occasioned by the various situations in which we find ourselves. At this stage our attitude to these obligations is one of unquestioning confidence. But inevitably the appreciation of the degree to which the execution of these obligations is contrary to our interest raises the doubt whether after all these obligations are, really obligatory, i.e., whether our sense that we ought not to do certain things is not illusion. We then want to have it proved to us that we ought to do so, i.e., to be convinced of this by a process which, as an argument, is different in kind from our original and unreflective appreciation of it. This demand IS, as I have argued, illegitimate. Hence in the first place, if, as is almost universally the case, by Moral Philosophy is meant the knowledge which would satisfy this demand, there is no such knowledge, and all attempts to attain it are doomed to failure because they rest on a mistake, the mistake of supposing the possibility of proving what can only be apprehended directly by an act of moral thinking.&lt;ref name="Prichard 1912"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Durand, Wisconsin]], she graduated from [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee|Wisconsin State Teachers College]] in 1907, studied at the universities of Rome and Munich as well as with [[Maria Montessori]] and was awarded her [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1943 from [[Yale University]]. She taught briefly in Wisconsin, moved to [[Tacoma, Washington]], in 1909, and returned to teach at Wisconsin Central State Teachers College from 1913 until 1915. For a time, Parkhurst served as director of all [[Montessori schools]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Women's History in America, pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

After further work with Montessori in Rome, Parkhurst wrote several books and had her own national radio and television programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Child's World: New program airs juvenile ideas on God, Jealousy, Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10cEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=tU2gA_xTaH&amp;dq=child's%20world%20helen%20parkhurst&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=child's%20world%20helen%20parkhurst&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 February 2018|publisher=LIFE|date=2 August 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkhurst hosted a children's educational program on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Radio Network]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio: How It Feels|publisher=TIME Magazine|date=12 April 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkhurst was a 1948 recipient of a Radio - Television Critics Award and a 1949 recipient of the 13th American Exhibition of Educational Radio Programs Award.

Parkhurst was the author of “Education on the Dalton Plan,” which was published in 58 languages; “Exploring the Child's World,” with an introduction by [[Aldous Huxley]], and “Growing Pains,” a book about teenagers. Parkhurst was named one of the 100 Educators of All Time. Parkhurst was decorated by the [[Queen of Italy]], [[Empress of Japan]], and [[Queen of the Netherlands]]. Maria Montessori best summarized Parkhurst‘s career by stating, ”Her intelligent activity is truly rare and precious.” [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] greatly admired the work of Parkhurst and played a significant role in expanding the population and resources of her school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwsp.edu/historicpres/Documents/Historical-People/Notable%20woman%20Helen%20Parkhurst.pdf|website=A Notable Woman – Helen Parkhurst|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Parkhurst's influence has spread across the globe, with schools in the [[Netherlands]], [[England]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]] and others adopting the Dalton Plan of education. The Helen Parkhurst Exhibit at the [[Pepin County Courthouse and Jail|Pepin County Museum]] traces the life and legacy of Parkhurst. There is a "Helen Parkhurst Dalton School" in [[Rotterdam]] and a Parkhurst Lecture Hall at [[UW-Stevens Point]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22660">'''Humanist Photography''', also known as the '''School of Humanist Photography''',&lt;ref name="Chalifour"&gt;Chalifour, Bruno, 'Jean Dieuzaide, 1935-2003' in ''Afterimage'' Vol. 31, No. 4, January–February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; manifests the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophical system in social documentary practice based on a perception of social change. It emerged in the mid-twentieth-century and is associated most strongly with Europe, particularly [[France]], where the upheavals of the two world wars originated, though it was a worldwide movement. It can be distinguished from [[photojournalism]], with which it forms a sub-class of reportage, as it is concerned more broadly with everyday human experience, to witness mannerisms and customs, than with newsworthy events, though practitioners are conscious of conveying particular conditions and social trends, often, but not exclusively, concentrating on the underclasses or those disadvantaged by conflict, economic hardship or prejudice. Humanist photography "affirms the idea of a universal underlying human nature".&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, C.A. and Collins, J.L. (1993) Reading National Geographic. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p.277&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Claude Gautrand describes humanist photography as
&lt;blockquote&gt;a 'lyrical trend, warm, fervent, and responsive to the sufferings of humanity [which] began to assert itself during the 1950s in Europe, particularly in France ... photographers dreamed of a world of mutual succour and compassion, encapsulated ideally in a solicitous vision.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Gautrand, 'Looking at Others: Humanism and neo-realism', in The New History of Photography, ed. Michel Frizot, K61n: K6nemann, 1998, 613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Photographing on the [[Street photography|street]] or in the bistro primarily in black‐and‐white in available light with the popular small cameras of the day, these image-makers discovered what the writer [[Pierre Mac Orlan]] (1882-1970) called the 'fantastique social de la rue' (social fantasticality of the street)&lt;ref&gt;in the preface by Pierre Mac Orlan to {{Citation | author1=Ronis, Willy | title=Belleville-Ménilmontant | publication-date=1954 | publisher=Arthaud | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16070565 | accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their style of image making rendered romantic and poetic the way of life of ordinary European people, particularly in Paris.

==Philosophical foundation==
The preoccupation with everyday life emerged after World War II. As a reaction to the atrocities of the trenches, Paris became a haven for intellectual, cultural and artistic life, attracting artists from the whole Europe and the United States. With the release of the first Leica and Contax range-finder cameras, photographers took to the street and documented life by day and night. Such photographers as André Kertész, Brassaï, Henri Cartier-Bresson emerged during the period between the two world wars thanks to the Illustrated Press (''Vu'' and ''Regards''). Having been brought to notice by the Surrealists and Berenice Abbott, the life work of [[Eugène Atget]] in the empty streets of Paris also became a reference.

At the end of World War II, in 1946, French intellectuals [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[André Malraux]] embraced humanism;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. Funny Face: Humanism in Post-War French Photography and Philosophy. French Cultural Studies February 2005 vol. 16 no. 1 41-53&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre arguing that existentialism was a humanism entailing freedom of choice and a responsibility for defining oneself,&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J.-P. (1996) L’Existentialisme est un humanisme. Paris: Gallimard.&lt;/ref&gt; while at the [[Sorbonne University (alliance)|Sorbonne]] in an address sponsored by [[UNESCO]], Malraux depicted human culture as 'humanisme tragique', a battle against biological decay and historical disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Malraux, A. (1996) ‘L’Homme et la culture’, in J. Mossuz-Lavau (ed.), La Politique, la culture: discours, articles, entretiens (1925–1975), pp. 151–61. Paris: Gallimard.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging from brutal global conflict, survivors desired material and cultural reconstruction and the appeal of humanism was a return to the values of dignity, equality and tolerance symbolised in an international proclamation and adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] in [[Paris]] on 10 December 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M. (1989) ‘Humanism and National Unity: The Ideological Reconstruction of France’, in N. Hewitt (ed.), The Culture of Reconstruction: European Literature, Thought and Film, 1945–50, pp. 103–19. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; That the photographic image could become a universal language in accord with these principles was a notion circulated at a UNESCO conference in 1958 &lt;ref&gt;An international centre of photography and moving pictures was created, then, during the UNESCO General Conference in New Delhi, an international of film and television, non-profit organisation dedicated primarily to education, culture and development of the international associations concerned was proposed by the Italian delegation to UNESCO, with Professor Mario Verdone, and on 23 October 1958 the International Council for Cinema, Television and Audiovisual Communication charter was signed.&lt;/ref&gt;

As France in particular,&lt;ref&gt;Thézy (Marie de), La Photographie humaniste, 1930-1960. Histoire d’un mouvement en France, Paris, Contrejour, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  but also [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], emerged from the dark period of the Occupation (1940–4), the [[liberation of Paris]] in August 1944 released photographers to respond to reconstruction&lt;ref&gt;Reconstructions et modernisation.

(2001). " A poetry of the streets?" Documenting Frenchness in an Era of Reconstruction: Humanist Photography 1935-1960. In The Documentary Impulse in French Literature&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1940s and 50s saw a further influx of foreign photographers sympathetic to this movement, including [[Ed van der Elsken]] from the Netherlands who recorded the interactions at the bistrot Chez Moineau, the dirt-cheap refuge of bohemian youths and of [[Guy Debord]], [[Michèle Bernstein|Michele Bernstein]], [[Gil J Wolman|Gil J. Wolman]], [[Ivan Chtcheglov]] and the other members of the [[Letterist International]] and the emerging [[Situationists]] whose theory of the ''[[dérive]]''&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord (1955) Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography. Les Lèvres Nues #6 (Paris, September 1955). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; accords with the working method of the humanist [[Street photography|street photographer]].

This humanist artistic current continued into the late 1960s and early 70s, after which attention turned to photography as a fine art.

==Picture magazines, reportage and the photoessay==
Humanist photography emerged and spread after the rise of the mass circulation picture magazines in the 1920s and as photographers formed fraternities such as Le Groupe des XV (which exhibited annually 1946-1957),&lt;ref&gt;Paris 1950 photographié par le Groupe des XV ; Marie de Thézy ; Marcel Bovis ; Catherine Floc'hlay ; Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris ; Paris (France). Direction des affaires culturelles. 1982. (OCLC 50603400)&lt;/ref&gt; or joined [[Stock photography|agencies]] which promoted their work and fed the demand of the newspaper and magazine audiences, publishers and editors before the advent of television broadcasting which rapidly displaced these audiences at the close of the 1960s. These publications include the ''[[Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung]]'', [[Vu (magazine)|''Vu'']], ''Point de Vue'', ''[[Regards]]'', ''[[Paris Match]]'', ''[[Picture Post]]'', [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']], [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'']], ''Plaisir de France'' and [[Réalités (French magazine)|''Réalités'']] which competed to give ever larger space to photo-stories; extended articles and [[editorial]]s that were profusely illustrated, or that consisted solely of photographs with captions, often by a single photographer, who would be credited alongside the journalist, or who provided written copy as well as images.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Book cover for Jacques Prévert and Izis Biedermans "Gran Bal du Printemps", Lausanne, Eds. Clairfontaine, 1951.jpeg|thumbnail|Book cover for [[Jacques Prévert]] and [[Izis Bidermanas]] ''Grand Bal du Printemps'', Lausanne, Eds. Clairfontaine, 1951]] --&gt;

==Photobooks and literary connections==
Iconic books appeared including [[Robert Doisneau|Doisneau]]'s ''Banlieue de Paris'' (1949), [[Izis Bidermanas|Izis]]'s ''Paris des rêves'' (1950), [[Willy Ronis]]' ''Belleville‐Ménilmontant'' (1954) (see left), and Cartier‐Bresson's ''Images à la sauvette'' (1952); better known by its English title, which defines the photographic orientation of all these photographers, ''[[Henri Cartier-Bresson|The Decisive Moment]]'').

==Exhibitions==

National and international exposure of humanist photography was accelerated through exhibitions and of particular importance in this regard is [[The Family of Man]], a vast travelling exhibition curated by [[Edward Steichen]] for [[MoMA]], which presented a unifying humanist [[manifesto]] in the form of images selected from amongst, literally, a million. Thirty-one French photographs appeared in ''The Family of Man'', a contribution representing almost one-third of the European photography in the show.&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Gresh (2005) The European roots of The Family of Man , History of Photography, 29:4, 331-343, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2005.10442815&lt;/ref&gt;

Steichen said that based on his experience of meeting photographers in Europe as he sought images of ‘everydayness' which he defined as 'the beauty of the things that fill our lives',&lt;ref&gt;Minutes, meeting at MoMA, 29 October 1953, typescript in Edward Steichen Archive, The Museum of Modern Art, New York&lt;/ref&gt; for the exhibition, that the French were the only photographers who had thoroughly photographed scenes of daily life. These were practitioners he admired for their conveying 'tender simplicity, a sly humor, a warm enthusiasm ... and convincing aliveness'.&lt;ref&gt;Steichen quoted by Jacob Deschin, 'The Work of French Photographers', New York Times (23 December 1951), X14.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this exposure in ''The Family of Man'' inspired a new generation of humanist photographers.&lt;ref&gt;The exhibition, for example, inspired Sune Jonsson (Swedish, b. 1930) to become a photographer and influenced the nature of his work.

==Humanist photography outside France==
The movement is in marked contrast to the contemporaneous ‘art’ photography of the USA. However, there too ran a current of humanism in photography first begun in the early 20th century by [[Jacob Riis]], then [[Lewis Hine]], followed by the [[Farm Security Administration|FSA]] and the [[Photo League|New York Photo League]] [see the ''Harlem Project'' led by [[Aaron Siskind]]] photographers. Books were published such as those by [[Dorothea Lange]] and Paul Taylor (''An American Exodus'', 1939), [[Walker Evans]] and [[James Agee]] (''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'', 1941), [[Margaret Bourke-White]] and [[Erskine Caldwell]] (''[[You Have Seen Their Faces]]'', 1937), [[Arthur Rothstein]] and [[William Saroyan]] (''[[Look at Us|Look At Us]],...'', 1967). In spite of the Red Scare and McCarthyism in the 1950s (which banned the Photo League) it was promoted widely by [[The Family of Man]] exhibitions, and strongly apparent in [[W. Eugene Smith]]'s 1950s development of the photo essay, street photography by [[Helen Levitt]], [[Vivian Maier|Vivian Meier]] et al., and work by [[Bruce Davidson (photographer)|Bruce Davidson]] (incl. his ''East'' ''100th Street)'', Eugene Richards, and [[Mary Ellen Mark|Mary-Ellen Mark]] from the 50s to the 90s.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Mortenson (2014) The Ghost of Humanism: Rethinking the Subjective Turn in Postwar American Photography, History of Photography, 38:4, 418-434, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2014.899747&lt;/ref&gt; The seminal work by [[Robert Frank]], ''The Americans'' published in France in 1958 ([[Robert Delpire]]) and the USA the following year (Grove Press), the result of his two Guggenheim grants, can also be considered an extension of the humanist photography current in the USA which had a demonstrable impact on American photography.

==Characteristics==
Typically humanist photographers harness the photograph's combination of description and emotional [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] to both inform and move the viewer, who may [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] with the subject; their images are appreciated as continuing the pre-war tradition of photo reportage as social or documentary records of human experience. It is praised for expressing of humanist values such as [[empathy]], [[solidarity]], sometimes humor, and mutual respect in recognition of the photographer, usually an editorial [[freelancer]], as [[Auteur theory|auteur]] on a par with other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Chevrier, J.-F. (1987a) ‘Photographie 1947: le poids de la tradition', in J.-L. Daval (ed.), L'Art en Europe: les années décisives 1945–1953, pp. 177–89. Geneva: Skira/Musée d'art moderne de Saint-Étienne&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in technology supported these characteristics. The Ermanox with its fast {{f/|1.8}} and {{f/|2}} lenses (6&amp;nbsp;cm x 4.5 cm format, 1924) and the [[35mm format|35mm]] [[Leica Camera|Leica]], 1925) camera, miniaturized and portable, had become available by the end of the 1920s, followed by the [[Medium format (film)|medium-format]] [[Rolleiflex]] (1929), and the 35mm [[Contax]] (1936). They revolutionized the practice of [[documentary photography]] and reportage by enabling the photographer to shoot quickly and unobtrusively in all conditions, to seize the "decisive moment" which [[Henri Cartier-Bresson|Cartier-Bresson]] defined as "the whole essence, in the confines of one single photograph, of some situation that was in the process of unrolling itself before my eyes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Cartier-Bresson, Henri | author2=Matisse, Henri, 1869-1954 | author3=Tériade, E | author4=Lang, Marguerite | title=The decisive moment : photography | publication-date=1952 | publisher=Simon and Schuster | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9145040 | accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus support [[Cornell Capa]]'s notion of "concerned photography", described as "work committed to contributing to or understanding humanity's well-being".&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Capa, ed., The Concerned Photographer (vols. 1-2), New York: Grossman Publishers 1968, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Metaphysics]]''' is the branch of [[philosophy]] that investigates principles of reality transcending those of any particular science. [[cosmology (metaphysics)|Cosmology]] and [[ontology]] are traditional branches of metaphysics. It is concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of [[being]] and the [[World (philosophy)|world]].&lt;ref name="BECA"&gt;Geisler, Norman L. "Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics" page 446. Baker Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who studies metaphysics can be called either a "metaphysician" or a "metaphysicist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/metaphysicist Random House Dictionary Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dame Jean Iris Murdoch''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|DBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɜr|d|ɒ|k}}; 15 July 1919 – 8 February 1999) was an Irish-born British novelist and philosopher. Murdoch is best known for her novels about good and evil, sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious. Her first published novel, ''[[Under the Net]]'', was selected in 1998 as one of [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|Modern Library's 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]]. In 1987, she was made a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]. Her books include ''[[The Bell (novel)|The Bell]]'' (1958), ''[[A Severed Head]]'' (1961), ''[[The Red and the Green]]'' (1965), ''[[The Nice and the Good]]'' (1968), ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'' (1973), ''[[Henry and Cato]]'' (1976), ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]'' (1978, Booker Prize), ''[[The Philosopher's Pupil]]'' (1983), ''[[The Good Apprentice]]'' (1985), ''[[The Book and the Brotherhood]]'' (1987), ''[[The Message to the Planet]]'' (1989), and ''[[The Green Knight (novel)|The Green Knight]]'' (1993).

==Life==
Murdoch was born in [[Phibsborough]], [[Dublin]], Ireland, the daughter of Irene Alice ([[née]] Richardson, 1899–1985)&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyers|first1=Jeffrey|title=Remembering Iris Murdoch: Letters and Interviews|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9781137352415|accessdate=1 June 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtQl_UyY928C&amp;pg=PT24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207070113/https://books.google.com/books?id=qtQl_UyY928C&amp;pg=PT24|archivedate=7 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wills John Hughes Murdoch. Her father, a [[civil service|civil servant]], came from a mainly [[Presbyterian]] sheep farming family from [[Hillhall]], [[County Down]]. In 1915, he enlisted as a soldier in [[King Edward's Horse]] and served in France during the [[World War I|First World War]] before being commissioned as a [[Second lieutenant]]. Her mother had trained as a singer before Iris was born, and was from a middle-class [[Church of Ireland]] family in Dublin. Iris Murdoch's parents first met in Dublin when her father was on leave and were married in 1918.&lt;ref name=Conradi2001&gt;{{cite book | last = Conradi | first = Peter J. | title = Iris Murdoch : A Life | publisher = Norton | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 0393048756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} Iris was the couple's only child. When she was a few weeks old the family moved to London, where her father had joined the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] as a second-class [[clerk]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.

Murdoch was educated in progressive [[independent school]]s, entering the [[Ibstock Place School|Froebel Demonstration School]] in 1925 and attending [[Badminton School]] in Bristol as a boarder from 1932 to 1938. In 1938 she went up to [[Somerville College, Oxford]], with the intention of studying English, but switched to "[[Greats]]", a course of study combining classics, ancient history, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Susan |first1=Brown |last2=Patricia |first2=Clements |last3=Isobel |first3=Grundy |title=Iris Murdoch |url=http://orlando.cambridge.org |website=Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford she studied philosophy with [[Donald M.

In June 1944 she left the Treasury and went to work for the [[UNRRA]]. At first she was stationed in London at the agency's European Regional Office. In 1945 she was transferred first to [[Brussels]], then to [[Innsbruck]], and finally to [[Graz]], Austria, where she worked in a refugee camp. She left the UNRRA in 1946.&lt;ref name=Conradi2001/&gt;{{rp|245}}

From 1947 to 1948 Iris Murdoch studied philosophy as a postgraduate at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. She met [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] at Cambridge but did not hear him lecture, as he had left his [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] professorship before she arrived.&lt;ref name=Conradi2001 /&gt;{{rp|262–263}}&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Conradi|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J.

From 1963 to 1967 she taught one day a week in the General Studies department at the [[Royal College of Art]].&lt;ref name=Conradi2001 /&gt;{{rp|469}}

In 1956 Murdoch married [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], a literary critic, novelist, and from 1974 to 1992 Warton Professor of English at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], whom she had met in Oxford in 1954.

Murdoch in contrast had "multiple affairs with both men and women which, on discomposing occasions, [Bayley] witnessed for himself".&lt;ref name="econ_Ofli"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Of literature and love| author = Ann Wroe| work = The Economist| date = 31 January 2015| accessdate = 15 February 2015| url = https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21641126-john-bayley-english-don-literary-critic-and-husband-iris-murdoch-died-january-12th| quote = Sex did not feature much...| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150207163300/http://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21641126-john-bayley-english-don-literary-critic-and-husband-iris-murdoch-died-january-12th| archivedate = 7 February 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tele_Thes"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The secrets of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley's unconventional marriage| author = Archer, Graeme| work = The Telegraph| date = 23 January 2015| accessdate = 3 March 2015| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/11362805/The-secrets-of-Iris-Murdoch-and-John-Bayleys-unconventional-marriage.html| quote = | deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150403013903/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/11362805/The-secrets-of-Iris-Murdoch-and-John-Bayleys-unconventional-marriage.html| archivedate = 3 April 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iris Murdoch's first novel, ''[[Under the Net]]'', was published in 1954. She had previously published essays on philosophy, and the first [[monograph]] about [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] published in English. She went on to produce 25 more novels and additional works of philosophy, as well as poetry and drama. In 1976 she was named to the Commander of [[Order of the British Empire]] and in 1987 was made a Dame Commander of Order of the British Empire.&lt;ref name=Conradi2001 /&gt;{{rp|571, 575}} She was awarded [[honorary degree]]s by the [[University of Bath]] (DLitt,1983),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/ |title=Honorary Graduates 1989 to present &amp;#124; University of Bath |publisher=Bath.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=29 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061336/http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/ |archivedate=17 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Cambridge (1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/degrees/honorary/recipients.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201183233/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/degrees/honorary/recipients.html |date=1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kingston University]] (1994), among others.

==Work==

===Philosophy===
For some time, Murdoch's influence and achievements as a philosopher were eclipsed by her success as a novelist, but recent appraisals have increasingly accorded her a substantial role in postwar Anglo-American philosophy, particularly for her unfashionably prescient work in moral philosophy and her reinterpretation of Aristotle and Plato. [[Martha Nussbaum]] has argued for Murdoch's "transformative impact on the discipline" of moral philosophy because she directed her analysis not at the once-dominant matters of will and choice, but at those of attention (how people learn to see and conceive of one another) and phenomenal experience (how the sensory "thinginess" of life shapes moral sensibility).&lt;ref name="NussbaumNR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|authorlink1=Martha Nussbaum|title=When she was good|journal=New Republic|date=31 December 2001|volume=225|pages=28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent survey of Murdoch's philosophical work, Justin Broackes points to several distinctive features of Murdoch's moral philosophy, including a "[[moral realism]] or 'naturalism', allowing into the world cases of such properties as humility or generosity; an anti‐scientism; a rejection of [[David Hume|Humean]] moral psychology; a sort of 'particularism'; special attention to the virtues; and emphasis on the metaphor of moral perception or 'seeing' moral facts."&lt;ref name=Broakesabstract&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-928990-5| last = Broackes| first = Justin.| title = Iris Murdoch, philosopher: a collection of essays| chapter = Introduction| location = Oxford, England| date = 2012| url = http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199289905.001.0001/acprof-9780199289905| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126115959/http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199289905.001.0001/acprof-9780199289905| archivedate = 26 November 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broackes also notes that Murdoch's influence on the discipline of philosophy was sometimes indirect, since it impacted both her contemporaries and the following generation of philosophers, particularly Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Bernard Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broackes|first1=Justin|title="Introduction," Iris Murdoch, Philosopher|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199289905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her philosophical work was influenced by [[Simone Weil]] (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by [[Plato]], under whose banner she claimed to fight.&lt;ref name=sovereignty&gt;{{cite book | last = Murdoch | first = Iris | title = The Sovereignty of Good | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780415253994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}} In re-animating Plato, she gives force to the reality of the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality.  From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] ('early' and 'late').  Her most central parable, which appears in ''[[The Sovereignty of Good]]'', asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), "to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D."&lt;ref name="NussbaumNR" /&gt; This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D "justly or lovingly".&lt;ref name=perfection&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Murdoch | first1 = Iris | title = Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on Philosophy and Literature | chapter = The Idea of Perfection | editors = Peter Conradi (Ed) | publisher = Chatto &amp; Windus | year = 1997 | location = London |isbn=0701166290}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|317}}  The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including [[R. M. Hare]] and [[Stuart Hampshire]]) the importance of the 'inner' life to moral action.  Seeing another aright can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.

===Fiction===
Her novels, in their attention and generosity to the inner lives of individuals, follow the tradition of novelists like [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], besides showing an abiding love of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].   There is however great variety in her achievement, and the richly layered structure and compelling realistic comic imagination of  ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'' (1973) is very different from the early comic work ''[[Under the Net]]'' (1954) or ''[[The Unicorn (novel)|The Unicorn]]'' (1963). ''The Unicorn'' can be read as a sophisticated [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[Romance novel|romance]], or as a novel with Gothic trappings, or perhaps as a parody of the Gothic mode of writing. ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'', for which Murdoch won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]], is a study of [[Hypersexuality|erotic obsession]], and the text becomes more complicated, suggesting multiple interpretations, when subordinate characters contradict the narrator and the mysterious "editor" of the book in a series of afterwords. Though her novels differ markedly, and her style developed, themes recur.  Her novels often include upper-middle-class male intellectuals caught in moral dilemmas, gay characters, refugees, Anglo-Catholics with crises of faith, empathetic pets, curiously "knowing" children and sometimes a powerful and almost demonic male "enchanter" who imposes his will on the other characters—a type of man Murdoch is said to have modelled on her lover, the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[Elias Canetti]].&lt;ref name=Conradi2001/&gt;{{rp|350–352}}

Murdoch was awarded the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] in 1978 for ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]'', a finely detailed novel about the power of love and loss, featuring a retired stage director who is overwhelmed by jealousy when he meets his erstwhile lover after several decades apart.  An authorised collection of her poetic writings, ''Poems by Iris Murdoch'', appeared in 1997, edited by [[Paul Hullah]] and Yozo Muroya. Several of her works have been adapted for the screen, including the British television series of her novels ''[[An Unofficial Rose]]'' and ''[[The Bell (novel)|The Bell]]''. [[J. B. Priestley]]'s dramatisation of her 1961 novel ''[[A Severed Head]]'' starred [[Ian Holm]] and [[Richard Attenborough]].

In 1997, she was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |author= |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121020544/http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature/ |archivedate=21 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critics and theorists have given her mixed reviews. [[Harold Bloom]] wrote in his 1986 review of ''[[The Good Apprentice]]'' that no other contemporary British novelist seemed of her 'eminence', and that she would be remembered for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/20/specials/murdoch-apprentice.html&lt;/ref&gt; A. S. Byatt called her 'unmatched in world literature since her death', and listed her as a source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/99/06/13/specials/byatt-possessed.html&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], in his influential work ''How Fiction Works'' said: 'In her literary and philosophical criticism, she again and again stresses that the creation of free and independent characters is the mark of a great novelist; yet her own characters never have this freedom.' He stressed that some authors, 'like [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Anthony Trollope|Trollope]], [[Honore de Balzac|Balzac]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]', wrote about people different to themselves by choice, whereas others, such as '[[Henry James|James]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[D. H. Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]]', have more interest in the self. Wood called Murdoch 'poignant', because she spent her whole life in writing in the latter category, whilst she struggled to fit herself into the former. Similarly, Sam Jordison, creator of the poll ''[[Crap Towns]]'', declared that, though her works had merit, she engaged in 'scenes of absurd melodrama', and moaned of her 'mystical bollocks'. He did, however, praise Murdoch's comic set pieces, and her portrayal of self-deceit. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/feb/10/iris-murdoch-sea-booker&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Murdoch won a scholarship to study at [[Vassar College]] in 1946, but was refused a visa to enter the United States because she had joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1938, while a student at Oxford. She left the party in 1942, when she went to work at the Treasury, but remained sympathetic to communism for several years.&lt;ref name=Conradi2001/&gt;{{rp|172}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Todd | first1 = Richard | title = Iris Murdoch | publisher = Methuen | year = 1984 | location = London | isbn = 0416354203 | quote = Here, like many other intellectuals in the 1930s, she became a member of the Communist Party; she later resigned in disillusion, but remained for a long time close to the Left.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} In later years she was allowed to visit the United States, but always had to obtain a waiver from the provisions of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952#Provisions|McCarran Act]], which barred Communist Party members and former members from entering the country.  In a 1990 [[Paris Review]] interview she said that her membership of the Communist Party had made her see "how strong and how awful it [Marxism] is, certainly in its organized form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Iris Murdoch: The Art of Fiction No. 117 | journal = Paris Review | date = Summer 1990 | first = Jeffrey | last = Meyers | issue = 115 | pages = 206–224 | id =  | url = http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2313/the-art-of-fiction-no-117-iris-murdoch | accessdate = 20 June 2012 | quote = But it was just as well, in a way, to have seen the inside of Marxism because then one realizes how strong and how awful it is, certainly in its organized form. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120630133530/http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2313/the-art-of-fiction-no-117-iris-murdoch | archivedate = 30 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}}

Aside from her Communist Party membership, her Irish heritage is the other sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that seems to attract interest.  Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch does not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin: "No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness.  Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish... [but] with both parents brought up in Ireland, and an ancestry within Ireland both North and South going back three centuries, Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American".&lt;ref name=Conradi2001/&gt;{{rp|24}}  Conradi notes A.N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in ''[[The Red and the Green]]'', and a competing defence of the book at [[Caen]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=Conradi2001/&gt;{{rp|465}} The novel, while broad of sympathy, is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of [[Ian Paisley]], Iris Murdoch stated "[he] sincerely condemns violence and did not intend to incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12–15 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep in my soul, I'm afraid."&lt;ref name=Conradi2001/&gt;{{rp|465}}  In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher [[Philippa Foot]], she remarked in 1978 that she felt "unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred"  and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that "the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Brown | title = Iris Murdoch Letters Reveal Love for Close Friend Philippa Foot | date = 31 August 2012 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/irish-murdoch-letters-philippa-foot | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 4 September 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141008201658/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/irish-murdoch-letters-philippa-foot | archivedate = 8 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographies and memoirs==
[[Peter J. Conradi]]'s 2001 biography was the fruit of long research and authorised access to journals and other papers.  It is also a labour of love, and of a friendship with Murdoch that extended from a meeting at her [[Gifford Lectures]] to her death.  The book was well received. [[John Updike]] commented: "There would be no need to complain of [[Biography in literature|literary biographies]] [...] if they were all as good".&lt;ref name=Updike&gt;{{Cite news| last = Updike| first = John| title = Young Iris| authorlink = John Updike| work = [[The New Yorker]]| accessdate = 17 February 2015| date = 1 October 2001| url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/10/01/young-iris| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150217223023/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/10/01/young-iris| archivedate = 17 February 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text addresses many popular questions about Murdoch, such as how Irish she was, what her politics were, etc.  Though not a trained philosopher, Conradi's interest in Murdoch's achievement as a thinker is evident in the biography, and yet more so in his earlier work of literary criticism ''The Saint and the Artist: A Study of Iris Murdoch's Works'' (Macmillan 1986, HarperCollins 2001).  He also recalled his personal encounters with Murdoch in ''Going Buddhist: Panic and Emptiness, the Buddha and Me''. (Short Books, 2005). Conradi's archive of material on Murdoch, together with Iris Murdoch's Oxford library, is held at [[Kingston University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fass.kingston.ac.uk/research/iris-murdoch/ Centre for Iris Murdoch Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093027/http://fass.kingston.ac.uk/research/iris-murdoch/ |date=17 December 2008 }} Kingston University, Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of Murdoch's life with a different ambition is given by [[A. N. Wilson]] in his 2003 book ''Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her''. The work was described by [[Galen Strawson]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "mischievously revelatory" and labelled by Wilson himself as an "anti-biography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,1036391,00.html|title=Telling Tales|publisher=The Guardian|last=Strawson|first=Galen|date=6 September 2003|accessdate=19 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521034217/http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,1036391,00.html|archivedate=21 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson eschews objectivity, but is careful to stress his affection for his subject. Wilson remarks that Murdoch "had clearly been one of those delightful young women... who was prepared to go to bed with almost anyone".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;{{rp|59}}   While Murdoch's thought is an inspiration for Conradi, Wilson treats Murdoch's philosophical work as at best a distraction.  In a [[BBC Radio 4]] discussion of Murdoch and her work in 2009, Wilson stated his opinion, with which he acknowledged that "no doctor would agree", that Murdoch's struggle to complete her late philosophical book, ''Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals'', reduced her to despair and precipitated her into Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = BBC Radio 4| title = An Unofficial Iris| accessdate = 30 August 2015| date = 27 June 2009| time = 48:00| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00l953t| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827154746/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00l953t| archivedate = 27 August 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Bayley wrote two memoirs of his life with Iris Murdoch. ''Iris: A Memoir'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1998, shortly before her death. The American edition, which was published in 1999, was called ''[[Elegy for Iris]]''. A sequel entitled ''Iris and the Friends'' was published in 1999, after her death. Murdoch was portrayed by [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Judi Dench]] in [[Richard Eyre]]'s film ''[[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' (2001), based on Bayley's memories of his wife as she developed Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Schudel| first = Matt| title = John Bayley, who stirred controversy with his intimate memoir of his wife, dies at 89| work = [[The Washington Post]]| accessdate = 20 February 2015| date = 21 January 2015| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/john-bayley-who-stirred-controvery-with-his-intimate-memoir-of-his-wife-dies-at-89/2015/01/21/91e29c8e-a19c-11e4-b146-577832eafcb4_story.html| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150220203951/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/john-bayley-who-stirred-controvery-with-his-intimate-memoir-of-his-wife-dies-at-89/2015/01/21/91e29c8e-a19c-11e4-b146-577832eafcb4_story.html| archivedate = 20 February 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jakob Klatzkin''', '''Yakov/Jakub Klaczkin''' ({{lang-he|יעקב קלצקין}}; {{lang-ru|link=no|Яков Клачкин}}) (October 3, 1882, [[Biaroza]], [[Grodno Governorate]], now [[Belarus]] – March 26, 1948, [[Vevey]], [[Switzerland]]) was a [[Jewish philosopher]], publicist, author, and publisher.

== Life ==
Klatzkin was born in [[Byaroza]]-Kartuskaya, a son of the local [[Rabbi]] Eliyahu Klatzkin. He received his early schooling from his father and yeshivas in Lithuania. Later he traveled to Germany to study with philosopher Hermann Cohen. Klatzkin received his doctorate from the University of Berne in Switzerland, then returned to Germany to write for Hebrew periodicals and establish Jewish publishing firms. He also served as director of the Jewish National Fund in Cologne.

He wrote widely on the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza and compiled 10 of 15 anticipated volumes of the German Encyclopaedia Judaica with Nahum Goldmann.  

After the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Klatzkin fled to Switzerland and earned a living giving lectures on various Jewish subjects. He moved to the United States in 1941 and continued to teach in Chicago at the College of Jewish Studies. He returned to Switzerland in 1947 and died there at the age of 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/brisman/bookplate/item/8255 |title=Bookplate of Jakob Klatzkin (Rare Books of the Shimeon Brisman Collection in Jewish Studies, Washington University) |accessdate=June 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619221156/http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/brisman/bookplate/item/8255 |archivedate=June 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
He rejected the notion of chosenness for the Jewish people, either religious or secular. He argued that the only meaningful goal for Zionism was regaining the land of Israel and normalizing the conditions of Jewish existence. He believed that assimilationists were "traitors to their Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Lewisohn (2007) ''Rebirth – A Book of Modern Jewish Thought'' READ BOOKS, {{ISBN|1-4067-4857-9}} p 170&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized [[Ahad Ha-Am]] for the notion that morality was the key to Israel's uniqueness. He believed that ethics are universal, not the possession of a particular people. He maintained that the spiritual definition of Judaism denied freedom of thought and led to national chauvinism.

'''Joseph Zalman Margolis''' (born May 16, 1924) is an American [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. A radical [[Historicism|historicist]], he has published many books critical of the central assumptions of [[Western philosophy]], and has elaborated a robust form of [[relativism]].

His philosophical affinities include [[Protagoras]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]], [[John Dewey]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V. Quine]].

== Biography ==
Joseph Margolis was the son of [[American Jews|Jewish immigrants]] from central [[Europe]]. His father, a dentist, read widely in [[literature]] and was proficient in four languages.

Margolis served in [[World War II]] as a [[paratrooper]] and was wounded during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], where he lost his only brother, a twin. He studied at [[Columbia University]], earning the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1950) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] (1953) in philosophy. His contemporaries at Columbia have included the art theorist [[Arthur C. Danto]] and the philosopher Marx Wartofsky.

Margolis has taught at numerous universities in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]] and has lectured throughout [[Europe]], in [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. Since 1991, he has held the [[Laura H. Carnell]] Chair of Philosophy at [[Temple University]].&lt;ref&gt;For a list of the many associations of which Margolis is a member, see [http://www.pragmatism.org/library/margolis/margolis.htm pragmatism.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205092933/http://www.pragmatism.org/library/margolis/margolis.htm |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Margolis was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

===Introduction===
As set out in ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'' (California, 1995), Margolis holds that philosophy is concerned principally with three things:

# what we assume to be the nature of the real world, and why;
# what we assume to be how much we might know about the real world, and why;
# and after having answered those questions as best we can, how we should live out our lives, and why.

He sees the [[history of philosophy]] concerning these three questions of [[reality]], [[knowledge]] and [[ethics]] as a gradual movement away from the idea that any of these three realms is changeless and towards an increasing acceptance of real change infecting all three spheres.  Margolis emphasizes that [[legitimation]] is philosophy's principal task.

Margolis defends the Protagorean dictum that "man is the measure of all things", arguing that all changeless first principles must give way to consensual, though not criterial, truth claims. Since "man", the measure, is himself a creature of [[history]], no modal claims of invariance can possibly be sustained. Margolis further avers that there need be no fixities either ''de re'' or ''de dicto'' or ''de cogitatione''. The world is a flux and our thought about it is also in flux. Margolis sees the whole history of [[Western philosophy]] as a struggle between the advocates of change and those who either, like [[Parmenides]], deny that change is intelligible, or those, like [[Heraclitus]], who find some ''[[logos]]'' or [[law]] which allegedly governs whatever changes are admitted. He has argued that cognitive privilege of the changeless lingers even in relatively pragmatic philosophy such as the work of W.V. Quine. Nonetheless, Margolis proposes possible modes of legitimation even under the ubiquity of flux. Contrary to [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] philosophers like [[Richard Rorty]] or [[Jean-François Lyotard]], he argues that our lack of cognitive privilege means that the need for philosophical justification becomes more, not less, pressing.

Margolis began close to the so-called [[Analytic philosophy|analytical school]] of English-speaking philosophy but his mature work draws freely on both analytic and [[Continental philosophy]].  In large part this disciplinary eclecticism reflects his ambition to overcome the apparent opposition between the [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] tradition of analytic philosophy and the [[Humanism|humanistic]] tradition of Continental philosophy.

To achieve this, Margolis treats the "natural" as [[Ontology|ontologically]] prior to the [[Culture|cultural]], while emphasizing that we only know [[nature]] via cultural means, hence, that the cultural is [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] prior to the natural.  This position is developed at length in his ''Selves and Other Texts'' (Penn State, 2001).

His philosophical pursuits, expressed programmatically, are:

# a critique of most mainstream Western philosophers, classical and modern;
# the advocacy of a consistent form of relativism;
# the defence of a radical historicism, which avoids the pitfalls of past historicisms, such as those of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], or [[Michel Foucault]];
# and an account of how legitimation functions under his historicist conditions.

===Themes===
Margolis has published more than thirty books, on a variety of topics in philosophy.  In ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'' (California, 1995), he argues that philosophy uncritically adopts the Platonic-Aristotelian view that "necessarily, reality is invariantly structured and, when known, discernibly known to be such".  Beginning with his counterproposal - "(2.1) It is not in any way conceptually necessary that reality possess invariant structures or an invariant nature" - Margolis gradually traces out an alternative view.  For instance, Margolis argues that [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the [[Law of noncontradiction|principle of non-contradiction]] presupposes the changelessness of individual things rather than providing any proof of the alleged law. In Margolis's view non-contradiction applies to "sentential formulas" and not to "meaningful sentences", since discourse in use may always offset any seeming contradiction via re-interpretation, as is routinely done in science (for instance, in the case of the wave theory versus the corpuscular theory of light). In other words, there is no conceptual necessity to accept a strictly bivalent logic; our logics depend, in a deep sense, on what we pre-thinkingly take the real world to be like. Hence, there is no reason to disallow relativism at all, for the world may well be the kind of place where incongruent judgments - judgments which on a bivalent reading would be "true" or "false", but are now no longer so, adhering to a many valued logic, one consisting of more than two exclusive [[truth-value]]s - are all that creatures such as ourselves may ever hope to legitimate.

Margolis goes on to examine reference and predication as our ability to probe and communicate the results of our probings. Constative discourse – the making of statements of fact — for instance need only rely on identification, and reidentification, of items for it to prove effective in use. Therefore, historical memory and consensus, together with a narratizing ability, are all that are necessary to ensure the stability of what we make reference to, there need be nothing essential at all in things themselves, for our constative discourse to be able to flourish and even thrive. Margolis inveighs against postmodernists of Rorty’s stamp, claiming that they risk disabling constative discourse in their objectivist fears of privilege. There need be, according to Margolis, no conceptual privilege involved in making statements, nor in the justifications proferred for the statements made.

Still, Margolis emphasizes that justifications cannot be dispensed with, as any statement implies a whole set of beliefs about the way the world is and about how we know that. We must legitimize our statements as best we can, else we should never know why we should choose some over others, nor should we know how to proceed to make other statements building upon, but going beyond, our original exemplars.

The key to how we in fact "go on" is to be found in Margolis's major postulate of ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'': "Thinking is a History".   Making meaningful reference within constative discourse is a thoroughly historical skill. What we predicate - about what is thus referred to - is likewise historical.  Margolis argues that the struggle to entrench changelessness either in human thought or human nature or physical nature has, in large part, been a futile struggle against acknowledging the lack of any fixed-kind nature of the human being.  It is futile, Margolis claims, in that we have no natures but are histories.  Nevertheless, Margolis admits that there are enough man-made would-be stabilities and fixities to go round. There is the habituating weight of the customary, the slow change in human languages, the inertia of institutions.

Margolis acknowledges that the historized "nature" of the human—and therefore of truth, of judgment, of reality, and the rest - is not his own discovery, but criticizes most previous versions of historicism as falling victim to some theological or teleological yearning, as in Hegel's ''Geist'', Marx's utopianism, or Heidegger's history of being.  In Margolis's view, the truth claims of earlier historical epochs are given their historical weight, from our own historical present, our own truth claims regarding theirs are subject to our own bias and blindness, but ours must still be legitimated as best we can legitimate them, taking into account as far as humanly possible – though never overcoming - our limited horizon via self-critique.

Margolis claims that five philosophical themes have gathered momentum from the time of Kant on. They are:

# Reality is cognitively intransparent. That is, everything we say about the world must pass through our conceptual schemes and the limits of our language, hence there is no way of knowing whether what we say "corresponds" to what there is; what the world is like independent of our investigating it;
# The structure of reality and the structure of thought are symbiotized. That is, there is no way of knowing how much of the apparent intelligibility of the world is a contribution of the mind and how much the world itself contributes to that seeming intelligibility;
# Thinking has a history. That is, all we take to be universal, rational, logical, necessary, right behaviour, laws of nature, and so on, are changing artifacts of the historical existence of different societies and societal groups. All are open to change and all are the sites of hegemonic struggle;
# The structure of thinking is preformed. That is, our thinking is formed by the enculturing process by which human babies become adults. The infant begins in a holistic space which is immediately parsed according to the norms and conduct and language she is brought up in. By taking part in the process, we alter it, alter ourselves, and alter the conditions for the next generation;
# Human culture, including human beings, are socially constructed or socially constituted. That is, they have no natures, but are (referentially) or have (predicatively) histories, narratized careers.

He embraces all five themes separately and conjointly, defends them all, and concludes that our future investigations of ourselves and of our world risk ignoring them at our own peril.  His own investigations into "ourselves" have proceeded with a focus on a consideration of the arts as an expression of human being. In ''What, After All, Is a Work of Art'' (1999) and ''Selves and Other Texts'' (2001), he elaborated upon his earlier work on the ontological similarity between human persons and artworks. The latter
– defined as "physically embodied, culturally emergent entities" – he treats as examples of "human utterance". Margolis argues that the cultural world is a semantically and semiotically dense domain, filled with self-interpreting texts, acts and artifacts.

===Affinities and critique===

Margolis has philosophical affinities with Hegel, Marx, Peirce, John Dewey, the later Wittgenstein, and Michel Foucault. From Hegel and Marx, he takes on their historicism without their teleologisms, or theories of some historical goal. From Peirce, he takes the idea of Secondness, the brute thingness of things which guides our sense of reality. With Dewey, he shares the conviction that philosophy should never exceed "natural" bounds. With Wittgenstein, he holds that "what has to be accepted, the given, is – so one could say - forms of life" (PI; 226).  Finally, Margolis sees Foucault's "historical a-priori" as a fair replacement for Kant's transcendental a-priori.

Margolis has extensively criticized what he sees as [[scientism]] in philosophy, singling out thinkers such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Paul Churchland]], [[Jerry Fodor]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] as modern-day defenders of invariance.

{{nihongo|'''Matsudaira Sadanobu'''|松平 定信||January 15, 1759 – June 14, 1829}} Japanese ''[[daimyō]]'' of the [[Edo period|mid-Edo period]], famous for his financial reforms which saved the [[Shirakawa Domain]], and the similar reforms he undertook during his tenure as chief {{nihongo|[[rōjū|senior councilor]]|老中首座|rōjū shuza}} of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], from 1787 to 1793.

==Early life==

Sadanobu was born in Edo Castle on January 15, 1759, into the [[Tayasu]] branch of the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa]] house. The Tayasu was one of the ''[[gosankyō]]'', the seniormost of the lesser cadet branches of the Shōgun's family, which still bore the name Tokugawa (instead of the cadet branches which had the Matsudaira surname).&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, Herman. (1975). ''Charismatic Bureaucrat: A Political Biography of Matsudaira Sadanobu, 1758–1829'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was Tayasu Munetake, the son of the reform-minded eighth shōgun [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]].&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tayasu house stood apart from the other cadet branches resident in Edo Castle, living a more austere lifestyle, following the example set by Yoshimune—in Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit (''masuraoburi'') as opposed to feminine spirit (''taoyameburi'').&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; It also set itself apart from the other branches due to its history of thwarted political ambition—the founder, Munetake, had hoped to become his father's heir but was passed over for Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige. As a result, Sadanobu was brought up from a very young age with the hopes of being placed as the next shogunal heir. His education was very thorough, being done along Confucian lines, and by his teens Sadanobu had already read and memorized much of the Confucian canon. As he matured, there was a further onus on Sadanobu for success as several members of the Tayasu house began to die young. Further attempts were made by the family to place Sadanobu as the next shogunal heir, but they were thwarted by the political clique of [[Tanuma Okitsugu]], who was then in power as the chief [[rōjū]].

==Career==

Following the last failed attempt at adoption by the shōgun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni, head of one of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira houses (another Tokugawa cadet branch), which ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern [[Mutsu Province]] (with an assessment of 110,000 ''[[koku]]''), succeeding to headship in late 1783 following his stepfather's protracted illness.&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, pp. 17, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; He was immediately faced with his domain's economically disastrous position: of 110,000 ''koku'' that it was supposed to be able to produce, 108,600 had been reported "lost".&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Sadanobu worked ceaselessly to fix the economic situation in Shirakawa, finally saving it and bringing its finances and agriculture back to stability. These reforms, coupled with Sadanobu's continued political maneuvering, brought him fame, and he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787, and regent to the 11th shōgun [[Tokugawa Ienari]] early the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, Conrad. (1988) ''Politics in the Tokugawa Bakufu, 1600–1843,'' p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

This period of Sadanobu's strengthening of the already faltering Tokugawa regime is known as the [[Kansei Reforms]]. His policies could as well be construed as a reactionary response to the execesses of his predecessor under Shōgun Ieharu.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, J. (1955). ''Tanuma Okitsugu: Forerunner of Modern Japan, 1719–1788''. pp. 131–142.&lt;/ref&gt;  He recovered the finances of the Shogunate to some extent, and had some success in rescuing its reputation. However, following the [[Title Incident]] and the visit of [[Adam Laxman]], Sadanobu's credibility and popularity in the Tokugawa bureaucracy became overtaxed, and true to the suggestion in his autobiography that "one should retire before discontent sets in", he resigned.&lt;ref name="o152"&gt;Ooms, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary Skill==

Aside from his political reforms, Sadanobu was also known as a writer and a moralist, working under the pen name ''Rakuō'' (楽翁). Some of his notable texts include ''Uge no Hitokoto'', ''Tōzen Manpitsu'', ''Kanko-dōri'', ''Kagetsutei Nikki'', ''Seigo'', and ''Ōmu no Kotoba'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after his death, it was discovered that he had written a satirical text parodying ''[[daimyō]]'' life, titled ''Daimyō Katagi''. Scholars have since been somewhat taken aback by this discovery, since the text falls into the category of ''[[gesaku]]'', which Sadanobu officially opposed.

==Later years==

Though Sadanobu resigned from his position on the senior council, he continued to keep up with political affairs, especially keeping in close touch with [[Matsudaira Nobuaki]] (his successor in the senior council), as well as the rector of the Shogunate's college, [[Hayashi Jussai]], whom he had personally installed in that position.&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; During these last few years of his rule in Shirakawa, he was also involved in matters of national defense, taking up security duties on the [[Bōsō Peninsula]] in 1810 together with [[Matsudaira Katahiro]] of [[Aizu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; In domainal matters, Sadanobu continued to devote himself to the reforms he had established, as well as to education.&lt;ref name="o152" /&gt; He retired from the family headship in 1819, and was succeeded by his son Sadanaga.&lt;ref name="o152" /&gt; Sadanobu died in 1829, and according to his will, his son petitioned the Yoshida family in Kyoto to grant him the deified title of ''Shukoku-daimyōjin''.&lt;ref name="o152" /&gt; This was granted in three stages, in 1833, 1834, and 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, p. 44n; 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Sadanobu was enshrined together with the Hisamatsu founder Sadatsuna, [[Sugawara no Michizane]], and two other figures, in the Chinkoku-Shukoku shrine.&lt;ref name="o44n"&gt;Ooms, p. 44n&lt;/ref&gt; This shrine has branches both in Kuwana, where Sadanaga was transferred, and in Sadanobu's former fief of Shirakawa, where the shrine was built in 1918.&lt;ref name="o44n" /&gt;

One of Sadanaga's sons, [[Itakura Katsukiyo]], became almost as famous as his grandfather in the late Edo era, due to his attempted reforms of the Shogunate.

'''Max Müller''' (6 September 1906 – 18 October 1994) was a German philosopher and influential post–[[World War II]] Catholic intellectual. Müller was Professor at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].

==Life==
Max Müller was born as the son of a jurist and completed his Gymnasium-Abitur in Freiburg at the [[Friedrich-Gymnasium Freiburg]].  Müller graduated in 1930 along with the philosopher [[Martin Honecker]]. He established himself in 1937 with a work on [[Thomas Aquinas|Tomas Aquinas]] ("Reality and Rationality"'). At this time he was active in the [[Catholic Youth Movement]] who were influenced by their study with [[Martin Heidegger]], generating their own thinking in engagement with his philosophy. During the [[Third Reich]] they were opponents of Nazism. Falling foul of Nazi educational policies, Müller was dismissed by Heidegger from research positions.

He became active as a lecturer at the Catholic {{Interlanguage link multi|Collegium Borromaeum (Freiburg im Breisgau)|de}}. After the war he succeeded the late Martin Honecker in his academic positions at the [[University of Freiburg]].

In addition to his activity at the university Müller was active in addressing social problems in Freiburg. In 1960 he moved to Ludwig Maximilians university in [[Munich]]. After his retirement he returned to Freiburg for research activity in philosophy and theology.

Müller's main influences were Honecker, [[Edmund Husserl]] and Heidegger. He was also influenced by the historian [[Friedrich Meinecke]] and the theologian [[Romano Guardini]].

==Müller's philosophy ==
Müller linked classical [[metaphysics]] with [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of Husserl and the [[existentialism]] of Heidegger. He developed from it a theory of “metahistory” as a philosophy of historical liberty. For Müller, the sense of history is distinctive in each epoch. The "transcendental experience" of humans is created in personal engagement through communal achievement in the world as work. Politics, religion, art and science, along with the personal relationships between people, carry material and symbolic means to attempt answers and achieve effective representations.

'''New mysterianism'''—or commonly just '''mysterianism'''—is a philosophical position proposing that the [[hard problem of consciousness]] cannot be resolved by humans. The unresolvable problem is how to explain the existence of [[qualia]] (individual instances of [[Subjectivity|subjective]], conscious experience). In terms of the various schools of [[philosophy of mind]], mysterianism is a form of [[nonreductive physicalism]]. Some "mysterians" state their case uncompromisingly ([[Colin McGinn]] has said that consciousness is "a mystery that human intelligence will never unravel"); others believe merely that consciousness is not within the grasp of present human understanding, but may be comprehensible to future advances of science and technology.

==Name==
[[Owen Flanagan]] noted in his 1991 book ''Science of the Mind'' that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness may never be completely explained.  Flanagan called them "the new mysterians" after the rock group [[Question Mark and the Mysterians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to Flanagan, "The 'old mysterians' were dualists who thought that consciousness cannot be understood scientifically because it operates according to nonnatural principles and possesses nonnatural properties." Apparently, some apply the terms to thinkers throughout history who suggested some aspect of consciousness may not be knowable or discoverable, including [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[Thomas Huxley]]. Thomas Huxley wrote, "[H]ow it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the [[Djinn]], when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."&lt;ref&gt;The Elements of Physiology and Hygiene: A Text-book for Educational Institutions. D. Appleton, 1869, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|The consciousness of brutes would appear to be related to the mechanism of their body simply as collateral product of its working, and to be completely without any power of modifying that working, as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery. Their volition, if they have any, is an emotion indicative of physical changes, not a cause of such changes... The soul stands to the body as the bell of a clock to the works, and consciousness answers to the sound which the bell gives out when it is struck... To the best of my judgment, the argumentation which applies to brutes holds good of men... We are conscious automata.&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"/&gt;|[[Thomas Huxley]]|"On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History"|1874}}

==Philosophy==
{{Further|Cognitive closure (philosophy)}}
In the view of the new mysterians, their contention that the hard problem of consciousness is unsolvable is not a presupposition, but rather a philosophical conclusion reached by thinking carefully about the issue. The standard argument is as follows:

[[Subjective experience]]s by their very nature cannot be shared or compared side-by-side. Therefore it is impossible to know what subjective experiences another person is having.

[[Noam Chomsky]] distinguishes between ''problems'', which seem solvable, at least in principle, through scientific methods, and ''mysteries'', which do not seem solvable, even in principle. He notes that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology, e.g. a mouse will never speak like a human. In the same way, certain problems may be beyond our understanding.

==Criticism==
Idealists would counter the mysterian view by pointing out that it is unscientific to use phrases such as "we may never know", or to try to limit the possibilities of a reflective consciousness, for example in gaining a knowledge of the underlying, pervading principle of consciousness. The apparent paradox that consciousness is "out there" and yet subjective to each individual cannot be solved unless the observer is the subject of the study, i.e. the scientist looks within.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Historical'''
*[[William James]], American philosopher, in his essay "Is Life Worth Living?" (1896). James makes the point that much human mental activity (e.g. reading) is forever closed to the mind of a dog, even though we may share the same household and have a deep friendship with each other. So, by analogy, the human mind may be forever closed to certain aspects of the larger universe. This was a concept which James found liberating, and which gave an implicit significance to certain distressing aspects of the human condition. James makes an analogy with the suffering of a dog during a vivisection: the meaning of the vivisection is inaccessible to the dog. But that does not mean that the vivisection is meaningless. So it may be with our suffering in this world.&lt;ref&gt;William James "Is Life Worth Living" (1896) https://archive.org/stream/islifeworthlivin00jameuoft#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

Our brains can't hold a hundred numbers in memory, can't visualize seven-dimensional space and perhaps can't intuitively grasp why neural information processing observed from the outside should give rise to subjective experience on the inside. This is where I place my bet, though I admit that the theory could be demolished when an unborn genius—a Darwin or Einstein of consciousness—comes up with a flabbergasting new idea that suddenly makes it all clear to us."&lt;ref&gt;http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580394-6,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Roger Penrose]], English physicist, mathematician and philosopher of science.
*[[Sam Harris]], American neuroscientist, has endorsed mysterianism by stating that "This situation has been characterized as an “explanatory gap” and the “hard problem of consciousness,” and it is surely both. I am sympathetic with those who, like ... McGinn and ... Pinker, have judged the impasse to be total: Perhaps the emergence of consciousness is simply incomprehensible in human terms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-mystery-of-consciousness-ii "The Mystery of Consciousness II"], 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolae Dimitrie Xenopol''' ({{IPA-ro|nikoˈla.e diˈmitri.e kseˈnopol}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-ro|ksenoˈpol|}}, also '''Nicu Xenopol'''; [[Francization|Francized]] ''Nicolas Xenopol''; October 11, 1858 – December 1917) was a Romanian politician, diplomat, economist and writer, the younger brother of historian [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]] and, like him, a member of ''[[Junimea]]'' society. Initially inspired by ''Junimea'' leader [[Titu Maiorescu]], he was later a dissident of ''Junimism'', a [[Positivism|Positivist]] and a supporter of [[literary realism]]. Politically, Xenopol also moved away from [[conservatism]] and was embraced by the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]], serving as editor of two liberal newspapers: ''[[Românul]]'' and ''[[Voința Națională]]''. He had a successful career in electoral politics, which began within the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and later saw him joining the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]]. In 1912, he was [[Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Business Environment (Romania)|Minister of Commerce]], and helped create an [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies|Academy of Economic Studies]].

Xenopol was the author of two realistic novels criticizing the social environment of his day. His campaign for realism and his positive coverage of urban civilization pitted him against the conservative author [[Mihai Eminescu]]. Their violent debate of the 1880s is one of the highlights in Xenopol's career in cultural journalism. His passionate involvement in support of the liberal cause was another topic of controversy, and, on several occasions, he dueled with his colleagues in the press.

Late in his life, N. Xenopol supported Romania's involvement in [[World War I]] alongside the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. He died while carrying out his final mission, as Romania's first Ambassador to Japan.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The Xenopol brothers were of foreign origins: their father, known locally as ''Dimitrie'' (and allegedly born ''Xenopoulos''),&lt;ref name="damceciteau"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dania-Ariana Moisa, [http://revistaramuri.ro/index.php?id=104&amp;editie=10&amp;autor=Dania-Ariana%20MOISA " 'Ce citeau, cum citeau' locuitorii secolului 19"], in ''[[Ramuri]]'', Nr. 1/2008&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] subject of the [[Protestantism in Greece|Protestant faith]], who settled in the port of [[Galați]] and converted to [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name="gc441"&gt;[[George Călinescu]], ''Istoria literaturii române de la origini pînă în prezent'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1986, p.441&lt;/ref&gt; According to various sources, including ''Junimea'' memoirist [[Iacob Negruzzi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/19584/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279959_1939_1940_017_006.pdf "Cărți - Reviste. ''Amintiri de la Junimea'' de Iacob Negruzzi"], in ''Școala Noastră'', Nr. 6/1940, p.259 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; and literary historian [[George Călinescu]],&lt;ref name="gc441"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iscarturar"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ionel Savitescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/SAVIi.htm "Memoriile și corespondența unui cărturar"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; he may have been [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greco-Jewish]]. Dimitrie opened the way for his son's political, literary and diplomatic career: he was a ''[[Dragoman]]'' for the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] mission to [[Moldavia]], a tutor of the [[Rosetti family]] children, a [[boarding house]] manager, and ultimately a prison warden.&lt;ref name="cc20"&gt;Cubleșan, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The Xenopols' mother, née Vasiliu, was of [[Greeks in Romania|Greco-Romanian]] origins.&lt;ref name="gc441"/&gt;

Nicolae was born in the Moldavian capital, [[Iași]], as one of Dimitrie's six children: he had two brothers (Alexandru and Filip, the future architect) and three sisters.&lt;ref name="Vorovenci, p.652"&gt;Vorovenci, p.652&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his secondary education in that city.&lt;ref name="cc20"/&gt; By 1877, he was affiliated with ''Junimea'', a conservative literary society founded by Maiorescu, [[Petre P. Carp]], Iacob Negruzzi and other Moldavian men of letters. The club members responded to his quest for affirmation, and provided him with money to study abroad: after attending the [[University of Paris]], he took his [[Doctor of Law]] diploma at the [[University of Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.20-21; Vorovenci, p.652-653&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his training period that Xenopol met and befriended other young Romanian students, including the future dramatist and theater manager [[Alexandru Davila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vera Molea, [http://www.bibliotecametropolitana.ro/Uploads/martie2009.pdf "Alexandru Davila și revolta studențească din 13 martie 1906"], in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 3/2009, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The grant did not meet all of his needs. He worked during most of college, and, for a while, gave up, trying to enlist in the [[Romanian Land Forces]], or concentrating on writing his novel ''Brazi și putregai'' ("Fir Trees and Rot").&lt;ref name="Vorovenci, p.652"/&gt;

Xenopol made his debut as a novelist and a realist writer with the humorous work ''Păsurile unui american în România'' ("The Griefs of an American in Romania"), serialized by ''Junimea''{{'}}s ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' journal from late 1879 to mid 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.20, 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brazi și putregai'' first saw print as a series in the ''Junimist'' tribune ''[[Timpul]]'' (1880).&lt;ref name="cc20"/&gt;

By 1882, N. Xenopol had drifted away from ''Junimea'', and, as the ''Junimists'' noted, may have lured Maiorescu's protégé, [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], to join him in anti-Conservative politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, I, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time involved with the newspaper ''[[Românul]]'', a mouthpiece of [[left-wing]] liberalism, and became its main editor. Working under liberal chief [[C. A. Rosetti]], he was seconded for a while by [[Constantin Bacalbașa]], who came from the liberal gazette ''Telegraful''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Bacalbașa]], [http://www.bibliotecametropolitana.ro/Uploads/Biblioteca_Bucurestilor_2008_nr8%281%29.pdf "Contrabandele bucureștene"], in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 8/2008, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Xenopol's ''Românul'' chronicles there pleaded for a realistic literature, capable of describing [[class conflict]]—for Xenopol, the model to follow was a young novelist from [[Transylvania]], [[Ioan Slavici]].&lt;ref name="cc20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ad-f189"&gt;Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Making of Modern Romanian Culture: Literacy and the Development of National Identity'', [[I.B. Tauris]], London, 2006, p.189. {{ISBN|1845110668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author highly praised by Xenopol was the ''Junimist'' [[Nicolae Gane]]: both Xenopol and his former patron Maiorescu believed that Gane's short story set the standard for a new [[literary language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilie Trăilă, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/familia/1882/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1882_018_19.pdf "Bibliografíe"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 19/1882, p.224, 226 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenopol called for Slavici's novels to be studied by other writers, and then be used in creating an urban-themed, fully modern, literature. The pillar of ''Junimist'' poetics, [[Mihai Eminescu]], responded to this argument with a virulent article, which identified Xenopol's theories with [[cosmopolitanism]] and alienation.&lt;ref name="damceciteau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ad-f189"/&gt; Initially overwhelmed by Eminescu's tone,&lt;ref name="damceciteau"/&gt; Xenopol replied with a mordant piece in ''Telegraful'' (April 1882), where the focus was on Eminescu's own ethnic origins.&lt;ref name="cc21"&gt;Cubleșan, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Constantin Cubleșan]]: "Politically, [Xenopol] became noted as a ''Junimea'' adversary, writing unusually violent lampoons against its members, with coarse and demeaning language".&lt;ref name="cc21"/&gt;

===PNL and ''Voința Națională''===
In short time, Xenopol affiliated with the National Liberal Party (PNL), whereas ''Junimea'' had become an inner faction of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative]] group. For a while in 1884, he was Head of the [[Bucharest]] Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/3144/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1884_020_28.pdf "Scíri din Românía"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 28/1884, p.339 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, PNL [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion Brătianu]] made Xenopol his personal secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.21; Vorovenci, p.653&lt;/ref&gt; Also then, Xenopol welcomed the Belgian visitor [[Émile Louis Victor de Laveleye]], arranging him a meeting with C. A. Rosetti.&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Louis Victor de Laveleye]], ''The Balkan Peninsula'', [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], New York City, 1887, p.342 ([http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bosnia/abe5413.0001.001/1:18?rgn=div1;view=fulltext online copy] at the [[University of Michigan Library]])&lt;/ref&gt;

This period marked the start of another open conflict between Xenopol and the ''Junimists'': the former took over as editor of the PNL mouthpiece ''[[Voința Națională]]'', and began publishing essays denouncing the backwardness of ''Junimist'' ideology. By October 1886, Xenopol even sided with ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[Marxism|Marxist]] adversaries at ''[[Contemporanul]]'', and allowed Marxist leader [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] to publish anti-Maiorescu pieces in ''Voința Națională''. He collected such articles, adding his own, into the brochure ''Contrazicerile d-lui T. Maiorescu'' ("Mr. T. Maiorescu's Contradictions").&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, II, p.319-320&lt;/ref&gt; During 1885, Xenopol also directed the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] campaign against the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'', with unsigned articles which may or may not have been written by Caragiale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Cioculescu]], ''Caragialiana'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1974, p.21.  {{OCLC|6890267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another target for Xenopol's attacks was his former ''Românul'' colleague C. Bacalbașa. The latter demanded satisfaction for claims made about him in ''Voința Națională'', and the two journalists dueled each other at the racecourse in [[Băneasa]]. The understanding was that the loser would be the first to shed blood: Bacalbașa's blade touched Xenopol's finger, and Xenopol conceded defeat.&lt;ref name="mpintampl58"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marian Petcu, [http://www.jurnalismsicomunicare.eu/rrjc/arhiva_pdf/2007/1_2007.pdf "Întâmplări cu ziariști morți și răniți.

Și puțin Bourdieu"], in ''Suplimentul de Cultură'', Nr. 246, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, ''Voința Națională'' focused its gibes on the Conservative paper ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''. As a result, Xenopol was visited in his home by two ''Epoca'' men, [[Nicolae Filipescu]] and A. A. Balș, who threatened him with physical harm; Xenopol pulled a gun on them, and the authorities were called in—Filipescu and Balș were received prison terms, but were pardoned 3 months into their sentences.&lt;ref name="mpintampl58"/&gt; Xenopol himself was still a passionate duelist, and, in one other instance, is said to have charged an adversary with a blade after their duel of pistols ended in a draw.&lt;ref name="crduelul"/&gt;

N. Xenopol's activities reached into other fields. He and the [[Bukovina]]n composer [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] wrote a [[choral]], ''Erna'', published by the ''Armonia'' Music Society in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/familia/1885/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1885_021_14.pdf "Salon. Teatru și musică"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 14/1885, p.167 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he lectured at the [[Romanian Atheneum]] in Bucharest. His conference, published as a booklet later in the year, was a [[satire]] of Romanian politics, and carried the title ''Hatîrul'' ("The Favor").&lt;ref name="salonl&amp;a189"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/familia/1885/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1885_021_16.pdf "Salon. Literatură și arte"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 16/1885, p.189 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

N. Xenopol married, in 1887, the daughter of Băicoianu (Baycoiano), [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] of [[Mehedinți County]].&lt;ref name="iv653"&gt;Vorovenci, p.653&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, the young author collected his satirical articles into a single tome, ''Cronici glumețe'' ("Funny Chronicles"); ''Păsurile unui american în România'' was first published as a volume the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.20, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Still a PNL man, Xenopol was first elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] during the [[Romanian general election, 1895|1895 suffrage]], and preserved his seat for several mandates, before moving to a similar position in the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]].&lt;ref name="cc21"/&gt; He was a member of all successive Romanian legislatures until 1917.&lt;ref name="iv653"/&gt;

In parallel, N. Xenopol carried on with his cultural initiatives. In March 1895, he lectured at the Romanian Atheneum on the topic of "[[crowd psychology]]", criticizing [[Scipio Sighele]]'s ideas on the topic.&lt;ref name="ivsalon129-130"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/familia/1895/BAR_FP_PIII155_1895_031_11.pdf "Salon. Dela Bucureșci"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 11/1895, p.129-130 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, he accepted an invitation from art patron [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], and joined the steering committee of his ''Ileana'' art society, which grouped independent painters reacting against [[academic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lassaigne]], [[Theodor Enescu]], ''Ștefan Luchian'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1972, p.51. {{OCLC|8359286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

N. Xenopol made his return to journalism in 1904, when he founded a [[French-language]] magazine, ''Le Mouvement Economique'' ("The Economic Movement"), directed by him until 1915.&lt;ref name="cc21"/&gt; By 1906, he had left the PNL and joined the Conservative Party. The Conservative cabinet of [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]] made Xenopol a member of its delegation, which negotiated a new trade agreement between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[French Third Republic|French Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2388486.image.r= "Dépêches télégraphiques"], in ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', December 27, 1906, p.1 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])&lt;/ref&gt; Well regarded by his superiors, he was later a Romanian negotiator of economic treaties with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="iv653"/&gt;

===PCD, ''Țară Nouă'' and ministerial term===
In January 1908, Xenopol affiliated with a Conservative splinter group, which became the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]] (PCD) and had [[Take Ionescu]] for leader.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, I, p.371, 381; Vorovenci, p.653&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, his analysis of [[land reform in Romania]] was published by the ''[[Österreichische Rundschau]]'' in Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/7250/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1908_007_005.pdf "Cronică. Știri"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 5/1908, p.110 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Also then, Xenopol was made Officer of the French Republic's [[Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5716246h/f1.image.r= "Distinctions honorifiques"], in ''La Revue Diplomatique'', Nr. 54/1908, p.9 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])&lt;/ref&gt; His conferencing on Romanian economic subjects earned him international exposure: in May 1910, he lectured in [[Paris]], invited by the ''[[Revue Générale des Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5658471r/f2.image.r= "La Roumanie au point de vue economique"], in ''Archives de la Chambre de Commerce de Roubaix'', Vol. XXXXI (1910), p.62 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Xenopol joined his brother Alexandru and fellow critic [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] in editing the journal ''Țară Nouă'' ("New Country"). It hosted contributions by some acclaimed writers, such as [[I. Dragoslav]], [[Victor Eftimiu]], [[Leon Feraru]], [[Corneliu Moldovan]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]] and [[Elena Văcărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Delaflămânzi, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/jspui/bitstream/123456789/18171/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_P3441_1912_029_0012.pdf "Revista revistelor"], in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 12/1912, p.4 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Although it received contributions from numerous Romanian academics and made special efforts to reach the Transylvanian public,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/culturacrestina/1911/BCUCLUJ_FP_279432_1911_001_019.pdf "Cărți și reviste"], in ''Cultura Creștină'', Nr. 19/1911, p.639 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; ''Țară Nouă'' eventually closed down in 1912.&lt;ref name="cc21"/&gt; In parallel, his merits as an economist were recognized internationally, and he was made a member of France's ''[[Société d'Economie Politique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k56645499/f1.image.r= "Liste des membres par époque d'admission"], in ''Annuaire de la Société d'Economie Politique'', Vol. 95, 1936, p.69 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolae and Alexandru Xenopol were both involved in [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] agitation for the cause of [[Romanians]] in Transylvania and other regions of Austria-Hungary. In 1911, some of their books had been censored in Transylvania, and were subject to confiscation by the [[Law Enforcement and Public Safety Service|Hungarian Gendarmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/romanul/1911/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2581_1911_001_0063.pdf "Un proces monstru contra literaturei române"], in ''Românul (Arad)'', Nr. 63/1911, p.1 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, in May, N. Xenopol was called upon as an expert witness in the trial between antisemitic academic [[A. C. Cuza]] and lawyer [[Emil Socor]]. Xenopol was supposed to testify as to whether Socor had been right to call Cuza a [[Plagiarism|plagiarist]], but he [[Judicial disqualification|recused]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} V. T., [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/romanul/1911/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2581_1911_001_0110.pdf "Corespondențe din România.

N. Xenopol's political career peaked in 1912. That year, after the PNL and the PCD toppled the Conservative-''Junimist'' Premier [[Petre P. Carp]], and Maiorescu formed a governing alliance with Take Ionescu, Xenopol joined the administration. Ionescu, [[Constantin Dissescu]], [[Alexandru Bădărău]] and Xenopol, who took over the [[Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Business Environment (Romania)|Ministry of Commerce]], were the four PCD ministers in Maiorescu's cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5740011k/f1.image.r= "Le Nouveau cabinet roumain"], in ''La Jeune Turquie'', Nr. 44/1912, p.3 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library]); Ornea, I, p.381&lt;/ref&gt; His time in office saw the adoption of some major labor laws, whereby he structured the professions, regulated [[trade union]]s (including the Civil Servants' Chamber) and provided for [[workers' compensation]].&lt;ref name="iv653"/&gt; His major accomplishment was the establishment of an [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies|Academy of Economic Studies]], independent from the university system. The irregular character and the staff appointments by government were rather controversial, and Xenopol's policies earned much criticism in the Romanian media of the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;Vorovenci, p.653-655&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Protectionism|protectionist]], Xenopol was interested in opening up new markets for Romanian products, but also favored France's economic interests over those of [[German Empire|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Désiré Pector, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5607935x/f51.image.r= "Commerce des matières premières nécessaires à l'industrie métropolitaine (suite). Roumanie"], in ''Bulletin Mensuel de Comité National des Conseillers du Commerce Extérieur de la France'', Nr. 64, May 1912, p.591 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1913, Xenopol visited the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], trying to increase the share of Italian investments in his country (according to his own estimate, Italy was the fifth exporter to Romania).&lt;ref&gt;Laura Oncescu, [http://www.annalesfsu.ro/sitero/tome_XI_no.2/13Laura_Oncescu.pdf "Aspects of the Economic Relations between Romania and Italy (1879-1914)"], in the [[Valahia University of Târgoviște]] ''Annales.Section d’Archéologie et d’Histoire'', Nr. 2/2009, p.142-143&lt;/ref&gt; During the last days of 1913, Maiorescu handed in his government's resignation, opening the way for a new National Liberal administration; his had been the last ever Conservative premiership.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, I, p.383&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and death===
The start of [[World War I]] reignited Nicolae Xenopol's career. Like other members of the PCD and PNL, and like his historian brother,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''"Germanofilii". Elita intelectuală românească în anii Primului Război Mondial'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2010, p.106, 109, 118.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-2635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; he clamored his belief that Romania should renounce her neutrality and join the [[Allies of World War I|Entente nations]]. Their adversity was aimed at Austria-Hungary and the [[Central Powers]], and their hope was that the Entente would help Romania to annex Transylvania. N. Xenopol was a guest speaker at the major pro-Entente rally of early October 1915, where Take Ionescu was also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Stan, [http://www.istorie.ugal.ro/anale/3/306%20STAN.pdf "Românii americani în anii neutralității României (1914-1916)"], in the [[University of Galați]] ''Anale. Seria Istorie'', Vol. III, 2004, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a trans-party [[Irredentism|irredentist]] group called ''Federația Unionistă'', presided upon by his former Conservative enemy Nicolae Filipescu, with Ionescu as Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;Goga, p.18-20; {{it icon}} Francesco Guida, "Il compimento dallo stato nazionale romeno e l'Italia. Opinione pubblica e iniziative politico-diplomatiche", in ''Rassegna Storica del Risorgimento'', IV/LXIX, October–December 1982, p.444 ([http://www.risorgimento.it/rassegna/index.php?id=57541&amp;ricerca_inizio=0&amp;ricerca_query=&amp;ricerca_ordine=DESC&amp;ricerca_libera= online copy] at the [http://www.risorgimento.it/php/index.php ''Istituto per la storia del Risorgimento italiano''])&lt;/ref&gt; One of the regular members, Transylvanian poet-activist [[Octavian Goga]], remembered Xenopol as "intelligent and industrious", but of dubious honesty.&lt;ref&gt;Goga, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Xenopol returned to publishing with a French-language study, ''La Richesse de la Roumanie'' ("Romania's Wealth"). It was in effect a condemnation of Romania's attachment to Germany and Austria-Hungary, beginning with the bilateral trade agreements of the 1870s. Xenopol contended that the imports from Austria-Hungary had destroyed branches of the Romanian economy, such as the shoe-making industry, and that Germany had sabotaged the Romanian export of cattle; he also argued that the Austrians were working to force Romania into becoming their vassal, as part of a [[Balkans|Balkan]] ''[[Zollverein]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} René Moreux, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5769645s/f2.image.r "La Roumanie sous le joug austro-allemand"], in ''Journal des Chambres de Commerce'', Nr. 22/1916, p.318-319 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipescu's ''Federația'' happily dissolved itself in September 1916, shortly after Romania sealed an [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|agreement with the Entente]]. In his closing speech, Filipescu welcomed the declaration of war as the dawn of a [[Greater Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Goga, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, as Romania made efforts to recover from a [[Romania in World War I|German invasion]], Xenopol was dispatched to the [[Empire of Japan]] (a fellow Entente country). Although fatigued, he took the perilous journey through the [[Russian Empire]], and, as a tribute to the war effort, refused to take money for his services.&lt;ref name="iv655"&gt;Vorovenci, p.655&lt;/ref&gt; He was Romania's first Ambassador to [[Tokyo]], but died there, only months after taking over his post.&lt;ref name="iscarturar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tv111"&gt;Vianu, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.21; Vorovenci, p.655&lt;/ref&gt; One of his last efforts was helping a stranded group of Romanian Transylvanians sail for the [[West Coast of the United States|US West Coast]].&lt;ref name="iv655"/&gt; In hindsight, literary historian [[Dan Mănucă]] notes that Xenopol, like his [[World War II]] successor [[Gheorghe Bâgulescu]], was among the few Romanian diplomats who "also went earnestly about their duties in propagating our culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan Mănucă]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MANUCAian7.html "Eliade lusitanul (II)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary work==

===Views and polemics===
Already as a ''Junimea'' participant, Nicolae Xenopol cut a liberal and rebellious figure. Historian Alex Drace-Francis refers to him as a culture critic "from the liberal, [[Progressivism|progressive]] wing of ''Junimea''".&lt;ref name="ad-f189"/&gt; Among the ''Junimist'' intellectuals, Xenopol and [[George Panu]] stood out for being fully committed to the [[Positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]]—the others were more interested in [[German idealism]], [[evolutionism]] or [[metaphysical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, I, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Elitism|elitists]] and the [[Misanthropy|misanthropists]], he believed that "[[crowd psychology]]" was generally a constructive factor in the course of human civilization.&lt;ref name="ivsalon129-130"/&gt; Xenopol's ideas were also more permeated by new trends in literary theory—according to cultural historian [[Z. Ornea]], he was "exasperated" by "the ossification of the ''Junimist'' aesthetic doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, II, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Cubleșan]] refers to Xenopol as not just a realist writer, but also "a fine analyst" of the realist current, citing his ideas on [[Ioan Slavici]]: "It is enough for a novel to be about national life, whatever the character types [...]. The essential is that those types should be truthful, and, as far as the events are unfolded, never stray from reality".&lt;ref name="cc20"/&gt;

Ornea suggests that Xenopol's rebellion against first-generation ''Junimism'' and Maiorescu was first evident in 1878, when the young man came into direct contact with [[19th-century French literature|contemporary French literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, II, p.128-129&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting conflict with the ''Junimists'' was bitter and spiteful. Eminescu attacked in him the "superimposed stratum" of foreign intruders, calling him "Mr. N. Xenopoulos", and cautioning him that the "defects of one's race" were showing in Xenopol's praise of urban literature.&lt;ref name="damceciteau"/&gt; Xenopol replied in kind. According to his account (also taken up by the liberal poet [[Alexandru Macedonski]] at ''[[Literatorul]]'' magazine), Eminescu was of [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarian]] origin, and therefore not of pure Romanian stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudor Nedelcea, [http://caietecritice.fnsa.ro/pdfs/cc%205-6-7%202009.pdf "Eminescu și Macedonski"], in ''Caiete Critice'', Nr. 5-6-7/2009, p.135; Vianu, p.357&lt;/ref&gt; His own 1882 portrait of [[Mihai Eminescu]] (whom he called by his birth name, ''Eminovici'') was purposefully grotesque and inflammatory, but, as Cubleșan notes, particularly colorful.&lt;ref name="cc21"/&gt; It reads: "[Eminescu has] an odd head with four edges, such as [[Bucharest]]ers have surely seen among Bulgarian laborers [...]. This individual wears purple trousers, a borrowed black frock and a large black hat, exactly like those of [[Germans of Romania|Germans]] who walk about with the [[street organ]]s on their backs; he is always covered in mud and his face and hands carry countless traces of purple ink".&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.21; {{ro icon}} Liviu Grăsoiu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/GRASOIUian3.html "Din nou despre Eminescu"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply, Eminescu stated that, regardless of the [[Slavic name suffix|Slavic suffix]] in ''Eminovici'', his own lineage was [[Moldavia]]n and aristocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Cimpoi]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20030707/article_3/ " 'Evul miez' eminescian"], in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', Nr. 2/2003&lt;/ref&gt; Author and psychologist  Vlad Mixich cites Eminescu's full answer as a sample of press insult in late 19th-century Romania: "The things Mr. N. Xenopoulos says are, in my view, the figments of a fomenting imagination, excited by the sting of my putdown. But who do you think you are to be allowed, at your age and with the knowledge you don't have, to give yourself such superior airs?"&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vlad Mixich, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=17331 "Obiectivitate însîngerată"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 401, October 2011 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===
Literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] writes that, in his beginnings, Xenopol was "a [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poet]], swift in his rhymes".&lt;ref name="tv111"/&gt; According to Cubleșan, that part of Xenopol's career should be dismissed, as his [[Patriotism|patriotic]] poetry, including a piece about [[Dragoș|Dragoș Vodă]], is in general [[pastiche]] from better known writers.&lt;ref name="cc21"/&gt; Instead, Xenopol's prose was directly inspired by what Vianu calls "the direct observation of local realities". Vianu classifies Xenopol and the ''Junimist'' [[Leon C. Negruzzi]] in the same realist subgroup of ''Junimist'' literature, but adds that Negruzzi had always been a [[Romanticism|romantic]].&lt;ref name="tv111"/&gt;

Iohnson Blackwurst, the [[Yankee]] protagonist of ''Păsurile unui american în România'', is the voice through which the paradoxes of Romanian society are evidenced with sincere bemusement. Xenopol noted that his was a satire of Romanian life, intended to show how "the disgusting reality" of Romania is perceived in advanced "[[bourgeois]]" societies.&lt;ref name="cc20"/&gt; As Vianu suggests, the ultimate inspiration for Xenopol's work was an 18th-century model, [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Persian Letters]]''.&lt;ref name="tv111"/&gt;

Written as a journalistic [[parody]] of Romantic [[travel literature]], Iohnson Blackwurst's story begins with his naive quest to study the Romanians, Europe's "bravest people", and ends in bitter disappointment: during his visit to Iași, Blackwurst is humiliated, cheated and confused.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.21-24&lt;/ref&gt; The work is sketchy, and the narrated episodes have morals that are largely illustrations of Xenopol's political views. The narrator believes that the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]] is parasitical and destructive, that the political class is endemically corrupt, and that the only productive class, on whose backs Romania herself was erected, are the peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the conclusions of various other critics, Cubleșan notes that, although ''Păsurile...'' is incomplete as a novel, its biting wit remains interesting.&lt;ref name="cc24"&gt;Cubleșan, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Philologist Ioana Costa suggests that Blackwurst's story is far from being a great novel itself, but that, as a "mixture of frivolity, localized satire [and] current events", it contains "the seeds of that classical literature that has given ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' its unmistakable imprint".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ANCHETAmar7.html "Ancheta revistei – O sută patruzeci de ani de ''Convorbiri Literare''"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brazi și putregai'' is seen by Cubleșan as more ambitious, more rigorous and more meticulous project, in effect "a faithful mirror of late 19th-century Romanian society", midway between the proto-realism of [[Nicolae Filimon]] and the complex narratives of [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] or [[Mihail Sadoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.22, 24-26&lt;/ref&gt; At its core, ''Brazi și putregai'' is about the downfall of an aristocratic ([[boyar]]) family, unable to maintain its status in a [[Modernization|modernized]] society.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The central character, Alecu Negradi, is a sternly patriarchal boyar who has rebuilt his family's fortune, and who attempts to break in his rebellious son Iorgu by forcing him to manage an isolated mountain estate. From this point on, Alecu Nagradi's entire universe falls apart: his son finds new ways to disobey him, his wife commits adultery, and his peasants rise up in revolt; Iorgu's sister, Maria, bequeathed to a much older man, elopes. She escapes the manor just as the buildings go up in flames, without realizing that the peasants have murdered her father.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is foremost noted for its complex descriptions of nature scenes and people interacting. According to an admirer, the historian and writer [[Nicolae Iorga]], Xenopol portrays his characters in such detail as to "compete with the barbers".&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; However, Xenopol's use of antiquated [[Romanian language|Romanian]] has led some to suggest that ''Brazi și putregai'' is no longer digestible. As early as 1925, novelist [[Cezar Petrescu]] concluded that the novel's atmosphere is "oldish and obsolete".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cezar Petrescu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1924-1925/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1924_1925_004_012_013.pdf "Idei, oameni &amp; fapte. Un roman franco-român"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 12-13/1925, p.383 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1955, critic Teodor Vârgolici also assessed that ''Brazi și putregai'' "is mostly of interest as a literary document" (a verdict seen by Cubleșan as "too drastic").&lt;ref name="cc24"/&gt;

Xenopol's criticism of Romania's political system was also given expression in ''Hatîrul''. According to Xenopol, favoritism and corruption were undermining the strength of Romanian society, since they detoured well-meaning projects, allowing one to interfere with the course of justice, or even to talk the [[Căile Ferate Române|Railway Company]] into servicing one's private residence.&lt;ref name="salonl&amp;a189"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Largely forgotten by the general public, Nicolae Xenopol was better remembered in professional circles: in 1929, he was dedicated a monograph, published by the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies|Academy of Economic Studies]], with contributions from [[Alexandru Averescu]], [[Dimitrie Gusti]], [[Take Ionescu]], [[Mina Minovici]], [[Gheorghe Tașcă]], [[Nicolae Vasilescu-Karpen]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Vorovenci, p.652, 655&lt;/ref&gt; Tașcă, [[Henri Cihoski]] and various Academy graduates collected money for a Xenopol statue, but the project was put on hold and only taken up by the Academy in 2011.&lt;ref name="iv655"/&gt;

Xenopol's dispute with Eminescu was revisited in a 2002 book by critic Alexandru Dobrescu: ''Detractorii lui Eminescu'' ("Eminescu's Detractors", second edition 2006).&lt;ref name="damceciteau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcdetract"&gt;[[Bogdan Crețu]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/detractorii-lui-eminescu-6187195/ " 'Detractorii' lui Eminescu?"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emvitrina"&gt;{{ro icon}} Emilian Marcu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MARCUmar7.html "Vitrina cărților"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Poet and ''Convorbiri Literare'' book critic Emilian Marcu notes: "[The detractors] are in fact intellectuals of great amplitude, who express opinions that are somewhat in contraction with those imposed officially. [Dobrescu's] book gives us a chance to rediscover [...] texts by authors who are at least honorable, over which, alas, the dust of oblivion has set. Their return into an intellectual circuit can only be beneficial for all those who truly wish to know more about the great Eminescu".&lt;ref name="emvitrina"/&gt; Similarly, critic [[Bogdan Crețu]] notes that Dobrescu managed to overturn the "poltroonish" classification of Xenopol and others as "detractors": "the new anthology [is] an honest exercise in the reevaluation of an epoch that is much more nuanced and rich than the books of literary history or the dictionaries will have us know".&lt;ref name="bcdetract"/&gt; Contrarily, other experts routinely list Xenopol as mainly an anti-Eminescian—his has an entry among the "detractors of Eminescu" in Săluc Horvat's dictionary of Eminescu exegetes (published in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Viorel Mureșan, [http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1058 "Un dicționar de eminescologi (I)"], in ''Caiete Silvane'', June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

N. Xenopol's Bucharest villa, on Arcului Street, was ravaged by neglect during the decades of [[Communist Romania|Romanian communism]]. According to a 2008 article by critic [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], it is one of the few well restored period buildings in downtown Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/dan-c-mihailescu-sos-bucuresti-810848.html "SOS București"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', July 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In a public letter to his fraternity brothers at Wesleyan, Daniels wrote: "At Harvard, I ended up co-chair of SDS and gave the speech on the steps of University Hall April 9, 1969, that began the take-over of that administration building and thus led to the Harvard Strike. I would have been fired as a teaching fellow, so I followed my advisors advice and quit that position to take a part-time job at Tufts, teaching philosophy of science and political philosophy. I stayed 33 years."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23325">An '''ontological commitment''' refers to a relation between a language and certain objects postulated to be extant by that language. The 'existence' referred to need not be 'real', but exist only in a [[universe of discourse]].  As an example, legal systems use vocabulary referring to 'legal persons' that are collective entities that have rights. One says the legal doctrine has an ''ontological commitment'' to non-singular individuals.&lt;ref name=Schafer/&gt;   In [[information system]]s and [[artificial intelligence]], where an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] refers to a specific vocabulary and a set of explicit assumptions about the meaning and usage of these words, then an ontological commitment is an agreement to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner within a specific context.&lt;ref name=Guarino/&gt; In philosophy a "theory is '''ontologically committed''' to an object only if that object occurs in ''all'' the ontologies of that theory"&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;

== Background ==
The sentence “Napoleon is one of my ancestors” apparently commits us only to the existence of two individuals (i.e., [[Napoleon]] and the speaker) and a line of ancestry between them. The fact that no other people or objects are mentioned seems to limit the “commitment” of the sentence. However, it is well known that sentences of this kind cannot be interpreted in [[first-order logic]], where individual variables stand for individual things. Instead, they must be represented in some [[second-order logic|second-order]] form. In ordinary language, such second-order forms use either grammatical plurals or terms such as “set of” or “group of”.

For example, the sentence involving Napoleon can be rewritten as “any group of people that includes me and the parents of each person in the group must also include Napoleon,” which is easily interpreted as a statement in second-order logic (one would naturally start by assigning a name, such as ''G'', to the group of people under consideration). Formally, collective noun forms such as “a group of people” are represented by [[second-order variable]]s, or by [[first-order variable]]s standing for [[set (mathematics)|sets]] (which are [[well-defined]] objects in [[mathematics]] and logic). Since these variables do not stand for individual objects, it seems we are “ontologically committed” to entities other than individuals — sets, classes, and so on. As [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] puts it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the general adoption of class variables of quantification ushers in a theory whose laws were not in general expressible in the antecedent levels of logic. The price paid for this increased power is [[ontological]]: objects of a special and abstract kind, [[viz.]] classes, are now presupposed. Formally it is precisely in allowing [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] over class variables α, β, etc., that we assume a range of values for these variables to refer to. To be assumed as an entity is to be assumed as a value of a variable. (''[[Methods of Logic]]'' p. 228)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another statement about individuals that appears “ontologically innocent” is the well-known [[Geach–Kaplan sentence]]: ''Some critics admire only one another.''

==Quine's analysis==

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] provided an early and influential formulation of ontological commitment:&lt;ref name=Quine1/&gt;
{{quote|If one affirms a statement using a name or other singular term, or an initial phrase of 'existential quantification', like 'There are some so-and-sos', then one must either (1) admit that one is committed to the existence of things answering to the singular term or satisfying the descriptions, or (2) provide a 'paraphrase' of the statement that eschews singular terms and quantification over so-and sos. Quine's criterion can be seen as a logical development of the methods of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G.E. Moore]], who assumed that one must accept the existence of entities corresponding to the singular terms used in statements one accepts, unless and until one finds systematic methods of paraphrase that eliminate these terms.&lt;ref name=Loux/&gt;|Michael J. Loux &amp; Dean W. Zimmerman|The Oxford Handbook of Metaphysics, p. 4}}

The purpose of Quine's strategy is to determine just how the ''ontological commitment'' of a theory is to be found. Quine argued that the only ontologically committing expressions are variables bound by a first-order existential quantifier, and natural language expressions which were formalized using variables bound by first-order existential quantifiers.&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dejnozka/&gt;

Attempts have been made to argue that [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s are also ontologically committing, and thus that subject-predicate sentences bear additional ontological commitment to [[abstract object]]s such as [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], or [[class (philosophy)|classes]]. It has been suggested that the use of meaningful names in nonexistence statements such as “Pegasus does not exist” brings with it an ontological commitment to [[fictional object]]s like Pegasus, a quandary referred to as [[Plato's beard]] and escaped by using quantifiers.&lt;ref name=Fogelin/&gt;

This discussion has a connection to the Carnap-Quine argument over analytic and synthetic objects.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; Although Quine refers to 'ontological commitment' in this connection,&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt; in his rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction he does not rely upon the formal translation of any particular theory along the lines he has suggested.&lt;ref name=Quine0/&gt;  Instead, Quine argues by using examples that although there are tautological statements in a formal theory, like "all squares are rectangles", a formal theory necessarily contains references to objects that are not tautological, but have external connections. That is, there is an ''ontological commitment'' to such external objects. In addition, the terms used to interpret the application of the theory are not simply descriptions of sensory input, but are statements in a context. That is, inversely, there is an ''ontological commitment'' of these observational objects to the formal theory. As Ryan puts it: "Rather than being divided between contingent synthetic claims and indubitable analytic propositions, our beliefs constitute a continuous range from a periphery of sense-reports to interior concepts that are comparatively theory-laden and general."&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt;  Thus we end up with Quine's 'flat' ontology that does not see a distinction between analytic and synthetic objects.&lt;ref name=Schaffer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;

Whatever process one uses to determine the ontological commitments of a theory, that does not prescribe what ontological commitments one should have. Quine regarded this as a matter of [[epistemology]], which theory one should accept. "Appeal is made to [concerns of] explanatory power, parsimony, conservatism, precision, and so on".&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

===Ontological parsimony===
Ontological parsimony can be defined in various ways, and often is equated to versions of [[Occam's razor]], a "rule of thumb, which obliges us to favor theories or hypotheses that make the fewest unwarranted, or ''ad hoc'', assumptions about the data from which they are derived."&lt;ref name=Henke/&gt; Glock regards 'ontological parsimony' as one of the 'five main points' of Quine's conception of ontology.&lt;ref name=Glock/&gt;

Following Quine,&lt;ref name=QuineW/&gt; Baker states that a theory, ''T'', is ''ontologically committed'' to items ''F'' if and only if ''T'' entails that ''F′''s exist.  If two theories, ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', have the same ontological commitments except that ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ontologically committed to ''F′''s while ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not, then ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is more parsimonious than ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. More generally, a sufficient condition for ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' being more parsimonious than ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is for the ontological commitments of ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be a proper subset of those of ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

These ideas lead to the following particular formulation of Occam's razor: 'Other things being equal, if ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is more ontologically parsimonious than ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' then it is rational to prefer ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.'  While a common formulation stipulates only that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity, this version by contrast, states that entities should not be multiplied ''other things being equal'', and this is compatible with parsimony being a comparatively weak theoretical virtue.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

== Recent controversies ==
The standard approach to ontological commitment has been that, once a theory has been regimented and/or "paraphrased" into an agreed "canonical" version,&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt; which may indeed be in formal logical notation rather than the original language of the theory, ontological commitments can be read off straightforwardly from the presence of certain ontologically committing expressions (e.g. bound variables of existential quantification). Although there is substantial debate about which expressions are ontologically committing,&lt;ref name=French/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; parties to that debate generally agree that the expressions they prefer are reliable bearers of ontological commitment, imparting ontological commitment to all regimented sentences in which they occur. This assumption has been challenged.

Inwagen has taken issue with Quine's methodology,&lt;ref name=Inwagen/&gt; claiming that this process did not lead to a unique set of fundamental objects, but to several possible sets, and one never could be certain that all the possible sets had been found. He also took issue with Quine's notion of a theory, which he felt was tantamount to suggesting a 'theory' was just a collection of sentences. Inwagen suggested that Quine's approach provided useful tools for discovering what entities were ontological commitments, but that he had not been successful. His attempts are comparable to an "attempt to reach the moon by climbing ever higher trees..."&lt;ref name=Inwagen2/&gt;

It has been suggested that the ontological commitments of a theory cannot be discerned by analysis of the syntax of sentences, looking for ontologically committing expressions, because the true ontological commitments of a sentence (or theory) are restricted to the entities needed to serve as [[truthmaker]]s for that sentence, and the syntax of even a regimented or formalized sentence is not a reliable guide to what entities are needed to make it true.&lt;ref name=Heil/&gt; However, this view has been attacked by Jonathan Shaffer, who has argued that truthmaking is not an adequate test for ontological commitment: at best, the search for the truthmakers of our theory will tell us what is "fundamental", but not what our theory is ontologically committed to, and hence will not serve as a good way of deciding what exists.&lt;ref name=Schaffer1/&gt;

It also has been argued that the syntax of sentences is not a reliable guide to their ontological commitments because English has no form of words which reliably functions to make an existence-claim in every context in which it is used. For example, Jody Azzouni suggests that "There is" does not make any kind of genuine existence-claim when it is used in a sentence such as "There are mice that talk". Since the meaning of the existential quantifier in formal notation is usually explained in terms of its equivalence to English expressions such as "there is" and "there exist", and since these English expressions are not reliably ontologically committing, it comes to seem that we cannot be sure of our theory's ontological commitments even after it has been regimented into a canonical formulation.&lt;ref name=Azzouni/&gt; This argument has been attacked by Howard Peacock,&lt;ref name=Peacock/&gt; who suggests that Azzouni's strategy conflates two different kinds of ontological commitment – one which is intended as a measure of what a theory explicitly claims to exist, and one which is intended as a measure of what is required for the theory to be true; what the ontological costs of the theory are. If ontological commitment is thought of as a matter of the ontological costs of a theory, then it is possible that a sentence may be ontologically committed to an entity even though competent speakers of the language do not recognize the sentence as asserting the existence of that entity. Ontological commitment is not a matter of what commitments one explicitly recognizes, but rather a matter of what commitments are actually incurred.

{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |edition=Paperback 2nd |page= 631 |chapter=Ontological commitment |isbn=0521637228 |editor=Robert Audi  |year=1999}} A shortened version of that definition is as follows:
:The '''ontological commitments''' of a theory are those things which occur in all the ''ontologies'' of that theory. To explain further, the [[ontology]] of a theory consists of the objects the theory makes use of. A dependence of a theory upon an object is indicated if the theory fails when the object is omitted. However, the ontology of a theory is not necessarily unique. A theory is '''ontologically committed''' to an object only if that object occurs in ''all'' the ontologies of that theory. A theory also can be ''ontologically committed'' to a class of objects if that class is populated (not necessarily by the same objects) in all its ontologies.

==Philosophical work==

An expert in [[moral psychology]], Hieronymi has written widely on issues about responsibility and agency, as well as on reasons, trust, forgiveness, and the voluntariness of belief. The work has been influential and widely cited.&lt;ref name="PPR citation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Philip|title=Voluntary Belief on a Reasonable Basis|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=September 2010|volume=LXXXI|issue=2|page=313|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00380.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00380.x/full|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP Trust"&gt;{{cite web|last=McCleod|first=Carolyn|title=Trust|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trust/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP Ethics of Belief"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chignell|first=Andrew|title=The Ethics of Belief|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-belief/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Consulting ==
Hieronymi served as an advisor on moral philosophy and ethics for the popular NBC sit-com ''[[The Good Place]]'', and subsequently became a “consulting philosopher” for the show; "surely a first in sitcom history." Hieronymi guided the show to feature the work of her dissertation advisor, Harvard emeritus professor [[T. M. Scanlon|T.M. Scanlon]], and also advised the writers on "[[existentialism]] and the famous thought experiment known as [[Trolley problem|the Trolley Problem]]," among other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/04/magazine/good-place-michael-schur-philosophy.html|title=What Makes ‘The Good Place’ So Good?|last=Anderson|first=Sam|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far as I have developed this science of phaneroscopy, it is occupied with the formal elements of the phaneron." &lt;ref&gt;Adirondack Lectures, 1905; in Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, vol. 1 (eds.

The '''Chair of Moral Philosophy''' is a professorship at the [[University of Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], which was established in 1727.

The [[Nova Erectio]] of King [[James VI]] of Scotland shared the teaching of Moral Philosophy, Logic and Natural Philosophy among the Regents. In 1727 separate chairs were instituted.

'''Reflective equilibrium''' is a state of [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]] or coherence among a set of beliefs arrived at by a process of deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and particular [[judgment]]s.  Although he did not use the term, philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] introduced the method of reflective equilibrium as an approach to [[theory of justification|justifying]] the ''principles'' of [[inductive logic]].  The term 'reflective equilibrium' was coined by [[John Rawls]] and popularized in his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' as a method for arriving at the content of the principles of justice.

[[:de:Dietmar Hübner|Dietmar Hübner]] has pointed out that there are many interpretations of reflective equilibrium that deviate from Rawls' method in ways that reduce the cogency of the idea.&lt;ref name="Hübner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hübner |first=Dietmar |date=January 2017 |title=Three remarks on 'reflective equilibrium': on the use and misuse of Rawls' balancing concept in contemporary ethics |journal=[[Philosophical Inquiry]] |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=11–40 |doi=10.5840/philinquiry20174112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these misinterpretations, according to Hübner, are definitions of reflective equilibrium as "(a) balancing theoretical accounts against intuitive convictions; (b) balancing general principles against particular judgements; (c) balancing opposite ethical conceptions or divergent moral statements".&lt;ref name="Hübner"/&gt;

==Overview==
Rawls argues that human beings have a "sense of [[justice]]" which is both a source of moral judgment and moral motivation.  In Rawls's theory, we begin with "considered judgments" that arise from the sense of justice.  These may be judgments about general moral principles (of any level of generality) or specific moral cases. If our judgments conflict in some way, we proceed by adjusting our various beliefs until they are in "equilibrium", which is to say that they are stable, not in conflict, and provide consistent practical guidance.  Rawls argues that a set of moral beliefs in ideal reflective equilibrium describes or characterizes the underlying principles of the human sense of justice.

An example of the method of reflective equilibrium may be useful.  Suppose Zachary believes in the general principle of always obeying the commands in the [[Bible]], and mistakenly thinks that these are completely encompassed by every Old Testament command.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--What is "encompassed" supposed to mean here? A member of a set obviously can't "encompass" the set, it's the other way round! If you mean something like "he mistakenly believes that every Old Testament command counts", then just say so, but first prove it is a mistaken belief, or better yet, change your example.--&gt;  Suppose also that he thinks that it is not ethical to [[stoning|stone]] people to death merely for being [[Wicca]]n.  These views may come into conflict (see Exodus 22:18, but see John 8:7).  If they do, Zachary will then have several choices.  He can discard his general principle in search of a better one (for example, only obeying the [[Ten Commandments]]), modify his general principle (for example, choosing a different translation of the Bible, or letting Jesus' teaching from John 8:7 "If any of you is without sin, let him be the first to cast a stone" override the Old Testament command), or change his opinions about the point in question to conform with his theory (by deciding that witches really should be killed).  Whatever the decision, he has moved toward reflective equilibrium.

==Use in Rawls's political theory==
Reflective equilibrium serves an important justificatory function within Rawls's political theory. The nature of this function, however, is disputed. The dominant view, best exemplified by the work of [[Norman Daniels]] and [[T. M. Scanlon|Thomas Scanlon]], is that the method of reflective equilibrium is a kind of [[coherentism|coherentist]] method for the epistemic justification of moral beliefs. However, in other writings, Rawls seems to argue that his theory bypasses traditional [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] questions, including questions of moral epistemology, and is intended instead to serve a practical function. This provides some motivation for a different view of the justificatory role of reflective equilibrium. On this view, the method of reflective equilibrium serves its justificatory function by linking together the cognitive and motivational aspects of the human sense of justice in the appropriate way.

Rawls argues that candidate principles of justice cannot be justified unless they are shown to be stable. Principles of justice are stable if, among other things, the members of society regard them as authoritative and reliably compliant with them. The method of reflective equilibrium determines a set of principles rooted in the human sense of justice, which is a capacity that both provides the material for the process of reflective equilibration and our motivation to adhere to principles we judge morally sound. The method of reflective equilibrium serves the aim of defining a realistic and stable social order by determining a practically coherent set of principles that are grounded in the right way in the source of our moral motivation, such that we will be disposed to comply with them. As Fred D'Agostino puts it, stable principles of justice will require considerable "up-take" by the members of society. The method of reflective equilibrium provides a way of settling on principles that will achieve the kind of "up-take" necessary for stability.

Reflective equilibrium is not static, though Rawls allows for provisional fixed points; it will change as the individual considers his opinions about individual issues or explores the consequences of his principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawls |first=John |authorlink=John Rawls |date=1971 |title=A theory of justice |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] of [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0674880102 |oclc=216912 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawls applied this technique to his conception of a hypothetical [[original position]] from which people would agree to a [[social contract]].  He arrived at the conclusion that the optimal theory of justice is the one to which people would agree from behind a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]], not knowing their social positions.

==Wide reflective equilibrium==
&lt;!--[[Wide reflective equilibrium]] redirects here ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
Wide reflective equilibrium, first introduced by Rawls, has been described by Norman Daniels as "a method that attempts to produce coherence in ordered triple sets of beliefs held by a particular person, namely: (a) a set of considered moral judgments, (b) a set of moral principles, and (c) a set of relevant (scientific and philosophical) background theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Räikkä |first=Juha |date=2011 |chapter=Wide reflective equilibrium |editor-last=Chatterjee |editor-first=Deen K. |title=Encyclopedia of global justice |series=Springer reference |location=Dordrecht |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=1157–1158 |isbn=9781402091599 |oclc=772633396 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9160-5_33 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to constructivism==
{{See also|Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivist epistemology}}
[[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] has asserted that "philosophers who are defenders of reflective equilibrium are also ''[[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivists]]''", in response to what he considered to be the misconception that reflective equilibrium works with some necessarily preexisting coherent system of moral beliefs and practices:&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Kai |authorlink=Kai Nielsen (philosopher) |date=1996 |chapter=Preface |title=Naturalism without foundations |series=Prometheus lectures |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |pages=9–22 |isbn=1573920762 |oclc=34798014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The pattern of consistent beliefs, including very centrally moral beliefs, is not a structure to be discovered or unearthed, as if it were analogous to the deep underlying "depth grammar" of language (if indeed there is any such a thing), but something to be ''forged''—constructed—by a careful and resolute use of the method of reflective equilibrium. We start from our considered judgments (convictions), however culturally and historically skewed. This involves—indeed, inescapably involves—seeing things by our own lights. Where else could we start? We can hardly jump out of our cultural and historical skins.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==
[[Paul Thagard]] has criticized the method of reflective equilibrium as "only like a smokescreen for a relatively sophisticated form of logical and methodological relativism" and "at best incidental to the process of developing normative principles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=1988 |title=Computational philosophy of science |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |page=115 |isbn=0262200686 |oclc=16525738}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the "numerous problems" of reflective equilibrium, Thagard counted "undue reliance on intuition and the danger of arriving at stable but suboptimal sets of norms".&lt;ref name="Thagard 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=April 2009 |title=Why cognitive science needs philosophy and vice versa |journal=Topics in Cognitive Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=237–254 [248] |doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2009.01016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of reflective equilibrium, Thagard recommended what he considered to be a more [[consequentialist]] method of justifying norms by identifying a domain of practices, identifying candidate norms for the practices, identifying the appropriate goals of the practices, evaluating the extent to which different practices accomplish these goals, and adopting as domain norms the practices that best accomplish these goals.&lt;ref name="Thagard 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=2010 |title=The brain and the meaning of life |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=202–217 |isbn=9780691142722 |oclc=416717721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Longchenpa]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]], he is often considered to be one of the three "omniscient" writers of the school. His elder contemporary [[Atisha|Atiśa]] (980–1054) considered Rongzompa to be an incarnation of the Indian ācārya Kṛṣṇapāda, the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Roerich (1949) p.160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;གཞན་ཕན་ཆོས་ཀྱི་ནང་བ p.25&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan historian [[Gö Lotsawa]] (1392–1481) said of Rongzom that no scholar in Tibet was his equal.

A.W. Barber writes that Rongzom was the first to receive the entire [[Dzogchen]] teachings of both [[Vimalamitra]] and [[Vairocana]] after the time of those two masters.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, 1990 p.301&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Blue Annals, Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo ... received the [[Semde]] (sems sde) teachings of the Dorje Dudjom transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

David Germano writes "In the eleventh century, Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo was without doubt the greatest Nyingma author, with extensive exoteric and esoteric commentaries."&lt;ref&gt;Germano (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Rongzom held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra, as Koppl notes:

{{quote|By now we have seen that Rongzom regards the views of the Sutrayana as inferior to those of Mantra, and he underscores his commitment to the purity of all phenomena by criticizing the Madhyamaka objectification of the authentic relative truth.&lt;ref&gt;Koppl, Heidi. ''Establishing Appearances as Divine.'' Snow Lion Publications 2008, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Writings==
According to a catalog of the commentaries he codified, the collected works of Rongzompa amounted to over 100 volumes, the majority of which are no longer [[Extant taxon|extant]]. In the 19th century, [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]], who was particularly influenced by Rongzompa's writings,&lt;ref&gt;Ju Mipham also wrote a short Guru Yoga practice focusing on Rongzom {{bo|t=དཔལ་རོང་ཟོམ་པཎྜི་ཏ་ཆེན་པོའི་བླ་མའི་རྣལ་བྱོར་བྱིན་རླབ་ཆར་འབེབས།|w= }}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to gather the surviving works together.

Important surviving works of Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo include:

*''Entering the Way of the Great Vehicle (Mahayana)'' ({{bo|t=ཐེག་པ་ཆེན་པོའི་ཚུལ་ལ་འཇུག་པ|w=theg pa chen po’i tshul la ’jug pa}}) – presents a defense and explanation of the Dzogchen tradition in the context of the Mahayana. This text has been translated into English:  ''Entering the Way of the Great Vehicle: Dzogchen as the Culmination of the Mahāyanā'', translated by Dominic Sur ( Snow Lion, 2017, Pages: 272, {{ISBN|9781611803686}}) 
* A commentary on Padmasambhava's ''Key Instructions: A Rosary of Views''  ({{bo|t=མན་ངག་ལྟ་ཕྲེང་གི་འགྲེལ་པ|w=man ngag lta phreng gi 'grel pa}}) – presents the view of the Nyingma school's nine yanas.
* A commentary on the Manjusrinama-Samgiti ({{bo|t=མཚན་ཡང་དག་པར་བརྗོད་པའི་འགྲེལ་པ་རྣམ་གསུམ་བཤད་པ|w=mtshan yang dag par brjod pa'i 'grel pa rnam gsum bshad pa}}).  This has been translated into English in The Wisdom of Manjushri (Sherdor, 2012).
*  A commentary on the  [[Guhyagarbha Tantra]] ({{bo|t=རྒྱུད་རྒྱལ་གསང་བ་སྙིང་པོ་དཀོན་ཅོག་འགྲེལ|w=rgyud rgyal gsang ba snying po dkon cog 'grel}})
*''Establishing the Divinity of Appearances'' ({{bo|t=སྣང་བ་ལྷར་བསྒྲུབ|w=snang ba lhar bsgrub}}) – a short text that presents the logical grounds for the pure view of Buddhist tantra. This text has been translated into English (by Heidi Köppl, in Establishing Appearances as Divine, 2008).
* ''The Great Stage of Buddhahood'' (Sangs rgyas kyi sa chen mo, Skt. Mahābuddhabhūmī), translated in Rong-zom-pa's discourses on buddhology: a study of various conceptions of buddhahood in Indian sources with special reference to the controversy surrounding the existence of gnosis (jñā-na : ye shes) as presented by the eleventh-century Tibetan scholar Rong-zom Chos-kyi-bzang-po, by Orni Almogi as Volume 24 of Studia philologica Buddhica: Monograph series, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies of the International College for Postgraduate Buddhist Studies, 2009.  Herein, Rongzom argues that on the level of the Buddha, gnosis does not exist, meaning that everything has been transcended and sublimated.

According to [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] and [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] philosophy, every [[Yoga|Yogi]] goes through '''Seven stages''' of development before achieving complete [[free will|liberation]].
They are listed in the commentary on the [[Yoga Sutras]] by [[Vyasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yoga and the Luminous: Patañjali's Spiritual Path to Freedom |last=Chapple |first=Christopher Key |page=172 |year=2008 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |isbn=9780791474754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Indian philosophy |authorlink=Surendranath Dasgupta |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |page=265 |year=1991 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=9788120804135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Stages==
The seven stages are grouped into two phases:
#The first four stages form the first phase where the Yogi is liberated from the 'products of mental processes',(i.e.) results of his thoughts.
#The last three stages form the second phase in which the Yogi is liberated from the mind itself.

'''Stage 1''':

''"That which is to be known is known by me".'' 
At this stage the yogi realises that all true [[knowledge]] comes from within oneself, and the mind becomes satisfied that meditation will lead to all truth.

'''Stage 2''':

At this stage the yogi recognises the causes of his sufferings, uses this knowledge to free himself from those causes and hence becomes free from pain.

'''Stage 3''':

The yogi attains full discriminative knowledge of the state of [[samādhi]], in which the Yogi is completely absorbed into The Self.

'''Stage 4''':

The yogi no longer needs to carry out acts (religious duties) as he has attained the end of all acts through discrimination.

'''Stage 5''':

At this stage the yogi becomes free of all waverings of the mind, (i.e.) The yogi obtains complete control over all mental processes.

'''Stage 6''':

The mind of the yogi becomes free of the influences of external natural processes whenever he desires so.

'''Stage 7''':

The Self of the yogi becomes identical with [[Purusha]] and the state of absolute freedom ([[kaivalya]]) is achieved.

[[File:Hirohito in dress uniform.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Emperor of Japan|Japan's Emperor]] ruled as divine descendant of sun goddess [[Amaterasu]].]]
'''Son of Heaven''', or '''''Tian Zi''''' ({{CJKV|c=天子|p=Tiānzǐ}}), is the sacred imperial title of the [[Chinese emperor]].  It originated with the ancient [[Zhou Dynasty]] and was founded on the political and spiritual doctrine of the [[Mandate of Heaven]].  The secular imperial title of the Son of Heaven was "[[Emperor of China]]".  

The title, "Son of Heaven", was subsequently adopted by other [[East Asia|East Asian]] monarchs to justify their rule.  

The Son of Heaven was the supreme universal emperor, who ruled ''[[tianxia]]'' ("all under heaven").  His status is rendered in English as "ruler of the whole universe" or "ruler of the whole world."{{sfn|Ebrey|2010|p=179}}  The title, "Son of Heaven", was interpreted literally only in [[China]] and [[Japan]], whose monarchs were referred to as [[demigod|demigods]], [[deity|deities]], or "[[deity|living gods]]", chosen by [[Chinese folk religion|all the ancient gods and goddesses]].{{sfn|Dull|1990|p=59}}

==History==
The title "Son of Heaven" stems from the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], created by the [[Zhou Dynasty]] monarchs to justify their having deposed the [[Shang Dynasty]].  They held that [[Tian|Heaven]] had revoked its mandate from the Shang and given it to the Zhou in retribution for Shang corruption and misrule.  Heaven bestowed the mandate on whomever was most fit to rule.  The title held the [[emperor]] responsible for the prosperity and security of his people by the threat of taking away his mandate.{{sfn|Dull|1990|p=59}}

The [[ancient]] [[Han Chinese]] [[Chinese sovereign|imperial]] title, {{nihongo|''tianzi''|天子}}, "Son of Heaven", was later adopted by the [[Emperor of Japan]] during that country's [[Asuka period]].{{sfn|Huffman|2010|p=15}}  Japan sent [[Japanese missions to Imperial China|diplomatic missions to China]], then ruled by the [[Sui dynasty]], and formed cultural and commercial ties with China.{{sfn|Inoue|1993|p=182}}  Japan's [[Yamato period|Yamato state]] modeled its government after the Chinese Confucian imperial bureaucracy.  A Japanese mission of 607 CE delivered a message from "the Son of Heaven in the [[Names of Japan|land where the sun rises]]&amp;nbsp;... to the Son of Heaven in the land where the sun sets."{{sfn|Huffman|2010|p=15}}  But the Japanese emperor's title was less contingent than that of his Chinese counterpart; there was no divine mandate that would punish Japan's emperor for failing to rule justly.  The right to rule of the Japanese emperor, descended from the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], was absolute.{{sfn|Beasley|1999|p=29}}

The Vietnamese also adopted the title, known in Vietnamese as ''Thiên tử'' ([[Chữ Hán]]: 天子).  A divine mandate gave the Vietnamese emperor the right to rule, based not on his lineage but on his competence to govern.{{sfn|Woodside|1971|p=9}}  Vietnam's adoption of a Confucian bureaucracy, presided over by Vietnam's Son of Heaven, led to the creation of a Vietnamese tributary system in Southeast Asia, modeled after the Chinese [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric system]] in East Asia.{{sfn|Woodside|1971|pp=234–237}}

"Son of Heaven" was often one of several titles adopted by East Asian monarchs.  [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] held the Chinese title, 
Son of Heaven", alongside the Central Asian title, ''[[Tian Kehan|Tengeri Qaghan]]'' ("Tenger Khan", or God-like Emperor), which he had gained after [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Eastern Tujue|defeating the Tujue]].{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|p=124}}  Japanese monarchs likewise used a second title, {{nihongo|''tennō''|天皇||"Heavenly Emperor"}}, that, like "Son of Heaven", appealed to the emperor's connection to Heaven.{{sfn|Ooms|2009|pp=154–156}}

Based on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, [[Goguryeo]] had concepts of Son of Heaven (天帝之子) and independent ''tianxia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yeongkwang |first1=Jo |title=Status and Tasks for Study of the Foreign Relations and World View of Koguryo in the Gwanggaeto Stele |journal=Dongbuga Yeoksa Nonchong |date=2015 |issue=49 |pages=70–76 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06520451 |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko |issn=1975-7840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=고구려의 천하관 |url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/hm/view.do?treeId=010201&amp;tabId=01&amp;levelId=hm_013_0010 |website=우리역사넷 |publisher=National Institute of Korean History |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Goryeo]] used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the ''Haedong'' "East of the Sea" ''tianxia'', which encompassed the historical domain of the "''Samhan''", another name for the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Em |first1=Henry |title=The Great Enterprise: Sovereignty and Historiography in Modern Korea |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822353725 |pages=24–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxAd2Aw_jP0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Deny Science — and Reality '''''  is a 2012 book about the [[Psychology|psychological basis]] for many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans']] rejection of [[Science|mainstream scientific]] theories, as well as theories of [[economics]] and [[history]], by the journalist [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]].

==Reception==
The ''[[Financial Times]]'' gave the book a favorable review, describing it as an "intelligent, nuanced and persuasive account" of psychological differences in political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d690e4ba-8a13-11e1-a0c8-00144feab49a.html#axzz1zeNQ4IS9 |title=Political animals |first= James |last= Wilsdon |date= 28 April 2012 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |accessdate= 2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooney responded, stating that Goldberg had mispresented his book in several respects.&lt;ref name="MooneyRespondsToGoldberg"/&gt; Mooney also stated that Goldberg exhibited "precisely the traits he seeks to deny: ideological defensiveness, a lack of nuance, and a deeply unwarranted and overconfident sense of certainty".&lt;ref name="MooneyRespondsToGoldberg"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/letters/story/2012-05-03/chirs-mooney-republican-brain/54733296/1 |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |department= Letters | title= Goldberg misunderstands ''Republican Brain'' |first= Chris |last= Mooney |authorlink= Chris Mooney (journalist) |date= 3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mooney later rebutted a similar criticism by [[Andrew Ferguson]] and stated that Ferguson dismissed science himself while attacking the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://scienceprogressaction.org/intersection/2012/05/the-weekly-standard-slam-the-republican-brain/ | work=[[Science Progress]] | title= ''The Weekly Standard'' slams ''The Republican Brain''  |first= Chris |last= Mooney |authorlink= Chris Mooney (journalist) |date= 14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Descartes}}

'''''The World''''', also called '''''Treatise on the Light''''' ([[French language|French]] title: ''Traité du monde et de la lumière''), is a book by [[René Descartes]] (1596&amp;ndash;1650). Written between 1629 and 1633, it contains a nearly complete version of his [[philosophy]], from method, to [[metaphysics]], to [[physics]] and [[biology]].

Descartes espoused [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]], a form of [[natural philosophy]] popular in the 17th century. He thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny "corpuscles" of matter. [[Corpuscularianism]] is closely related to [[atomism]]. The main difference was that Descartes maintained that there could be no [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|vacuum]], and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. ''The World'' presents a corpuscularian cosmology in which swirling vortices explain, among other phenomena, the creation of the [[Solar System]] and the circular motion of planets around the [[Sun]].

''The World'' rests on the [[heliocentric]] view, first explicated in Western Europe by [[Copernicus]].  Descartes delayed the book's release upon news of the [[Roman Inquisition]]'s conviction of [[Galileo]] for "suspicion of heresy" and sentencing to house arrest.  Descartes discussed his work on the book, and his decision not to release it, in letters with another philosopher, [[Marin Mersenne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaukroger|first=Stephen|title=Descartes an intellectual biography|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198237243|edition=Repr., paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some material from ''The World'' was revised for publication as ''Principia philosophiae'' or ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. In the ''Principles'' the heliocentric tone was softened slightly with a relativist frame of reference. The last chapter of ''The World'' was published separately as ''De Homine'' (''On Man'') in 1662. The rest of ''The World'' was finally published in 1664, and the entire text in 1677.

== The void and particles in nature ==
Before Descartes begins to describe his theories in physics, he introduces the reader to the idea that there is no relationship between our sensations and what creates these sensations, thereby casting doubt on the Aristotelian belief that such a relationship existed.  Next he describes how fire is capable of breaking wood apart into its minuscule parts through the rapid motion of the particles of fire within the flames.  This rapid motion of particles is what gives fire its heat, since Descartes claims heat is nothing more than just the motion of particles, and what causes it to produce light.

According to Descartes, the motion, or agitation, of these particles is what gives substances their properties (i.e. their fluidity and hardness).  Fire is the most fluid and has enough energy to render most other bodies fluid whereas the particles of air lack the force necessary to do the same.  Hard bodies have particles that are all equally hard to separate from the whole.

Based on his observations of how resistant nature is to a vacuum, Descartes deduced that all particles in nature are packed together such that there is no void or empty space in nature (however, Descartes makes it clear that he does not claim that a void cannot exist in nature, since he lacks the observations necessary to say this with certainty).

Descartes describes substances as consisting only of three elementary elements: fire, air and earth, from which the properties of any substance can be characterized by its composition of these elements, the size and arrangement of the particles in the substance, and the motion of its particles.

== Cartesian laws of motion ==

The motion of these particles and all other objects in nature are subject to the laws of motion Descartes had observed:

# “…each particular part of matter always continues in the same state unless collision with others forces it to change its state.”
# “…when one of these bodies pushes another, it cannot give the 2nd any motion, except by losing as much of its own motion at the same time…”
#  “…when a body is moving…each of its parts individually tends always to continue moving along a straight line” (Gaukroger)

Descartes in ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' added to these his laws on [[elastic collision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Garber|title=The Cambridge history of seventeenth-century philosophy: Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC&amp;pg=PA688|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9|page=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Cartesian universe ==

Descartes elaborates on how the universe could have started from utter chaos and with these basic laws could have had its particles arranged so as to resemble the universe we observe today.  Once the particles in the chaotic universe began to move, the overall motion would have been circular because there is no void in nature, so whenever a single particle moves, another particle must also move to occupy the space where the previous particle once was.  This type of circular motion, or vortex, would have created what Descartes observed to be the orbits of the planets about the sun with the heavier objects spinning out towards the outside of the vortex and the lighter objects remaining closer to the center.  To explain this, Descartes used the analogy of a river that carried both floating debris (leaves, feathers, etc.) and heavy boats.  If the river abruptly arrived at a sharp bend, the boats would follow Descartes third law of motion and hit the shore of the river since the flow of the particles in the river would not have enough force to change the direction of the boat.  However, the much lighter floating debris would follow the river since the particles in the river would have sufficient force to change the direction of the debris.  In the heavens, it’s the circular flow of celestial particles, or aether, that causes the motion of the planets to be circular.

As to the reason why heavy objects on Earth fall, Descartes explained this through the agitation of the particles in the atmosphere.  The particles of the aether have greater agitation than the particles of air, which in turn have greater agitation than the particles that compose terrestrial objects (e.g. stones).  The greater agitation of the aether prevents the particles of air from escaping into the heavens, just as the agitation of air particles forces terrestrial bodies, whose particles have far less agitation than those of air, to descend towards the world.

== Cartesian theory on light ==

With his laws of motion set forth and the universe operating under these laws, Descartes next begins to describe his theory on the nature of light.  Descartes believed that light traveled instantaneously - a common belief at the time – as an impulse across all the adjacent particles in nature, since Descartes believed nature was without a void.  To illustrate this, Descartes used the example of a stick being pushed against some body.  Just as the force which is felt at one end of the stick is instantly transferred and felt at the other end, so is the impulse of light that is sent across the heavens and through the atmosphere from luminous bodies to our eyes.  Descartes attributed light to have 12 distinct properties:

#Light extends circularly in all direction from luminous bodies	
#Light extends out to any distance
#Light travels instantaneously
#Light travels ordinarily in straight lines or rays
#Several rays can come from different points and meet at the same point
#Several rays can start at the same point and travel in different directions
#Several rays can pass through the same point without impeding each other
#If the rays are of very unequal force, then they can sometimes impede one another

Also:
* 9) and 10) Rays can be diverted by reflection or by refraction
* 11) and 12) The force of a ray can be augmented or diminished by the disposition of the matter that receives it.

==Christian hermeneutics==
{{Main|Biblical hermeneutics}}

'''Biblical hermeneutics''' is the study of the principles of interpretation concerning the books of the [[Bible]]. It is part of the broader field of [[hermeneutics]] which involves the study of principles for the text and includes all forms of communication: verbal and nonverbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Judaic hermeneutics==
{{Main|Talmudical hermeneutics}}

'''Talmudical Hermeneutics''' ([[Hebrew]]:  approximately, '''מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהן''') is the science which defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the [[Tanakh|Scriptures]], both legal and historical. Since the [[Halakah]], however, is regarded simply as an exposition and explanation of the [[Torah]], [[Talmud]] [[hermeneutics]] includes also the rules by which the requirements of the oral law are derived from and established by the written law.

==Islamic hermeneutics==
{{Main|Qur'anic hermeneutics}}

'''Qur'anic hermeneutics''' is the study of theories of the interpretation and understanding of the [[Qur'an]], the [[Muslim]] holy book. Throughout religious history, Qur'anic scholars have sought to mine the wealth of its meanings by developing a variety of different systems of [[hermeneutics]].

'''Vidyajyoti College of Theology''' (literally, ‘Light of Knowledge’), [[Delhi]], [[India]], is an institute and faculty of [[theology]] run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. It was started in 1879 in [[Asansol]], West Bengal, as a modest 'Saint Joseph’s Seminary'. From 1889 to 1971 it developed in the mountains of [[Kurseong]], near [[Darjeeling]], where it was renamed Saint Mary’s College. From 1972 onwards it has flourished in the neighbourhood of the [[University of Delhi]].

Vidyajyoti confers the Degrees of Bachelor of Theology, Master of [[Theology]] and Doctor of Theology. It also admits students for certificate courses for one or two years and diploma courses for three years.

Vidyajyoti is known for its efforts to develop a contextual method of doing [[theology]]. As integral part of its curriculum, each student is assigned to a concrete social context and initiated into socio-cultural analysis of the Indian situation. This enables the student to get a more competent and comprehensive grasp of the issues that affect the lives of ordinary Indians. Theological reflection is thus closely related to questions emerging from the context, thereby equipping each student to understand the [[Christian faith]] from within the Indian context and in dialogue with India’s many religions.

==History==
Vidyajyoti College of Theology is one of the oldest institutions of learning run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in India. It started in [[Asansol]] ([[West Bengal]]) in 1881, as a house for training in [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] for expatriate young European missionaries that at that time volunteered for service in India (among whom was the apostle of [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chotanagpur]], [[Constant Lievens]]) and came to the country without having yet done the years of study required for the [[priesthood]].

In 1889, the Seminary, as it was then called, was transferred to hills of the [[Himalayas]], in [[Kurseong]] ([[Darjeeling District]]), about 1800 metres above sea level, where for 82 years grew into an important centre of research and teaching of Indian religions and Christian theology, open to Indian and foreign Jesuits working in South Asia.

In 1932, the [[Holy See]] recognized it as a Faculty of Theology directly under its Congregation for Education, authorized to offer degrees of Licentiate and Doctorate in theology recognized in the [[Catholic Church]].

In 1972, the St Mary's College, as it was then called, was transferred to Delhi where it took the name of '''Vidyajyoti College'''. It also opened its doors to any duly qualified students interested in the subjects it offers. As a result of a restructuring of its academic programme from 1978 the College opened extension centres in various parts of the country aimed at greater integration with the various cultures of India and at eventually teaching and studying theology in our rich local languages. At present, the faculty has five such extension centres in [[Chennai]], [[Patna]], [[Ranchi]], [[Shantiniketan]] (West-Bengal) and [[Varanasi]]. Students do part of their courses in these centres and complete them in the national centre in Delhi.

==Work==
Vidyajyoti is more than an academic institution. It is a way of life designed to form men and women dedicated to the service of others by letting the inner Divine Light shine through them. Many, though not all, of its students prepare for the priesthood. The personal growth in enlightened religious attitudes of bhakti and jñāna are central to the aims of the institution. The main prerequisite is therefore a deep religious faith and a desire for contact with the Divine. But faith needs to be enlightened by objective and valid knowledge. Yet, neither true bhakti nor jñāna will be authentic if they do not emerge from a life of commitment to the good of others, without karma.

== Objectives ==
The Faculty aims at:
personal religious and human growth of its members
research and publication in the areas of religion, religious history, theology, Indian traditions, sociology of religion, and allied subjects
teaching courses of theology at the levels of B.Th. and M.Th. and at doctoral research
fostering and participating in ecumenical discourse and interreligious dialogue
being involved in movements of the people aiming at their liberation from the clutches of poverty, oppression and marginalization.

==Faculty==
Vidyajyoti College has a residential faculty consisting largely of Jesuits coming from all parts of India and from diverse cultural backgrounds. This diversity is enriched with the presence and support of ‘visiting lecturers’.

The Faculty is governed by the Academic Council, which consists of: (a) All Professors, Readers, Lecturers and Tutors who are permanent members of the Staff; (b) The Rector of Vidyajyoti; (c) The Registrar; (d) Associate and Visiting teachers during their stay at the centre; (e) Three representatives of the B.Th. students as well as one representative of the postgraduate students for matters especially concerning the order of studies and other matters affecting the academic life and interests of the students. If there is no woman representative among those elected, the Principal in consultation with Executive Council will nominate one. The students of each Regional Centre elect one representative. The Treasurer, Administrator and Librarian, unless they are otherwise members of the Council, may be called whenever found opportune.

==Academics==
Some people are puzzled by the word theology although it is quite a traditional word. Literally it means the study or understanding of God. It is true that by its transcendence the Divine is beyond the scope of human rational study. There are other roads to contact the Mystery at the root of all existence. Religions have somehow given testimony to it. The study of religions and of other ways in which the concept and the reality of the Divine has impacted in human history forms the specific field of the study of theology. It includes the study of the great Scriptures, and the way in which the respective communities have understood their message. For Christians the Bible is primary but not exclude other Scriptures. There is also the study of religious history of humanity and of our own community and of the many expressions for the Divine found in history.

Theology is necessary if religion wants to avoid the pitfalls of irrationality and narrow fundamentalism. It is important to study our own faiths by using the gifts of reason and understanding, and the sense of the higher values, which nature, or rather God, has given us. Theology is not a rationalization of religion or of faith. Rather it helps faith be truly human, flourish and be fruitful within the complexities of life.

The aim of Vidyajyoti is to do contextual theology. This means that the understanding of God and of the knowledge of God which our faith has given us takes into account the rich historical culture in which we find ourselves and is articulated in ways that make sense within this context. This has been in the past and continues to be the specific theological focus of Vidyajyoti, so much so that already in 1905 it started in Kurseong an ‘Indian Academy’ to facilitate the study of Indian religions at a time when colonialism was still the dominant culture.

==Students==
Vidyajyoti currently has 305 students on its rolls studying at its college in Delhi and its RTCs (regional theology centres). The students are university graduates or postgraduates belonging to some 70 religious congregations, dioceses, secular institutes and lay associations from every part of India and abroad. Although most of the students belong to the Indian subcontinent, there are a few from abroad, as well. While the medium of education is English, Hindi is mostly used for fieldwork.

===Spiritual Life===
Vidyajyoti seeks to nourish in its students a vibrant spirituality to sustain its theology and praxis. The spiritual life of students is nurtured through regular religious exercises and sacramental life (daily [[Eucharist]], weekly adoration, monthly recollection, yearly retreat, special preparations for [[diaconate]] and so on). A Jesuit counselor — assisted by some staff-members with training in psycho-spirituality — provides spiritual guidance. The staff and students also organize and actively participate in various other spiritual, pastoral and [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] programmes in and around Delhi.

===Cultural Activities===
The diversity among Vidyajyoti’s students is representative of the diversity in India itself. The students speak some twenty languages and bring their cultural treasures to expression during the yearly festivals that are celebrated. Besides the national festivals of India that are celebrated with appropriate liturgy, three major cultural festivals are celebrated. These are (a) Karam, which is a tribal festival celebrated by the Chotanagpur adivasis (aboriginals), (b) Onam a harvest festival celebrated by the people of Kerala in south India, and (c) Pongal the harvest festival of Tamil Nadu, south India. At these occasions, through creative use of the media, dance, drama, music and other means, the students highlight the meaning of these feasts, their theological relevance and their impact in the lives or ordinary people. Other cultural activities include an annual cultural programme held in the college and in Tihar Jail where the students work, as well as occasional skits and debates on themes of theological interest.

===Extension Services===
Besides the extracurricular activities of the college, Vidyajyoti’s students offer Extension Services to other academic institutions in Delhi and elsewhere. Groups of students offer their services for conducting self-awareness, personality development, faith formation and social awareness seminars and weekends for students of other colleges and schools. Seminars are also conducted for teachers in various schools and colleges so as to improve teacher-student relationships. The Vidyajyoti students also network with socially committed groups in organizing interfaith initiatives, highlighting social problems and dialoguing on religio-social concerns that affect life in India.

===Contextual Ministries===
Fieldwork is an integral part of the Vidyajyoti curriculum. Every student is required to opt for and be committed to some form of fieldwork since the faculty considers guided socio-pastoral involvement as an essential dimension of doing contextual theology. Each student is put into direct contact with a specific community, especially the marginalized ones to gain direct experience of the negativities of life and the suffering of the poor. This context then becomes a locus theologicus — a site for a deepening reflection on the [[Christian faith]] and other faiths, as well.

Apart from these regular ministries, orientation programs and spiritual guidance in various schools and parishes are also conducted in and around Delhi for teachers, students and youth.  Students are also involved in SAMAG (Social and Media Action Group) that creates awareness among the students of Vidyajyoti on issues of injustice, violation of human rights, exploitation of women, decisions that affect the Dalits, tribals and children. SAMAG also takes initiative to organize and collaborate with other NGOs and agencies fighting for the rights of the oppressed and marginalized in the form of dharna and protests.

Regular pastoral reflection sessions in the College are intended to integrate theology with the experience of the students in their fieldwork and vice versa. In this way, the students are trained to cultivate a deeply human and Christian perspective of life that calls for committed responds to the signs of the times.

For their pastoral and social ministries the students visit those in prison (Tihal Jail), in hospitals and homes run by the [[Missionaries of Charity]]. They organize activities and tuitions for slum, railway stations and neighbourhood children (Bal mela). Some are involved in organizing religious services in Delhi parishes and give guidances to spiritual and youth groups (Small Christian communities, Youth catholic associations, etc.). They help also marginal groups into organizing themselves into self-help units: domestic workers from the tribal areas, rickshaw pullers (Asha ki kiran), etc.

==Resources==

===Library===
The library holds nearly 130,000 volumes and has more than 300 reviews. Most of the library has been computerized and the students have access to three points of entry into the computer and to the stacks of the library. The library is particularly rich in the fields of Biblical studies, systematic and pastoral theology, spirituality, [[Hinduism]] and Indian culture and Islamics.

The library has a few hundreds of ancient publications, some of them from the 16th to the 19th century. Its oldest book was printed in 1514, a Latin commentary on the Book of Sentences of [[Peter Lombard]], which was almost a kind of text book of theology in the 16th century university of Paris. The library has also a precious manuscript of a Tamil-French dictionary composed in the 18th century, one of the earliest monuments of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[lexicography]].

The library is open to research scholars and staff of [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], the [[University of Delhi]], [[Jamia Millia Islamia]] and other scholars from India and abroad.

===Archives===
From 2005 we have started the process of digitalising some rare and ancient books and manuscripts in Vidyajyoti Library as a collaborative venture with the EurIndia Project of Preservation of Rare Books to make these rich resources available to scholars through internet facilities. The Hosten Collections are also in the process of being digitalised.

==Publications==
Theological research being one of the aims of the Vidyajyoti faculty, it endeavours to publish the results of the research of its teachers and students.

Some of Vidyajyoti’s publications are: Vidyajyoti Journal of Theological Research, Ave, Vachan Sudha and Tattvaviveka.

The [[Vidyajyoti Journal of Theological Research]] [VJTR], a monthly journal, reaches nearly 4000 subscribers all over the world, including most theological colleges of English-speaking countries. It covers areas of Christian theology and service, inter-religious dialogue, Indian theology, social concerns, and trends significant for religion in the modern times. The Journal was started in 1938 with the title ''The Clergy Monthly''. In 1975 it assumed the present title. It opens its pages to scholars from all over India that want to publish in the areas of concern for the journal.
