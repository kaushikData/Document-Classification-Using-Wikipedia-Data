      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2429">In American media, the term '''Americanization''' is used to describe the [[censorship|censoring]] and [[editing]] of a foreign TV show or movie that is bought by a U.S. station. This editing is done with the aim of making the work more appealing to American audiences, and to respond to perceived American sensitivities. The changes can be so drastic that little—if any—evidence of the TV show or movie's true origin remains.

For television documentaries, it is an established practice in English-speaking countries to hire someone of the audience's accent as a narrator. Sometimes the script is done verbatim, e.g., the [[PBS]] [[Nova]] documentary series continued to use the [[BBC]]'s original word "maize," whereas an American audience would expect to hear "corn."

==Media==
In [[Hollywood]], many foreign film productions (most of them from [[Europe]] and the [[Far East]]) are remade into U.S.-produced versions for American viewers - adapting the story to conform to American culture. Most of these "Americanized" versions are filmed in American places, and with English-speaking actors. Examples include ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', ''[[Point of No Return (film)|Point of No Return]]'' (aka ''[[Nikita (film)|Nikita]]''), ''[[My Father the Hero (1994 film)|My Father the Hero]]'', ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', and [[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]. In some cases, an original story from a foreign country is Americanized by recasting its lead characters as American; an example of this was the first adaptation of the [[James Bond]] novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', which was produced for [[CBS Television]] in 1954. In this version, the character of Bond — a [[United Kingdom|British]] agent in the original novel and subsequent movie series — is changed into an American agent for the TV version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">'''[[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] Knowledge Tracing''' is an [[algorithm]] used in many [[intelligent tutoring systems]] to model each learner's mastery of the knowledge being tutored.

It models student knowledge in a [[Hidden Markov Model]] as a latent variable, updated by observing the correctness of each student's interaction in which they apply the skill in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Corbett, A. T.|author2=Anderson, J. R.|title=Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge|journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction|date=1995|volume=4|issue=4|pages=253–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BKT assumes that student knowledge is represented as a set of binary variables, one per skill, where the skill is either mastered
by the student or not. Observations in BKT are also binary: a student gets a problem/step either right or wrong.
[[Intelligent tutoring systems]] often uses BKT for mastery learning and problem sequencing. In its most common
implementation, BKT has only skill-specific parameters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yudelson, M.V.|author2=Koedinger, K.R.|author3=Gordon, G.J.|title=Individualized bayesian knowledge tracing models|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Education|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
There are 4 model parameters used in BKT:
* &lt;math&gt;p(L_0)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p-init&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of the student knowing the skill beforehand.
* &lt;math&gt;p(T)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p-transit&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of the student demonstrating knowledge of the skill after an opportunity to apply it
* &lt;math&gt;p(S)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p-slip&lt;/math&gt;, the probability the student makes a mistake when applying a known skill
* &lt;math&gt;p(G)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p-guess&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that the student correctly applies an unknown skill (has a lucky guess)
Assuming that these parameters are set for all skills, the following formulas are used as follows: The initial probability of a student &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; mastering skill &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is set to the p-init parameter for that skill equation (a). Depending on whether the student &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; learned and applies skill &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; correctly or incorrectly, the conditional probability is computed by using equation (b) for correct application, or by using equation (c) for incorrect application. The conditional probability is used to update the probability of skill mastery calculated by equation (d). To figure out the probability of the student correctly applying the skill on a future practice is calculated with equation (e). 

Equation (a):

&lt;math&gt;p(L_1)^k_u=p(L_0)^k&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (b): 

&lt;math&gt;p(L_{t+1}|obs=correct)^k_u=\frac{p(L_t)^k_u\cdot(1-p(S)^k)}{p(L_t)^k_u\cdot(1-p(S)^k)+(1-p(L_t)^k_u)\cdot p(G)^k}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (c): 

&lt;math&gt;p(L_{t+1}|obs=wrong)^k_u=\frac{p(L_t)^k_u\cdot p(S)^k}{p(L_t)^k_u\cdot p(S)^k+(1-p(L_t)^k_u)\cdot(1-p(G)^k)}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (d):

&lt;math&gt;p(L_{t+1})^k_u=p(L_{t+1}|obs)^k_u+(1-p(L_{t+1}|obs)^k_u)\cdot p(T)^k&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (e):

&lt;math&gt;p(C_{t+1})^k_u=p(L_t)^k_u\cdot(1-p(S)^k)+(1-p(L_t)^k_u)\cdot p(G)^k&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Blaues Kartell''' is a circle of four [[German Student Corps]], or '''Corps''' ([[Studentenverbindung]]) for short, who understand the union as "one fraternity spanning four cities". The member fraternities are the Corps [[Corps Altsachsen Dresden|Altsachsen Dresden]], [[Corps Saxo-Thuringia München|Saxo-Thuringia München]], [[Corps Berlin|Berlin]] and Hannoverania Hannover. 

The ''Blaues Kartell'' is the largest one of similar circles within the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical [[Corporation (university)|fraternities]] found in Europe, its roots dating back to the 15th century A.D.&lt;ref name="DieCorps"&gt;Die Corps.

== History ==
The ''Blaues Kartell'' was founded on April 24, 1874 by Landsmannschaft (today Corps) Hannoverania Hannover and Landsmannschaft Feronia Berlin (later Corps Teutonia, today part of Corps Berlin). Both fraternities belonged to the local ''Berliner SC'' of ''veterinary-medical Landsmannschaften''. Over the years, the ''Blaues Kartell'' grew as new fraternities with compatible ideals of the enlightenment joined and left:
[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by the fraternities' members then and now.]]
* 1874 Initiation by Hannoverania Hannover and Feronia Berlin (later Corps Teutonia, today Corps Berlin)
* 1875 Hippokratia München (until suspension in 1879)
* 1885 Landsmannschaft Nicaria Stuttgart (until it fused with Saxo-Thuringia München in 1910)
* 1899 [[Corps Saxo-Thuringia München|Saxo-Thuringia München]]
* 1900 Albingia Aachen (until it fused with [[Corps Marko-Guestphalia Aachen|Marko-Guestphalia Aachen]] in 1996)
* 1933 Frisia Frankfurt (until it suspended due to Nazi pressure in 1935)
* 1993 [[Corps Altsachsen Dresden|Altsachsen Dresden]]
* 2010 [[Corps Berlin]] (established in 2009 by fusion of Corps Teutonia, Cheruscia, and Rheno-Guestphalia in Berlin)

The constitution of the Blaues Kartell stipulates that a member fraternity that merges with another (external) fraternity, will lose its membership with the ''Blaues Kartell''. The reason is that newly formed fraternities are understood to be inhomogeneous, thus first need to internally debate and decide to re-join the ''Blaues Kartell'', then successfully petition to be accepted as an equal member of the ''Kartell'' again, a process which requires the current ''Kartell'' members to agree on the new potential member.

As a result of formerly being a member but not yet having re-joined the ''Kartell'', a friendly relationship exists with [[Corps Marko-Guestphalia Aachen]] that has its origin in Marko-Guestphalia's history: the former ''Corps Albingia Dresden'' existed until its suspension due to Nazi pressure against the [[German Student Corps]] in the 1930s and remained dormant for years before being reconstructed in Aachen after the war. The fusion of the reconstructed, now ''Corps Albingia Aachen'' with the ''Corps Marko-Guestphalia'' in 1996 caused Albingia having to exit the ''Kartell''. Marko-Guestphalia and Saxo-Thuringia thereafter established an official relationship to commemorate the former band between the two fraternities.

'''''Borne Fontaine''''' (or ''Kiosque à eau'') is a permanent [[fountain]], from artist [[Danièle Diwouta-Kotto]], inaugurated in 2003. It is located in [[Douala]] ([[Cameroon]]).

==The artwork==

Borne Fontaine is a [[public art]]work in [[Douala]] ([[Cameroon]]. Its creation was commissioned by [[Doual'art]], produced by [[Danièle Diwouta-Kotto]], then offered to the Douala Municipality. It was inaugurated in 2003 during the [[c:Category:SUD Salon Urbain de Douala 2007|SUD - Salon Urbain de Douala 2007]]. It is an artwork of 3 by 4 meters, with a height of 6 meters.

Before its construction, Danièle Diwouta-Kotto, an architect whose firm secured the prime contractor, had had several conversations with the community. During these exchanges, the architect had invited people to imagine what might look like a fire hydrant ideal.

The people of Bessengu-Akwa wanted a framework that would be a meeting point, would offer an attractive sight and would also provide [[water]]. Following the interviews, the architect has made several proposals and people chose the model that corresponded most to their expectations.

This small building was therefore conceived as a public and paying fountain, as well as a food outlet. In particular, the roof reflects the style of the ephemeral building, created by the artist [[Jesús Palomino]], in the workshop '' Bessengue City '' organized by [[Goddy Leye]] and theart center [[ArtBakery]].&lt;ref&gt;'' [http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=78307 Cameroon: The aesthetics of water] '' in IRIN for Humanitarian Affairs and Analysis of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 20/05/2008; ''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is restored in 2013, the walls being repainted.

The '''''Cancionero de Turin''''' or '''''Cancionero Musical de Turin''''' is a musical [[manuscript]] that contains Spanish secular [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] works from the period between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, in the transition period between the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras.

== The manuscript ==
The manuscript is kept at the [[Turin National University Library|National University Library]] (R.1–14) in [[Turin]], Italy.

The index section lists 47 works, but one of them is duplicated. Th manuscript includes three other works that are not listed in the index, two of which are also duplicated. On the other hand, the works listed as numbers 36 and 37, ''Salte y baile'' and ''Mi voluntad no me dexa'' are in fact parts of a single work titled ''Por dinero baila el perro''. Therefore, the cancionero contains 46 individual works. One of them is for 4 voices, 35 are for 3 voices and the ten remaining are for 2 voices. The musical forms employed are the [[villancico]], the [[canción]] and the [[Romance (music)|romance]].

All the pieces are anonymous, but one of them, ''Sobre moradas violetas'', is also found in the [[Cancionero de la Sablonara]], attributed to the [[Sevillian]] guitarist and composer [[Juan de Palomares]], on a text by Catalina Zamudio.

Several texts were extracted from the [[romancero]] or were written by known authors, such as [[Lope de Vega]], Catalina Zamudio, etc.

'''Cannon fodder''' is an informal, derogatory term for [[combatant]]s who are regarded or treated by government or military command as expendable in the face of enemy fire. The term is generally used in situations where combatants are forced to deliberately fight against hopeless odds (with the foreknowledge that they will suffer extremely high casualties) in an effort to achieve a strategic goal; an example is the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. The term may also be used (somewhat pejoratively) to differentiate [[infantry]] from other forces (such as artillery troops, air force or the navy), or to distinguish expendable low-grade or inexperienced combatants from supposedly more valuable veterans.

The term derives from [[fodder]], as food for [[livestock]]. Soldiers are the metaphorical food for enemy [[cannon]] fire.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/cannon%20fodder |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=education.yahoo.com |publisher=[[Yahoo! Search]] |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606134638/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/cannon%20fodder |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The concept of soldiers as fodder, as nothing more than "food" to be consumed by battle, dates back to at least the 16th century. For example, in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' there is a scene where Prince Henry ridicules [[John Falstaff]]'s pitiful group of soldiers. Falstaff replies to Prince Henry with [[cynical]] references to [[gunpowder]] and tossing bodies into [[mass grave]] pits, saying that his men are "good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better [men]...."

The first attested use of the expression "cannon fodder" supposedly belongs to a French writer, [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]. In his anti-[[Napoleonic]] pamphlet "De Bonaparte et des Bourbons", published in 1814, he criticized the cynical attitude towards recruits that prevailed in the end of [[Napoleon]]'s reign: "''On en était venu à ce point de mépris pour la vie des hommes et pour la France, d'appeler les conscrits la matière première et la chair à canon''" — "the contempt for the lives of men and for France herself has come to the point of calling the [[conscripts]] 'the raw material' and 'the cannon fodder'."&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[:wikisource:fr:De Buonaparte et des Bourbons|"De Buonaparte et des Bourbons"]] — full text in the French [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; The English term dates back at least to 1893&lt;ref&gt;Sense 9, "Cannon", entry, pp. 71-72, vol. 2, [https://archive.org/details/oed02arch ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles''], James A. H. Murray, ed., Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/20/opinion/lighter-world-war-i-language/ How World War I gave us 'cooties'], Jonathan Lighter, cnn.com, June 25, 2014.

[[File:Centum Satem map.png|thumb|238px|Map showing the approximate extent of the ''centum'' (blue) and ''satem'' (red) [[Areal feature|areals]]. The origin of satemization according to von Bradke's hypothesis is shown in darker red (marked as the range of the [[Sintashta-Petrovka|Sintashta]]/[[Abashevo culture|Abashevo]]/[[Srubna culture|Srubna]] archaeological cultures), but that hypothesis is not accepted by the majority of linguists.]]
{{Indo-European topics|310}}

Languages of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] are classified as either '''centum languages''' or '''satem languages''' according to how the [[dorsal consonant]]s (sounds of "K" and "G" type) of the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) developed. An example of the different developments is provided by the words for "hundred" found in the early [[attested language|attested]] [[Indo-European languages]]. In centum languages, they typically began with a {{IPAslink|k}} sound ([[Latin]] ''centum'' was pronounced with initial /k/), but in satem languages, they often began with {{IPAslink|s}} (the example ''satem'' comes from the [[Avestan language]] of [[Zoroastrian]] scripture).

The table below shows the traditional reconstruction of the PIE dorsal consonants, with three series, but according to [[#Alternative interpretations|some more recent theories]] there may actually have been only two series or three series with different pronunciations from those traditionally ascribed. In centum languages, the palatovelars, which included the initial consonant of the "hundred" root, merged with the plain velars. In satem languages, they remained distinct, and the labiovelars merged with the plain velars.&lt;ref name="D.Q. Adams 1997 p. 461"&gt;J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (1997), p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centum–satem division forms an [[isogloss]] in [[synchrony and diachrony|synchronic]] descriptions of Indo-European languages. It is no longer thought that the Proto-Indo-European language split first into centum and satem branches from which all the centum and all the satem languages, respectively, would have derived. Such a division is made particularly unlikely by the discovery that while the satem group lies generally to the east and the centum group to the west, the most eastward of the known IE language branches, [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], is centum.&lt;ref name=FortsonConsonants&gt;{{harvnb|Fortson|2010|loc=chpt. 3.2–3.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centum languages==
The canonical centum languages of the Indo-European family are the "western" branches: [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]. They merged Proto-Indo-European palatovelars and plain velars, yielding plain velars only ("centumisation") but retained the labiovelars as a distinct set.&lt;ref name="D.Q. Adams 1997 p. 461"/&gt;

The [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] branch probably falls outside the centum–satem dichotomy; for instance, [[Luwian language|Luwian]] indicates that all three dorsal consonant rows survived separately in [[Proto-Anatolian language|Proto-Anatolian]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Fortson|2010|p=59}}, originally proposed in {{harvnb|Melchert|1987}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The centumisation observed in [[Hittite language|Hittite]] is therefore assumed to have occurred only after the breakup of Proto-Anatolian.&lt;ref name="Fortson 2010 178"&gt;{{harvnb|Fortson|2010|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]] is generally regarded as a centum language,&lt;ref name=Fortson59&gt;{{harvnb|Fortson|2010|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a special case, as it has merged all three of the PIE dorsal series (originally nine separate consonants) into a single phoneme, ''*k''. According to some scholars, that complicates the classification of Tocharian within the centum–satem model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Tocharian has replaced some Proto-Indo-European labiovelars with the labiovelar-like, non-original sequence ''*ku''; it has been proposed that labiovelars remained distinct in [[Proto-Tocharian language|Proto-Tocharian]], which places Tocharian in the centum group (assuming that Proto-Tocharian lost palatovelars while labiovelars were still phonemically distinct).&lt;ref name="Fortson59"/&gt;

In the centum languages, PIE roots reconstructed with palatovelars developed into forms with plain velars. For example, in the [[PIE root]] ''*{{PIE|ḱm̥tóm}}'', "hundred", the initial palatovelar *{{PIE|ḱ}} became a plain velar /k/, as in Latin ''centum'' (which was originally pronounced with /k/ in spite of various contemporary pronunciations with /s/, for example), [[Greek language|Greek]] ''(he)katon'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''cant'', [[Tocharian B]] ''kante''. In the [[Germanic languages]], the /k/ developed regularly by [[Grimm's law]] to become /h/, as in the English ''hund(red)''.

Centum languages also retained the distinction between the PIE labiovelar row (*{{PIE|kʷ}}, *{{PIE|gʷ}}, *{{PIE|gʷʰ}}) and the plain velars. Historically, it was unclear whether the labiovelar row represented an innovation by a process of labialisation, or whether it was inherited from the parent language (but lost in the satem branches); current mainstream opinion favours the latter possibility. Labiovelars as single phonemes (for example, {{IPA|/kʷ/}}) as opposed to biphonemes (for example, {{IPA|/kw/}}) are attested in Greek (the [[Linear B]] ''q-'' series), Italic (Latin ''qu''), Germanic ([[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] ''[[hwair]]'' ''ƕ'' and ''qairþra'' ''q'') and Celtic ([[Ogham]] ''ceirt'' ''Q'') (in the [[P-Celtic]] languages {{IPA|/kʷ/}} developed into /p/; a similar development sometimes took place [[Mycenaean Greek|in Greek]]). The [[boukólos rule]], however, states that a labiovelar reduces to a plain velar when it occurs next to {{PIE|*''u''}} or {{PIE|*''w''}}.

The centum–satem division refers to the development of the dorsal series at the time of the earliest separation of Proto-Indo-European into the [[proto-language]]s of its individual daughter branches. It does not apply to any later analogous developments within any individual branch. For example, the conditional palatalization of [[Latin]] {{IPA|/k/}} to {{IPA|/s/}} in some [[Romance languages]] (which means that modern [[French language|French]] ''cent'' is pronounced with initial /s/) is satem-like, as is the merger of {{PIE|*kʷ}} with {{PIE|*k}} in the [[Gaelic languages]]; such later changes do not affect the classification of the languages as centum.

==Satem languages==
The satem languages belong to the "eastern" sub-families, especially [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] (but not [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]]). It lost the labial element of Proto-Indo-European labiovelars and merged them with plain velars, but the palatovelars remained distinct and typically came to be realised as [[sibilant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory 1997, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; That set of developments, particularly the [[assibilation]] of palatovelars, is referred to as '''satemisation'''.

Some linguists claim that the [[Albanian language|Albanian]]&lt;ref name=MatasovicOnPedersen&gt;Matasović, Ranko (2012). [http://mudrac.ffzg.unizg.hr/~rmatasov/Albanian.pdf "A Grammatical Sketch of Albanian for students of Indo-European"]. Page 13:"It has been claimed that the difference between the three PIE series of gutturals is preserved in Albanian before front vowels. This thesis, sometimes referred to as Pedersen’s law, is often contested, but still supported by the majority of Albanologists (e. g. Hamp, Huld, and Ölberg). In examining this view, one should bear in mind that it seems certain that there were at least two palatalizations in Albanian: the first palatalization, whereby labiovelars were palatalized to s and z before front vowels and *y, and the second palatalization, whereby all the remaining velars (*k and *g) were palatalized to q and gj, in the same environment. PIE palatalized velars are affected by neither palatalization (they yield Alb. th, d, dh, cf. Alb. thom ‘I say’ &lt; *k’ensmi, cf. OInd. śa m s- ‘praise’,  L c e nse o ‘reckon’). It may be that th yielded f before a consonant, if Alb. ënfle ‘sleep’ is from *nthle &lt; *n-k’loye- (cf. G klínō ‘recline’). " &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] {{citation needed|date=July 2017}} branches are also classified as satem, but some linguists claim that they show evidence of separate treatment of all three dorsal consonant rows and so may not have merged the labiovelars with the plain velars, unlike the canonical satem branches. In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], some assert that /kʷ/ is distinguishable from /k/ before front vowels,&lt;ref&gt;[[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]], ''[[Historische Sprachforschung|KZ]]'' 36 (1900) 277–340; [[Norbert Jokl]], in: ''Mélanges linguistiques offerts à M. Holger Pedersen'' (1937) 127–161.&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], it has been claimed that /kʷ/ and /gʷ/ are distinguishable from /k/ and /g/ before front vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Vittore Pisani, ''Ricerche Linguistiche'' 1 (1950) 165ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Such "incomplete satemisation" may also be evidenced by remnants of labial elements from labiovelars in Balto-Slavic, including Lithuanian  ''ungurys'' "eel" &lt; ''*{{PIE|angʷi-}}'' and ''dygus'' "pointy" &lt; ''*{{PIE|dʰeigʷ-}}''. A few examples are also claimed in Indo-Iranian, such as Sanskrit ''[[guru]]'' "heavy" &lt; ''*{{PIE|gʷer-}}'', ''kulam'' "herd" &lt; ''*{{PIE|kʷel-}}'', but they may instead be secondary developments, as in the case of ''kuru'' "make" &lt; ''*{{PIE|kʷer-}}'' in which it is clear that the ''ku-'' group arose in [[Vedic Sanskrit|post-Rigvedic]] language. It is also asserted that in Sanskrit and Balto-Slavic, in some environments, resonant consonants (denoted by /R/) become /iR/ after plain velars but /uR/ after labiovelars.

In the satem languages, the reflexes of the presumed PIE palatovelars are typically [[fricative]] or [[affricate]] consonants, articulated further forward in the mouth. For example, the [[PIE root]] ''*{{PIE|ḱm̥tóm}}'', "hundred", the initial palatovelar normally became a [[sibilant]] [s] or [ʃ], as in [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''satem'', [[Persian language|Persian]] ''sad'', [[Sanskrit]] ''śatam'', [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''simts'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''šimtas'', [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''sъto''. Another example is the Slavic prefix ''sъ(n)-'' ("with"), which appears in Latin, a centum language, as ''co(n)-''; ''conjoin'' is cognate with Russian ''soyuz'' ("union"). An [s] is found for PIE {{PIE|*ḱ}} in such languages as [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Avestan]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], but [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Sanskrit]] have {{IPAblink|ʃ}} (''š'' in Lithuanian, ''ś'' in Sanskrit transcriptions). For more reflexes, see the [[#Phonetic correspondences in daughter languages|phonetic correspondences]] section below; note also the effect of the [[ruki sound law]].

Assibilation of velars in certain phonetic environments is a common phenomenon in language development (compare, for example, the initial sounds in [[French language|French]] ''cent'' and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''cien'', which are fricatives even though they derive from Latin /k/). Consequently, it is sometimes hard to establish firmly the languages that were part of the original satem diffusion and the ones affected by secondary assibilation later. While extensive documentation of Latin and Old Swedish, for example, shows that the assibilation found in French and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] were later developments, there are not enough records of [[Dacian language|Dacian]] and [[Thracian language|Thracian]] to settle conclusively when their satem-like features originated. Extensive [[lexicon|lexical]] borrowing, such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]] from Iranian, may also add to the difficulty. The status of Armenian as a satem language as opposed to a centum language with secondary [[assibilation]] rests on the evidence of a very few words.

==History of concept==

===Schleicher's single guttural row===
[[August Schleicher]], an early Indo-Europeanist, in Part I, "Phonology", of his major work, the 1871 ''Compendium of Comparative Grammar of the Indogermanic Language'', published a table of original ''momentane Laute'', or "stops", which has only a single velar row, *k, *g, *gʰ, under the name of ''Gutturalen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleicher|1871|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=History of the language sciences: an international handbook on |volume=Volume 2 |editor-first=Sylvain |editor-last=Auroux|first=Theodora|last=Bynon|contribution=The Synthesis of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Studies: August Schleicher|pages=1223–1239}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies four palatals (*ḱ, *ǵ, *ḱʰ, *ǵʰ) but hypothesises that they came from the gutturals along with the nasal *ń and the spirant *ç.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleicher|1871|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brugmann's labialized and unlabialized language groups===
[[Karl Brugmann]], in his 1886 work ''Outline of Comparative Grammar of the Indogermanic Language'' (''[[Grundriss]]...''), promotes the palatals to the original language, recognising two rows of ''Explosivae'', or "stops", the palatal (*ḱ, *ǵ, *ḱʰ, *ǵʰ) and the velar {{nowrap|(*k, *g, *kʰ, *gʰ),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brugmann|1886|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} each of which was [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Stop series|simplified to three articulations]] even in the same work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brugmann|1886|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same work, Brugmann notices among ''die velaren Verschlusslaute'', "the velar stops", a major contrast between [[Reflex (linguistics)|reflexes]] of the same words in different [[daughter language]]s. In some l, the velar is marked with a ''u-Sprache'', "u-articulation", which he terms a ''Labialisierung'', "labialization", in accordance with the prevailing theory that the labiovelars were velars labialised by combination with a ''u'' at some later time and were not among the original consonants. He thus divides languages into ''die Sprachgruppe mit Labialisierung''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brugmann|1886|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''die Sprachgruppe ohne Labialisierung'', "the language group with (or without) labialization", which basically correspond to what would later be termed the centum and satem groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brugmann|1886|p=313}}. The quote given here is a translation by Joseph Wright, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For words and groups of words, which do not appear in any language with labialized velar-sound [the "pure velars"], it must for the present be left undecided whether they ever had the u-afterclap.}}

The doubt introduced in that passage suggests he already suspected the "afterclap" ''u'' was not that but was part of an original sound.

===Von Bradke's centum and satem groups===
In 1890, Peter von Bradke published ''Concerning Method and Conclusions of Aryan (Indogermanic) Studies'', in which he identified the same division (''Trennung'') as did Brugmann, but he defined it in a different way. He said that the original Indo-Europeans had two kinds of ''gutturaler Laute'', "guttural sounds" the ''gutturale oder velare, und die palatale Reihe'', "guttural or velar, and palatal rows", each of which were aspirated and unaspirated. The velars were to be viewed as gutturals in an ''engerer Sinn'', "narrow sense". They were a ''reiner K-Laut'', "pure K-sound". Palatals were ''häufig mit nachfolgender Labialisierung'', "frequently with subsequent labialization". The latter distinction led him to divide the ''palatale Reihe'' into a ''Gruppe als Spirant'' and a ''reiner K-Laut'', typified by the words ''satem'' and ''centum'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Bradke|1890|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the book&lt;ref name=bradke107&gt;{{harvnb|von Bradke|1890|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; he speaks of an original ''centum-Gruppe'', from which on the north of the Black and Caspian Seas the ''satem-Stämmen'', "satem tribes", dissimilated among the ''Nomadenvölker'' or ''Steppenvölker'', distinguished by further palatalization of the palatal gutturals.

===Brugmann's identification of labialized and centum===

By the 1897 edition of ''[[Grundriss]]'', Brugmann (and [[Berthold Delbrück|Delbrück]]) had adopted Von Bradke's view: "The Proto-Indo-European palatals... appear in Greek, Italic, Celtic and Germanic as a rule as K-sounds, as opposed to in Aryan, Armenian, Albanian, Balto-Slavic, [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] and Thracian... for the most part sibilants."&lt;ref&gt;"''Die Palatallaute der idg. Urzeit... erscheinen in Griech, Ital., Kelt., Germ. in der Regel als K-Laute, dagegen im Ar., Arm., Alb., Balt-Slav., denen sich Phrygisch und Thrakisch... meistens als Zischlaute.''"  Brugmann &amp; Delbrück 1897 p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no more mention of labialized and non-labialized language groups after Brugmann changed his mind regarding the labialized velars. The labio-velars now appeared under that name as one of the five rows of ''Verschlusslaute (Explosivae)'' ([[Stop consonant|plosives/stops]]), comprising ''die [[Labial consonant|labialen]] V., die [[dental consonants|dentalen]] V., die [[Palatal consonants|palatalen]] V., die [[velar nasal|reinvelaren]] V.'' and ''die [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelaren]] V.'' It was Brugmann who pointed out that labiovelars had merged into the velars in the satem group,&lt;ref&gt;Brugmann &amp; Delbrück 1897 p. 616. "''...die Vertretung der qʷ-Laute... ist wie die der q-Laute,...''"&lt;/ref&gt; accounting for the coincidence of the discarded non-labialized group with the satem group.

===Discovery of Anatolian and Tocharian===
When von Bradke first published his definition of the centum and satem sound changes, he viewed his classification as "the oldest perceivable division" in Indo-European, which he elucidated as "a division between eastern and western cultural provinces (''Kulturkreise'')".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Bradke|1890|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The proposed split was undermined by the decipherment of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] in the early 20th century. Both languages show no satem-like [[assibilation]] in spite of being located in the satem area.&lt;ref&gt;K Shields, A New Look at the Centum/Satem Isogloss, ''Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] division of Indo-European into satem and centum "sub-families" was further weakened by the identification of other Indo-European [[isogloss]]es running across the centum–satem boundary, some of which seemed of equal or greater importance in the development of daughter languages.&lt;ref name="baldi"&gt;"...an early dialect split of the type indicated by the centum–satem contrast should be expected to be reflected in other high-order dialect distinctions as well, a pattern which is not evident from an analysis of shared features among eastern and western languages."{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&amp;pg=PA39|last=Baldi|first=Philip|title=The Foundations of Latin|year=1999|page=39|location=Berlin|publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|series=Trends in Linguistics: Studies and Monographs 117 | isbn=978-3-11-016294-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, since the early 20th century at least, the centum–satem isogloss has been considered an early [[areal feature|areal phenomenon]] rather than a true phylogenetic division of daughter languages.

==Alternative interpretations==

===Different realisations===
The actual pronunciation of the velar series in PIE is not certain. One current idea is that the "palatovelars" were in fact simple velars {{PIE|*[k], *[ɡ], *[ɡʰ]}}, and the "plain velars" were pronounced farther back, perhaps as [[uvular consonant]]s: {{PIE|*[q], *[ɢ], *[ɢʰ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kümmel, M.J. (2007), ''Konsonantenwandel. Bausteine zu einer Typologie des Lautwandels und ihre Konsequenzen für die vergleichende Rekonstruktion''. Wiesbaden: Reichert. Cited in Prescott, C., ''Pharyngealization and the three dorsal stop series of Proto-Indo-European''.&lt;/ref&gt; If labiovelars were just [[labialization|labialized]] forms of the "plain velars', they would have been pronounced {{PIE|*[qʷ], *[ɢʷ], *[ɢʷʰ]}}. The following are arguments in support of that view:{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

*The "palatovelar" series was the most common, and the "plain velar" was by far the least common and never occurred in any [[affix]]es. In known languages with multiple velar series, the normal velar series is usually the most common, which would imply that what have been interpreted as "palatovelars" were more probably simply velars.
*There is no evidence of any [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalisation]] in the early history of the velars in the centum branches, but see above for the case of Anatolian. If the "palatovelars" were in fact palatalised in PIE, there would have had to be a single, very early, uniform depalatalisation in all (and only) the centum branches. Depalatalisation is cross-linguistically far less common than is palatalisation and so is unlikely to have occurred separately in each centum branch. In any case it would almost certainly have left evidence of prior palatalization in some of the branches. (As noted above, it is not thought that the centum branches had a separate common ancestor in which the depalatalization could have occurred just once and then have been inherited.)

On the above interpretation, the split between the centum and satem groups would not have been a straightforward loss of an articulatory feature (palatalization or labialization). Instead, the uvulars {{IPA|*q, *ɢ, *ɢʰ}} (the "plain velars" of the traditional reconstruction) would have been fronted to velars across all branches. In the satem languages, it caused a [[chain shift]], and the existing velars (traditionally "palatovelars") were shifted further forward to avoid a merger, becoming palatal: {{IPA|/k/}} &gt; {{IPA|/c/}}; {{IPA|/q/}} &gt; {{IPA|/k/}}. In the centum languages, no chain shift occurred, and the uvulars merged into the velars. The delabialisation in the satem languages would have occurred later, in a separate stage.

===Only two velar series===
The presence of three dorsal rows in the proto-language has been the mainstream hypothesis since at least the mid 20th century. There remain, however, several alternative proposals with just two rows in the parent language, which describe either "satemisation" or "centumisation", as the emergence of a new phonematic category rather than the disappearance of an inherited one.

[[Antoine Meillet]] (1937) proposed that the original rows were the labiovelars and palatovelars, with the plain velars being [[allophone]]s of the palatovelars in some cases, such as depalatalisation before a resonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymologies establishing the presence of velars in the parent language are explained as artefacts of either borrowing between daughter languages or of false etymologies.

Other scholars who assume two dorsal rows in Proto-Indo-European include [[Jerzy Kuryłowicz|Kuryłowicz]] (1935) and [[Winfred P. Lehmann|Lehmann]] (1952), as well as [[Frederik Kortlandt]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Szemerényi (1995), Sihler (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is that PIE had only two series, a simple velar and a labiovelar. The satem languages palatalized the plain velar series in most positions, but the plain velars remained in some environments: typically reconstructed as before or after /u/, after /s/, and before /r/ or /a/ and also before /m/ and /n/ in some Baltic dialects. The original allophonic distinction was disturbed when the labiovelars were merged with the plain velars. That produced a new phonemic distinction between palatal and plain velars, with an unpredictable alternation between palatal and plain in related forms of some roots (those from original plain velars) but not others (those from original labiovelars). Subsequent analogical processes generalised either the plain or palatal consonant in all forms of a particular root. The roots in which the plain consonant was generalized are those traditionally reconstructed as having "plain velars" in the parent language in contrast to "palatovelars".

[[Oswald Szemerényi]] (1990) considers the palatovelars as an innovation, proposing that the "preconsonantal palatals probably owe their origin, at least in part, to a lost palatal vowel" and a velar was palatalised by a following vowel subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1990|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palatal row would therefore postdate the original velar and labiovelar rows, but Szemerényi is not clear whether that would have happened before or after the breakup of the parent-language (in a table showing the system of stops "shortly before the break-up", he includes palatovelars with a question mark after them).

Woodhouse (1998; 2005) introduced a "bitectal" notation, labelling the two rows of dorsals as ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;''. The first row represents "prevelars", which developed into either palatovelars or plain velars in the satem group but just into plain velars into the centum group; the second row represents "backvelars", which developed into either labiovelars or plain velars in the centum group but just plain velars in the satem group.&lt;ref&gt;R. Woodhouse, ''Indogermanische Forschungen'' (2010), 127–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are arguments that have been listed in support of a two-series hypothesis:{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*The plain velar series is statistically rarer than the other two, is almost entirely absent from affixes and appears most often in certain phonological environments (described in the next point).
*The reconstructed velars and palatovelars occur mostly in complementary distribution (velars before *a, *r and after *s, *u; palatovelars before *e, *i, *j, liquid/nasal/*w+*e/*i and before o in o-grade forms by generalization from e-grade).
*It is unusual in general for palatovelars to move backwards rather than the reverse (but that problem might simply be addressed by assuming three series with different realizations from the traditional ones, as described [[#Different realizations|above]]).
*In most languages in which the "palatovelars" produced fricatives, other palatalisation also occurred, implying that it was part of a general trend;
*The centum languages are not contiguous, and there is no evidence of differences between dialects in the implementation of centumization (but there are differences in the process of satemisation: there can be pairs of satemized and non-satemized velars within the same language, there is evidence of a former labiovelar series in some satem languages and different branches have different numbers and timings of satemization stages). This makes a "centumisation" process less likely, implying that the position found in the centum languages was the original one.
*Alternations between plain velars and palatals are common in a number of roots across different satem languages, but the same root appears with a palatal in some languages but a plain velar in others (most commonly Baltic or Slavic, occasionally Armenian but rarely or never the Indo-Iranian languages). That is consistent with the analogical generalisation of one or another consonant in an originally-alternating paradigm but difficult to explain otherwise.
*The claim that in late PIE times, the satem languages (unlike the centum languages) were in close contact with each other is confirmed by independent evidence: the geographical closeness of current satem languages and certain other shared innovations (the [[ruki sound law]] and early palatalization of velars before front vowels).

Arguments in support of three series:
*Many instances of plain velars occur in roots that have no evidence of any of the putative environments that trigger plain velars and no obvious mechanism for the plain velar to have come in contact with any such environment; as a result, the [[comparative method]] requires three series to be reconstructed.
*Albanian and Armenian are said to retain three series (that is disputed, and it is pointed out that this does not falsify an original two-series hypothesis, as they may have been satem languages in which the labiovelars failed to merge);
*Evidence from the Anatolian language [[Luwian language|Luwian]] attests a three-way velar distinction {{PIE|*ḱ}} &gt; ''z'' (probably {{IPA|[ts]}}); {{PIE|*k}} &gt; ''k''; {{PIE|*kʷ}} &gt; ''ku'' (probably {{IPA|[kʷ]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Melchert/gscowgill.pdf |author=Craig Melchert|author-link=Craig Melchert |accessdate=2008-10-27 |work= Studies in Memory of [[Warren Cowgill]] |title=PIE velars in Luvian |year=1987 |pages=182–204.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no evidence of any connection between Luwian and any satem language (labiovelars are still preserved, the [[ruki sound law]] is absent) and the Anatolian branch split off very early from PIE. The three-way distinction must be reconstructed for the parent language. (That is a strong argument in favor of the traditional three-way system; in response, proponents of the two-way system have attacked the underlying evidence by claiming that it "hinges upon especially difficult or vague or otherwise dubious etymologies" (such as Sihler 1995).) Melchert originally claimed that the change {{PIE|*ḱ}} &gt; ''z'' was unconditional and subsequently revised the assertion to a conditional change occurring only before front vowels, /j/, or /w/; however, that does not fundamentally alter the situation, as plain-velar {{PIE|*k}} apparently remains as such in the same context.  Melchert also asserts, contrary to Sihler, the etymological distinction between {{PIE|*ḱ}} and {{PIE|*k}} in the relevant positions is well-established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Melchert/The%20Position%20of%20Anatolian.pdf |author=Craig Melchert |author-link=Craig Melchert |accessdate=2010-06-29 |work=Handbook of Indo-European Studies |title=The Position of Anatolian |year=2013 |pages=18–22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709201329/http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Melchert/The%20Position%20of%20Anatolian.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Ringe (2006), there are root constraints that prevent the occurrence of a "palatovelar" and labiovelar or two "plain velars", in the same root, but they do not apply to roots containing, for example, a palatovelar and a plain velar.
*The centum change could have occurred independently in multiple centum subgroups (at the very least, Tocharian, Anatolian and Western IE), as it was a phonologically natural change, given the possible interpretation of the "palatovelar" series as plain-velar and the "plain velar" series as back-velar or uvular (see [[#Different realizations|above]]). Given the minimal functional load of the plain-velar/palatovelar distinction, if there was never any palatalisation in the IE dialects leading to the centum languages, there is no reason to expect any palatal residues. Furthermore, it is phonologically entirely natural for a former plain-velar vs. back-velar/uvular distinction to have left no distinctive residues on adjacent segments.

In P-Celtic, Osco-Umbrian, and Aeolian Greek, *kw &gt; /p/. That may be due to contact, perhaps in the Balkan region in the second millennium BC. The same /p/ also occurs in Hittite in a few pronominal forms (''pippid'' 'something, someone', compare Latin ''quisquid'').

'''Christmas''' ({{lang-sv|jul}}, {{IPA-sv|jʉːl|}}) is celebrated throughout December and traditionally until [[St. Knut's Day]] on January 13. The main celebration and the exchange of gifts in many families takes place on [[Christmas Eve]], December 24. The [[Saint Lucy's Day|Lucia Day]] is celebrated during [[Advent]], on December 13.&lt;ref name="LuciaChristmas"&gt;[http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Traditions/Reading/Lucia-and-Christmas/ Sweden.se: ''Lucia and Christmas''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217031653/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Traditions/Reading/Lucia-and-Christmas/ |date=2012-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas contains a mix of domestic and foreign customs that have been adapted. Many Swedes celebrate [[Christmas]] in roughly the same way, and many local customs and specialities have disappeared.

== History ==
The origin of the Germanic word "Jul" is somewhat unclear. Around the year 600, it is mentioned in the Gothic calendar together with Christian religious texts. Around the year 900, the word "Jul" can be found in a tribute to king [[Harald Fairhair]], in which someone is said to "Dricka Jul" (Drink Jul).&lt;ref name="EtymologyJul"&gt;[http://www.firajul.nu/julenstraditioner/ordet-jul ''Firajul.nu: Ordet "Jul"'']&lt;/ref&gt; The pretext for the ''Jul'' celebration was to mark the [[winter solstice]] when the days start to get longer and the nights shorter again.

In Nordic prehistoric times there was a "midvinterblot" rite ([[mid-winter]] [[blót]]), which was a sacrificial rite held in mid-winter, which may either mean the same time as ''Jul'' (in later sources called ''julablot''), or in mid-January which was in the middle of the winter period. The people sacrificed cattle and perhaps humans to win the [[Æsir]]'s blessing on the germinating crop. The ''ás'' (singular of Æsir) who was especially hailed at this time was [[Odin]], who commonly went by the name of "Jólner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Näsström|first1=Britt-Marie|title=Blot: Tro och offer i det förkristna Norden|publisher=Norstedts|pages=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Jul'' was [[Christianized]], while the ''blót'' rites were forbidden and abandoned when Sweden became a Christian country.

The celebration of Christmas at the end of December is a very old tradition with many origins. Among these is the Old Norse Christmas celebration - which was prevailing in Scandinavia in the 11th century - and was celebrated in connection with the midwinter offering celebration. Moreover, there is the Christian Christmas celebration in memory of the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. The earliest records of these celebrations are from year 333{{where|date=December 2014}}. Eight hundred years later this is merged with the Old Norse Christmas celebration.

In the Old Norse sources the pagan celebration of Jul in the Nordic countries is often described as "to drink jul/yule". The central aspect of the pagan [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] celebration of midwinter was to eat and drink well. To bake and to produce ale and mead were important preparations for the celebration. In medieval wooden calendars and pre-Christian picture stones, this celebration is still symbolised by a barrel of ale, or a drinking horn. So the emphasis on food and drink traditions was originally a pagan trait of the Christmas celebration.&lt;ref name="JulFoodHistory"&gt;[http://www.bandoli.no/christmas.htm ''Bandoli.no: Where is the Christ in Christmas?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christmas tree is a custom that was imported from Germany in the 1880s. The foremer tradition of giving joke presents, often a log of wood, was replaced during the late-19th century and 20th century by Christmas gifts given out by the [[Christmas goat]] (''Julbocken'') or, especially later, [[Santa Claus]] (''Jultomten''). &lt;ref name="Christmas"&gt;[http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Traditions/Celebrating-the-Swedish-way/Christmas/ Sweden.se: ''Christmas'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions ==
===The month of December===
The [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas celebrations]] in Sweden usually starts with the first Advent in the end of November. However Christmas decorations and ''julmust'' might go on sale in stores much earlier, often directly after [[All Saints Day]]. At this time many people start to plan their Christmas and start buying gifts. The 13th of December is Lucia where most of the children and also some adults dress up and have processions in preschool, school and companies. The third and fourth Advent is important for many families as many preparations are done then. Baking and cooking are common activities, just like decorating the home. A big shopping of food and drink is often done the weeks before the holidays as well as the last purchases of Christmas gifts.

Many preschools and schools start their Christmas vacation between December 17 to 22. Many workplaces start the vacation later, between December 20 and 23. The start of the vacation depends on what day of the week Christmas Eve is on. The last days before Christmas Eve, between December 20 and 23, the greatest preparations are made like, preparing most of the food, buying and decorating the Christmas tree and wrapping presents. During the last days there are usually a lot of people in stores and shopping malls to buy things for the Christmas celebrations.

After Christmas Eve there are two [[public holiday]]s: ''juldagen'' (Christmas Day) and ''annandag jul'' (Boxing Day). Most of the families have holiday and are free from work, but some workplaces can start the work again in the days before New Year's Eve. After the New Year's Eve the schools usually have at least a week before the spring term starts, but workplaces often start the work again a couple of days after the new year.

=== Christmas tree ===
[[File:Falu gruva 2014-12-06.jpg|thumb|A Swedish Christmas tree, outdoors.]]
[[File:Julgran, Sverige, 2017.jpg|thumb|A Swedish Christmas tree, indoors, and a [[Yule Goat|Yule goat]].]]
The story of the Christmas tree begins in Germany in the 16th century. During the 17th and 18th centuries the Christmas tree started being dressed with candles. The first Swedish Christmas trees were generally decorated with live candles and treats such as fruit and candy. Apples were often hung on the branches where the candles were located to make them more parallel to the ground{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It soon became more common for families to make their own decorations with paper and straw. Some families preferred to build a ''[[Ljuskrona]]'' decorated with cut paper. From around 1880, commercial Christmas tree decorations were readily available in larger Swedish cities, the finest of which were imported from Germany. The day that people in Sweden buy and dress their Christmas tree varies greatly from family to family, but most have them dressed on 13 December and throw them out by 13 January. Commonly used decorations today include: baubles, candles, apples, Swedish flags, small gnomes, tasseled caps, and straw ornaments. The house may be filled with red tulips and the smell of ''pepparkakor'' - a heart-star, or goat-shaped gingerbread biscuits.&lt;ref name="OrnamentsHistory"&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm ''Sweden - Christmas traditions &amp; customs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Knut's Day]] (13 January) marks the end of the Swedish [[Christmas and holiday season]]. Children, especially, may celebrate it with a [[Knut's party]].&lt;ref name=rocking&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlivingcity.com/stockholm/cultural/events/julgransplundring/|title=Julgransplundring: Rocking around the Christmas Tree|publisher=Your Living City|language=|date=3 January 2014|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jultomten ===
''Jultomten'', or just ''tomten'', is the being who brings the gifts at ''Julafton'' (the evening of December 24). The gifts are called ''julklappar'', and are probably a modern version of the [[Yule log]]. ''Jultomten'' does not climb down the chimney, he delivers the gifts in person. This task is often performed by an old man who secretly dresses up as ''Jultomten'' and knocks at the door with a sack of gifts.

The origin of the modern ''Jultomte'' is a hybridisation between the pre-Christian being called ''[[Tomte]]'' and the (originally Dutch) [[Santa Claus]]. A ''Tomte'' is mostly portrayed as a small, gnomelike spirit being who lives on a farm and takes care of it (or the family) while the farmer family are asleep. He might be a gift giver if the farmers treat him and the livestock correctly. The ''tomte'' is an echo of ancient [[ancestor worship|ancestral cult]]. It is thought that the ''tomte'' was considered a spirit of previous generations at the homestead, and there are references to them following the family/clan, when they move. Despite its different cultural roots, the ''Jultomte'' (''Tomte'' of ''Jul'') is today portrayed similarly to the commonly known image of Santa Claus.

=== Food and drink === 
[[File:Julmaten 2017.jpg|thumb|Christmas food, with Christmas ham, Janssons frestelse, meatballs, prinskorv, red cabbage.]]
[[File:Dopp i grytan.jpg|thumb|Dopp i grytan]]
The foods served in Sweden during Christmastime differ per region. But here, too, homogenisation has set in, due in no small part to the uniform offerings of the department stores and the ready availability of convenience foods. Few have time to salt their own hams or stuff their own pork sausages nowadays.

Traditional foods include a [[julbord]] which has been prepared with all the classic dishes: Christmas ham, pork sausage, an egg and anchovy mixture (gubbröra), herring salad, pickled herring, home-made liver pâté, wort-flavoured rye bread (vörtbröd), potatoes and a special fish dish, [[lutefisk|lutfisk]]. The seasonal soft drink ''[[julmust]]'' is also served at the julbord, as well as during the whole Christmas holiday.

A traditional ''julbord'' is typically eaten in three courses. The dishes include local and family specialties. The first course would typically be a variety of fish, particularly pickled herring and lox ([[gravlax]]). It is customary to eat particular foods together; herring is typically eaten with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs and is frequently accompanied by strong spirits like [[snaps]], [[brännvin]] or [[akvavit]] with or without spices.

Other traditional dishes would be (smoked) eel, [[rollmops]], herring salad, baked herring, smoked salmon and crab [[canapé]]s, accompanied by sauces and dips.

The second course is often a selection of cold sliced meats, the most important cold cut being the [[Christmas ham]] (''julskinka'') with mustard. Other traditional cuts include homemade sausages, [[leverpastej]] and several types of [[brawn]]. It is also common to serve the cold meats with sliced [[cheese]], pickled [[cucumbers]] and soft and [[crisp bread]]s.

The third course would be warm dishes. Traditionally, the third course begins with  soaking bread in the [[stock (food)|stock]] from the Christmas ham, which is called ''dopp i grytan''. Warm dishes include Swedish [[meatball]]s (''köttbullar''), small fried hot dog sausages (''[[prinskorv]]''), roasted [[pork ribs]] (''[[revbensspjäll]]''), and warm potato casserole, matchstick potatoes layered with cream, onion and [[sprats]] called ''[[Janssons frestelse]]'' (literally "Jansson's Temptation").

Other dishes are pork sausages (''[[fläskkorv]]''), smoked pork and potato sausages (''[[isterband]]''), [[cabbage rolls]] (''[[kåldolmar]]''), [[baked beans]], [[omelette]] with shrimps or mushrooms covered with béchamel sauce. Side dishes include [[beetroot]] salad in mayonnaise and warm stewed red, green or brown [[cabbage]].

[[Lutfisk]], lyed fish made of stockfish (dried [[common ling|ling]] or [[cod]]) served with boiled potato, thick [[white sauce]] and green peas can be served with the warm dishes or as a separate fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include [[rice pudding]] (''risgrynsgröt''), sprinkled with [[cinnamon]] powder. Traditionally, an [[almond]] is hidden in the bowl of rice pudding and whoever finds it receives a small prize or is recognised for having good luck. Julbord is served from early December until just before Christmas at restaurants and until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in some homes.

The ham is either boiled, or broiled and then painted and glazed with a mixture of egg, breadcrumbs and mustard. [[Beer]] and the occasional [[snaps]] are common beverages to this Christmas meal. Mulled wine [[Mulled wine#Nordic glögg|''glögg'']], [[ginger nut]]s and [[saffron bun]]s are served throughout December.

Many Swedes visit the service on [[Advent Sunday]], the [[Midnight Mass]] on December 24 or the early morning Christmas Day service (''[[Julotta]]'').

'''Comparative linguistics''' (originally '''comparative [[philology]]''') is a branch of [[historical linguistics]] that is concerned with comparing languages to establish their [[history|historical]] relatedness.

[[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|Genetic relatedness]] implies a common origin or [[proto-language]] and comparative linguistics aims to construct [[language family|language families]], to reconstruct proto-languages and specify the changes that have resulted in the documented languages. To maintain a clear distinction between attested and reconstructed forms, comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts. A number of methods for carrying out language classification have been developed, ranging from simple inspection to computerised hypothesis testing. Such methods have gone through a long process of development.

==Methods==
The fundamental technique of comparative linguistics is to compare phonological systems, morphological systems, syntax and the lexicon of two or more languages using techniques such as the [[comparative method]]. In principle, every difference between two related languages should be explicable to a high degree of plausibility and systematic changes, for example in phonological or morphological systems are expected to be highly regular (i.e. consistent). In practice, the comparison may be more restricted, e.g. just to the lexicon. In some methods it may be possible to reconstruct an earlier proto-language. Although the proto-languages reconstructed by the comparative method are hypothetical, a reconstruction may have predictive power. The most notable example of this is [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'s proposal that the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[consonant]] system contained [[laryngeals]], a type of consonant attested in no Indo-European language known at the time. The hypothesis was vindicated with the discovery of [[Hittite language|Hittite]], which proved to have exactly the consonants Saussure had hypothesized in the environments he had predicted.

Where languages are derived from a very distant ancestor, and are thus more distantly related, the comparative method becomes impracticable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ringe |first=D. A. |year=1995 |title='Nostratic' and the factor of chance |journal=Diachronica |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=55–74 |doi=10.1075/dia.12.1.04rin }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, attempting to relate two reconstructed proto-languages by the comparative method has not generally produced results that have met with wide acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The method has also not been very good at unambiguously identifying sub-families and different scholars{{Who|date=April 2011}} have produced conflicting results, for example in Indo-European.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} A number of methods based on statistical analysis of vocabulary have been developed to try and overcome this limitation, such as [[lexicostatistics]] and [[mass comparison]]. The former uses lexical [[cognates]] like the comparative method but the latter uses only [[lexical similarity]]. The theoretical basis of such methods is that vocabulary items can be matched without a detailed language reconstruction and that comparing enough vocabulary items will negate individual inaccuracies.  Thus they can be used to determine relatedness but not to determine the proto-language.

==History==
The earliest method of this type was the comparative method, which was developed over many years, culminating in the nineteenth century.  This uses a long word list and detailed study.  However, it has been criticized for example as being subjective, being informal, and lacking testability.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Language Classification by Numbers'' by April McMahon and Robert McMahon&lt;/ref&gt; The comparative method uses information from two or more languages and allows reconstruction of the ancestral language. The method of [[Internal reconstruction]] uses only a single language, with comparison of word variants, to perform the same function. Internal reconstruction is more resistant to interference but usually has a limited available base of utilizable words and is able to reconstruct only certain changes (those that have left traces as morphophonological variations).

In the twentieth century an alternative method, [[lexicostatistics]], was developed, which is mainly associated with [[Morris Swadesh]] but is based on earlier work.  This uses a short word list of basic vocabulary in the various languages for comparisons.  Swadesh used 100 (earlier 200) items that are assumed to be cognate (on the basis of phonetic similarity) in the languages being compared, though other lists have also been used. Distance measures are derived by examination of language pairs but such methods reduce the information. An outgrowth of lexicostatistics is [[glottochronology]], initially developed in the 1950s, which proposed a mathematical formula for establishing the date when two languages separated, based on percentage of a core vocabulary of culturally independent words. In its simplest form a constant rate of change is assumed, though later versions allow variance but still fail to achieve reliability. Glottochronology has met with mounting scepticism, and is seldom applied today. Dating estimates can now be generated by computerised methods that have fewer restrictions, calculating rates from the data. However, no mathematical means of producing proto-language split-times on the basis of lexical retention has been proven reliable.

Another controversial method, developed by [[Joseph Greenberg]], is [[mass comparison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyle Campbell|Campbell, Lyle]] (2004). ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction'' (2nd ed.). Cambridge: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; The method, which disavows any ability to date developments, aims simply to show which languages are more and less close to each other. Greenberg suggested that the method is useful for preliminary grouping of languages known to be related as a first step toward more in-depth comparative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, J. H. (2001). "The methods and purposes of linguistic genetic classification". ''Language and Linguistics'' 2: 111–135.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since mass comparison eschews the establishment of regular changes, it is flatly rejected by the majority of historical linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Ringe, Don. (1993). "A reply to Professor Greenberg". ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 137, 1:91–109. {{doi|10.1007/s101209900033}}. {{JSTOR|986947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, computerised statistical hypothesis testing methods have been developed which are related to both the [[comparative method]] and [[lexicostatistics]]. Character based methods are similar to the former and distanced based methods are similar to the latter (see [[Quantitative comparative linguistics]]). The characters used can be morphological or grammatical as well as lexical.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Greenhill, S. J., Q. D. Atkinson, A. Meade, and R. D. Gray. (2010). "[http://simon.net.nz/files/2010/04/Greenhill_et_al2010-preprint.pdf The shape and tempo of language evolution]". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'' 277, no. 1693: 2443–50. {{doi|10.1098/rspb.2010.0051}}. {{JSTOR|25706475}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s these more sophisticated tree- and network-based [[phylogenetic]] methods have been used to investigate the relationships between languages and to determine approximate dates for proto-languages.  These are considered by many to show promise but are not wholly accepted by traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the criticisms of Gray and Atkinson's work in {{cite web |last=Poser |first=Bill |title=Dating Indo-European |website=Language Log |date=10 December 2003 |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000208.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not intended to replace older methods but to supplement them.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhill, S. J., and R. D. Gray. 2009. "[http://simon.net.nz/files/2009/09/Greenhill_and_Gray2009.pdf Austronesian language phylogenies: Myths and misconceptions about Bayesian computational methods]". In ''Austronesian historical linguistics and culture history: a festschrift for Robert Blust'', ed. K. A. Adelaar and A. Pawley, 375–397. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Such statistical methods cannot be used to derive the features of a proto-language, apart from the fact of the existence of shared items of the compared vocabulary. These approaches have been challenged for their methodological problems, since without a reconstruction or at least a detailed list of phonological correspondences there can be no demonstration that two words in different languages are cognate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Related fields==
There are other branches of linguistics that involve comparing languages, which are not, however, part of ''comparative linguistics'':
* [[Linguistic typology]] compares languages to classify them by their features. Its ultimate aim is to understand the [[linguistic universal|universal]]s that govern language, and the range of types found in the world's languages in respect of any particular feature (word order or vowel system, for example). Typological similarity does not imply a historical relationship. However, typological arguments can be used in comparative linguistics: one reconstruction may be preferred to another as typologically more plausible.
* [[Contact linguistics]] examines the linguistic results of contact between the speakers of different languages, particularly as evidenced in [[loan words]]. An empirical study of loans is by definition historical in focus and therefore forms part of the subject matter of historical linguistics. One of the goals of [[etymology]] is to establish which items in a language's vocabulary result from linguistic contact. This is also an important issue both for the comparative method and for the lexical comparison methods, since failure to recognize a loan may distort the findings.
* [[Contrastive analysis|Contrastive linguistics]] compares languages usually with the aim of assisting [[language learning]] by identifying important differences between the learner's native and target languages. Contrastive linguistics deals solely with present-day languages.

==Pseudolinguistic comparisons==
{{Main|Pseudoscientific language comparison}}
Comparative linguistics includes the study of the historical relationships of languages using the comparative method to search for regular (i.e. recurring) correspondences between the languages' phonology, grammar and core vocabulary, and through hypothesis testing{{Clarify|date=July 2012|reason=which ones?}}; some persons with little or no specialization in the field sometimes attempt to establish historical associations between languages by noting similarities between them, in a way that is considered [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] by specialists (e.g. African/Egyptian comparisons&lt;ref&gt;Russell G. Schuh (1997) "The Use and Misuse of language in the study of African history", ''Ufahamu'' 25(1):36–81&lt;/ref&gt;).

The most common method applied in pseudoscientific language comparisons is to search two or more languages for words that seem similar in their sound and meaning. While similarities of this kind often seem convincing to laypersons, linguistic scientists consider this kind of comparison to be unreliable for two primary reasons. First, the method applied is not well-defined: the criterion of similarity is subjective and thus not subject to [[falsifiability|verification or falsification]], which is contrary to the principles of the scientific method. Second, the large size of all languages' vocabulary and a relatively limited inventory of articulated sounds used by most languages makes it easy to find coincidentally similar words between languages.

There are sometimes political or religious reasons for associating languages in ways that some linguists would dispute. For example, it has been suggested that the [[Turanian#Linguistics|Turanian]] or [[Ural–Altaic languages|Ural–Altaic language]] group, which relates [[Sami languages|Sami]] and other languages to the [[Mongolian language]], was used to justify [[racism]] towards the Sami in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} [http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-nwa/rasII.html Niclas Wahlgren. ''Något om rastänkandet i Sverige.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615133919/http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-nwa/rasII.html |date=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also strong, albeit [[areal feature|areal]] not [[language family|genetic]], similarities between the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Altaic]] languages which provided an innocent basis for this theory. In 1930s [[Turkey]], some promoted the [[Sun Language Theory]], one that showed that [[Turkic languages]] were close to the original language. Some believers in [[Abrahamic religions]] try to derive their native languages from [[Classical Hebrew]], as [[Herbert W. Armstrong]], a proponent of [[British Israelism]], who said that the word "British" comes from Hebrew ''brit'' meaning "[[wikt:covenant|covenant]]" and ''ish'' meaning "man", supposedly proving that the British people are the 'covenant people' of God. And [[Lithuania]]n-American [[archaeologist]] [[Marija Gimbutas]] argued during the mid-1900s that Basque is clearly related to the extinct [[Pictish language|Pictish]] and Etruscan languages, in attempt to show that Basque was a remnant of an "[[Old European culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Gimbutas, Marija, ''The Living Goddesses'' pp. 122 and 171–175 {{ISBN|0-520-22915-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Dissertatio de origine gentium Americanarum'' (1625), the Dutch lawyer [[Hugo Grotius]] "proves" that the American Indians ([[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]]s) speak a language (''lingua Maquaasiorum'') derived from Scandinavian languages (Grotius was on Sweden's payroll), supporting Swedish colonial pretensions in America. 
The Dutch doctor [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]], in his ''Origines Antverpiana'' (1580) admits ''Quis est enim qui non amet patrium sermonem'' ("Who does not love his fathers' language?"), whilst asserting that Hebrew is derived from Dutch. The Frenchman [[Éloi Johanneau]] claimed in 1818 (''Mélanges d'origines étymologiques et de questions grammaticales'') that the Celtic language is the oldest, and the mother of all others. 

In 1759, Joseph de Guignes theorized (''Mémoire dans lequel on prouve que les Chinois sont une colonie égyptienne'') that the Chinese and Egyptians were related, the former being a colony of the latter. In 1885, [[Edward Tregear]] (''The Aryan Maori'') compared the Maori and "Aryan" languages. {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Prat (linguist)|fr|3=Jean Prat (linguiste)|lt=Jean Prat}}, in his 1941 ''Les langues nitales'', claimed that the Bantu languages of Africa are descended from Latin, coining the French linguistic term ''nitale'' in doing so. But the Bantu language is also claimed to be related to Ancient Egyptian by {{Interlanguage link multi|Mubabinge Bilolo|fr}}. Ancient Egyptian is, according to [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], related to the [[Wolof language]]. And, according to [[Gilbert Ngom]], Ancient Egyptian is similar to the [[Duala language]]. Just as Egyptian is related to Brabantic, following [[Johannes Goropius Becanus|Becanus]] in his ''Hieroglyphica'', still using Comparative methods.

The first practicians of Comparative linguistics were not universally acclaimed: upon reading Becanus' book, [[Scaliger]] wrote ''never did I read greater nonsense'', and [[Leibnitz]] coined the term ''goropism'' (from Goropius) to designate a far-sought, ridiculous etymology.

There have also been claims that humans are descended from other, non-primate animals, with use of the voice referred to as the main point of comparison.  [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]] (''La Grande Nouvelle'', around 1900) believed and asserted that humans descended from the frog, by linguistic means, due to frogs' croaking sounding similar to the French language. He held that the French word ''logement'', "dwelling", derived from the word ''l'eau'', "water".

{{Jordan Series}}
The culture of [[Jordan]] is based in Arabic and Islamic elements with significant Western influence. Jordan stands at the intersection of the three continents of the ancient world, lending it geographic and population diversity. Notable aspects of the culture include traditional music and clothing of Jordan, as well as an interest in sports. These include football and basketball as well as other imported sports, mainly from western Europe and the United States.

==Popular culture==
More than 60% of the population lives in the metropolis of [[Amman]], concentrating the culture of Jordan in that city. Jordanian pop culture is heavily influenced by the "West". European and American music, movies, fashion and other forms of entertainment are popular among Jordan's people. Clubbing and partying culture are present in Amman, especially in the Western half of the city.  A small minority of youth, mostly the rich in West Amman, exhibit counter-culture traits like face piercings and tattoos.  Amman is consistently declared one of the most westernised and modern cities in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/amman.htm|title=Jordan Jubilee - Visit Jordan|author=|date=|website=www.jordanjubilee.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malls, Western-brand stores, and hotels are important elements in Amman's urban life, especially in the Western side. [[English language|English]] is widely understood and even spoken in lieu of [[Jordanian Levantine]] among Jordanians in the upper class. [[Westernization]] is occurring due to the heavy Western, especially British and American, influence on the nation's political life and foreign affairs. In addition, many people from western Europe and America have been moving to Amman and calling it their new home in the past few years. This increased trade links with the West and has reshaped the culture. Cuisine is shared with surrounding nations, especially [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]].

===Media===
Nonprint media has played the most important role in Jordanian culture. Television production in particular has thrived due to high quality acting and creative, interesting story lines that challenge and critique contemporary Arab society. Print media too, however, continues to play a large role in Jordanian culture; newspapers include ''[[Ad-Dustour (Jordan)|ad-Dustour]]'' ("The Constitution") and ''[[Al Ra'i (Jordanian newspaper)|Al Ra'i]]'' ("The Opinion"), the most widely read of the Arabic language newspapers. Additionally, the country has one daily English newspaper, ''[[The Jordan Times]]'', and one weekly English newspaper, ''[[The Star (Amman newspaper)|The Star]]''. (See [[List of newspapers in Jordan]].)

===Music===
{{main|Music of Jordan}}
The traditional music of Jordan has a long history. Rural [[Zajal]] songs, with improvised poetry played with a [[Mijwiz]], [[Tablah]], [[Arghul]], [[Oud]], [[Rabab]] [[reed pipe]] and [[ADdaf]] ensemble accompanying is popular. Recently Jordan has seen the rise of several prominent DJs and popstars.

===Cinema===
{{main|Cinema of Jordan}}
Jordan does not have a film industry. The only Jordanian film is ''[[Captain Abu Raed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1017428/|title=Captain Abu Raed|author=|date=6 February 2008|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this is the only Jordanian film made in Jordan,  multiple Hollywood films have been filmed on location in Jordan, such as ''[[Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, John A. Culture and Customs of Jordan. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Oscar winner for Best Picture, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was also filmed in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/|title=The Hurt Locker|author=|date=31 July 2009|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much more recently, [[The Martian (film)|The Martian]] was filmed in [[Wadi Rum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/|title=The Martian|author=|date=2 October 2015|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and Musalsalat===
{{see also|Arab television drama}}
The term "musalsalat" may be loosely translated as Arabic soap operas. Jordan produces a number of "Bedouin soap operas" that are filmed outdoors with authentic props. The actors use Bedouin-accented Arabic to make the story feel more authentic, but have incorporated aspects of the accent of Bedouins of the Persian Gulf region in order to make the dialect more widely understood. These musalsalat have become popular in Saudi Arabia, Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and Iraq. 

Some musalsalat center around traditional village life during the time period just before World War II.  Often, these dramas are permeated by themes of tension between the traditional and modern ways of life with specific emphasis on the patriarchal systems and the role of women within them. 

Another musalsal genre is that of the historical drama. Topics of these shows range from pre-Islamic poets to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Many of these are joint productions by Jordanian, Syrian, and Gulf television producers. 

While the aforementioned musalsalat target a broader, Arabic-speaking audience, certain programs target Jordanians specifically.  These shows tend to deal with social and political issues particular to current-day Amman. Acting in these programs, as well as Jordanian musalsalat in general, is often lauded as being superior to that of many Egyptian-produced soap operas.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, John A. "Literature and Media." Culture and Customs of Jordan. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2006. 45-54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance===
One of the most popular traditional dances in Jordan is [[dabke]]. This may be performed as gender-segregated or co-ed groups. The dancers line up shoulder-to-shoulder, holding hands or placing arms over the neighboring two dancers’ shoulders, then move as a group in a circle using steps that are punctuated by kicks and stomps. The accompanying music includes a flute called a [[ney]], a drum called a [[Davul|tabl]], and a reed instrument called a [[mizmar (instrument)|mizmar]]. This group dance is popular among Bedouins and non-Bedouins alike, and is often performed at weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, John A. "Music and Dance." Culture and Customs of Jordan. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2006. 109-116. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan has also been effected by an influx of Western dance styles within the Western cultural impact of the last century. These include several ballroom and ballet dance studios in Amman, as well as a regionally recognized and royally supported contemporary dance troupe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pac.org.jo/ncca/index.php/en/dep-6/536-misk-dance-troupe ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Archaeology==
Archaeological study of Jordan began in the 19th century with the discovery of [[Petra]] by [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]]. Most archaeological attention in the 19th century, however, was focused on Palestine, since foreign archaeologists tended to be preoccupied with the proliferation of Biblical sites located there. The Department of Antiquities in Amman was established in 1923, and since then, there have been excavations in Amman, [[Pella]], [[Gadara]] in [[Um Qais]], [[Petra]], [[Jerash]], [[Kerak]], and Aljun. [[Neolithic]] statuettes were found in 1983 at the site of prehistoric village [[Ain Ghazal]]. Fourth century mosaics have been found in the church at the Monument of [[Moses]] at [[Mt. Nebo]], and Byzantine mosaics at various churches in [[Mount Nebo|Nebo]] and [[Madaba]]. Other mosaics are found throughout the Jordanian desert at various castles dating back to the Umayyad dynasty. Such castles include Qasr al-Hallabat, Hmmam al-Sarakh, Qusayr ‘amra, Qasr Kharana, Mshatta, and Qasr al-Tuba.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;"Jordan, Hashemite Kingdom of." In The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture. Ed. Jonathan M. Bloom, Sheila S. Blair. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. 03-May-2012. &lt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t276/e452&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]] was founded in 1951 in Amman, and archeological museums at Petra, jerash, Madaba, and Kerak have also come into existence.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; Archeological discoveries in Jordan have also been supported since 1970 by the American Center for Oriental Research (ACOR). ACOR hosts visiting archeologists and anthropologists, funds ongoing discovery initiatives and offers fellowships for students in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acorjordan.org/|title=ACOR Jordan: Homepage|author=|date=|website=Acor Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and customs==
===Hospitality===
One of the key aspects of Jordanian culture is the hospitality shown by hosts to their guests. This is felt even while walking around the streets of Jordan, where the phrase "ahlan wa sahlan" ("I welcome you") is heard nearly everywhere you go.
 
Old proverbs such as the following one show that traditions of hospitality date back many years:
	
"The host must fear the guest. When he sits [and shares your food], he is company. When he stands [and leaves your house], he is a poet" (Lazim al-mu’azzib yikhaf min al-dhayf. Luma yijlis howa dhayf. Luma yigum howa sha’ir).&lt;ref name="Shyrock"&gt;Shryock, Andrew. "The New Jordanian Hospitality: House, Host, and Guest in the Culture of Public Display". Comparative Studies in Society and History , Vol. 46, No. 1 (Jan., 2004), pp. 35-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the traditions of hospitality come from Jordanian Bedouin culture. For example, the host and his/her guest often share a cup of black coffee. The host drinks out of the cup first, ensuring that the coffee is the right temperature. The guest then drinks what remains of the first cup. A second cup is served to the guest, and then a third. The host also serves the guest copious amounts of food and is careful to make sure the guest is comfortable and stays as long as he/she would like.&lt;ref name="Shyrock" /&gt; Such displays are referred to as karam, the Arabic word for "generosity" or "hospitality" that also has implications of "nobility," "grace," and "refinement."&lt;ref name="Shyrock" /&gt;

In addition to wanting to be hospitable, the host also has a reputation at stake when inviting over a guest.

===Bedouin weddings===
Bedouin tradition favors marriage between first cousins on the paternal side of the family. This allows family property to stay within the family. When a man decides he would like to marry, he, his father, and the women of the family discuss who might be an appropriate choice for a wife. Then, a courtship begins. The young man is able to meet with his potential spouse multiple times until they decide whether the marriage will happen. The father of the bride meets with the young man and his father, who seal the agreement over coffee. 

Traditional Bedouin wedding celebrations last anywhere from five to seven days. The week begins with small gatherings in the tents of the bride and the groom. These gatherings increase in size throughout the week, adding more guests and food as the days pass. The men gather in the groom’s tent where they dance and sing and use pistols and rifles to shoot celebratory shots in the air. The women gather in the bride’s tent, and on the final night they paint her hands and feet with henna. On the day of the wedding, the male relatives of the groom dress and prepare him; the women prepare the bride. The bride is dressed in an embroidered wedding dress and gold or silver jewelry, with a green silk cloth covering her head. The female relatives process her to the groom’s tent where the wedding takes place. After seven days of marriage, the female relatives of the groom wash and dress the new bride, who is now officially a married woman of the groom’s household.

===Non-Bedouin weddings===
Traditional weddings among non-Bedouin Jordanians involve a long process that starts with an engagement.  Typically, the older women in the family lead the process and talk among one another their children and which among them might make a good match as husband and wife. When an agreement is made between two families, the deal is confirmed over rounds of coffee between the girl’s father and the prospective groom and his father. The groom's family then hosts a large engagement party. The two families work together to prepare for the wedding. 

Traditional wedding celebrations last a week and begin with small gatherings of family and close friends. As the days pass and the wedding grows closer, the parties increase in size. More guests are invited and more food is served. The night before the wedding, the bride's hands and feet are painted with henna by the women in her family as they sing and tell stories. Traditionally, on the morning of the wedding, the groom’s friends take him to a bathhouse for an intense cleaning and a shave, singing and telling jokes all the while, but today this is less common. Once prepared, both the bride and the groom go to the house of the groom's parents.  The bride is processed by a caravan of honking cars.  The men typically sit outside the house; the women, inside.  There is much singing and dancing done by all. Mansaf is typically served as the noonday meal. 

Today, especially in cities such as Amman, it is also common for the wedding celebration to be shortened to make the occasion more financially affordable, as well as less time consuming. Many brides opt for Western-style white dresses; grooms, a formal black suit. The procession of cars still occurs, but often to a wedding hall rather than the groom’s house where guests may or may not sit segregated by gender.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, John A. "Gender, Marriage, and Family." Culture and Customs of Jordan. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2006. 87-98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main|Sport in Jordan}}
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Jordan, followed by [[basketball]]. The increase of interest in football can be attributed to the recent success of the [[Jordan national football team|Jordanian national football team]], after they qualified for the [[AFC Asian Cup]] for the first time ever in 2004. The [[Jordan national basketball team|Jordanian national basketball team]] also experienced success after receiving sponsorship by [[Zain Group|Zain]].

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Jordanian cuisine}} 
[[File:Petra metzes.jpg|thumb|300px|A large plate of Jordanian [[mezze]] in [[Petra]]]]
The Jordanian cuisine is a traditional style of [[food preparation]] originating from Jordan that has developed from centuries of social and political change with roots starts with the evidence of human activity in Jordan in the Paleolithic period (c. 90,000 BC).

There is a wide variety in the [[Jordanian cuisine|Jordanian]] style of cooking. The authentic Jordanian cuisine can range from [[baking]], [[sautéing]] and [[grilling]] to stuffing of [[vegetables]] (grape leaves, eggplants, etc.), [[meat]], and [[poultry]]. Also common in the Jordanian style of cooking is [[roasting]], and/or preparing foods with special sauces. 

As one of the largest producers of [[olives]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alarabalyawm.net/pages.php?news_id=330648 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206080309/http://www.alarabalyawm.net/pages.php?news_id=330648 |archivedate=6 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[olive oil]] is the main cooking oil in Jordan. [[Herb]]s, [[garlic]], [[spice]]s, [[onion]], [[tomato sauce]] and [[lemon]] are typical flavours found in [[Jordanian food]]. The recipes to the meals of the cuisines of Jordan can vary from extremely spicy to mild. 

The most common and popular of the appetizers is [[hummus]], which is a puree of [[chick peas]] blended with [[tahini]], lemon, and garlic. [[Ful Medames]] is another well-known appetizer. A worker's meal, today it has made its way to the tables of the upper class. A successful [[mezze]] must of course have [[kebbeh|koubba maqliya]], [[labaneh]], [[baba ghanoush]], [[tabbouleh]], [[olive]]s and [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]].

===Mansaf===
The national dish in Jordan is [[mansaf]], a dish that is associated with Bedouin traditions. Despite these rural roots, it is shared by Jordanians of many diverse backgrounds, not just Bedouins or those who can trace their ancestral lines back to Bedouins. The dish is composed of a bread called sherack, lamb meat, and yogurt (jameed). Recently, rice and nuts have been added to the dish, and some regions in Jordan add seasoning. It is served on a large, circular platter. The ingredients are combined to form several layers. The first layer is made of thin, unleavened bread, shredded and soaked in yogurt broth. Next is a layer of rice which covers the bread. Large chunks of lamb that have been simmered in the same type of yogurt broth are placed on top of the rice. The head of the lamb is placed in the center of the tray. Pine nuts, almonds, and parsley are sprinkled atop the meat and rice. The final step involves pouring a yogurt broth over the entire dish, which is then added periodically throughout the meal to keep the dish warm and moist. Traditionally, mansaf is eaten while sitting on the floor, using ones hands to eat from a large, circular communal tray. This tradition still persists, although in modern years, many people have taken to eating the dish with silverware. Most admit, however, that mansaf tastes better when eaten with the hand. The dish takes hours to prepare and thus is primarily served only on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Sally. "Modernizing Mansaf: The Consuming Contexts of Jordan's National Dish."

===Zarb===

Another famous meat dish in Southern Jordan, especially in the [[Bedouin]] Desert area of [[Petra]] and [[Wadi Rum]], is the ''[[Quzi|zarb]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Saudi Aramco World :         Jordan’s Legendary Musakahan|url = https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197506/jordan.s.legendary.musakahan.htm|website = www.saudiaramcoworld.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a Bedouin style barbeque containing chunks of meat which have been marinated in spices, as well as bread dough and vegetables which are prepared in a submerged oven called a ''[[taboon]]''. It is considered a delicacy of that area.

===Daily meals===
Breakfast usually includes a variety of white cheeses, olives, pickled vegetables, and freshly baked breads served with various fruit spreads, butter, or honey. Most opt for tea or fruit juice as a drink with breakfast.

Lunch is the main meal for most Jordanian families, and can take place anywhere from 2 pm until 8 pm. It typically includes a main dish containing meat, as well as rice or bread, as well as a wide variety of salads and dips. Some common salads are [[tabbouleh]] and salatah ‘arabiyah (chopped tomatoes, cucumber, and onions, drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice). Dips include [[baba ghanouj]] and [[tahini]]. 

Dinner is generally a smaller meal than lunch, but this can vary family-to-family depending on work schedules.  If traditional practice is followed, the meal is usually a type of soup or stew or the leftovers from lunch.

Although simple fresh [[fruit]]s are often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, there is also dessert, such as [[baklava]], hareeseh, [[knafeh]], [[halva]] and [[qatayef]] which is a dessert made specially for [[Ramadan]].

===Imported culinary customs===
The large Palestinian population in the country has led to the rise of another popular dish among the people of Jordan: [[maqluba]]. This dish is made of meat (typically beef or lamb), fried onions,  and a variety of vegetables. The word maqlubah means "upside down" and the dish draws its name from the fact that the pot it is prepared in is turned upside down on a plate before it is served. The dish falls out of the pot with what had been at the bottom of the pot during preparation now sitting on top of the dish. 
 
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] legacy also lives on in Jordanian cuisine, as evidenced by the presence of such dishes as one called [[kabsa]] or Riz Bukhari which is made with chicken, onions, carrots, tomatoes, orange or lemon zest and juice, and spices. This mixture is served on top of rice and sprinkled with raisons and chopped almonds. This dish originates with Turkish-speaking Uzbeks from Central Asia who came to Jordan in the decade after [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, John A. "Traditional Cuisine and Costume."

'''Décolletage''' {{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|ə|t|ɑː|ʒ}} (or '''décolleté''', its adjectival form, in current [[French language|French]]) is a term used in woman's fashion referring to the upper part of a woman's [[torso]], comprising her neck, shoulders, back and upper chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. The term is most commonly used in Western female fashions and is most commonly applied to a [[neckline]] that reveals or emphasizes [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]. Low-cut necklines are a feature of [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[lingerie]] and [[swimsuit]]s, among other fashions. Although décolletage does not itself prescribe the extent of exposure of a woman's upper chest, the design of a décolleté garment takes into account current fashions, aesthetics, social norms and the occasion when a garment will be worn.

Though neckline styles have varied in Western societies and décolletage may be regarded as [[aesthetic]] and an expression of [[femininity]], in some parts of the world any décolletage is considered provocative and shocking.

== Etymology ==

Décolletage is a French word which is derived from ''décolleter'', meaning to reveal the neck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/d%C3%A9collet%C3%A9 The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in English literature sometime before 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Barnhart|editor-first=Robert K.|title=Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-270084-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In strict usage, décolletage is the neckline extending about two handbreadths from the base of the neck down, front and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudofsky|first=Bernard|title=The Unfashionable Human Body|year=1984|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-442-27636-2|edition=Repr. d.

In [[Indonesia]] (especially in [[Javanese people|Java]]), a breast cloth known as ''[[kemben]]'' was worn for centuries until the 20th century. Today, shoulder-exposing gowns still feature in many [[culture of Indonesia|Indonesian rituals]].

Gowns which exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and non-controversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, pp. 25–26, 43, 53, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris. ''The Naked Woman. A Study of the Female Body'', p. 156. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2004. {{ISBN|0-312-33853-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During that long period, low-cut dresses partially exposing breasts were considered more acceptable than they are today; a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders were considered more risqué than exposed breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-486-27124-8 |author=C. Willett |author2=Phillis Cunnington |last-author-amp=yes |title=The History of Underclothes |location=London |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1450, [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress to [[Charles VII of France]], is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [[toplessness|fully bared breasts]] in the French court.&lt;ref name="histoire_mode"&gt;Monique Canellas-Zimmer, ''Histoires de mode'', Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine - 2005, {{ISBN|9782846221191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included [[Simonetta Vespucci]], whose [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|portrait with exposed breasts]] was painted by [[Piero di Cosimo]] in c. 1480.

Based on woodcut prints, a researcher has argued that during the 17th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000086551/ |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne of Brittany]] has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], wife of [[Charles I of England]], were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect [[Inigo Jones]] designed a [[masque]] costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660"/&gt;

In [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] and upper-class circles, the display of breasts was at times regarded as a [[status symbol]], as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/caricatures/fr6-wetnursing.cfm |title=French Caricature |accessdate=2010-01-13 |publisher=University of Virginia Health System |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601211316/http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/caricatures/fr6-wetnursing.cfm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Renaissance]] onwards, the bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of [[Ancient Greece|classical Greece]] that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period.&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660"&gt;Lucy Gent and Nigel Llewellyn, eds., ''Renaissance Bodies: The Human Figure in English Culture c. 1540–1660''. London: Reaktion Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]] décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back.&lt;ref&gt;S. Devadas Pillai. ''Indian Sociology through Ghurye, A Dictionary'', p. 68, Popular Prakashan, 1997, {{ISBN|81-7154-807-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the period 1795–1820]], many women wore dresses which bared the bosom and shoulders.

During the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end of the 19th century), the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions. (See [[1880s in fashion]].) In 1884, a portrait painting by [[John Singer Sargent]] of American-born Paris socialite, [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]], was criticised&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ormand and Elaine Kilmurray, ''Sargent: The Early Portraits'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-300-07245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she was depicted in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884, his reputation in tatters. The painting was named "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |title=John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-300-08744-4 |page=139, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=424 "Sargent's Portraits"], an article including a mention of the scandal caused by the portrayal of cleavage in [[John Singer Sargent]]'s "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

When it became fashionable, around 1913, for dresses to be worn with what would now be considered a relatively modest round or V-shaped neckline, [[clergymen]] all over the world became deeply shocked. In the [[German Empire]], all of the [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking modern fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim,  94.&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more permitted in Western societies, during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Kim K. P. Johnson, Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne Bubolz Eicher. ''Fashion foundations'', p. 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-619-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Hollywood film ''[[The French Line]]'' was found objectionable under the strict [[Hays Code]] with some of [[Jane Russell]]'s décolletage gowns being described as "intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme décolletage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14358-5|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, [[Gina Lollobrigida]] raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations.

During a short period in 1964, "topless" dress designs appeared at fashion shows, but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Fashion/Fashion.shtm |title=Sixties City – Bringing on back the good times |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104085440/http://sixtiescity.com/Fashion/Fashion.shtm |archivedate=2010-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cleavage of a woman.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A woman's revealing [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]], is a modern form of décolletage]]

Low necklines usually result in increased décolletage. In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body, and especially breast, exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;Salmansohn, Karen. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html The Power of Cleavage]". ''The Huffington Post'', October 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered the appropriate neckline varies by context, and is open to differences of opinion. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters, or to leave the plane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;NBC News.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30664">Education in state institutions is free at the initial, primary, secondary and tertiary levels and in the undergraduate university level (not for graduate programs). Private education is paid, although in some cases (especially in primary and secondary schools)  state subsidies support its costs. According to studies by UNESCO, education in Argentina and Uruguay guarantee equality to have institutional features that hinder the commercialization of education, as well as Finland has characteristics that favor multiethnic population education and special education, education favors Argentina equality. According to the last census, the illiteracy rate is 1.9%, the second lowest in [[Latin America]]. In the last decade, Argentina has created nine new universities, while the outflow of university students increased by 68%.

Education is a responsibility shared by the national government, the provinces and federal district and private institutions, though basic guidelines have historically been set by the Ministry of Education {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. Closely associated in Argentina with President [[Domingo Sarmiento]]'s assertion that ''"the sovereign should be educated"'' ("sovereign" referring to the people), education has been extended nearly universally and its maintenance remains central to political and cultural debate. Even though education at all levels, including universities, has always been free, there are a significant number of private schools and universities.

==History==
[[Image:Domingo Sarmiento.jpg|thumb|170px|left|President Domingo F. Sarmiento, father of the Argentine Education System.]]
The education in [[Argentina]] known as the ''Latin American docta'' has had a convoluted history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sarmiento encouraged the immigration and settling of European educators and built schools and public [[library|libraries]] throughout the country, in a programme that doubled the enrollment of students during his term; in Argentina, [[Teacher's Day]] (on September 11) commemorates his death. The first national laws mandating universal, compulsory, free and secular education ([[Argentine Law 1420|Law 1420 of Common Education]]) were sanctioned in 1884 during the administration of President [[Julio Roca]]. The non-religious character of this system, which forbade parochial schools from issuing official degrees directly but only through a public university, harmed the [[State-Church relations in Argentina|relations between the Argentine State and the Catholic Church]], leading to resistance from the local clergy and a heated conflict with the [[Holy See]] (through the Papal [[Nuncio]]).

[[File:Buenos Aires - Escuela Normal Sarmiento - Callao 450.jpg|thumb|180px|Sarmiento Teachers' College: President Domingo Sarmiento established the first of these ''[[Normal school|Escuelas Normales]]'']]

Following the [[University Reform of 1918]], Argentine education, especially at university level, became more independent of the government, as well as the influential Catholic Church. The church began to re-emerge in country's secular education system during the administration [[Juan Perón]], when in 1947, [[catechism]] was reintroduced in public schools, and parochial institutions began again receiving subsidies. A sudden reversal in the policy in 1954 helped lead to Perón's violent overthrow, after which his earlier, pro-clerical policies were reinstated by General [[Pedro Aramburu]]. Aramburu's Law 6403 of 1955, which advanced private education generally, and parochial, or more often, Catholic-run schools (those staffed with lay teachers), in particular, helped lead to the establishment of the [[Universidad Católica Argentina|Argentine Catholic University]].&lt;ref name=rein&gt;Esti Rein, Mónica. ''Politics and education in Argentina, 1946-1962''. M.E. Sharpe, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program of deregulation and privatization pursued by President [[Carlos Menem]] in reaction to the country's socio-economic crisis of 1989 led to the decentralization of the Argentine secondary school system, whereby, from 1992 onward, the schools' administration and funding became a provincial responsibility. The policy's weakness, however, lay in that federal [[revenue sharing]] did not increase accordingly, particularly given the decision to shift two primary school years to the secondary system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbared.ungs.edu.ar/download/documentos/Descentralizacion%20Educativa1.doc Delgado, Marta.

Real government spending on education increased steadily from the return of democratic rule in [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983]] (with the exception of the crises in 1989 and 2002) and, in 2007, totaled over US$14 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mecon.gov.ar/peconomica/docs/gp_cons.xls Economy Ministry: National budget] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920021909/http://www.mecon.gov.ar/peconomica/docs/gp_cons.xls |date=2009-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
In spite of its many problems, Argentina's higher education managed to reach worldwide levels of excellence in the 1960s. Up to 2013 Argentina educated five [[List of Nobel laureates by country#Argentina|Nobel Prize]] winners, three in the sciences: [[Luis Federico Leloir]], [[Bernardo Houssay]] and [[César Milstein]] and two in peace: [[Carlos Saavedra Lamas]] and [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], the highest number in Latin America surpassing countries economically more developed and populated as Ireland or Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.gov.ar/spu/|title=SPU - Secretaría de Políticas Universitarias|first=SPU - Secretaría de Políticas|last=Universitarias|website=www.me.gov.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentina.ar/sw_seccion.php?id=124&amp;idioma_sel=en Science and Education in Argentina] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617145706/http://www.argentina.ar/sw_seccion.php?id=124&amp;idioma_sel=en |date=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spuweb.siu.edu.ar/studyinargentina/StudyinArgentina.htm Argentine Higher Education Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611015906/http://spuweb.siu.edu.ar/studyinargentina/StudyinArgentina.htm |date=2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as of 2010, Argentines are the only Latin Americans to have ever been honoured with a [[Rolf Schock Prizes|Rolf Schock Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kva.se/sv/Priser/Rolf-Shock-prisen/Pristagare-Rolf-Shock/|title=Kungl. Vetenskapsakademien|website=www.kva.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine population benefits from a relatively high level of educational attainment, by regional standards. Among those age 20 and over, the highest level attained, per the 2010 Census, was distributed thus:

==Characteristics==
Education in Argentina has four levels and two different systems: initial level (kindergarten, ''educación inicial''), primary level (''educación primaria''), secondary level (''educación secundaria'') and tertiary level (''educación superior'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.educacion.gov.ar/sistema/la-estructura-del-sistema-educativo/los-niveles/|title=Ministerio de Educación|website=Argentina.gob.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some provinces, primary level is called ''educación primaria'' or ''EP'' (Spanish, "primary education") and comprises grades first to sixth. Secondary level, called ''educación secundaria'' or ''ES'', comprises grades first to sixth ( called ''years''). EP and ES are divided in two stages, called ''ciclos'' ("cycles"):

# EP: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th (only in some provinces) school years
# ES  1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th (Only in some provinces) school years

In some other provinces EP comprises grades first to seventh (the traditional system, established by Argentine law 1420/1884). ES comprises grades first to fifth (the traditional system, in use throughout the 20th century).

In both systems EP is mandatory to all students, as well as secondary education, according to the National Educational Law established in 2011.

The fourth stage is tertiary education, which includes both college and university education.

Education is funded by tax payers at all levels except for the majority of [[graduate studies]]. There are many private school institutions in the [[Primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and university levels. Around 11.4 million people were enrolled in formal education of some kind in 2005:

===Qualification Modes of Grading===

In the ''[[Latin American docta]]'' the scale to grade up the academic performance in students at the primary and secondary school rest in the 1-10 ladder as is described in the following frame.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: auto; font-size:90%; width:580px; background:F5F5F5;"

In the University System however the scale can vary depending on the independent policies and statutes of grading of each independent Argentine University.

===Primary education===
[[Image:Delantales blancos 2.jpg|210px|thumb|The ubiquitous white uniform of Argentine school children is a national symbol of learning.]]

[[Image:Colegio Nacional Bragado.jpg|thumb|210px|Secondary School in the Pampas city of [[Bragado]]. Argentina's secondary schools belong to a provincial system.]]

Accepted between ages 6 and 14.
Primary education s the first EP cycles (grades 1–6). Because of the system that was in place during 1995-2007, most schools that offered 7 years of primary school prior to 1995 were forced to be converted and accept grades 8th and 9th, while others chose to eliminate 7th grade altogether, forcing students to complete the 3rd cycle in another institution.

===Secondary education===
Secondary education in Argentina comprises two levels. Years 1st to 3rd are common to all schools (''Ciclo básico''). Years 4th to 6th (in some provinces 4th to 5th) are organized in orientations (''Ciclo orientado'') such as Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Arts, Sport, Design, etc. An additional year is offered in certain schools (Technical-Professional schools), which grants a professional title, also with orientations (agriculture, electricity, mechanics, construction, etc.).

In many provinces the secondary education system is still divided in three traditional large groups, "Bachiller" schools (very similar to [[grammar school]]s with a huge emphasis on humanistic studies), "Comercial" schools (focusing on economic sciences and everything related to it) and "Escuelas Técnicas" (with a focus on technical and scientific assignments, this one having the particularity of lasting six/seven years instead of five/six, it used to be called "Industrial") each one subdivided in more specific orientations related to its main branch.

In December 2006 the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Argentine Congress]] approved a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 12 years. The transitional period ended in 2011.

In addition an adult system of high schools (usually called ''Acelerados'', Spanish for accelerated) exists in order to guarantee secondary education to people over 18. Normally it consists in 2 or 3 years of intensive program of study and it is provided by a large number of public and private schools varying on each province. Night shift is available in order to satisfy those who work during the day. These high school diplomas are accepted to enroll in a university.

Argentina's network of vocational schools, many under the auspices of the [[Universidad Tecnologica Nacional|National Technological University (UTN)]] or the provincial educational systems, have historically given students viable alternatives, as well.

===International education===
As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=Home - International School Consultancy|website=www.iscresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed Argentina as having 160 international schools.&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms "ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation."&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"/&gt; This definition is used by publications including [[The Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher Education in Argentina===
{{see also|Academic ranks in Argentina|List of universities in Argentina}}
Argentine higher education system is based, since its conception during the colonial period, on the old and dogmatic [[Higher education in Spain|Spanish higher education system]], which is basically a [[Continental education system]] (opposed to the Anglo-Saxon Model). A historic event took place in the [[University Reform|Reforma Universitaria de 1918]], a highly-popular series of reforms that took place in the oldest university of the Country, the [[Universidad de Córdoba]]  that finally paved the way to the modernization of the Argentinian higher university systems as it is known nowadays. Since its foundation, it was focused on the teaching of [[Profession]]s offering [[Professional degree]]s.

It is divided in three levels .

* '''Tertiary Education level''':  1- to 3-years degrees related to education or technical professions like [[Teachers]], [[Professorship]], [[Technician]]s.
* '''University level''': 4- to 6-years Professional education taught at Universities offering many different degrees [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]], [[Engineer's degree]], [[Title of Medic|Medic Title]], [[Title of Attorney|Attorney Title]], Professorships, Translation degrees, etc.
* '''Post-graduate level''': This is a specialized and research-oriented education level. It is roughly divided in a first sub-level where a [[Specialist degree]] can be obtained in a 12–18 months period or [[Master's degree]], requiring 24–30 months and an original research work and a higher sub-level where a [[Doctorate]] degree could be achieved.

====Funding====

One important aspect is that [[public university|Public universities]] at Tertiary Education level and at University level are '''tuition-free''' and '''open''' to anyone. Although it is not required to pay any kind of fee at universities, hidden costs of education, like transportation and materials, are often neglected and a lack of a well-developed and widespread scholarship system makes it hard for students from low-income families to enroll in public universities: for each eight students from the 20% upper-income class, there is only one student from the 20% lower-income class.&lt;ref name=University&gt;"Realidad y propuestas para la Universidad Argentina", Alieto Aldo Guadagni, Academia Nacional de Educación&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, post-graduate education requires some form of funding and it is generally not free.

Additionally, financial pressure to freshman college students force them to join the work force before graduation, thus it is very common for young students to have full-time jobs and at the same time study at the University.  This is considered beneficial because when the students graduate they already have working experience, though this could also be one of the causes of the high ratio of dropouts.&lt;ref name=University/&gt;&lt;ref name=WorkAndStudy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1078072|title=¿Se puede estudiar y trabajar al mismo tiempo?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====College education====
[[Image:UBA-Facultad-Derecho.jpg|thumb|210px|The University of Buenos Aires Law School.]]
Argentina maintains a network of 39 [[national university|National universities]], financed by the Ministry of Education since 1946. Private and parochial universities are also abundant, numbering 46 among the active institutions and they enroll about a sixth of the collegiate student body (see [[Argentine university reform of 1918|University reform in Argentina]] and [[List of universities in Argentina]]).&lt;ref name=indec/&gt;  Summing up, over 1.5 million students attend institutions of higher learning in Argentina, annually (roughly half the population of college age).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica, Book of the Year. Statistical Appendix: Argentina.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina does not have a standard and common system of examination after high school, thus admission to universities is strictly defined by each university.  Moreover, a steady degradation in primary and secondary education created a huge difference between the required level to enter a university and the level achieved by the high school students. Some universities like [[University of Buenos Aires]] cope with this issue by creating a 1-year shared program called ''CBC'' that students need to complete in order to join the university.&lt;ref name=Ingreso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/03/29/sociedad/s-01638810.htm|title=Un nuevo bochazo en el ingreso a la universidad|first=|last=Clarin.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Graduate School====
{{see also|Graduate education#Argentina}}
The doctoral fields of study in Argentina are generally [[Doctorate#Research-oriented doctorates|research-oriented doctoral studies]], leading mostly to the awarding of the degrees of [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]], [[Doctor of Medicine]], and [[Doctor of Law]], among others. Enrollment in doctorate programs in Argentina is available to candidates having earned a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]], [[Professorship]]s [[Engineer's degree]] or [[Master's degree]] in a related area of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?item=34&amp;apps=&amp;tpl=busc_posgrado&amp;act=result&amp;id_convocatoria=&amp;idioma=en Doctorate Engine Seeker - CONEAU by ''Areas Disciplinarias'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spuweb.siu.edu.ar/studyinargentina/pages/study1603.php Doctorates in Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421161753/http://spuweb.siu.edu.ar/studyinargentina/pages/study1603.php |date=2010-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctoral fields of study mostly pertain to one of five fields of knowledge:  [[Applied Sciences]], [[Hard sciences|Basic Sciences]], [[Health Sciences]], [[Human Sciences]] and [[Social Sciences]]. The [[doctorate|doctoral studies]] offered by the Argentine universities include multiple fields and do have national and international validity of the degrees granted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcye.gov.ar/spu/guia_tematica/estadisticas_y_publicaciones/estaditicas_sobre_las_preferencias.pdf Disciplinary Election in the Argentine University System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619213743/http://www.mcye.gov.ar/spu/guia_tematica/estadisticas_y_publicaciones/estaditicas_sobre_las_preferencias.pdf |date=2009-06-19 }} Secretary of Academic Policies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.me.gov.ar/spu/documentos/publicaciones/posgra97.pdf Postgraduate Career Guide] Secretary of Academic Policies&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic regulations governing doctorates, and their corresponding fields, in Argentina prescribe that all graduate courses must be accredited by the [[w:es:Comisión Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación Universitaria|National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation]].  This entity stands as a public and decentralized body working under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, Science and Technology. It administers the process of evaluation and accreditation for all [[doctorate]] programs, and is responsible for the institutional evaluation of all such programs at a national level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?idioma=en National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702010802/http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?idioma=en |date=July 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate programs, including the ''Doctorados'' (PhDs), set standards per guidelines set forth by the Ministry of Science and Technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia|title=Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva|date=30 October 2017|website=Argentina.gob.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the Universities Council.

Additionally, external evaluations of the doctoral programs are carried out by the National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation, or private entities created to that effect, together with the participation of academic peers. Argentine institutions of higher education provide further accreditation by international establishments to many of their courses of studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coneau.gov.ar/index.php?item=8&amp;apps=64&amp;idioma=en External evaluation&amp;nbsp;— CONEAU]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|[[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
In philosophy, '''empiricism''' is a [[theory]] that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from [[Empirical evidence|sensory experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415546133|pages=129–38|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of several views of  [[epistemology]], the study of human knowledge, along with [[rationalism]] and [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. Empiricism emphasises the role of [[empirical evidence]] in the formation of ideas, over the idea of [[innate idea]]s or [[traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. ''Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', 1748.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empiricism in the [[philosophy of science]] emphasises evidence, especially as discovered in [[experiment]]s. It is a fundamental part of the [[scientific method]] that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on ''[[A priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' reasoning, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], or [[revelation]].

Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and [[Falsifiability|falsification]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, M. (2006). Empiricism. In F. English (Ed.), Encyclopedia of educational leadership and administration. (pp. 338–39). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.

==Etymology==
The English term ''empirical'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ἐμπειρία, ''empeiria'', which is cognate with and translates to the Latin ''experientia'', from which are derived the word ''experience'' and the related ''experiment''.

==History==

===Background===
{{Main|Empirical method}}

A central concept in  [[science]] and the [[scientific method]] is that it must be ''empirically'' based on the evidence of the senses. Both [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s use working [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that are [[testable]] by [[observation]] and [[experiment]]. The term ''semi-empirical'' is sometimes used to describe theoretical methods that make use of basic [[axiom]]s, established scientific laws, and previous experimental results in order to engage in reasoned model building and theoretical inquiry.

Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.&lt;ref&gt;Markie, P. (2004), "Rationalism vs. Empiricism" in Edward D. Zalta (ed.), ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; This view is commonly contrasted with [[rationalism]], which states that knowledge may be derived from [[reason]] independently of the senses. For example, [[John Locke]] held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and reasoning alone.

===Early empiricism===
''[[Vaisheshika]]'' [[darsana]], founded by the ancient Indian philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], accepted perception and inference as the only two reliable sources of knowledge. This is enumerated in his work [[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]].

The earliest Western proto-empiricists were the [[Empiric school]] of ancient Greek medical practitioners, who rejected the three doctrines of the [[Dogmatic school]], preferring to rely on the observation of ''[[Phenomenalism|"phenomena"]]''.&lt;ref name=sini&gt;Sini, Carlo (2004), "Empirismo", in Gianni Vattimo et al. (eds.), ''Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("clean slate" or "blank tablet") connotes a view of mind as an originally blank or empty recorder (Locke used the words "white paper") on which experience leaves marks. This denies that humans have [[innate ideas]]. The image dates back to [[Aristotle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What the mind (''[[nous]]'') thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet (''grammateion'') which bears no actual writing (''grammenon'');  this is just what happens in the case of the mind.  (Aristotle, ''[[On the Soul]]'', 3.4.430&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of [[potentiality and actuality]], and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the [[active intellect|active ''nous'']]. These notions contrasted with [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others).  Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than [[Plato]], and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (Latin for "nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses").

This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Jeffrey|title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille|date=June 11, 2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as "When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book|last1=Long|first1=A.A.|last2=Sedley|first2=D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge, Ma|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) from 1271]]

During the [[Middle Ages]] Aristotle's theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed by [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] starting with [[Al Farabi]], developing into an elaborate theory by [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; and demonstrated as a [[thought experiment]] by [[Ibn Tufail]].&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt; For Avicenna ([[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]), for example, the ''tabula rasa'' is a pure potentiality that is actualized through [[education]], and knowledge is attained through "empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" developed through a "[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]] in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts". The [[intellect]] itself develops from a [[passive intellect|material intellect]] (''al-'aql al-hayulani''), which is a [[potentiality]] "that can acquire knowledge to the [[active intellect]] (''al-[['aql]] al-fa'il''), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; So the immaterial "active intellect", separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.

In the 12th century CE the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Muslim]] philosopher and novelist Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]] (known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West) included the theory of ''tabula rasa'' as a [[thought experiment]] in his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a ''tabula rasa'' to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]], through experience alone. The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] novel, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', was written by the Arab theologian and physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] in the 13th century. It also dealt with the theme of empiricism through the story of a feral child on a desert island, but departed from its predecessor by depicting the development of the protagonist's mind through contact with society rather than in isolation from society.&lt;ref name="Roubi"&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=February 6, 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'')&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] adopted the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] position that the senses are essential to mind into [[scholasticism]]. [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274), one of Aquinas' strongest intellectual opponents, offered some of the strongest arguments in favour of the Platonic idea of the mind.

===Renaissance Italy===
In the late [[renaissance]] various writers began to question the [[medieval]] and [[classical philosophy|classical]] understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way. In political and historical writing [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and his friend [[Francesco Guicciardini]] initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the "effectual truth" instead. Their contemporary, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) said, "If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings."&lt;ref&gt;"Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chineseand Western Medical Illustration", Camillia Matuk, Journal of Biocommunication, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2006, [http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (c. 1520 – 1591), father of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and the inventor of [[monody]], made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his ''Dialogo della musica antica e moderna'' (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for "experiment" was ''esperienza''. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. ''Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei''), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of '[[Pythagorean hammers|Pythagoras' hammers]]' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded "experience and demonstration" as the ''sine qua non'' of valid rational enquiry.

===British empiricism===
'''British empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of [[early modern philosophy]] and [[modern science]]. The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders [[Francis Bacon]], described as [[The Advancement of Learning|empiricist]], and [[René Descartes]], who is described as a rationalist. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], in the next generation, are often also described as an empiricist and a rationalist respectively. [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] were the primary exponents of empiricism in the 18th century [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with Locke being the person who is normally known as the founder of empiricism as such.

In response to the early-to-mid-17th century "[[rationalism#Background|continental rationalism]]" [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) proposed in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) a very influential view wherein the ''only'' knowledge humans can have is ''[[a posteriori]]'', i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', a "blank tablet", in Locke's words "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for [[certainty]] of [[Descartes]].

[[File:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bishop George Berkeley]]]]
A generation later, the Irish [[Anglican]] bishop, [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual [[atheism]]. In response to Locke, he put forth in his ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things ''only'' exist either as a ''result'' of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)  In his text ''Alciphron'', Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Stephen (1987) "Berkeley's Theory of Reality" in ''The Journal of the Limerick Philosophical Society'', [http://www.ul.ie/~philos/vol1/berkel.html UL.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called [[subjective idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "George Berkeley", vol. 1, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP2"/&gt;

The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of [[skepticism]].  Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, "Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition."&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_prob"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of Probability|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt; And,&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_nec"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of the Idea of a Necessary Connexion|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"I believe the most general and most popular explication of this matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, such as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as distinguished from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cause or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained: and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on."|Hume Section XIV "of the idea of necessary connexion in ''A Treatise of Human Nature''}}

Hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: ''relations of ideas'' and ''matters of fact'' (see also [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. "that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving  some [[contingent]] observation of the world (e.g. "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's "ideas", in turn, are derived from their "impressions". For Hume, an "impression" corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an "idea". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt;

[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]'s empiricism led to numerous philosophical schools.]]
Hume maintained that no knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, can be conclusively established by reason.  Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated ''habits'', developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about [[scientific method]]—that of the [[problem of induction]].  Hume argued that it requires [[inductive reasoning]] to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt; Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.  Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by [[inductive reasoning]] that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.&lt;ref name=Hume1&gt;Hume, D. "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding", in Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals, 2nd edition, L.A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, UK, 1902 [1748].{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume concluded that such things as belief in an external world and belief in the existence of the self were not rationally justifiable. According to Hume these beliefs were to be accepted nonetheless because of their profound basis in instinct and custom.  Hume's lasting legacy, however, was the doubt that his skeptical arguments cast on the legitimacy of inductive reasoning, allowing many skeptics who followed to cast similar doubt.

===Phenomenalism===
{{Main|Phenomenalism}}
Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is ''rationally'' unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit.&lt;ref&gt;Morick, H. (1980), Challenges to Empiricism, Hackett Publishing, Indianapolis, IN.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an extreme empiricist theory known as [[phenomenalism]], anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Marconi, Diego (2004), "Fenomenismo"', in [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Gaetano Chiurazzi (eds.), ''L'Enciclopedia Garzanti di Filosofia'', 3rd edition, Garzanti, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist—hence the closely related term [[subjective idealism]]. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences.  This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As [[John Stuart Mill]] put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the "permanent possibility of sensation".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., "An Examination of Sir William Rowan Hamilton's Philosophy", in A.J. Ayer and Ramond Winch (eds.), British Empirical Philosophers, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, 1968.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for ''all'' meaningful knowledge including mathematics.  As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:

{{quote|[Mill] claimed that mathematical truths were merely very highly confirmed generalizations from experience; mathematical inference, generally conceived as deductive [and ''a priori''] in nature, Mill set down as founded on induction.  Thus, in Mill's philosophy there was no real place for knowledge based on relations of ideas.  In his view logical and mathematical necessity is psychological; we are merely unable to conceive any other possibilities than those that logical and mathematical propositions assert. This is perhaps the most extreme version of empiricism known, but it has not found many defenders.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;}}

Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fred (2005), "John Stuart Mill", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations.  This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such "groups of permanent possibilities of sensation" might exist in the first place.  Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of "reality" that goes beyond mere "possibilities of sensation", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MEP6&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Phenomenalism", vol. 6, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the "gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all".&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;  Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.  It  fails to fully consider the structure and method of [[mathematical science]], the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of [[inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref name=MEP2&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Empiricism", vol. 2, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Axiomatic Method", vol. 5, pp. 188–89, 191ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.&lt;ref&gt;Bolender, John (1998), "Factual Phenomenalism: A Supervenience Theory"', Sorites, no. 9, pp. 16–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement.  The translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no ''finite'' set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.  But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the [[Third Man Argument|third man]]).&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah (2004), The Refutation of Phenomenalism, Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chisholm |first1=Roderick M. |date=September 9, 1948 |title=The Problem of Empiricism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=45 |issue=19 |pages=512–17 |jstor=2019108 |doi=10.2307/2019108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical empiricism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
Logical empiricism (also ''logical positivism'' or ''neopositivism'') was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from [[mathematical logic]] that had been developed by [[Gottlob Frege]]  and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Some of the key figures in this movement were [[Otto Neurath]], [[Moritz Schlick]] and the rest of the [[Vienna Circle]], along with  [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]].

The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the  methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all [[logical truth]]s are mere linguistic [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the ''analytic'' (a priori) and the ''synthetic'' (a posteriori).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Achinstein|Achinstein, Peter]], and [[Stephen Francis Barker|Barker, Stephen F.]] (1969), The Legacy of Logical Positivism: Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called [[verification principle]]. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, Francesco (1986), Il neopositivismo logico, Laterza, Roma Bari.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of ''phenomenalism'' in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics.  That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called ''protocol sentences'', for example, "''X'' at location ''Y'' and at time ''T'' observes such and such."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, Nicholas]] (1985), The Heritage of Logical Positivism, University Press of America, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic–synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as [[Nelson Goodman]], [[W.V. Quine]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Richard Rorty]].  By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant  among contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] such as [[Michael Dummett]] and other [[anti-realism|anti-realists]].

===Pragmatism===
In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] arose.  The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s.  James popularized the term "pragmatism", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of "pragmaticism".  Along with its ''[[pragmatic theory of truth]]'', this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and [[rationalism|rational]] (concept-based) thinking.

[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
Charles Peirce (1839–1914) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today's empirical [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/peirce/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Burch|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peirce severely criticized many elements of Descartes' peculiar brand of rationalism, he did not reject rationalism outright.  Indeed, he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation.  In later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism, in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the "data-driven" strict-empiricist view.

Among Peirce's major contributions was to place [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before.  To this, Peirce added the concept of [[abductive reasoning]].  The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today.  Peirce's approach "presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them.  According to Peirce's doctrine of [[fallibilism]], the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Teddy (n.d.), "Empiricism", [http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm Eprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714183655/http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm |date=2012-07-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the "three cotary propositions of pragmatism" ([[Latin|L:]] ''cos, cotis'' whetstone), saying that they "put the edge on the [[pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]]".  First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street.  That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses.  Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of [[abductive reasoning|abductive inference]], its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique—in a word, incorrigible.  This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or "thisness"—what the [[Scholastics]] called its ''[[haecceity]]''—that stands beyond control and correction.  Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.  This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]] research, most recently for instance with the work of [[Irvin Rock]] on ''[[indirect perception]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin (1983), The Logic of Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin, (1997) Indirect Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term "[[radical empiricism]]" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism—though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed "directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support",&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1911), The Meaning of Truth.&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any [[value added]] by seeking [[supernatural]] explanations for [[nature|natural]] [[phenomena]].  James' "radical empiricism" is thus ''not'' radical in the context of the term "empiricism", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term "[[empirical]]". His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) modified James' pragmatism to form a theory known as [[instrumentalism]].  The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated.  Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that [[reality]] is determined by past experience.  Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience.  The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1906), Studies in Logical Theory.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in physical sciences as in ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/jsp.2011.0000 |title=What Experimentalism Means in Ethics |year=2011 |last1=Weber |first1=Eric Thomas |journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume=25 |pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, ideas in Dewey's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known ''a posteriori''.

'''EuroBillTracker''' ('''EBT''') is a website designed for tracking [[euro banknotes]]. It was inspired by the US [[currency tracking]] website [[Where's George?]].&lt;ref&gt;''Euro Bill Tracker Reaches 50,000 Registered Bills in 15 Weeks Time'', [http://www.eurobilltracker.com/press/press-release-50k.txt press release published on April 12, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saranow, J: "Follow the Money", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to record as many notes as possible to know details about their distribution and movements, follow it up, like where a note has been seen in particular, and generate statistics and rankings, for example, in which countries there are more tickets.&lt;ref name="EuroBillTracker About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.eurobilltracker.com/about/ |title=EuroBillTracker – About this site|date=1 January 2002|accessdate=21 October 2011|work=Philippe Girolami, Anssi Johansson, Marko Schilde|publisher=EuroBillTracker}}&lt;/ref&gt; EuroBillTracker has registered over 167 million notes as of June 2017,&lt;ref name="EuroBilltracker Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.eurobilltracker.com/stats/ |title=EuroBillTracker – Statistics|date=1 January 2002|accessdate=1 May 2013|work=Philippe Girolami, Anssi Johansson, Marko Schilde|publisher=EuroBillTracker}}&lt;/ref&gt; worth more than €3.096 billion.&lt;ref name="EuroBilltracker Statistics"/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
EuroBillTracker is an international non-profit volunteer team dedicated to tracking euro notes around the world. The site is made up of people who simply enter the information from the notes in their possession. Each user enters the [[serial number]]s and location information for each note they obtain into EuroBillTracker. A user can then see any comments from other people who have had that note. From this information, the site extracts:
* Diffusion information: Each euro country has its own range of note serial numbers and from this information EBT can generate diffusion graphs that tell us how the notes travel to other countries. See the Diffusion section for more information.
* Tracking information: When a note is re-entered, the users who previously entered it are notified via email. These hits can be seen in the statistics section.
* Statistics and rankings: Who enters the most notes, which are the top countries? Where are the notes currently situated?

Euro banknotes and coins were put into circulation on 1 January 2002 and EBT has been tracking notes since then. The site was initially created by Philippe Girolami (giro). Anssi Johansson (avij) has been assisting with running the site since mid-2003. Site translation and various other tasks are handled by a group of active EBT users.

EuroBillTracker is not affiliated with the [[European Union]], [[European Central Bank]], national central banks or other financial institutions. Using EBT is completely free. Unlike [[Where's George?]], EuroBillTracker requires users to register an account before they can enter details of banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurobilltrackerforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=10810 |title=EuroBillTracker :: View topic – how to enter notes? |publisher=Eurobilltrackerforum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 2008 onwards, the website is supposed to be run by a non-profit organization based in [[France]], and called the [[European Society for EuroBillTrackers]] or [[Association des Eurobilltrackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurobilltrackerforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=10510 |title=EuroBillTracker :: View topic – Gennevilliers Agreement |publisher=Eurobilltrackerforum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation, operating generally similar to the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], will be in charge of protecting the EuroBillTracker database and ensuring it is free of charge. Proceedings for the founding of the association are under way as of January 2008; they were launched after disagreements between the founder of the website and other webmasters caused a split of EuroBillTracker into two different sites on 24 December 2007. The two sites reunited in early 2008.

== Community ==
The growing popularity of EuroBillTracker has led to the development of a community of ''trackers'', especially in countries with a higher usage of the website, such as [[Finland]], the [[Benelux]] countries and [[Slovenia]]. On the contrary, the percentage of users with respect to the national population is especially low in some south European countries such as France, Spain or [[Greece]], and also in [[Republic of Ireland]]

Since 2004, the community has been organising a pan-European yearly meeting during summer. After the 2008 meeting in [[Ljubljana]], the EBT users also decided to organise a winter pan-European meeting.

* The 2019 Winter meeting will take place in [[Munich]] during the weekend of 22-24 March.

'''Curiosities:'''
* The Winter Meeting in 2010 was the first where the name of the country was attributed to the meeting instead of the host city;
* The city of {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Frankfurt am Main]] was the host of the Winter 2012 Meeting, where the 10th Anniversary of EuroBillTracker was celebrated;
* The Summer 2016 Meeting was the first with a repeat host (in {{flagicon|Malta}} [[Malta]], which also hosted the 2010 Winter Meeting);

Apart from the yearly meeting, national communities have been organising local gatherings at various levels; most notably, the German-speaking community was once hosted at the [[European Central Bank]] headquarters in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in April 2007. The visit was repeated in April 2012, during an international meeting.

== Notes ==
{{note|a}}There was no Winter Meeting in 2017 because the only host that applied to organize the event did it outside of the deadline date.

The '''Exposición Nacional de Minería, Artes Metalúrgicas, Cerámica, Cristalería y Aguas Minerales''' (National Exhibition of Mining, Metallurgical Arts, Ceramics, Glass and Mineral Waters) was an exhibition held in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] in 1883. Situated in the [[Parque del Buen Retiro]] between May and November,&lt;ref name="Díaz1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Díaz|first=Gonzalo Díaz|title=Hombres y Documentos de la Filosofia Española|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7eX6WsVBjUC&amp;pg=PA411|accessdate=18 September 2012|year=1988|publisher=CSIC-Dpto. de Publicaciones|isbn=978-84-00-06703-8|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was presided over by King [[Alfonso XII]] of Spain and his wife Queen [[Maria Christina of Austria]]. Several countries participated.

==History==
The idea for the contest came in 1880 from the Spanish press, driven by the then Minister for Development, [[José Luis Albareda y Sezde]], and aimed to promote and publicize the Spanish mining industry both within the country and abroad. Enacted in 1882, it was arranged by [[Luis de la Escosura y Morrogh]], chief of the National Corporation of Mines, and his team.&lt;ref name="Engineers1884" /&gt; Machinery exhibitors had until February 15, 1882 to apply for space, while specialized machinery exhibitors had an October 31 deadline. All non-machinery exhibitors had until November 30 to submit applications for main gallery space. Exhibition articles included machinery, tools, and utensils. These were the types used for mining, metallurgy, manufacture of glass ware, pottery, and utilization of mineral waters. There was no charge for space; water requirements for hydraulic and steam engines was also free for smaller machines. Transportation and passage of goods in bond for the exhibition received "liberal arrangements" through [[customs]].&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican1882"&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientific American |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYI9AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA352|accessdate=18 September 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1882|publisher=Scientific American, Incorporated|pages=352–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official opening was scheduled for April 1, 1883, but because of the storms that delayed completion of the venue, it had to be postponed to May 30, when it was opened by the Kings of Spain and Portugal, [[Luís I of Portugal|Luís I]].&lt;ref name="Engineers1884"&gt;{{cite book|title=Transactions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p499AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA46|accessdate=18 September 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1884|publisher=North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Industry, [[Germán Gamazo]], gave an opening speech.&lt;ref name="Engineers1884" /&gt; Belgium, England, France, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and Spain participated in the event.&lt;ref name="Engineers1884" /&gt; Attendees included Franco-Belgian companies, Ibarra and Orconera (Bilbao), the Hullera Company (Bélmez), the Artillery Corps in Spain, the Humboldt Company, the [[Royal Company Asturian Mines]], and [[Rio Tinto Mines]] (Huelva). The Sociedad de Santander y Quirós published a work in 1883 documenting the event.&lt;ref name="Quirós1883"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sociedad de Santander y Quirós|title=Exposición Nacional de Minería Madrid 1883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBYuQwAACAAJ|accessdate=18 September 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1883|publisher=Gregorio Estrada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grounds and facilities==
The exhibition was held in an area of {{convert|9000|m}} in the Parque del Buen Retiro. The project was led by the mining engineer [[Enrique Nouvion]]. The exhibition was clustered in one area, enclosed with a wooden fence, surrounded by trees and vegetation, and stood in the center of the main pavilion.  The main pavilion was separated by an avenue lined with large ceramic frogs, leading to a lake fed by a river. The lake emptied into a rockery with a cascade, and on it was built the Royal Pavilion. A second smaller lake led through another large lake, closing the circuit. The weather conditions were a major inconvenience, and the different pavilions were built under snow, rain and wind, to the point that the exhibition was closed during the summer months to finish the work and reopened on 8 September. Most of the facilities built for the event were demolished at the end of the show, except the Royal Pavilion, which was demolished in the twentieth century, and the [[Palacio de Velázquez]], which is the only building that remains today. The Development Minister commissioned architect [[Ricardo Velázquez Bosco]] to build the main pavilion, later known as the Palacio de Velázquez;&lt;ref name="Gómez2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gómez|first=Luis Ángel Sánchez|title=Un imperio en la vitrina: El colonialismo español en el Pacífico y la Exposición de Filipinas de 1887|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhAVmkRxoA0C&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=18 September 2012|year=2003|publisher=CSIC-Dpto. de Publicaciones|isbn=978-84-00-08190-4|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; his team included engineer [[Alberto Palacio]] and ceramist tile maker [[Daniel Zuloaga]], who through the [[Real Fábrica de La Moncloa]], handled the palace's decoration.&lt;ref name="Jorrín1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorrín|first=Emilio|title=Efemerides Matritenses, 852-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjAsAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 September 2012|year=1992|publisher=Avapiés|isbn=978-84-86280-59-8|page=68|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Mary-Ann|title=Frommer's Madrid Day By Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNN7MtIMhkEC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=21 October 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-97258-7|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
===Boundaries===
[[File:Macdougal Street and Minetta Lane street scene NYC.jpg|thumb|left|[[MacDougal Street]] in Greenwich Village]]
The neighborhood is bordered by [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] to the east, the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] (part of the [[Hudson River]]) to the west, [[Houston Street]] to the south, and [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] to the north,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and roughly centered on [[Washington Square Park]] and [[New York University]]. The neighborhoods surrounding it are the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] and [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]] to the east, [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] and [[Hudson Square]] to the south, and [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] and [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] to the north. The East Village was formerly considered part of the [[Lower East Side]] and has never been considered a part of Greenwich Village.&lt;ref name=EV&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD6123FF932A35752C0A963958260 F.Y.I.], "When did the East Village become the East Village and stop being part of the Lower East Side?", Jesse McKinley, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 1, 1995. Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The western part of Greenwich Village is known as the [[West Village, Manhattan|West Village]]; the dividing line of its eastern border is debated. Some{{who|date=November 2017}} believe it starts at [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] and its southern extension, a border to the west of which the neighborhood changes substantially in character and becomes heavily residential. Others{{who|date=November 2017}} say the West Village starts one avenue further east at [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], where the east-west streets in the city's grid plan start to orient themselves on an angle to the traditionally perpendicular grid plan occupying most of Manhattan. The Far West Village is another sub-neighborhood of Greenwich Village that is bordered on its west by the Hudson River and on its east by [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Street]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Greenwich Village is located in [[New York's 10th congressional district]], New York's 25th State Senate district, New York's 66th State Assembly district, and New York City Council's 3rd district.

Into the early 20th century, Greenwich Village was distinguished from the upper-class neighborhood of Washington Square{{spaced ndash}}based on the major landmark [[Washington Square Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|url=http://www.gvshp.org/history.htm|title=Village History|accessdate=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold 1988, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; or Empire Ward&lt;ref name="Johns Hopkins University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Luther S.|title=Around Washington Square: An Illustrated History of Greenwich Village|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2003|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7341-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century.

''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'''s 1956 article on "New York (City)" (subheading "Greenwich Village") states that the southern border of the Village is [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]], reflecting an earlier understanding. The newer district of SoHo has since encroached on this border.

As Greenwich Village was once a rural, isolated [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] to the north of the 17th century European settlement on [[Manhattan Island]], its street layout is more organic than the planned grid pattern of the 19th century [[grid plan]] (based on the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]]). Greenwich Village was allowed to keep the 18th century street pattern of what is now called the West Village: areas that were already built up when the plan was implemented, west of what is now [[Greenwich Avenue]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], resulted in a neighborhood whose streets are dramatically different, in layout, from the ordered structure of the newer parts of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=fny199909&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/1999/09/greenwich-village-necrology/|title=The Street Necrology of Greenwich Village|date=November 1999|website=[[Forgotten NY]]|author=Walsh, Kevin|accessdate=August 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the neighborhood's streets are narrow and some curve at odd angles. This is generally regarded as adding to both the historic character and charm of the neighborhood. In addition, as the meandering [[Greenwich Street]] used to be on the [[Hudson River]] shoreline, much of the neighborhood west of Greenwich Street is on landfill, but still follows the older street grid.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt; When Sixth and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]]s were built in the early 20th century, they were built diagonally to the existing street plan, and many older, smaller streets had to be demolished.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt;

Unlike the streets of most of Manhattan above Houston Street, streets in the Village typically are named rather than numbered. While some of the formerly named streets (including Factory, Herring and Amity Streets) are now numbered, they still do not always conform to the usual grid pattern when they enter the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt; For example, [[4th Street (Manhattan)|West 4th Street]] runs east-west across most of Manhattan, but runs north-south in Greenwich Village, causing it to intersect with West 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets before ending at West 13th Street.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt;

A large section of Greenwich Village, made up of more than 50 northern and western blocks in the area up to 14th Street, is part of a Historic District established by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]. The District's convoluted borders run no farther south than 4th Street or St. Luke's Place, and no farther east than Washington Square East or University Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/maps/maps_manh.shtml |title=Landmark Maps: Historic District Maps: Manhattan |publisher=Nyc.gov |accessdate=September 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909211747/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/maps/maps_manh.shtml |archivedate=September 9, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redevelopment in that area is severely restricted, and developers must preserve the main façade and aesthetics of the buildings during renovation.

Most of the buildings of Greenwich Village are mid-rise apartments, 19th century row houses, and the occasional one-family walk-up, a sharp contrast to the high-rise landscape in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and [[Downtown Manhattan]].

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Greenwich Village map circa 1760 - Project Gutenberg eText 16907.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of old Greenwich Village. A section of [[Bernard Ratzer]]'s map of New York and its suburbs, made ca. 1766 for [[Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet|Henry Moore]], Royal Governor of New York, when Greenwich was more than two miles (3 km) from the city.]]
In the 16th century, Native Americans referred to its farthest northwest corner, by the cove on the Hudson River at present-day Gansevoort Street, as Sapokanikan ("tobacco field"). The land was cleared and turned into pasture by Dutch and [[Freedman|freed African]] settlers in the 1630s, who named their settlement Noortwyck ("North district", equivalent to Northwich/Northwick). In the 1630s, Governor [[Wouter van Twiller]] farmed tobacco on {{convert|200|acre|km2}} here at his "Farm in the Woods".&lt;ref&gt;Gold 1988, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The English conquered the Dutch settlement of [[New Netherland]] in 1664, and Greenwich Village developed as a hamlet separate from the larger New York City to the south on land that would eventually become the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. In 1644, the eleven Dutch African settlers were freed after the first black legal protest in America.{{efn|The eleven freed blacks were Paul d'Angola, Big Manuel, Little Manuel, Manuel de Gerrit de Rens, Simon Congo, Anthony Portuguese.

The earliest known reference to the village's name as "Greenwich" dates back to 1696, in the will of Yellis Mandeville of Greenwich; however, the village was not mentioned in the city records until 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=I.N.

In 1822, a [[yellow fever]] epidemic in New York encouraged residents to flee to the healthier air of Greenwich Village, and afterwards many stayed. The future site of [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] was a [[potter's field]] from 1797 to 1823 when up to 20,000 of New York's poor were buried here, and still remain. The handsome Greek revival rowhouses on the north side of Washington Square were built about 1832, establishing the fashion of Washington Square and lower Fifth Avenue for decades to come. Well into the 19th century, the district of Washington Square was considered separate from Greenwich Village.

Greenwich Village historically was known as an important landmark on the map of American [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture in the early and mid-20th century. The neighborhood was known for its colorful, artistic residents and the alternative culture they propagated. Due in part to the progressive attitudes of many of its residents, the Village was a focal point of new movements and ideas, whether political, artistic, or cultural. This tradition as an enclave of [[avant-garde]] and [[alternative culture]] was established during the 19th century and continued into the 20th century, when small presses, art galleries, and experimental theater thrived.

The [[Tenth Street Studio Building]] was situated at 51 West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, the building was commissioned by James Boorman Johnston{{efn|James Boorman Johnston (1822–1887) was a son of the prominent Scottish-born New York merchant John Johnston, in partnership with James Boorman (1783–1866) as Boorman &amp; Johnston, developers of [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square North]], and a founder of [[New York University]]; a group portrait of the Johnston Children 1831, is at the [[Museum of the City of New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnston Children: John Taylor Johnston (1820-1893), James Boorman Johnston (1822-1887), Margaret Taylor Johnston (1825-1875), and Emily Proudfoot Johnston (1827-1831), (painting) |url=https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!43361!0 |publisher=SIRIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and designed by [[Richard Morris Hunt]]. Its innovative design soon represented a national architectural prototype, and featured a domed central gallery, from which interconnected rooms radiated. Hunt's studio within the building housed the first architectural school in the United States. Soon after its completion in 1857, the building helped to make Greenwich Village central to the arts in New York City, drawing artists from all over the country to work, exhibit, and sell their art.

From the late 19th century until the present, the Hotel Albert has served as a cultural icon of Greenwich Village. Opened during the 1880s and originally located at 11th Street and University Place, called the Hotel St. Stephan and then after 1902, called the Hotel Albert while under the ownership of William Ryder, it served as a meeting place, restaurant and dwelling for several important artists and writers from the late 19th century well into the 20th century. After 1902, the owner's brother [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] lived and painted there. Some other noted guests who lived there include: [[Augustus St. Gaudens]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Hart Crane]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Anaïs Nin]], [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Horton Foote]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehotelalbert.com/history.html|title=Hotel Albert history|publisher=Thehotelalbert.com|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher.

In 1924, the [[Cherry Lane Theatre]] was established. Located at 38 Commerce Street, it is New York City's oldest continuously running [[Off-Broadway]] theater. A landmark in Greenwich Village's cultural landscape, it was built as a farm silo in 1817, and also served as a tobacco warehouse and box factory before [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and other members of the [[Provincetown Players]] converted the structure into a theatre they christened the Cherry Lane Playhouse, which opened on March 24, 1924, with the play ''The Man Who Ate the Popomack''. During the 1940s [[The Living Theatre]], [[Theatre of the Absurd]], and the Downtown Theater movement all took root there, and it developed a reputation as a showcase for aspiring [[playwright]]s and emerging voices.

In one of the many Manhattan properties that [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]] and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the ''Whitney Studio Club'' at 8 West 8th Street in 1914, as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works. By the 1930s it had evolved into her greatest legacy, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], on the site of today's [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]]. The Whitney was founded in 1931, as an answer to the [[Museum of Modern Art]], founded 1928, and its collection of mostly European [[modernism]] and its neglect of [[United States|American Art]]. Gertrude Whitney decided to put the time and money into the museum after the New York [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] turned down her offer to contribute her twenty-five-year collection of [[modern art]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Avis|title=Rebels on Eighth Street: Juliana Force and the Whitney Museum of American Art|publisher=Atheneum|year=1990|place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the renowned [[Abstract Expressionist]] artist and teacher [[Hans Hofmann]] moved his [[art school]] from E. 57th Street to 52 West 9th Street.

Café Society showcased [[African American]] talent and was intended to be an American version of the political [[cabaret]]s that Josephson had seen in Europe before [[World War I]].

The Village again became important to the bohemian scene during the 1950s, when the [[Beat Generation]] focused their energies there. Fleeing from what they saw as oppressive social conformity, a loose collection of writers, poets, artists, and students (later known as the [[Beat generation|Beats]]) and the [[Beatniks]], moved to Greenwich Village, and to [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] in [[San Francisco]], in many ways creating the east-coast and west-coast predecessors respectively to the [[Haight-Ashbury]]-[[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Hippy|hippie scene]] of the next decade. The Village (and surrounding New York City) would later play central roles in the writings of, among others, [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Dylan Thomas]], who collapsed at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] and died at [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincents Hospital]] at 170 West 12th Street, in the Village after drinking at the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] on November 5, 1953.

[[Off-Off-Broadway]] began in Greenwich Village in 1958 as a reaction to [[Off Broadway]], and a "complete rejection of commercial theatre".&lt;ref&gt;Viagas (2004, p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first venues for what would soon be called "Off-Off-Broadway" (a term supposedly coined by [[critic]] Jerry Tallmer of the ''[[Village Voice]]'') were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the [[Caffe Cino]] at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric [[Joe Cino]], who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. Also integral to the rise of Off-Off-Broadway were [[Ellen Stewart]] at [[La MaMa, E.T.C.|La MaMa]], originally located at 321 E. 9th Street, and [[Al Carmines]] at the Judson Poets' Theater, located at [[Judson Memorial Church]] on the south side of [[Washington Square Park]].

[[File:Blue Note Jazz Club, New York City.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Note Jazz Club]]]]
The Village had a cutting-edge cabaret and music scene. ''[[The Village Gate]]'', the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'', and ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]]'' (since 1981), regularly hosted some of the biggest names in [[jazz]]. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the [[American folk music revival|folk music scene]] of the 1960s. Music clubs included ''[[Gerde's Folk City]]'', ''[[The Bitter End]],'' ''[[Cafe Au Go Go]]'', ''[[Cafe Wha?]]'', ''[[The Gaslight Cafe]]'' and ''[[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]]''. Three of the four members of [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]] met there. Guitarist and folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]] lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon [[Bob Dylan]] by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring [[folk rock]] movement in [[San Francisco]] and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, including [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Bette Midler]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[James Taylor]], [[Eric Andersen]], [[Joan Baez]], [[the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]], [[the Velvet Underground]], [[the Kingston Trio]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Janis Ian]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Laura Nyro]], and [[Nina Simone]]. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of [[Jane Jacobs]]'s book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'', which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common [[urban renewal]] policies of the time.

Founded by New York-based artist [[Mercedes Matter]] and her students, the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]] is an art school formed in the mid-1960s in the Village.

Greenwich Village was home to a safe house used by the radical [[anti-war movement]] known as the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. On March 6, 1970, their safehouse was destroyed when an explosive device that they were constructing was accidentally detonated, killing three of their members ([[Ted Gold]], [[Terry Robbins]], and [[Diana Oughton]]).

The Village has been a center for movements that challenged the wider American culture, for example, its role in the [[gay liberation]] movement. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community|gay community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], 53 [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]]. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Park Service|title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562|url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm|publisher=US Dept. of Interior|year=2008|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html|title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530065722/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html|archivedate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] on the basis of its status in LGBT history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|title=NYC grants landmark status to gay rights movement building|author=Associated Press|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201003/http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 24, 2016, the [[Stonewall National Monument]] was named the first [[List of U.S. National Monuments|U.S. National Monument]] dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/nyregion/stonewall-inn-named-national-monument-a-first-for-gay-rights-movement.html|title=Stonewall Inn Named National Monument, a First for the Gay Rights Movement|author=Eli Rosenberg|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwich Village contains the world's oldest gay and lesbian bookstore, [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop]], founded in 1967, while The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center – best known as simply "The Center" – has occupied the former Food &amp; Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street since 1984. In 2006, the Village was the scene of [[2006 Greenwich Village assault case|an assault involving seven lesbians and a straight man]] that sparked appreciable media attention, with strong statements defending both sides of the case.

Nevertheless, residents of Greenwich Village still possess a strong community identity and are proud of their neighborhood's unique history and fame, and its well-known liberal live-and-let-live attitudes.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Historically, local residents and preservation groups have been concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve its architectural and historic integrity. In the 1960s, [[Margot Gayle]] led a group of citizens to preserve the [[Jefferson Market Courthouse]] (later reused as Jefferson Market Library)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/nyregion/30gayle.html|work=The New York Times|title=Margot Gayle, Urban Preservationist and Crusader With Style, Dies at 100|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/washingtonsquarepark/highlights/9763|author=NYC Dept. of Parks and Recreation|title=Shirley Hayes and the Preservation of Washington Square Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jane Jacobs]], using the Village as an example of a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.

Since then, preservation has been a part of the Village ethos. Shortly after the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was established in 1965, it acted to protect parts of Greenwich Village, designating the small [[Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District]] in 1966, which contains the city's largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses, and the even smaller [[MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District]] in 1967, a group of 22 houses sharing a common back garden, built in the Greek Revival style and later renovated with Colonial Revival façades. In 1969, the LPC designated the Greenwich Village Historic District — for four decades, the city's largest — despite preservationists' advocacy for the entire neighborhood to be designated an historic district. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s.

====Rezoned areas====
[[File:Jefferson market.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Jefferson Market Library]], once a courthouse, now serves as a branch of the [[New York Public Library]].]]
The [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP), a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the architectural and cultural character and heritage of the neighborhood, successfully proposed new districts and individual landmarks to the LPC. Those include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/index.htm|author=The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|title=Preservation|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gansevoort Market Historic District was the first new historic district in Greenwich Village in 34 years. The 112 buildings on 11 blocks protect the city's distinctive [[Meatpacking District]] with its cobblestone streets, warehouses and rowhouses. About 70 percent of the area proposed by GVSHP in 2000 was designated a historic district by the LPC in 2003, while the entire area was listed on the State and National Registers of Historic Places in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/nyregion/11GANS.html|author=The New York Times|title=Blood on the Street, and it's Chic|accessdate=March 4, 2014|date=September 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_33/gansevoorthistoric.html|author=The Villager|title=Gansevoort Historic District Gets Final Approval From City|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Weehawken Street|Weehawken Street Historic District]], designated in 2006, is a 14-building, three-block district near the Hudson River centering on tiny Weehawken Street and containing an array of architecture including a sailors' hotel, former stables, and a wooden house.&lt;ref name=weehawk&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2006/05/village-historic-district-extension/|author=The Observer|title=Village Historic District Extension|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Greenwich Village Historic District Extension I, designated in 2006, brought 46 more buildings on three blocks into the district, thus protecting warehouses, a former public school and police station, and early 19th century rowhouses. Both the Weehawken Street Historic District and the Greenwich Village Historic District Extension I were designated by the LPC in response to the larger proposal for a Far West Village Historic District submitted by GVSHP in 2004.&lt;ref name=weehawk/&gt;
* Greenwich Village Historic District Extension II, designated in 2010, embracing 225 buildings on 12 blocks, contains 19th century houses, 19th and 20th century tenements, and a variety of cultural landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/panel-enlarges-landmark-zone-and-cites-2-bronx-sites/?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults%230&amp;version=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry302%23%2Fgreenwich%2Bvillage%2Bhistoric%2Bdistrict%2Ffrom20100101to20101231%2F|work=The New York Times|title=Panel Enlarges Landmark Zone and Cites 2 Bronx Sites|accessdate=March 4, 2014|date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[South Village|South Village Historic District]], designated in 2013, covers 235 buildings on 13 blocks, representing the largest single expansion of landmark protections in Greenwich Village since 1969. It includes well-preserved and renovated 19th century houses, colorful tenements, and a variety of sites important to the area's rich immigrant, artistic, and Italian-American history, as well as several low-rise, historically significant New York University buildings on Washington Square South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thevillager.com/2013/12/19/positively-south-village-l-p-c-votes-to-expand-historic-district/|author=The Villager|title=Positively South Village: LPC Votes to Expand Historic District|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Landmarks Preservation Commission designated as landmarks several individual sites proposed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, including the former Bell Telephone Labs Complex (1861-1933), now [[Westbeth Artists Community|Westbeth Artists' Housing]], designated in 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_445/citydubs.html|author=The Villager|title=City Dubs Westbeth a Landmark|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University Village (Manhattan)|Silver Towers/University Village Complex]] (1967), designed by [[I.M.

Several contextual rezonings were enacted in Greenwich Village in recent years to limit the size and height of allowable new development in the neighborhood, and to encourage the preservation of existing buildings. The following were proposed by the GVSHP and passed by the [[New York City Department of City Planning|City Planning Commission]]:
* Far West Village Rezoning, approved in 2005, was the first downzoning in Manhattan in many years, putting in place new height caps, thus ending construction of high-rise waterfront towers in much of the Village and encouraging the reuse of existing buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/city-landmarks-looking-to-rezone-part-of-west/13921/|title=City, Landmarks Looking to Rezone Part of West Village|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washington and Greenwich Street Rezoning, approved in 2010, was passed in near-record time to protect six blocks from out-of-scale hotel development and maintain the low-rise character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20101027/REAL_ESTATE/101029881#|work=crainsnewyork.com|title=Council Approves 2 Village Rezonings|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, as part of a multi-stakeholder Community Task Force on NYU Development, the university agreed to a set of "Planning Principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arenson|first1=Karen|title=NYU Offers An Accord on Growth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/nyregion/30nyu.html|accessdate=August 8, 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet advocates did not find NYU to follow the principles in practice, culminating in a successful lawsuit against the university's "NYU 2031" plan for expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bagli|first1=Charles|title=Judge Blocks Part of NYU's Plan for Four Towers in Greenwich Village|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/nyregion/judge-blocks-part-of-nyus-plan-for-four-towers-in-greenwich-village.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar|accessdate=August 8, 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of interest==
Greenwich Village includes several collegiate institutions. Since the 1830s, [[New York University]] (NYU) has had a campus there. In 1973 NYU moved its campus in the [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] section of the [[West Bronx]] to Greenwich Village. In 1976 [[Yeshiva University]] established the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] in the northern part of Greenwich Village. In the 1980s [[Hebrew Union College]] was built in Greenwich Village. [[The New School]], with its [[Parsons The New School for Design]], a division of The New School, and the School's Graduate School expanded in the 2000s, with the renovated, award-winning design of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center at 66 Fifth Avenue on 13th Street. The [[Cooper Union]] is located in Greenwich Village, at [[Astor Place]], near [[St. Mark's Place]] on the border of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. [[Pratt Institute]] established its latest Manhattan campus in an [[adaptive reuse|adaptively reused]] [[Arnold Brunner|Brunner &amp; Tryon]]-designed loft building on 14th Street, east of Seventh Avenue. The university campus building expansion was followed by a [[gentrification]] process in the 1980s.
[[File:ChristopherPark3358.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Christopher Park, part of the [[Stonewall National Monument]]&lt;ref name=StonewallNationalMonument1/&gt;]]
The historic [[Washington Square Park]] is the center and heart of the neighborhood. Additionally, the Village has several other, smaller parks: Christopher, Father Fagan, Minetta Triangle, Petrosino Square, Little Red Square, and Time Landscape. There are also city playgrounds, including [[DeSalvio Playground]], Minetta, [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]], Bleecker Street, Downing Street, Mercer Street, Cpl. John A. Seravelli, and William Passannante Ballfield. Perhaps the most famous, though, is "The Cage", officially known as the [[West Fourth Street Courts]]. Sitting atop the [[West Fourth Street – Washington Square (New York City Subway)|West Fourth Street – Washington Square]] subway station ({{NYCS West 4th}} trains) at Sixth Avenue, the courts are easily accessible to [[basketball]] and [[American handball]] players from all over New York. The Cage has become one of the most important tournament sites for the citywide "[[Streetball]]" amateur basketball tournament. Since 1975, New York University's art collection has been housed at the [[Grey Art Gallery]] bordering Washington Square Park, at 100 Washington Square East. The Grey Art Gallery is notable for its museum-quality exhibitions of contemporary art.

The Village has a bustling performing arts scene. It is home to many [[Off Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters; for instance, ''[[Blue Man Group]]'' has taken up residence in the Astor Place Theater. ''[[The Village Gate]]'' (until 1992), the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'' and ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]]'' are still presenting some of the biggest names in [[jazz]] on a regular basis. Other music clubs include ''[[The Bitter End]],'' and ''[[Lion's Den (nightclub)|Lion's Den]]''. The village has its own orchestra aptly named the ''[[Greenwich Village Orchestra]]''. Comedy clubs dot the Village as well, including ''[[Comedy Cellar]]'', where many American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] comedians got their start.

Several publications have offices in the Village, most notably the citywide newsweekly ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and the monthly magazines ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. The [[National Audubon Society]], having relocated its national headquarters from a mansion in [[Carnegie Hill]] to a restored and very [[green building|green]], former industrial building in [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], relocated to smaller but even greener [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified digs at 225 Varick Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/realestate/06sqft.html|work=The New York Times|title=Audubon's New Home Brings the Outdoors In|first=Claire|last=Wilson|date=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Houston Street near the [[Film Forum]].

==Education==
Greenwich Village residents are zoned to two elementary schools: PS 3, Melser Charrette School, and [[PS 41]], Greenwich Village School. Residents are zoned to Baruch Middle School 104.

"'''He's Bla-ack!'''" is the twentieth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 12)|twelfth season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]'' and the 230th episode overall. It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 11, 2014, and is written by Julius Sharpe and directed by Steve Robertson. The episode features the return of [[Cleveland Brown]] after his [[The Cleveland Show|spin-off]] was axed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy-2014/episode-20-season-12/hes-bla-ack/100148 |title=Family Guy Episode Guide 2014 Season 12 - He's Bla-ack!, Episode 20 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Cleveland and his family return to Quahog. However, his and Peter's friendship is on a knife edge when their wives argue about parenting.

==Plot==
Joe is bragging to the gang about his sexual exploits with Bonnie when Cleveland returns to Quahog and shows up at the Drunken Clam. Cleveland takes some good-natured ribbing over ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' and its many faults, including the show's logo looking like a penis, the show (which has an African-American main cast) being written by white writers, [[Tim the Bear]] not being funny and having [[Seth MacFarlane|his voice actor]] replaced after [[The Cleveland Show (season 2)|season 2]], and the show losing to ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' in the ratings. Peter then gives Cleveland some ''Family Guy'' DVDs to bring him up to speed on what happened during his absence, adding that unlike ''The Cleveland Show'', the ''Family Guy'' DVDs contain jokes (Cleveland admits, however, that he doesn't own a [[DVD player]]). During the theme song, Cleveland appears and ends up taking Mort's place in the theme song while Mort heads home.

As Cleveland and Cleveland Jr. move back into their old house and Donna, Roberta, and Rallo move in there with them, Cleveland discovers it has been wrecked due to all of the past residents like [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Chevy Chase]] (as seen in "[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]"), [[Ryan Reynolds]] (as seen in "[[Stewie Goes for a Drive]]"), and its having once been used as an orphanage. After getting things fixed, the Brown family proceeds with moving in, cleaning up and sorting things. Rallo tries to make friends with Stewie, but Stewie blows him off, calling him a ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|Boondocks]]'' rip-off. Chris breaks a vase that belonged to Donna's great-grandmother over Rallo's head. As a result, Donna spanks him, which enrages Lois, who confronts Donna after finding out. Donna accuses Lois of being a bad parent while Lois accuses her of being a child abuser for hitting her son. They refuse to have anything to do with each other, forbidding their husbands from socializing with each other as well.

At the Drunken Clam, Joe plans for Susie's first birthday party as Cleveland walks in. Cleveland and Peter try to decide who must leave, and they decide to find a place where they can hang out without being discovered. They first try meeting on a commercial airline flight, and then later Peter poses as a [[police officer]] and pulls Cleveland over so they can talk. To make it look real, Peter beats up Cleveland while receiving some assistance from Joe. Both Peter and Cleveland are caught and punished by their wives. Lois makes Peter sleep on the couch while Donna spanks Cleveland. As Chris finds Peter on the couch trying to sleep later that night, he suggests they find a way to get the wives together. Peter then initiates a conversation with Cleveland across the street using a flashlight and [[Morse code]]. Peter subsequently implements various crazy plans in an attempt to get their wives to reconcile (getting Cleveland injured in a car crash, having [[Child pornography|nude photographs of children]] exhibited at an art gallery, and burning an [[eagle]] with cigarettes), without success.

At Susie's birthday party, they prepare for the three-legged race. While Lois wants to be Peter's partner, he really wants to be Cleveland's partner and refuses with finality. They both defy their wives and enter together. But when Peter trips and is hurt, Cleveland tries to carry Peter, but settles for hugging and rolling. As the wives look on, they agree to be friends for their husbands' sake. As Peter and Cleveland continue their rolling, they come in second place to two one-legged people who tied themselves together to form one body. Peter and Cleveland celebrate being friends at the Drunken Clam and once again rag on him for ''The Cleveland Show''.

==Reception==
Eric Thurm of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B–, saying "The deficits of 'He's Bla-ack!' are not small, but they're slightly easier to overlook getting caught up in the very sitcom-like pleasantness of just hanging out with Cleveland again in a non-''Cleveland Show'' setting. The cheesy flashback montage of bro moments between Cleveland and Peter (which I am pretty sure was of actual clips from earlier episodes) was just as cynical as everything else ''Family Guy'' does these days, but it was also effective at what it was trying to do. Cleveland and Peter may never be this close again in any given episode, but it's nice to have him back anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurm |first=Eric |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/family-guy-hes-bla-ack-204526 |title=Family Guy: “He's Bla-ack!” |publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received a 2.1 rating in the 18-49 years old demographic and was watched by a total of 4.16 million people. This made it the most watched show on [[Animation Domination]] that night, beating ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/13/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-american-dad-revenge-cosmos-dateline-adjusted-down/263313/ |title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘Once Upon a Time’, ‘American Dad’ &amp; ‘America’s Funniest Home Videos’ Adjusted Up; ‘Revenge’, ‘Cosmos’ &amp; ‘Dateline’ Adjusted Down |publisher=TVbytheNumbers |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''This article is about the history of ethnic Jews and political radicalism. For the antisemitic canard, see [[Jewish Bolshevism]].''

The historical contribution of Jews to the political Left has been well documented. Both as individual theorists and activists of the stature of [[Karl Marx]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Léon Blum]] and [[Emma Goldman]], and as organised mass labour movements in, for example, revolutionary Russia and early-mid twentieth century Warsaw, Amsterdam, Paris, Toronto, New York and London, Jews have been conspicuous for their socialist and communist affiliations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Historical analysis of the dynamics of this Jewish/Left alliance, however, has been far less conclusive. Considerable dissonance exists, for example, concerning the factors which attracted Jews to the Left, the extent to which leading Jewish Left activists were originally motivated by or subsequently influenced by explicitly Jewish concerns, and the degree to which one can reasonably speak of a specific or unique Jewish contribution to the international Left. In addition, discussion of these factors has often been inhibited by concerns regarding the use of the alleged Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy by the Nazis and other anti-Semitic groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==History==

According to Paul Johnson, Jewish society in the last 1,500 years has been designed to produce and support intellectuals who largely focused their talents on rabbinical studies.  Johnson asserts that "quite suddenly, around the year 1800, this ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals began to shift its output. Instead of pouring all its products into the closed circuit of rabbinical studies, . . . it unleashed a significant and ever-growing proportion of them into secular life. This was an event of shattering importance in world history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Jews |first=Paul |last=Johnson |year=1988 |pages=340–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution|French Revolution of 1789]] promised equality, freedom, and an end to discrimination for all including the Jews. The subsequent political emancipation of the Jews in most of Western and Central Europe provoked an anti-modern and specifically anti-Jewish backlash from traditional conservative groupings. In response, Jews allied themselves with the modern liberalist forces, and played an important role in the 1848 European revolutions which sought to entrench the gains of liberalism. However, the ensuing failure of liberalism to protect Jewish rights led many Jews to seek new allies within the growing working-class movement. The international character of the socialist movement seemingly offered Jews protection from old religious and national hatreds. Thus in contrast to most other national groups, Jews had a double reason to join the proletarian revolution. They were discriminated against both on class grounds and on racial grounds.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Not surprisingly, many Jews made a rational decision to join a movement which promised to defend and extend the equal rights granted by the French Revolution. The prominence of Jews in the Left can, therefore, be attributed to reasons of self-interest as much as to any idealistic motivation. Equally, the subsequent decline of Jewish involvement in the Left can be attributed to relatively objective factors such as the creation of the State of Israel which transformed Jewish dependence from international to national forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==20th century==
Many young Jews rejected the Orthodoxy of their parents and turned to the great Jewish secular movements of [[Zionism]], [[socialism]], and [[Bundism]] [a Jewish labor movement founded in Eastern Europe in the 19th century]. They viewed their parents' faith in the eventual coming of the Messiah as a dangerous passivity in the face of imminent danger to the Jewish people. They took their fate into their own hands and created new forms of secular Jewish messianic activity. Their concern for changing the world by rejecting their religious background shows how deeply they were immersed in the Jewish search for redemption.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Jewish Bolshevism===
A persistent theme among critics of Jews—particularly those on the pre-World War II right—has been that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution was a Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews. This theme appears in a wide range of writings, from Henry Ford's [[The International Jew|International Jew]], to published statements by a long list of British, French, and American political figures in the 1920s (Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[David Lloyd George]]), and, in its most extreme form, by [[Adolf Hitler]], who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now begins the last great revolution. By wresting political power for himself, the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise he still wears. The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew and the tyrant of peoples. In a few years he will try to exterminate the national pillars of intelligence and, by robbing the peoples of their natural spiritual leadership, will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a permanent subjugation. The most terrible example of this is Russia."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''lead paragraph''' (sometimes shortened to '''lead'''; also spelled '''lede''') is the opening [[paragraph]] of an article, essay, book chapter, or other written work that summarizes its main ideas.&lt;ref name=mavensword20001128/&gt;

==Types of leads==
[[News style#Lead|Journalistic leads]] emphasize grabbing the attention of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peha &amp; Lester |title=Be a Writer: Your Guide to the Writing Life!: Proven Tips and Powerful Techniques to Help Young Writers Get Started |page=125 |publisher=Leverage Factory |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFMagLZx2vIC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=lede+newspaper&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=swajR-7mHI3azATIk7DzCA&amp;sig=01ouafTz7WfhQLt1up7epCRZ1JU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In journalism, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the first paragraph is sometimes called "burying the lead". Most standard news leads include brief answers to the questions of [[5 Ws|who, what, why, when, where, and how]] the key event in the story took place. In newspaper writing, the first paragraph that summarizes or introduces the story is also called the "blurb paragraph", "teaser text" or, in the United Kingdom, the "standfirst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spark |first1=David |last2=Harris |first2=Geoffrey |title=Practical Newspaper Reporting |date=2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=9781473903340 |pages=89, 90, 94, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leads in essays summarize the outline of the argument and conclusion that follows in the main body of the essay. [[Encyclopedia]] leads tend to define the subject matter as well as emphasize the interesting points of the article. [[feature story|Features]] and general articles in [[magazine]]s tend to be somewhere between journalistic and encyclopedian in style and often lack a distinct lead paragraph entirely. Leads and [[book]] [[foreword]]s vary enormously in length, intent and content.

==Other introductions==
In [[journalism]], there is the concept of an introductory or summary line or brief paragraph, located immediately above or below the headline, and typographically distinct from the body of the article.&lt;ref name=Standfirst&gt;{{cite web|title=Standfirst|url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/standfirst/|work=[[Double-Tongued Dictionary]]|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be referred with a variety of terms, including: the ''standfirst'' (UK),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''rider'',{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ''kicker'' (US),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''bank head(line)'', ''deck'', ''dek'', or ''subhead'' (US).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} (See {{slink|News style|Terms and structure}}.)

==Spelling==
The term is sometimes spelled "lede",&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lede |title=Lede |work=Merriam-Webster Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |location=Chicago, IL, US |date=2012|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a claim it was a historical spelling intended to distinguish it from the [[homograph]] [[lead]], a metal commonly used in typesetting in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=mavensword20001128&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001128 |title=The Mavens' Word of the Day: lede |author="Carol" (author unidentifiable) |work=RandomHouse.com |at="Maven's Word of the Day" blog (defunct as of 2012) |publisher=Random House/Bertelsmann |location=New York |date=November 28, 2000 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219122848/http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001128 |archivedate=19 February 2012 }}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the spelling "lede" first appears in journalism manuals in the [[1980]]s, well after lead typesetting's heyday.&lt;ref name=Owens20110918&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howardowens.com/lede-vs-lead/ |title=lede-vs-lead |author="Owens, Howard" |work=HowardOwens.com |publisher=Owens Press |location=New York |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=2016-06-28 |deadurl=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metz1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Metz|title=Newswriting: from lead to "30"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IxbAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-617514-8|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyons1965"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Martin Lyons|title=Reporting the news: selections from Nieman reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuJZAAAAMAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyde2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Milnor Hyde|title=Newspaper Editing - A Manual for Editors, Copyreaders and Students of Newspaper Desk Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9n381QZO_qYC|date=November 2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4437-2632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl G.

'''M.A.S.K.''' is a [[media franchise]] created by [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]. The main premise revolved around the fight between an underground task force called M.A.S.K. (Mobile Armored Strike Kommand) and a criminal organization called V.E.N.O.M. (Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem). After its initial launch in 1985, the franchise  spawned a variety of products, including four series of [[action figure]]s, an [[animated television series]], [[video games]], comics, and a live-action theatrical film is currently in development by [[Hasbro Studios]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]].&lt;ref name="deadline"/&gt;

==History==
M.A.S.K. was developed by [[Kenner Products]] in 1985, along with an [[animated television series]] to help with [[toy]] merchandising. The animated series debuted the same year and ran for two seasons (1985 to 1986). It focused mostly on toys released during the first two series of the toyline. From 1987 to 1988, Kenner released two additional series of action figures and vehicles. However, these last two series strayed from the original theme of the series of crimefighting and terrorism, focusing instead on a racing theme.

==Action figures (1985–1988)==
{{Main|List of M.A.S.K. toys &amp; characters}}

The M.A.S.K. toyline ran from 1985 to 1988, releasing four official series through those years. Each series featured a group of common vehicles with the ability to transform into armored combat vehicles. Most vehicles came with one or two drivers, and each character had a mask with a certain ability.

==Animated series (1985–1986)==
{{Main|M.A.S.K. (TV series)}}

Debuting in 1985, the M.A.S.K. animated series followed the original premise where M.A.S.K., a law enforcement task force led by Matt Trakker, fought against V.E.N.O.M., a criminal organization led by Miles Mayhem. The series ran for two seasons (from 1985 to 1986) with a total of 75 episodes aired. It was produced by [[DiC|DIC Enterprises, Inc.]]

The animated series was originally [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to local [[Television station|TV stations]] across America.

==Other media==
===Comics===
The first M.A.S.K. comics were three mini-comics produced by [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] that were packaged with the vehicles from the first series of toys in 1985. After the success of the franchise, [[DC Comics]] picked up the rights and produced a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] which appeared in several comic books dated September and November 1985 to launch a four-issue miniseries (December 1985 – March 1986). This was soon followed by another insert in comics dated from June to November 1986 and a regular series that lasted nine issues (February–October 1987).

A selection of the DC strips were reprinted in the UK, by Grandreams in Christmas Annuals (1986 and 1987), which also featured original text stories. [[Fleetway]]'s M.A.S.K. comic magazine, initially published fortnightly before moving to a weekly pattern, featured entirely new plots produced by British writers and artists, in the standard mostly black and white short strip format of British comics. The stories were in their own continuity, not connected to either the cartoon series or DC/Grandreams comics. There was a notable difference in the comics in that Venom knew the identities of M.A.S.K. agents, whereas in the first cartoon series they did not. This weekly title lasted 80 issues before merging with the second incarnation of ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in 1988.

M.A.S.K. was presented at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]] by Hasbro in a convention-exclusive one-shot comic titled ''UNIT-E'' that featured various Hasbro licenses. Written by [[Andy Schmidt]], M.A.S.K. was repackaged therein as a rogue quasi-law enforcement agency battling corruption in [[Detroit]], led by Matt Trakker and four original team members, including a married couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hisstank.com/2011/10/17/unit-e-nycc-2011-exclusive-comic-hasbro-universe-issue-0-10784|title=UNIT-E NYCC Exclusive Comic Hasbro Universe Issue 0|author=Staff|work=hisstank.com|date=October 17, 2011|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the franchise was reintroduced as part of IDW's ''[[Revolution (IDW Publishing)|Revolution]]'' crossover series, with writing by Brandon Easton and artwork by Tony Vargas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/06/23/m-a-s-k-gets-the-comic-treatment-it-deserves-and-stays-true-to-its-japanese-origins/#1fa8b8163b8e|title='M.A.S.K.'

Comic Series To End After 10 Issues|first=Jason|last=Gross|work=agentsofmask.com|date=May 24, 2017|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the series was canceled, the characters from Brandon Easton's M.A.S.K. Comic Series returned later in 2017 as part of IDW's First Strike crossover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idwpublishing.com/product/m-a-s-k-first-strike-1/ |title=''First Strike'' crossover series|publisher=IDW Publishing|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; series, featured in both a one-shot issue and a six issue mini-series.

===Video games===
[[File:Venom Strikes Back Screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot from the [[Commodore 64]] version of ''M.A.S.K. III: Venom Strikes Back'']]
Beginning in 1987, British software house [[Gremlin Graphics]] released a trilogy of computer games based on the M.A.S.K. franchise for various eight-bit computer formats.

The first game, ''MASK I'', was a vertically-viewed 2D game in which the player controls the Thunderhawk vehicle. The premise of the game is that V.E.N.O.M. have propelled Boulder Hill into a time vortex, and the player must rescue the other members of the M.A.S.K. team by collecting and re-assembling parts of a scan key, which then directs the player to the location of the missing personnel. The game received mostly favorable reviews at the time, although it was noted by some that the tie-in to the franchise was quite tenuous and only the graphics, rather than the storyline and gameplay, connected it to the M.A.S.K. franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/list.php%3Fpublisher%3DGremlin+Graphics MASK] on Lemon Retro Store&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c64endings.freeolamail.com/endings/m/mask/mask.htm MASK] on C64Endings&lt;/ref&gt;

The second game, ''MASK II'', also released in 1987, was a 2D horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up. The game featured many more of the M.A.S.K. vehicles, and included a selection process in which the player chose which vehicles to use before the game began. Only one vehicle could be controlled at a time but these could be quickly interchanged. Again, the game was received favorably in the press, where it was noted that it was a better tie-in to the franchise than the first, because it featured more of the vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/list.php%3Fpublisher%3DGremlin+Graphics MASK II] on Lemon Retro Store&lt;/ref&gt;

The final game in the trilogy ''MASK III – Venom Strikes Back'' was released in 1988 and was a 2D horizontal shoot-em-up. The premise of the game is that V.E.N.O.M. have kidnapped Scott Trakker and are holding him on the moon. The player controls Matt Trakker (unrecognizable in a space suit with helmet) through a series of static screens featuring platform puzzles and obstacles which must be overcome using the powers of the various masks. The player can hold up to four masks at a time, but can only use the power of one at a time. The masks can also be exchanged at certain points in the game. This game received the best reviews of the trilogy, despite the deviation from the franchise's storyline and style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/list.php%3Fpublisher%3DGremlin+Graphics MASK III] on Lemon Retro Store&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generation-msx.nl/msxdb/softwareinfo/3307 MASK III] on Generation-MSX&lt;/ref&gt;

All three M.A.S.K. games were released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] formats, while the second and third games were also released for the [[MSX]] format.

===Television===
In the animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', M.A.S.K. is referred as a division of the United States military that developed a special vehicle (which they described as "experimental, all-terrain, expeditionary fighting").&lt;ref&gt;''Transformers: Prime'' – Season 3: ''Beast Hunters'' – Episode 5: Project Predacon&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, several copies of that vehicle have been apparently mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;''Transformers: Robots in Disguise'' – Season 1 – Episode 17: One of Our Mini-Cons is Missing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
On December 15, 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that Hasbro and Paramount were joining forces to create a shared cinematic universe combining M.A.S.K. with ''[[G.I. Joe (film series)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]]'', ''[[Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light]]'', and ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-hasbro-gi-joe-universe-848920|title=Paramount, Hasbro Creating Movie Universe Around G.I.

The '''Mask of Tutankhamun''' is a [[death mask]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th-dynasty]] [[ancient Egypt]]ian Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] (reigned 1332–1323 BC). It was discovered by [[Howard Carter]] in 1925&lt;!-- the burial chamber was opened in 1923 and the sarcophagus in 1925 --&gt; in tomb [[KV62]] and is now housed in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; The mask is one of the most well known works of art in the world.&lt;ref name="Reeves522"&gt;Reeves, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Egyptologist]] [[Nicholas Reeves]], the mask is "not only the quintessential image from Tutankhamun's tomb, it is perhaps the best-known object from ancient Egypt itself."&lt;ref name="Reeves522"/&gt; Since 2001, research has suggested that it may originally have been intended for Queen [[Neferneferuaten]];&lt;ref name="Eaton-Krauss2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marianne Eaton-Krauss|title=The Unknown Tutankhamun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FySCCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4725-7561-6|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; her royal name (Ankhkheperure) was found in a partly erased [[cartouche]] on the inside of the mask.&lt;ref name="newscorp"&gt;{{cite news|author=James Seidel|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/archaeology/tutankhamuns-mask-evidence-of-an-erased-name-points-to-the-fate-of-heretic-queen-nefertiti/news-story/41c5e678fdbc4dc5fcd5b38de1687b7e|title=Tutankhamun's mask: Evidence of an erased name points to the fate of heretic Queen Nefertiti|date=26 November 2015|website=News.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
Tutankhamun's burial chamber was found at the [[Theban Necropolis]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in 1922 and opened in 1923. It would be another two years before the excavation team, led by the English archaeologist Howard Carter, was able to open the heavy sarcophagus containing [[Tutankhamun's mummy]]. On 28 October 1925, they opened the innermost of three coffins to reveal the gold mask, seen by people for the first time in approximately 3,250 years. Carter wrote in his diary:

&lt;blockquote style="text-align:justify"&gt;The pins removed, the lid was raised. The penultimate scene was disclosed – a very neatly wrapped mummy of the young king, with golden mask of sad but tranquil expression, symbolizing Osiris … the mask bears that god's attributes, but the likeness is that of Tut.Ankh.Amen – placid and beautiful, with the same features as we find upon his statues and coffins. The mask has fallen slightly back, thus its gaze is straight up to the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/discoveringTut/journals-and-diaries/season-4/journal.html|title=Howard Carter's excavation diaries (transcripts and scans)|accessdate=10 April 2016|website=The Griffith Institute|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 1925, the mask was removed from the tomb, placed in a crate and transported {{convert|635|km|mi}} to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where it remains on public display.

== Description ==
The mask is {{convert|54|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|39.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|49|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep. It is fashioned from two layers of high-[[Fineness|karat]] gold, varying from {{convert|1.5|–|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness, and weighing {{convert|10.23|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; [[X-ray crystallography]] has revealed that the mask contains two [[alloy]]s of gold: a lighter 18.4 karat shade for the face and neck, and 22.5 karat gold for the rest of the mask.&lt;ref name="Reeves513"&gt;Reeves, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;

The face represents the pharaoh's standard image, and the same image was found by excavators elsewhere in the tomb, in particular in the guardian statues.&lt;ref name="Reeves513"/&gt; He wears a [[nemes]] headcloth, topped by the royal insignia of a cobra ([[Wadjet]]) and vulture ([[Nekhbet]]), symbolising Tutankhamun's rule of both [[Lower Egypt]] and [[Upper Egypt]] respectively. The ears are pierced to hold earrings, a feature that appears to have been reserved for queens and children in almost all surviving ancient Egyptian works of art.&lt;ref name="newscorp"/&gt;

It contains inlays of coloured glass and gemstones, including [[lapis lazuli]] (the eye surrounds and eyebrows), [[quartz]] (the eyes), [[obsidian]] (the pupils), [[carnelian]], [[feldspar]], [[turquoise]], [[amazonite]], [[Egyptian faience|faience]] and other stones (as inlays of the broad collar).&lt;ref name=Carternotes /&gt;&lt;ref name="BongioanniCroce2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alessandro Bongioanni|author2=Maria Sole Croce|title=The Treasures of Ancient Egypt from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaUYAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=978-0-7893-0986-0|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the beard fell off when the mask was taken out of its display case for cleaning. The museum workers responsible used quick-drying [[epoxy]] in an attempt to fix it, leaving the beard off-center. The damage was noticed in January 2015, and has been repaired by a German-Egyptian team who reattached it using beeswax, a natural material used by the ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Liam Stack|title=Repaired King Tut mask back on display in Egypt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/world/middleeast/repaired-king-tut-mask-back-on-display-in-egypt.html|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=The New York Times|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, it was announced that eight employees of the Egyptian Museum were to stand trial for allegedly ignoring scientific and professional methods of restoration and causing permanent damage to the mask. A former director of the museum and a former director of restoration were among those facing prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2016/01/23/8-antiquities-employees-referred-to-trial-over-damage-to-tutankamun-mask/|title=8 employees referred to trial over damage to Tutankhamun mask|newspaper=Daily News Egypt|date=23 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2016, the date of the trial remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/24/africa/king-tut-broken-mask-charges/index.html|title=CNN It did not say when the trial will be|newspaper=CNN News|date=28 January 2016|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inscription ===
A protective spell is inscribed with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] on the back and shoulders in ten vertical and two horizontal lines.&lt;ref name="Reeves513"/&gt; The spell first appeared on masks in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], 500 years before Tutankhamun, and was used in Chapter 151 of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/museum/tutl18.htm|title=Tut exhibit: Gold death mask of Tutankhamun|website=Tour Egypt|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="text-align:justify"&gt;Thy right eye is the night [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] (of the sun-god), thy left eye is the day-bark, thy eyebrows are (those of) the [[Ennead]] of the Gods, thy forehead is (that of) Anubis, the nape of thy neck is (that of) Horus, thy locks of hair are (those of) Ptah-Sokar. (Thou art) in front of the Osiris (Tutankhamun). He sees thanks to thee, thou guidest him to the goodly ways, thou smitest for him the confederates of Seth so that he may overthrow thine enemies before the Ennead of the Gods in the great Castle of the Prince, which is in Heliopolis … the Osiris, the King of Upper Egypt Nebkheperure [Tutankhamun's throne-name], deceased, given life by [[Ra|Re]]".&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasures of Tutankhamun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBYOAQAAMAAJ|year=1972|author=Trustees of the British Museum|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|pages=154–156|isbn=978-0-7230-0070-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Osiris]] was the Egyptian god of the afterlife. Ancient Egyptians believed that kings preserved in the likeness of Osiris would rule the Kingdom of the Dead. It never totally replaced the older cult of the sun, in which dead kings were thought to be reanimated as the sun-god Re, whose body was made of gold and lapis lazuli. This confluence of old and new beliefs resulted in a mixture of emblems inside Tutankhamun's sarcophagus and tomb.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"/&gt;

=== Bead necklace ===
Although it is usually removed when the mask is on display, it has a triple-string necklace of gold and blue [[faience]] disc-beads with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]] terminals and [[uraeus]] clasps.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Navy Day 1945 ships Hudson River NY.jpg|thumb|Ships anchored on the [[Hudson River]] north above [[New York City]] for the 1945 Navy Day at the victorious end of [[World War II]].]]
In the United States, the [[United States Navy League|Navy League of the United States]] organized the first Navy Day in 1922, holding it on October 27 because it was the birthday of 26th President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858–1919, served 1901–1909), who was a naval enthusiast/promoter of sea power and former assistant [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] just before the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. Although meeting with mixed reviews the first year, in 1923 over 50 major cities participated, and the [[United States Navy]] sent a number of its ships to various port cities for the occasion. The 1945 Navy Day was an especially large celebration, with 33rd President [[Harry S. Truman]] (1884–1972, served 1945–1953),  reviewing the returning home American fleet in [[New York Harbor]] after victory in [[World War II]].

In 1949, [[Louis A. Johnson]], (1891–1966, served 1949–1950), second [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary]] of the newly merged and created [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], directed that the U.S. Navy's participation occur on newly established [[Armed Forces Day]] for the unified/coordinated uniformed services in May, although as a private civilian organization, the Navy League was not affected by this directive, and continued to organize separate Navy Day celebrations as before. In the 1970s, historical research found that the "birthday" of the earlier [[Continental Navy]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), was determined to be October 13, 1775, and so [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Elmo R. Zumwalt]] worked with the Navy League to define October 13th as the new date of Navy Day. However, Navy Day in the United States is still largely recognized as October 27th.

== Venezuela and Colombia ==
July 24, the birthday of Simon Bolivar and the anniversary of the 1823 Patriot victory in the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]], is marked as Navy Day in both Venezuela and Colombia. Both the [[Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela]] and the [[Colombian Navy]] hold major events to mark the holiday.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3983">In the early years of [[Christianity]], the '''[[Church Fathers]]''' commented extensively on '''[[numerology]]'''. 

The Fathers repeatedly condemned the magical use of numbers which had descended from [[Babylonia]]n sources to the [[Pythagoreans]] and [[Gnostics]] of their times. They denounced any system of philosophy which rested upon an exclusively numerical basis. Even so, they almost unanimously regarded the numbers of Holy Writ as full of mystical meaning, and they considered the interpretation of these mystical meanings as an important branch of [[exegesis]]. There was reluctance in the Christian teachers of the early centuries to push this recognition of the significance of numbers to extremes.

==Irenaeus==

[[Irenaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Haer.]], V, xxx.&lt;/ref&gt; explains the [[number of the beast]] 666 (Apoc., xiii, 18) by the word "Lateinos".{{what|reason=Our readers who don't know Greek will likely have no idea what this means.|date=June 2016}} The numerical value of its constituent Greek letters yields the total

:30 + 1 + 300 + 5 + 10 + 50 + 70 + 200 = 666. 

Also he discusses at length&lt;ref&gt;Haer., I, viii, 5 and 12, and II, xxxiv, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Gnostic numerical interpretation of the holy name "Jesus" as the equivalent of 888, and he claims that by writing the name in Hebrew characters an entirely different interpretation is necessitated.

==Ambrose==

[[St. Ambrose]] commenting upon the days of creation and the Sabbath remarks, 

:"The number seven is good, but we do not explain it after the doctrine of Pythagoras and the other philosophers, but rather according to the manifestation and division of the grace of the Spirit; for the prophet Isaias has enumerated the principal gifts of the Holy Spirit as seven" (Letter to Horontianus). 

==Augustine==
[[Augustine of Hippo]], replying to [[Tichonius]] the [[Donatist]], observes that 

:"if Tichonius had said that these mystical rules open out some of the hidden recesses of the law, instead of saying that they reveal all the mysteries of the law, he would have spoken truth".&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'', III, xlii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Biblical texts==

Influenced mainly by Biblical precepts, the Fathers down to the time of [[Bede]] and even later gave much attention to the sacredness and mystical significance not only of certain numerals in themselves but also of the numerical totals given by the constituent letters with which words were written. An example is in the early ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]''. This document appeals to ''[[The Book of Genesis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gen., xiv, 14 and xvii, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; as mystically pointing to the name and self-oblation of the coming [[Messias]]. 

"Learn, therefore," says the writer, "that Abraham who first appointed circumcision, looked forward in spirit unto Jesus when he circumcised, having received the ordinances of three letters. For the Scripture saith, And Abraham circumcised of his household eighteen males and three hundred.' What then was the knowledge given unto him? Understand ye that He saith the eighteen' first, and then after an interval three hundred.' In the [number] eighteen [the Greek IOTA] stands for 10, [the Greek ETA] for eight. Here thou hast Jesus ([in Greek] IESOUS). And because the cross in the [Greek TAU] was to have grace, he saith also three hundred.' So he revealeth Jesus in two letters and in the remaining one the cross".&lt;ref&gt;Ep. Barnabas, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Here the numerical value of the Greek letters [[iota]] and [[eta]], the first letters of the Holy Name, is 10 and 8, for 18, while [[Tau]], which stands for the form of the cross, represents 300.

'''Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill''' is a {{convert|182|m|ft|adj=on}} [[volcano|volcanic peak]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. It is an important memorial place for both [[Māori people|Māori]] and other New Zealanders. The suburb around the base of the hill is also called One Tree Hill. It is surrounded by the suburbs of [[Royal Oak, New Zealand|Royal Oak]] to the west, and clockwise, [[Epsom, New Zealand|Epsom]], [[Greenlane]], [[Oranga]], and [[Onehunga]]. The summit provides views across the Auckland area, and allows visitors to see both of Auckland's harbours.

The hill's [[scoria]] [[volcanic cone|cone]]s were erupted from three craters – one is intact and two have been breached by [[lava]] flows that rafted away part of the side of the scoria cone. Lava flows went in all directions, many towards Onehunga, covering an area of {{convert|20|km2}}, making it the second largest (in area covered) of the [[Auckland volcanic field]], behind [[Rangitoto Island]]. The age of eruption is currently unknown, but it is older than 28,500 years as it has a mantling of volcanic ash erupted at that time from [[Te Tatua-a-Riukiuta|Te Tātua-a-Riukiuta]] volcano.&lt;ref name=Hayward_essential_2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hayward |first1=Bruce W. |last2=Murdoch |first2=Graeme |last3=Maitland |first3=Gordon |title=Volcanoes of Auckland: The Essential Guide |year=2011 |publisher=Auckland University Press |isbn=978-1-86940-479-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Māori pā (fort)===

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name ''Maungakiekie'' means "mountain of the [[kiekie (plant)|kiekie]] vine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwallpark.co.nz/index.php?s=2 Cornwall Park website]. Retrieved 8 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Māori people|Māori]] also knew it as "[[Podocarpus totara|tōtara]] that stands alone".&lt;ref name="CLOSED"/&gt; The mountain and its surrounds were home to the [[Te Wai ō Hua]] tribe from the early 1700s and probably before that time. Other [[iwi|Māori tribes]] in the Auckland area can also trace their ancestry to the mountain.

Maungakiekie was the largest and most important [[Pā (Māori)|Māori pā]] in pre-European times. The cone and its surroundings are estimated to have been home to a population of up to 5,000.&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/places/parks/onetreehill.asp One Tree Hill Domain (Maungakiekie)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204084541/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/places/parks/onetreehill.asp |date=4 February 2012 }} (from the Auckland City Council website. Retrieved 2007-12-10.)&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the [[Nga Marama]] chief [[Kiwi Tamaki]] held the pa and used its strategic placement to exact tribute from travellers passing from [[Northland Region|Northland]] to the rest of the [[North Island]] through the rich isthmus. Its position between the [[Waitematā Harbour]] to the east (opening upon the [[Pacific Ocean]]) and the [[Manukau Harbour]] to the west (opening onto the [[Tasman Sea]]) offered a wide variety of seafood from the two harbours. The volcanic soil on the scoria cone was highly fertile, and the inhabitants terraced the slopes extensively. The hill was relatively easy to defend from raiding parties from other tribes by its steep sides and imposing wooden [[wikt:palisades|palisades]]. Waiohua occupation of the [[Pā (Māori)|Māori pā]] ended around 1740-1750 AD when they were defeated in a war against the invading Ngati Whatua-o-Kaipara&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/auckland-region/page-6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pā (Māori)|pā]] was abandoned around 1795 AD with the death of Te Taou leader Tuperiri.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5RVnVeGiCzAC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=maungakiekie+pa+abandoned&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uMKQu8tMCG&amp;sig=O7APFI7SouY4sHMbciHTnmopJSo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BTMDU6KhHIbDkgXy_4GwAQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=maungakiekie%20pa%20abandoned&amp;f=false] From Tamaki Makau-Rau to Auckland&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 the Ngati Whatua, with the concurrence of representatives of the Waiohua people, sold a block of land which included Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill to a merchant, Thomas Henry. The Government under its preemptive rights excluded 115 acres of the hill itself from the sale and this was vested in the Crown. This is now One Tree Hill Domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/managementplans/onetree/section413.asp](One Tree Hill Domain Origin)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 Brown &amp; Campbell purchased Henry's land surrounding the recently protected One Tree Hill Domain. This land ultimately became Cornwall Park in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;(Brochure "Sir John Logan Campbell" - Cornwall Park Information Center )&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 the government led an initiative to restore the mountain. After two years the initiative was cancelled and the mountain left alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===One Tree Hill Domain===
One Tree Hill Domain, a {{convert|118|acre|adj=on}} park, is owned by Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau Collective and administered by Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau Authority. One Tree Hill Domain adjoins [[Cornwall Park, Auckland|Cornwall Park]]'s {{convert|425|acre}}, creating a total of {{convert|540|acre||abbr=off}} of public green space.&lt;ref&gt;[all decisions are made by the owners Auckland Council] accessed 10 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The hilltop is always accessible by foot, but because it became a nightly party stop for [[boy racer]]s and other (often drunk) groups of youths, after-dark road access to the summit was closed in 2008.&lt;ref name="CLOSED"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=117&amp;objectid=10536509 |title=Vandals force One Tree Hill to be locked |date=8 October 2008 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area contains two parks, One Tree Hill Domain and Cornwall Park, which are next to each other and thus often perceived as one. One Tree Hill Domain is open to the public and was formerly administered by Auckland City Council but since 2012 has been owned and administered by Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2014/0052/latest/DLM5322500.html|title=Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau Collective Redress Act 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Legislation|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All decisions are made by the owners, who have delegated minor day-to-day operations to Cornwall Park Trust. Cornwall Park is a private park, also open to the public, administered by the Cornwall Park Trust Board. The Trust's endowment includes income from leasehold properties adjoining the park's borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cornwallpark.co.nz/index.php?s=6|title=Ground Leases and Conditions of Entry|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cornwallpark.co.nz|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because One Tree Hill Domain is high and relatively central, the city has long used it for its potable water reservoirs. The first of these was constructed in 1900 atop the western peak; though it is no longer in service, the small structure remains in place. Five further reservoirs were subsequently built underground, with the latest completed in 1977. They are currently used to maintain supply to the Onehunga area and to the reservoirs atop [[Maungawhau|Maungawhau / Mount Eden]].

===Treaty settlement===
In the 2014 [[Treaty of Waitangi]] settlement with the Tamaki Makaurau Collective of 13 Auckland [[iwi]], the volcano was officially named Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill and ownership was vested to the collective.

==Features==

===Obelisk===
[[File:Onetreehill monument01.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Detail of the obelisk]]
On the summit of the hill is an [[obelisk]], a memorial to Māori.&lt;ref name=obelisk&gt;{{cite news|title=Maori Memorial. Obelisk on One Tree Hill. Scheme to divert fund.|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19310319.2.84&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------100--1----0goldstine+obelisk--|accessdate=21 April 2013|newspaper=Auckland Star|date=19 March 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the obelisk stands a bronze statue of a Māori warrior. The stone obelisk was designed by [[Richard Atkinson Abbot]] and completed in 1940, but the unveiling of the obelisk was delayed until after [[World War II]] on 24 April 1948. This was in keeping with Māori custom of not holding such ceremonies during a time of bloodshed.

Beneath it is the grave of Sir John Logan Campbell who bequeathed £5,000 for the obelisk. His grave is a plain granite slab, ornamented only by a bronze wreath. It lies in the middle of the viewing platform, on axis with the main memorial plaques on the Obelisk base and the bronze Warrior Statue.&lt;ref name=obelisk /&gt;

Campbell, like many European New Zealanders of his generation, had expected that Māori would gradually die out and that an impressive memorial would be a most fitting symbol to perpetuate their memory.&lt;ref name=obeliskname&gt;{{cite news |title=Delay encountered |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19400822.2.75&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------100--1----0delay+encountered+goldstine-- |accessdate=21 April 2013 |newspaper=Auckland Star |date=22 August 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s this had obviously not happened, and some considered the term "memorial" was inappropriate with many Māori objecting to its use. During construction of the obelisk, a suggestion was made that it should be described as a centennial tower to mark the centennial year of the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and not a memorial.&lt;ref name=obeliskname /&gt;

===Stardome Observatory===
{{Main|Stardome Observatory}}

The Stardome Observatory (previously known as ''Auckland Observatory''), is located within One Tree Hill Domain, and contains two [[telescope]]s and a [[planetarium]]. The observatory has, amongst other research, discovered and named the [[asteroid]] [[19620 Auckland]]. Its current functions combine entertainment and education (via the planetarium and via public access to the older telescope) as well as ongoing research with both telescopes. It is operated by a charitable trust.

==Summit trees==

When Auckland was founded as a colonial town a tree stood near the summit which gave the hill its English name. Two accounts identify it as a [[Metrosideros excelsa|pōhutukawa]] (''Metrosideros excelsa''). This tree was cut down by a [[pākehā]] settler in 1852, in an act of vandalism in one account,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The History of One Tree Hill, the volcanic mountain known to the Maori people as 'Maungakiekie' {{!}} NZETC|url = http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Stout77-t6.html|website = nzetc.victoria.ac.nz|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for firewood in another.&lt;ref name="CLOSED"/&gt; It seems likely this was a different tree from the [[tōtara]] (''Podocarpus totara'') which, as a sacred tree, had given the hill one of its Maori names. A [[Monterey pine|radiata pine]] was planted in the 1870s to replace the previous tōtara .&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/993105.stm One Tree Hill loses its tree]". ''[[bbc.co.uk|BBC News]]''. 26 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; John Logan Campbell repeatedly tried to grow [[Flora of New Zealand|native trees]] on the hill's summit, but the trees failed to survive - with only two pines, originally part of a shelter belt for the native trees, surviving for long. However, in 1960, one of the two was felled in another attack,&lt;ref name="CLOSED"/&gt; possibly for firewood.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
[[File:One Tree Hill Auckland in the 1990s.jpg|thumb|Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill with tree, in 1996.]]
The remaining tree was later attacked twice with chainsaws by Māori activists to draw attention to injustices the New Zealand government had inflicted upon Māori. The first attack happened on 28 October 1994, the anniversary of the 1835 Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://aotearoa.wellington.net.nz/back/tumoana/index.htm The Evolution of Contemporary Maori Protest]'' (from a [[Tino Rangatiratanga]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; A second attack on 5 October 2000&lt;ref name="TVNZ_12225"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/423466/12225 |title=Attempt to attack One Tree Hill |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; left the tree unable to recover even though substantial efforts were made, and so it was removed on 26 October due to the risk of it collapsing.&lt;ref name="CLOSED"/&gt; The chainsaw used in the first attack was later placed on sale on popular New Zealand auction site, [[TradeMe]] in 2007,&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10419863"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10419863 |title=One Tree Hill chainsaw goes on sale at $5000 plus |author=Trevett, Claire |date=19 January 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later withdrawn by the website after complaints and a poll of users.

A well-attended dawn ceremony conducted by Tupuna Maunga Authority took place upon Maungakiekie on 11 June 2016 planting nine young [[tōtara]] and [[pōhutukawa]] grown from parent trees on the hill. A [[kiekie (plant)|kiekie]] will be added later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/80961808/hundreds-turn-out-for-one-tree-hill-planting |title=Hundreds turn out for One Tree Hill planting |author=Simon Maude |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |work=Auckland Now |date=11 June 2016 |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Irish rock band [[U2]] wrote a song about the hill, "[[One Tree Hill (song)|One Tree Hill]]", which appeared on their album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''. It was written to honour New Zealander Greg Carroll, an employee of the band who died in a motorcycle accident in [[Dublin]] on 3 July 1986.
** The naming of the teen television drama, ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the show's final episode, was inspired in turn by the U2 song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = "Building a Winning Team: The Making of One Tree Hill" | medium = Documentary | location = [[One Tree Hill DVD releases#Season one|One Tree Hill: The Complete First Season]]'' | publisher=[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the series [[Andy Hargrove]] hails from New Zealand. His mother moved the family to [[Tree Hill, North Carolina]] because of the common name.
* [[Asteroid]] ''[[List of asteroids (23001-24000)|23988 Maungakiekie]]'' was named after the hill by [[Ian P. Griffin]], a British astronomer. The asteroid was discovered at the [[Auckland Observatory]] which is located in the One Tree Hill Domain, a kilometre southwest of the peak.
* [[Mozilla Firefox]] 0.9 was named One Tree Hill by Auckland resident and (at that time) Firefox lead engineer [[Ben Goodger]].

{{Italic title}}
'''''Piers Plowman''''' (written {{circa}} 1370&amp;ndash;90) or ''Visio Willelmi de Petro Ploughman'' (''William's Vision of Piers Plowman'') is a [[Middle English]] [[allegorical]] [[narrative poem]] by [[William Langland]]. It is written in unrhymed, [[alliterative verse]] divided into sections called ''passus'' ([[Latin]] for "step"). Like the [[Pearl Poet]]'s ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', ''Piers Plowman'' is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest works of [[English literature]] of the [[Middle Ages]], even preceding and influencing [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. ''Piers Plowman'' contains the first known allusion to a literary tradition of [[Robin Hood]] tales.

==Summary==
The poem, a mix of theological allegory and social satire, concerns the narrator/dreamer's quest for the true [[Christian]] life in the context of [[medieval]] [[Catholicism]]. This journey takes place within a series of dream-visions; the dreamer seeks, among other things, the [[allegory|allegorical]] characters Dowel (''"Do-Well"''), Dobet (''"Do-Better"''), and Dobest (''"Do-Best"''). The poem is divided into ''passus'' ('steps'), the divisions between which vary by version.

The following summary is based on the B-version of the poem{{mdash}}the most widely edited and translated.

===Vision 1===

'''Prologue:'''
The poem begins in the [[Malvern Hills]] between [[Worcestershire]] and [[Herefordshire]]. A man named Will (which can be understood either simply as a personal name or as an allegory for a person's will, in the sense of 'desire, intention') falls asleep and has a vision of a tower set upon a hill and a fortress (''[[wikt:donjon|donjon]]'') in a deep valley; between these symbols of heaven and hell is a 'fair field full of folk', representing the world of mankind. A satirical account of different sections of society follows, along with a dream-like fable representing the King as a cat and his people as rodents.

'''Passus 1:'''
Holy Church visits Will and explains the tower of Truth, and discusses Truth more generally.

'''Passus 2:'''
Will sees Lady Mede ('payment') and finds out about her planned marriage to False.

'''Passus 3:'''
Lady Mede travels to the royal court; the King proposes she marry Conscience; but Conscience denounces her.

'''Passus 4:'''
Conscience and Reason convince the King not to marry Mede to False. Will wakes up.

===Vision 2===

'''Passus 5:'''
Will falls back to sleep. Reason gives a sermon to the Field of Folk and the people decide to repent. The [[Seven Deadly Sins]] make confession and in penance attempt to go on pilgrimage to St Truth. They get lost, and Piers Plowman makes his first appearance: he will help the penitents if they help him plough his half-acre.

'''Passus 6:'''
Piers and the penitents plough the half-acre. Some people refuse to work, and Hunger punishes them until they work. But once Hunger has been sated, the people return to idleness.

'''Passus 7:'''
Eventually, Truth sends Piers a pardon for the penitents' sins; its main content is 'Do well and have well and God shall have your soul' and 'Do evil and have evil, and expect nothing other than that after your death, the Devil shall have your soul'. When challenged on the pardon's validity by a priest, Piers angrily tears it in two. Will is awakened by their arguing and, musing on his dreams, decides to seek ‘Do-wel’.

'''The A-version of ''Piers Plowman'' stops at this point.'''

===Vision 3===

'''Passus 8:'''
Will's search for Dowel begins. He enters into a disputation with Friars. He then falls asleep once more and meets Thought. Thought instructs Will in 'Do well, do better, do best'. Practical interpretation of what these concepts mean is to be provided by Wit.

'''Passus 9:'''
There is an extended allegory featuring Dowel and the Castle of Flesh, exposing the need for people to be governed by their ‘Inwit’. The text discusses poverty and marriage. Wit makes further inroads to understanding Dowel, as active virtue.

'''Passus 10:'''
Will meets Wit’s wife, Dame Study. She complains to Will about his ignorance. Will then proceeds to Clergy and Scripture to learn more about Dowel. He considers what use scholarship might have in helping him achieve salvation.

'''Passus 11:'''
Scripture complains about Will's lack of self-knowledge. Angered, Will (who is already dreaming) goes to sleep and has a dream-within-a-dream in which he meets Fortune. He serves her into old age, but she abandons him. Will learns about the salvation of the [[Emperor Trajan]] and power of love. Kynde ('character, natural disposition, nature', here understood as an aspect of God) shows Will the world. Will has an argument with Reason: Reason, Will concludes, does not do enough to keep people from sin; but Reason disagrees. Will awakes from the dream-within-a-dream. He now meets Imaginatif, who advises Will to be patient.

'''Passus 12:'''
Imaginatif teaches Will, bringing together and improving his understanding of earlier discussions in the poem. Imaginatif emphasises the need for humility and the importance of Grace.

===Vision 4===

'''Passus 13:'''
Will awakens and then falls back to sleep; he dreams of sharing a feast with Conscience, Scripture, Clergy and Patience; he encounters a greedy Doctor of Divinity (who later shows disdain for love) and as well as eating actual food also dines on spiritual food. Piers the Plowman offers a definition of Do Well, Do Better and Do Best. Then Conscience and Patience meet Haukyn the Active Man, who wears a coat of Christian faith which is, however, soiled with the Seven Deadly Sins.

'''Passus 14:'''
Conscience teaches Haukyn to seek forgiveness and do penance; Patience teaches Haukyn about the merits of embracing poverty. Haukyn cries out for God's mercy, which awakens Will.

===Vision 5===

'''Passus 15:'''
Will finds himself alienated from the waking world, but Reason helps him to go back to sleep, whereupon Will meets Anima ('spirit'). Anima tells Will off for his pride in wanting to know too much, but goes on to talk about charity, in particular how the Church should care for its flock, but how its priests and monks (among whom Langland counts the [[Prophet Mohammed]]) do not always fulfil this duty. Talking to Anima, Will starts to conclude that Piers the Plowman is Christ. Will realises that he needs to switch from searching for Dowel to searching for Charity.

'''Passus 16:'''
Will falls into another dream-within-a-dream, this time about the Tree of Charity, whose gardener is Piers the Plowman. Will participates in a re-enactment of the Fall of Man and then has a vision of the life of Christ; when this reaches the point where the Devil is defeated, Will wakes up from the dream-within-a-dream. Will goes looking for Piers and meeting Faith/Abraham, who is himself searching for Christ.

'''Passus 17:'''
Next, Will meets Hope/Moses, characterised by the tablets of law, who is also in search of Christ. Will learns about the Good Samaritan, the prospect of salvation, and the importance of Love. He wakes up.

===Vision 6===

'''Passus 18:'''
Will sleeps again, and experiences the climactic section of ''Piers Plowman''. He experiences Love and the intersection of human and divine time. Will witnesses Christ/the Good Samaritan/Piers Plowman riding into Jerusalem and Christ's crucifixion. He then witnesses the [[Four Daughters of God]] (Truth, Justice, Mercy, Peace) in debate; the Harrowing of Hell; and Redemption.

Will wakes again, and now exhorts his family to hear Mass.

===Vision 7===

'''Passus 19:'''
During the mass, Will falls back to sleep and meets Conscience once more. Conscience recounts the life and Passion of Christ and how Piers/Peter was given his power by Grace/Christ. Will finds out about Pentecost; once more sees Piers as a ploughman; and witnesses Pride attacking Unity/Holy Church. He wakes up and records his dream.

===Vision 8===

'''Passus 20:'''
While awake, Will meets Need. He falls asleep again and now dreams of the Antichrist. Kynde sends Old Age, Death, and Pestilence, to chastise people: Will is attacked by Old Age. He witnesses Holy Church undermined by a hypocritical Friar. Conscience goes on pilgrimage to seek Piers the Plowman, and calls on Grace for help{{mdash}}whereupon Will wakes up.

==Title and authorship==
It is now commonly accepted that ''Piers Plowman'' was written by [[William Langland]], about whom little is known. This attribution rests principally on the [[evidence]] of an early-fifteenth-century manuscript of the C-text (see below) of ''Piers'' held at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (MS 212), which ascribes the work to one man, called 'Willielmus de Langlond':

{{quote |Memorandum quod Stacy de Rokayle pater willielmi de Langlond qui stacius fuit generosus &amp; morabatur in Schiptoun vnder whicwode tenens domini le Spenser in comitatu Oxoniensi qui predictus willielmus fecit librum qui vocatur Perys ploughman.}}

;Translation
{{quote |It should be noted that Stacy de Rokayle was the father of William de Langlond; this Stacy was of noble birth and dwelt in [[Shipton-under-Wychwood]], a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of [[Oxfordshire]]. The aforesaid William made the book which is called ''Piers Plowman''.}}

Other manuscripts also name the author as "Robert or William Langland", or "Wilhelmus W." (which could be shorthand for "William of Wychwood").

The attribution to William Langland is also based on internal evidence, primarily a seemingly [[autobiographical]] section in Passus 5 of the C-text of the poem. The main [[narrator]] of the poem in all the versions is named Will, with allegorical resonances clearly intended, and Langland (or Longland) is thought to be indicated as a surname through apparent [[pun]]s; e.g., at one point the narrator remarks: "I have lyved in ''londe''... my name is ''longe wille''" (B.XV.152). This could be a coded reference to the poet's name, in the style of much late-medieval literature. New evidence suggests that this reverse cryptogram was read as "Will Long Will" by contemporary scribes and that the rebels of 1381 used this name as pseudonym alongside the name "Piers Plowman".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=Hares, Rabbits, Pheasants: ''Piers Plowman'' and William Longewille, a Norfolk Rebel in 1381|journal=Review of English Studies|date=2018|pages=1-21|doi=10.1093/res/hgx130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langland's authorship, however, is not entirely beyond dispute, as recent work by Stella Pates and C. David Benson has demonstrated. in their work,"The Langland Myth", they claim there is not enough evidence to suggest that Langland is, in fact, the author, but instead that it is the work of a man by the name of William de la Rokele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benson |first=C. David |title="The Langland Myth," in William Langland's Piers Plowman: A Book of Essays |editor=Kathleen M. Hewett-Smith |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn= |date=2001 |page=83–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixteenth century, when ''Piers'' was first printed, authorship was attributed by various [[antiquarian]]s (such as [[John Bale]]) and poets to [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], amongst others. Some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century persons regarded the poem as anonymous, and/or associated it with texts in the [[plowman tradition]] of social complaint, particularly the Chaucerian [[pseudepigrapha]] ''[[The Ploughman's Tale]]'' and ''[[Pierce the Ploughman's Crede]]''. (The latter was appended to [[Owen Rogers]]' 1560 edition of ''Piers Plowman'', a degraded version of [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]]'s 1550 editions.) The character of Piers himself had come to be considered by many readers to be in some sense the author.

The first printed editions by Crowley named the author as "Robert Langland" in a prefatory note. Langland is described as a probable protégé of Wycliffe. With Crowley's editions, the poem followed an existing and subsequently repeated convention of titling the poem ''The Vision of Piers'' [or Pierce] ''Plowman'', which is in fact the conventional name of just one section of the poem.

Some medievalists and text critics, beginning with [[John Matthews Manly]], have posited multiple authorship theories for ''Piers'', an idea which continues to have a periodic resurgence in the scholarly literature. One scholar{{Who|date=July 2013}} now disputes the single-author hypothesis, supposing that the poem may be the work of between two and five authors, depending upon how authorship is defined. In keeping with contemporary scholarly trends in [[textual criticism]], [[critical theory]], and the [[history of the book]], [[Charlotte Brewer]], among others, suggests that [[scribes]] and their supervisors be regarded as editors with semi-authorial roles in the production of ''Piers Plowman'' and other early modern texts, but this has nothing to do with Manly's argument.

==The text==
[[Image:Piers Plowman.jpg|thumb|Image of the opening of ''Piers Plowman'' from manuscript Laud misc. 581 in the [[Bodleian Library]]]]
[[File:Piers Ploughman. Middle English Poetry (f.169).jpg|thumb|''Piers Plowman'' from the early-15th century manuscript in the [[National Library of Wales]]]]
''Piers Plowman'' is considered to be one of the most analytically challenging texts in [[Middle English]] [[textual criticism]]. There are 50–56 surviving [[manuscripts]], some of which are fragmentary. None of the texts are known to be in the author's own hand, and none of them derive directly from any of the others.

All modern discussion of the text revolves around the classifications of [[Walter William Skeat|W. W. Skeat]]. Skeat argued that there are as many as ten forms of the poem, but only three are to be considered authoritative&amp;mdash;the A, B, and C-texts&amp;mdash;although the definition of "authoritative" in this context is problematic. According to the three-versions hypothesis, each version represents different manuscript traditions deriving from three distinct and successive stages of authorial revision. Although precise dating is debated, the A, B, and C texts are now commonly thought of as the progressive (20–25&amp;nbsp;years) work of a single author.

According to the three-versions hypothesis, the A-text was written {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1367–70 and is the earliest. It breaks off, apparently unfinished, at Book 11, and Book 12 is written by another author or interpolator. The poem runs to about 2,500 lines. The B-text (Warner's ur-B text) was written {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1377–79; it revises A, adds new material, and is three times the length of A. It runs to about 7,300 lines. The C-text was written in the 1380s as a major revision of B except for the final sections. There is some debate over whether the poem can be regarded as finished or not. It entails additions, omissions, and transpositions; it is not significantly different in size from B. Some scholars see it as a conservative revision of B that aims at disassociating the poem from [[Lollardy]] and the religious and political radicalism of [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] during the [[Peasants' Revolt|Great Rising of 1381]]. (Ball appropriated Piers and other characters in the poem for his own verses, speeches, and letters during the Rising.) There is little actual evidence for this proposal, and much against it.{{fact|date=September 2014}}

[[Walter William Skeat|Skeat]] believed that the A-text was incomplete and based his editions on a B-text manuscript (Oxford, MS. Laud Misc. 581) that he wrongly thought was probably a [[holograph]]. Modern editors following Skeat, such as George Kane and [[E. Talbot Donaldson]], have maintained the basic tenets of Skeat's work: there were three final authorial texts, now lost, that can be reconstructed, albeit imperfectly and without certainty, by rooting out the "[[corruption (linguistics)|corruption]]" and "damage" done by scribes.

The Kane, Kane-Donaldson, and Russell-Kane editions of the three versions, published by the [[Athlone Press]], have been controversial, but are considered among the most important accomplishments in modern editorial work and theory in Middle English. A. V. C. Schmidt has also published a parallel edition of A, B, C and Z; the second volume containing a full [[critical apparatus]] indicating his editorial decisions was finally published in 2008, long after the first volume fell out of print.

A. G. Rigg and Charlotte Brewer hypothesized the existence of a Z-text predecessor to A which contains elements of both A and C. The Z-text is based on Oxford MS. Bodley 851, which Rigg and Brewer edited and published. It is the shortest version, and its authenticity is disputed. Ralph Hanna III has disputed the Rigg/Brewer approach based on [[codicological]] evidence and internal literary evidence; consequently the Z-text is now more commonly viewed as a scribal corruption of A with C elements. More recently, Lawrence Warner has shown that what was thought of as B in fact incorporates matter produced as part of the C-revision: if B circulated before C, it looked nothing like what previous editors had assumed.

==Editorial, publication and reception history==

===14th–15th centuries===

[[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], a priest involved as a leader in the [[Peasants' Revolt|Great Rising of 1381]] (also known as the Peasants' Revolt), included Piers and other characters in his writings. If ''Piers Plowman'' already had perceived associations with [[Lollardy]], Ball's appropriations from it (assuming he was not referring to a folk character also appropriated by Langland) enhanced his and its association with the Lollards as well. The real beliefs and sympathies at work in Langland's poem and the revolt remain, for this reason, mysterious and debatable. New evidence suggests that in Norfolk the rebels of 1381 had access to the B version of the text and that they used the author-persona's name - Will Long Will - as a pseudonym.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

No doubt because of Ball's writings, the ''Dieulacres Abbey Chronicle'' account of the revolt refers to Piers, seemingly as a real person who was a leader with Ball in the revolt. Similarly, early in the history of the poem's dissemination in manuscript form, Piers is often treated as the author of the poem. Since it is hard to see how this is credible to those who read the poem, perhaps the idea was that Piers was a mask for the author. Or, as the ideal character of the poem, Piers might be seen as a kind of alter-ego for the poet that was more important to his early readers than the obviously authorial narrator and his apparent self-disclosures as Will. Ironically, Will's name and identity were substantially lost.

In some contemporary chronicles of the Rising, Ball and the Lollards were blamed for the revolt, and Piers began to be associated with [[heresy]] and rebellion. The earliest literary works comprising the Piers Plowman tradition follow in the wake of these events, although they and their sixteenth-century successors are not anti-monarchical or supportive of rebellion. Like William Langland, who may have written the C-text version of ''Piers Plowman'' to disassociate himself from the Rising, they look for the reform of the English church and society by the removal of abuses in what the authors deem a restorative rather than an innovative project.

The first recorded owner of a copy of ''Piers Plowman'' was the  Irish judge [[Walter de Brugge]], who died in 1396.

===16th–18th centuries===
The most conspicuous omissions from [[William Caxton]]'s press were the Bible and ''Piers Plowman''. [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]]'s 1550 editions of ''Piers Plowman'' present the poem as a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] goad to the reformation of religion and society. In the passus summaries in the second and third editions, Crowley emphasizes material in the poem warning of political instability and widespread corruption when the king is a child (as was then the case). Crowley may have made small attempts to remove or soften single references to [[transubstantiation]], the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], [[purgatory]], and the [[Virgin Mary]] as a mediator and object of devotion (although almost a dozen references to purgatory remain, as well as three significant references to Mary). He actually added a line to his second and third editions that clearly refers to [[Marian intercession]] (F1r). After 1550, it was not printed again until 1813 except for Owen Rogers' 1561 edition -- a cheap knock-off of Crowley's text. The few people who mention ''Piers Plowman'' before 1700 usually attribute it to someone other than Langland, and often it is unclear whether they are referring to Langland's poem or one of the many other texts circulating in print as part of the [[Piers Plowman tradition]], particularly ''[[The Ploughman's Tale]]''. Since Piers was conflated with the author and dreamer-narrator of the poem at an early date, "Piers Plowman" or a Latin equivalent is often given as the name of the author, which indicates unfamiliarity with, or disbelief of, Crowley's preface.

When Langland's poem is mentioned, it is often disparaged for its barbarous language. Similar charges were made against Chaucer, but he had more defenders and was already well established as a historical figure and "authority." Despite the work of Bale and Crowley, Langland's name appears to have remained unknown or unaccepted since other authors were suggested after Crowley's editions. Sometimes "Piers Plowman" was referred to as the author of the poem, and when writers refer to a list of medieval authors, they will often mention "Piers Plowman" as an author's name or a substitute for one. One gets the overall impression that Langland and ''Piers Plowman'' had less existence as author and text than did the fictional figure of Piers, whose relationship to a definite authorial and textual origin had been obscured much earlier.

[[Samuel Pepys]] owned a copy of ''Piers Plowman''. Milton cites "Chaucer's Ploughman" in "Of Reformation" (1641) when he is discussing poems that have described Constantine as a major contributor to the corruption of the church. The end of ''Piers Plowman'', Passus 15, makes this point at length—but it is also made briefly in one stanza in ''The Ploughman's Tale'' (ll. 693-700). In "An Apology for a Pamphlet&amp;nbsp;..." Milton refers to ''The Vision and Crede of Pierce Ploughman'', which might mean one or both of these texts. Perhaps it refers to Rogers' 1561 edition which put them together. [[Henry Selden]] (1622) appears to have read the poem closely enough to admire it for its criticism of the church as well as its judgment and invention. [[John Weever]] (1631) also names Robert Langland, as does [[David Buchanan (writer)|David Buchanan]] (1652). Buchanan, however, makes Langland a Scot and attributes other works to him aside from ''Piers Plowman''. [[Thomas Fuller]] (1662) bases his remarks about Langland on Selden and Bale, emphasizing Langland's putative proto-Protestant status. Fuller also notes that ''[[The Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe]]'' was "first set forth by [[William Tyndale|Tindal]], since, exemplified by [[John Foxe|Mr. Fox]]." Since the language of this text is similar to that of ''Piers Plowman'', Fuller attributes it to Langland as well. [[Thomas Dudley]], father of [[Anne Bradstreet|Anne Dudley Bradstreet]] (1612–72), brought a copy of Crowley's ''Piers Plowman'' to America. [[Alexander Pope]] (1688–1744) owned a copy of Rogers' reprint of Crowley's edition of ''Piers Plowman'' with the ''Crede'' appended, and [[Isaac D'Israeli]] (1766–1848) wrote in his ''Amenities of Literature'' that Pope had "very carefully analyzed the whole" of the latter text. D'Israeli also mentions [[Lord Byron]]'s (1788–1824) praise for ''Piers Plowman''.

===19th–20th-21st centuries===
With its old language and alien worldview, ''Piers Plowman'' fell into obscurity until the nineteenth century. Barring Rogers, after Crowley, the poem was not published in its entirety until [[Thomas Dunham Whitaker|Thomas Whitaker]]'s 1813 edition. It emerged at a time when amateur [[Philology|philologists]] began the groundwork of what would later become a recognized scholarly discipline. Whitaker's edition was based on a C-text, whereas Crowley used a B-text for his base.

With Whitaker a modern editorial tradition began, with each new editor striving to present the "authentic" ''Piers Plowman'' and challenging the accuracy and authenticity of preceding editors and editions. Then, as before in the English Reformation, this project was driven by a need for a national identity and history that addressed present concerns, hence analysis and commentary typically reflected the critic's political views.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In the hands of [[Frederick Furnivall]] and W. W. Skeat, ''Piers Plowman'' could be, respectively, a consciousness-raising text in the Working Man's College or a patriotic text for [[grammar school]] pupils. ''Piers Plowman'' has often been read primarily as a political document. In an 1894 study, [[J. J. Jusserand]] was primarily concerned with what he saw as the poem's psychological and sociopolitical content—as distinct from the aesthetic or literary—in a dichotomy common to all modern humanistic studies.

In "Le temps des laboureurs. Travail, ordre social et croissance en Europe (XIe-XIVe siècle)" (Albin Michel 2012) historian of medieval labour Mathieu Arnoux devotes particular attention to "Piers Plowman" in a breakthrough attempt to identify theological causes for the growth of agricultural production from the 11th century to the 14th century.

{{main|Piers Plowman tradition}}

Many subsequent texts – at least 14 – use characters from ''Piers Plowman'', most often Piers himself. Many more texts were written with similar themes and characters, though not directly borrowing from ''Piers Plowman'', until around the end of the 16th century. Conversely, ''Piers Plowman'' was preceded by and contemporary with a number of similar works in the 14th and 15th centuries. Together, these are referred to as the "[[Piers Plowman tradition]]".

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

[[File:Swanage Punch &amp; Judy.JPG|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy booth, at [[Swanage]], Dorset, England]]

'''Punch and Judy''' is a traditional [[puppet]] show featuring Mr. Punch and his wife Judy. The performance consists of a sequence of short scenes, each depicting an interaction between two characters, most typically Mr. Punch and one other character who usually falls victim to Punch's slap stick. It is often associated with traditional [[British culture]].&lt;ref name="British seaside" /&gt; The various episodes of Punch comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—are dominated by the clowning of Mr. Punch.&lt;ref name="350 years"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr Punch celebrates 350 years of puppet anarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17895716|agency=BBC|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is performed by a single puppeteer inside the booth, known since Victorian times as a "professor" or "punchman", and assisted sometimes by a "bottler" who corrals the audience outside the booth, introduces the performance, and collects the money ("the bottle"). The bottler might also play accompanying music or sound effects on a drum or guitar, and engage in back chat with the puppets, sometimes repeating lines that may have been difficult for the audience to understand. In Victorian times, the drum and [[pan pipe]]s were the instruments of choice. Today, the audience is also encouraged to participate, calling out to the characters on the stage to warn them of danger or clue them in to what is going on behind their backs. Also nowadays, most professors work solo, since the need for a bottler became less important when [[busking]] with the show gave way to paid engagements at private parties or public events.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote="[Pulcinella] went down particularly well with Restoration British audiences, fun-starved after years of [[Puritanism]]. We soon changed Punch's name, transformed him from a marionette to a hand puppet, and he became, really, a spirit of Britain – a subversive maverick who defies authority, a kind of puppet equivalent to our political cartoons." |source=—Punch and Judy showman Glyn Edwards.&lt;ref name="British seaside"&gt;{{cite news|title=Punch and Judy around the world |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/7949781/Punch-and-Judy-around-the-world.html|work=The Telegraph|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Punch and Judy show has roots in the 16th-century Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. The figure of Punch is derived from the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] stock character of [[Pulcinella]], which was [[anglicized]] to ''Punchinello''.&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"&gt;{{cite EB1911|last=Wheeler|first=R. Mortimer|wstitle=Punch (puppet)|title=Punch|volume=22|pages=648–649}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]] figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally called "Joan."
[[File:Punch Plaque Covent Garden.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Plaque commemorating the first recorded performance of Punch and Judy on [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]] in [[Covent Garden]]]]

The figure who later became Mr. Punch made his first recorded appearance in England on 9 May 1662, which is traditionally reckoned as Punch's UK birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Watson. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2141622/Thats-way-Mr-Punch-celebrates-350-years-recorded-time-diary-Samuel-Pepys.html "That's the way to do it! Mr Punch celebrate 350 years since being recorded for the first time in the diary of Samuel Pepys"], ''The Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; The diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] observed a [[marionette]] show featuring an early version of the Punch character in [[Covent Garden]] in London. It was performed by Italian puppet showman Pietro Gimonde, a.k.a. "Signor Bologna." Pepys described the event in his diary as "an Italian puppet play, that is within the rails there, which is very pretty."

In the British Punch and Judy show, Punch wears a brightly coloured [[jester]]'s [[motley]] and [[Capotain|sugarloaf hat]] with a tassel. He is a [[hunchback]] whose hooked nose almost meets his curved, jutting chin. He carries a stick (called a slapstick) as large as himself, which he freely uses upon most of the other characters in the show. He speaks in a distinctive squawking voice, produced by a contrivance known as a ''[[swazzle]]'' or ''swatchel'' which the professor holds in his mouth, transmitting his gleeful cackle. This gives Punch a vocal quality as though he were speaking through a [[kazoo]]. So important is Punch's signature sound that it is a matter of some controversy within Punch and Judy circles as to whether a "non-swazzled" show can be considered a true Punch and Judy Show. Other characters do not use the swazzle, so the Punchman has to switch back and forth while still holding the device in his mouth.

In the early 18th century, the marionette theatre starring Punch was at its height, with showman [[Martin Powell (puppetry)|Martin Powell]] attracting sizable crowds at both his ''Punch's Theatre'' at Covent Garden and earlier in provincial [[Bath, Somerset]].&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"/&gt; Powell has been credited with being "largely responsible for the form taken by the drama of Punch and Judy".&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Powell, Martin|first=Thomas| last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, a puppet theatre opened in [[Dublin]] that ran for decades. The cross-dressing actress [[Charlotte Charke]] ran the successful but short-lived Punch's Theatre in the Old Tennis Court at [[St. James's]], [[Westminster]], presenting adaptations of [[Shakespeare]] as well as plays by herself, her father [[Colley Cibber]], and her friend [[Henry Fielding]]. Fielding eventually ran his own puppet theatre under the pseudonym Madame de la Nash to avoid the censorship concomitant with the Theatre [[Licensing Act of 1737]].

Punch was extremely popular in [[Paris]] and, by the end of the 18th century, he was also playing in Britain's American colonies,&lt;!---By the end of the 18th century, Britain didn't HAVE any American colonies---&gt; where even [[George Washington]] bought tickets for a show. However, marionette productions were expensive and cumbersome to mount and transport, presented in empty halls, the back rooms of [[taverns]], or within large tents at England's yearly agricultural events at [[Bartholomew Fair]] and [[Mayfair]]. In the latter half of the 18th century, marionette companies began to give way to glove-puppet shows, performed from within a narrow, lightweight booth by one puppeteer, usually with an assistant, or "bottler," to gather a crowd and collect money. These shows might travel through country towns or move from corner to corner along busy London streets, giving many performances in a single day. The character of Punch adapted to the new format, going from a stringed comedian who might say outrageous things to a more aggressive glove-puppet who could do outrageous—and often violent—things to the other characters. About this time, Punch's wife's name changed from "Joan" to "Judy."
[[File:Punch and Judy Thornton Hough.jpg|thumb|left|A Punch and Judy show attracts a family audience In [[Thornton Hough]], Merseyside, England]]

The mobile puppet booth of the late 18th- and early 19th-century Punch and Judy [[Hand puppet|glove-puppet]] show was originally covered in checked bed ticking or whatever inexpensive cloth might come to hand. Later Victorian booths were gaudier affairs, particularly those used for Christmas parties and other indoor performances. In the 20th century, however, red-and-white-striped puppet booths became iconic features on the beaches of many English seaside and summer holiday resorts. Such striped cloth is the most common covering today, wherever the show might be performed.

A more substantial change came over time to the show's [[target audience]]. The show was originally intended for adults, but it changed into primarily a children's entertainment in the late Victorian era. Ancient members of the show's cast ceased to be included, such as the [[Devil]] and Punch's mistress "Pretty Polly," when they came to be seen as inappropriate for young audiences.

The story changes, but some phrases remain the same for decades or even centuries. For example, Punch dispatches his foes each in turn and still squeaks his famous catchphrase: "''That's'' the way to do it!"&lt;ref name="350 years" /&gt; The term "pleased as Punch" is derived from Punch and Judy; specifically, Mr. Punch's characteristic sense of gleeful self-satisfaction.

Modern British performances of Punch and Judy are no longer exclusively the traditional [[seaside resort|seaside]] children's entertainments which they had become. They can now be seen at carnivals, festivals, birthday parties, and other celebratory occasions.

==Characters==
[[File:Islington Punch and Judy.JPG|thumb|Punch and Judy, taken in [[Islington]], north London.]]
The characters in a Punch and Judy show are not fixed. They are similar to the cast of a [[soap opera]] or a [[Folklore|folk tale]] such as [[Robin Hood]]: the principal characters must appear, but the lesser characters are included at the discretion of the performer. New characters may be added and older characters dropped as the tradition changes.

Along with Punch and Judy, the cast of characters usually includes their baby, a hungry crocodile, a clown, an officious policeman, and a prop string of sausages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140814/http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 November 2010 |title=A Brief History of Punch and Judy (with an introduction to the characters) |publisher=Speckinspace.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The devil and the generic hangman [[Jack Ketch]] may still make their appearances but, if so, Punch will always get the better of them. The cast of a typical Punch and Judy show today will include:
* Mr. Punch
* Judy
* The Baby
* The Constable
* Joey the Clown
* The Crocodile
* The Skeleton
* The Doctor

Characters once regular but now occasional include:
* Toby the Dog
* The Ghost
* The Lawyer
* Hector the Horse
* Pretty Polly
* The Hangman (a.k.a. Jack Ketch)
* The Devil
* The Beadle
* Jim Crow  ('The black man')
* Mr. Scaramouche
* The Servant (or 'The Minstrel')
* The Blind Man

Other characters included Boxers, Chinese Plate Spinners, topical figures, a trick puppet with an extending neck (the "Courtier"), and a monkey. A live Dog Toby was once a regular featured novelty routine, sitting on the playboard and performing 'with' the puppets.

==Story==
Glyn Edwards has likened the story of Punch and Judy to the story of [[Cinderella]].&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful"&gt;Edwards, Glyn. (2000) ''Successful Punch and Judy'', Second Edition 2011. Worthing: The Fedora Group. {{ISBN|9780956718914}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that there are parts of the Cinderella story which everyone knows, namely the cruel step sisters, the invitation to the ball, the handsome prince, the fairy godmother, Cinderella's dress turning to rags at midnight, the glass slipper left behind, the prince searching for its owner, and the happy ending. None of these elements can be omitted and the famous story still be told. The same principle applies to Punch and Judy. Everyone knows that Punch mishandles the baby, that Punch and Judy quarrel and fight, that a policeman comes for Punch and gets a taste of his stick, that Punch has a gleeful run-in with a variety of other figures and takes his stick to them all, that eventually he faces his final foe (which might be a hangman, the devil, a crocodile, or a ghost). Edwards contends that a proper Punch and Judy show requires these elements or the audience will feel let down.&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful" /&gt;

Peter Fraser writes, "the drama developed as a succession of incidents which the audience could join or leave at any time, and much of the show was impromptu."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Peter (1970) ''Punch and Judy''. London: B.T Batsford. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. {{ISBN|0-7134-2284-X}}. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 71-110085. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was elaborated by [[George Speaight]], who explained that the plotline "is like a story compiled in a parlour game of [[Consequences (game)|Consequences]]&amp;nbsp;... the show should, indeed, not be regarded as a story at all but a succession of encounters."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. (1955) ''Punch and Judy: A History'', Revised Edition 1970. London: Studio Vista Ltd. {{ISBN|0-289-79785-3}}. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Leach makes it clear that "the story is a conceptual entity, not a set text: the means of telling it, therefore, are always variable."&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Robert. (1985) ''The Punch &amp; Judy Show: History, Tradition and Meaning''. London: Batsford Academic and Educational; Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0713447842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalind Crone asserts that the story needed to be episodic so that passersby on the street could easily join or leave the audience during a performance.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"&gt;Crone, Rosalind (2006). "Mr and Mrs Punch in Nineteenth-Century England." ''The Historical Journal'', 49(4) pp. 1055–1082.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much emphasis is often placed on the first printed script of Punch and Judy, in 1827. It was based on a show by travelling performer Giovanni Piccini, illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]], and written by [[John Payne Collier]]. This is the only surviving script of a performance, and its accuracy is questioned. The performance was stopped frequently to allow Collier and Cruikshank to write and sketch and, in the words of Speaight, Collier is someone of whom "the full list of his forgeries has not yet been reckoned, and the myths he propagated are still being repeated. (His) 'Punch and Judy' is to be warmly welcomed as the first history of puppets in England, but it is also sadly to be examined as the first experiment of a literary criminal."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight (1970), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale of Punch and Judy varies from puppeteer to puppeteer, as previously with Punchinello and Joan, and it has changed over time. Nonetheless, the skeletal outline is often recognizable. It typically involves Punch behaving outrageously, struggling with his wife Judy and the baby, and then triumphing in a series of encounters with the forces of law and order (and often the supernatural), interspersed with jokes and songs.

===Typical 21st-century performance===
A typical show as performed currently in the UK will start with the arrival of Mr. Punch, followed by the introduction of Judy. They may well kiss and dance before Judy requests Mr. Punch to look after the baby. Punch will fail to carry out this task appropriately. It is rare for Punch to hit his baby these days, but he may well sit on it in a failed attempt to "babysit", or drop it, or even let it go through a sausage machine. In any event, Judy will return, will be outraged, will fetch a stick, and the knockabout will commence. A policeman will arrive in response to the mayhem and will himself be felled by Punch's slapstick. All this is carried out at breakneck farcical speed with much involvement from a gleefully shouting audience. From here on anything goes.

Joey the Clown might appear and suggest, "It's dinner time." This will lead to the production of a string of sausages, which Mr. Punch must look after, although the audience will know that this really signals the arrival of a crocodile whom Mr. Punch might not see until the audience shouts out and lets him know. Punch's subsequent comic struggle with the crocodile might then leave him in need of a Doctor who will arrive and attempt to treat Punch by walloping him with a stick until Punch turns the tables on him. Punch may next pause to count his "victims" by laying puppets on the stage, only for Joey the Clown to move them about behind his back in order to frustrate him. A ghost might then appear and give Mr. Punch a fright before it too is chased off with a [[slapstick]].

In less squeamish times, a hangman would arrive to punish Mr. Punch, only to himself be tricked into sticking his head in the noose. "Do you do the hanging?" is a question often asked of performers. Some will include it where circumstances warrant (such as for an adult audience) but most do not. Some will choose to include it whatever the circumstances and will face down any critics. Finally, the show will often end with the Devil arriving for Mr. Punch (and possibly to threaten his audience as well). Punch—in his final gleefully triumphant moment—will win his fight with the Devil, bring the show to a rousing conclusion, and earn a round of applause.

===Plots reflect their own era===

[[File:Hitler Punch and Judy Show.jpg|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy show dating from [[World War II]] with the addition of a [[Hitler]] Character as a figure of derision to reflect the times. Taken at the [[History On Wheels Museum]], [[Eton Wick]], UK.]]
Punch and Judy might follow no fixed storyline, as with the tales of Robin Hood, but there are episodes common to many recorded versions. It is these set piece encounters or "routines" which are used by performers to construct their own Punch and Judy shows. A visit to a Punch and Judy Festival at Punch's "birthplace" in London's Covent Garden will reveal a whole variety of changes that are wrung by puppeteers from this basic material. Scripts have been published at different times since the early 19th century, but none can be claimed as the definitive traditional script of Punch and Judy. Each printed script reflects the era in which it was performed and the circumstances under which it was printed.

The various episodes of the show are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Just as the Victorian version of the show drew on the morality of its day, so also the Punch &amp; Judy College of Professors considers that the 20th- and 21st-century versions of the tale have changed into something akin to a primitive version of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which a bizarre family is used as a vehicle for grotesque visual comedy and a sideways look at contemporary society.

{{quote|In my opinion the street Punch is one of those extravagant reliefs from the realities of life which would lose its hold upon the people if it were made moral and instructive. I regard it as quite harmless in its influence, and as an outrageous joke which no one in existence would think of regarding as an incentive to any kind of action or as a model for any kind of conduct. It is possible, I think, that one secret source of pleasure very generally derived from this performance… is the satisfaction the spectator feels in the circumstance that likenesses of men and women can be so knocked about, without any pain or suffering.|[[Charles Dickens]]|Letter to Mary Tyler, 6 November 1849, from ''The [[Letters of Charles Dickens]] Vol V, 1847–1849''}}

An awareness of the prevalence of domestic abuse, and how Punch and Judy could be seen to make light of this, threatened Punch and Judy performances in the UK and other English-speaking countries for a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Puppet show faces knockout punch? |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/502752.stm |accessdate=3 September 2008 |date=8 November 1999 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the show is having one of its cyclical recurrences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |title=around the world with mr. punch » Silly-Season-On-Sea |publisher=Punchandjudyworld.org |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223201406/http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can now be seen in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Ireland]]—and also in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Puerto Rico]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]].

==Comedy==
Despite Punch’s unapologetic murders throughout the performances, it is still a comedy. The humour is aided by a few things. Rosalind Crone (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1065) suggests that, since the puppets are carved from wood, their facial expressions cannot change, but are stuck in the same exaggerated pose, which helps to deter any sense of realism and to distance the audience.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; The use of the swazzle also helps to create humour, and that the swazzled sound of Punch's voice takes the cruelty out of Punch.&lt;ref&gt;Proschan, Frank (1981). "Puppet Voices and Interlocutors: Language in Folk Puppetry." ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 94, No. 374, Folk Drama (Oct.–Dec. 1981), pp.527–555. The American Folklore Society.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crone, a third aspect that helped make the violence humorous was that Punch's violence toward his wife was prompted by her own violence toward him.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; In this aspect, he retains some of his previous hen-pecked persona. This would suggest that, since Punch was merely acting violently out of self-defence, it was okay. This is a possible explanation for the humour of his violence toward his wife, and even towards others who may have somehow "had it coming."&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; This suggestion better explains the humour of the violence toward the baby. Other characters that had to incur the wrath of Punch varied depending on the punchman, but the most common were the foreigner, the blind man, the publican, the constable, and the devil.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"/&gt;

==Published scripts==
Punch is primarily an oral tradition, adapted by a succession of exponents from live performances rather than authentic scripts, and in constant evolution. There exist, however, some early published scripts of varying authenticity.

In 1828, the critic [[John Payne Collier]] published a Punch and Judy script under the title ''The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyrock.com/nadafarm/html/punch_pdf.html |title=Punch &amp; Judy: 1832 Book pdf file |publisher=Spyrock.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was illustrated by the well-known caricaturist [[George Cruikshank]]. Collier said his script was based on the version performed by the "professor" Giovanni Piccini in the early 19th century, and Piccini himself had begun performing in the streets of London in the late 18th century. The Collier/Cruickshank ''Punch'' has been republished in facsimile several times. Collier's later career as a literary forger has cast some doubt on the authenticity of the script, which is rather literary in style and may well have been tidied up from the rough-and-tumble street-theatre original. 

A transcript of a typical Punch and Judy show in [[London]] of the 1840s can be found in [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''London Labour and the London Poor''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2640">The '''Rozz Tox Manifesto''' is a 1980 [[essay]] by visual artist [[Gary Panter]] in which Panter rejects the notion of the [[artist]] as [[bohemian]]; instead, an artist is encouraged to work within [[capitalism]] to reach a larger market.

==Selected Quotes==
* "It is unfortunate and unacceptable what vile and lazy do-nothings are given unwarranted credence for mouthing such foul and mean clichés as 'rip-off' and 'sell-out.' They have no understanding of our economy and the time it takes society to go. Confess and shut up! Capitalism good or ill is the river in which we sink or swim. Inspiration has always been born of recombination."
* "In a capitalistic society such as the one in which we live, [[aesthetics]] as an endeavor flows thorough a body which is built of free enterprise and various illnesses. In boom times art may be supported by wildcat speculation or by excess funds in form of grants from the state or patronship as a tax write-off. Currently we are suffering from a lean economy. By necessity we must infiltrate popular mediums. We are building a business-based art movement. This is not new. Admitting it is."
* "Waiting for art [[talent scout]]s? There are no art talent scouts. Face it, no one will seek you out."
* "Law: If you want better media, go make it."

==Effects on Culture==
The essay influenced Panter's friend [[Matt Groening]], who later went on to become the creator of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

In [[Matt Howarth]]'s comic ''[[Stalking Ralph]]'', the musical group [[The Residents]] are portrayed as being created by a "Rozz Tox Virus", whose ultimate goal is to constantly mutate to avoid becoming part of [[mainstream]] culture.  While the text of the manifesto does not appear in the comic, an alien creature declares, "The [[underground (culture)|underground]] becomes the [[The Establishment|establishment]]", and that the reason The Residents change their band identity so often is to remain underground and to avoid becoming establishment. Howarth's interpretation of Rozz Tox is different from Groening's.  While Groening has worked within a capitalist system to create and to perpetuate successful [[merchandising]], Howarth's characters are specifically avoiding "selling out" and avoiding popular acceptance.

'''Shaped canvases''' are [[painting]]s that depart from the normal flat, rectangular configuration. [[Canvas]]es may be shaped by altering their outline, while retaining their flatness. An ancient, traditional example is the ''[[Tondo (art)|tondo]]'', a painting on a round panel or canvas: [[Raphael]], as well as some other Renaissance painters, sometimes chose this format for [[Madonna (art)|madonna]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistory.about.com/od/renaissanceart/l/bl_debrecy_tondo.htm Arthistory.about.com] page on Raphael's "de Brécy" tondo canvas painting&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, canvases may be altered by losing their flatness and assuming a three-dimensional surface. Or, they can do both. That is, they can assume shapes other than rectangles, and also have surface features that are three-dimensional. Arguably, changing the surface configuration of the painting transforms it into a sculpture. But shaped canvases are generally considered paintings.

Apart from any aesthetic considerations, there are technical matters, having to do with the very nature of canvas as a material, that tend to support the flat rectangle as the norm for paintings on canvas. (See [[#Departing from the rectangular|Departing from the rectangular]] below.)

In the literature of art history and criticism, the term ''shaped canvas'' is particularly associated with certain works created mostly in New York after about 1960, during a period when a great variety and quantity of such works were produced. According to the commentary at a [[Rutgers University]] exhibition site, "... the first significant art historical attention paid to shaped canvases occurred in the 1960s...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zamweb.rutgers.edu/exhibitions/?id=41 Image of a 1935 Abraham Joel Tobias shaped-canvas painting at the Zimmerli Art Museum] ([[Rutgers University]])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pioneers of modern shaped-canvas painting ==
Abraham Joel Tobias made "shaped canvases" in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, Jeffrey;  Abraham Joel Tobias;  Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum.;  Queens Museum. [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/18137181?tab=details ''Abraham Joel Tobias : sculptural paintings of the 1930s''] (New Brunswick, N.J. : The Museum, 1987) OCLC 18137181&lt;/ref&gt; Uruguayan artist Rhod Rothfuss began to experience with "marco irregular" paintings in 1942, late in 1944 publish in Arturo magazine your seminal text "El marco: un problema de la plástica actual" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/aw_rel.asp?ID_Gallery=11&amp;CountOrder=4 Colección Cisneros] "Arlequin 1944"&lt;/ref&gt; Munich-born painter Rupprecht Geiger exhibited "shaped canvases" in 1948 in Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenbachhaus.de/cms/index.php?id=53&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=62&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1&amp;cHash=dffe792541 Lenbachhaus – Rupprecht Geiger zum 100.

Geburtstag&lt;/ref&gt;
Paintings exhibited by the [[New Orleans]] born abstract painter [[Edward Clark (artist)|Edward Clark]] shown at New York's [[Tenth Street galleries#Brata Gallery|Brata Gallery]] in 1957 have also been termed shaped canvas paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/edward-clark-41|title=Edward Clark – The HistoryMakers|work=thehistorymakers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2230 Metro Times Book review of ''Edward Clark: For the Sake of the Search'' in the Detroit Metro Times], stating that Clark is "widely credited with making the first extended shape painting (continuing the painting out of its rectangular frame with paper and wood) in 1956. "It wasn't called a shape painting then, just something strange and different that began with that painting," Clark said. The untitled work was shown in 1957 at the Brata Gallery..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the late 1950s through the mid-1960s [[Jasper Johns]] experimented with shaped and compartmentalized canvases, notably with his '[[American Flag]] [[Painting]]' – one canvas placed on top of another, larger canvas. [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s experimental [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]] and "combines" of the 1950s also explored variations of divided and shaped canvas. Argentine artist [[Lucio Fontana]] also began early on the experiment in shaped and compartmentalized canvases with his Concetto Spaziale, Attese series in 1959. Assigning a date to the origin of the postwar shaped canvas painting may not be possible&lt;!-- see this article's discussion page--&gt;, but certainly it had emerged by the late 1950s.

== Postwar modern art and the shaped canvas ==
Frances Colpitt ("The Shape of Painting in the 1960s"; ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]'', Spring 1991) states flatly that "the shaped canvas was the dominant form of abstract painting in the 1960s". She writes that the shaped canvas, "although frequently described as a hybrid of painting and sculpture, grew out of the issues of abstract painting and was evidence of the desire of painters to move into real space by rejecting behind-the-frame illusionism." .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/777086 ''The Shape of Paintings in the 1960s''] Retrieved June 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Charles Hinman]] [[Ronald Davis]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Leo Valledor]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[John Levee]], David Novros, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Gary Stephan]], Paul Mogenson, [[Clark Murray]], and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the shaped canvas during the period beginning in the early 1960s. [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[hard-edge]] painters may, for example, elect to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. There is a connection here with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacts against the [[abstract expressionist]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as their solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting.
While the shaped canvas first challenged the formalized rectangular shape of paintings, it soon questioned the constraints of two-dimensionality. According to [[Donald Judd]] in his ''Complete Writings'': 'The main thing wrong with painting is that it is a rectangular plane placed flat against the wall. A rectangle is a shape itself: it is obviously the whole shape; it determines and limits the arrangement of whatever is on or in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judd|first1=Donald|title=Complete Writings 1959–1975|date=1975|publisher=Halifax: Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design|pages=181-182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the Solomun R. [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] organised the definitive exhibition 'The Shaped Canvas" curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]]. [[Lucy Lippard]] noted that this show focused exclusively on paintings with a "one -sided continuous surface"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=James|title=Minimalism: Art and Polemics in the Sixties|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10590-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3EYlwvRzvwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Frank Stella]] and Frank Geldzahler confronted this definition of the shaped canvas by introducing three-dimensional shaped canvases by artists [[Charles Hinman]] and [[Will Insley]] in their seminal group show "Shape and Structure" at Tibor de Naguy in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, Meyer&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the third dimension by paintings was an important development of the shaped canvas as it questioned the frontier between painting and sculpture.

The apertured, superimposed, multiple canvases of [[Jane Frank]] in the 1960s and 1970s are a special case: while generally flat and rectangular, they are rendered sculptural by the presence of large, irregularly shaped holes in the forward canvas or canvases, through which one or more additional painted canvases can be seen. A student of [[Hans Hofmann]], and sharing his concern for pictorial depth as well as his reverence for nature, she also favors colors, textures, and shapes that are complex, nuanced, and organic or earthen – giving her work a brooding or introspective quality that further sets it apart from that of many other shaped-canvas painters.

In the late 1960s, [[Trevor Bell (artist)|Trevor Bell]], a leading member of the British [[St. Ives group]] introduced dynamic shaped-canvas paintings that combined radical, angular structures with an [[abstract expressionist]] sensibility. These works continued to evolve into the 1970s as Bell's works were exhibited in the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]] and The [[Tate]] Gallery in [[London]]. The artist’s highly chromatic, [[color field]] surfaces on massive canvases merged shaped painting and the subsequent blank space surrounding the object into a state of equal importance. The Italian artist [[Luigi Malice]]&lt;ref&gt;Barbera, Lucio, ''[[:it:Luigi Malice|Luigi Malice]]: Percorsi della memoria 1959–1999'', Roma: Gangemi Editore, 1999 {{ISBN|88-7448-906-4}} [http://www.gangemieditore.com/scheda_articolo.php?id_prodotto=2914&amp;id_autore=1011]&lt;/ref&gt; also experimented with shaped canvases in the late 1960s.

[[Pop art]]ists such as [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[James Rosenquist]] also took up the shaped canvas medium. Robin Landa writes that "Wesselmann uses the shape of the container [by which Landa means the canvas] to express the organic quality of smoke" in his "smoker" paintings.&lt;ref name="Landa"&gt;Landa, Robin. ''An Introduction to Design'', Inglewood: Prentis Hall, 1983 {{ISBN|0-13-480624-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colpitt, however, the use of the shaped canvas by 1960s pop artists was considered at the time to be something other than shaped canvas painting properly speaking: "At the same time, not all reliefs qualified as shaped canvases, which, as an ideological pursuit in the sixties, tended to exclude Pop art." (op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;52)

== More recent shaped canvas art ==
Among shaped-canvas artists of more recent generations, [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]] (1940–2007) produced playfully "exploding" canvases, in which exuberance of shape and color seems to force itself outside the normative rectangle – or, as a 1981 ''New York Times'' review put it: "...the inner shapes blast off from their moorings and cause the whole painting to fly apart." &lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E1DB1738F93BA35756C0A967948260  NY Times review: "Art: Exploding Canvases of Elizabeth Murray"], May 8, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore's [[Anthony Poon]] (1945–2006) continued the tradition of cool, abstract, minimalist geometry associated with the shaped canvas in the 1960s. The analytical poise and undulating repetitions in his work somewhat recall the work of [[modular constructivist]] sculptors such as [[Erwin Hauer]] and [[Norman Carlberg]].

The Filipino artist [[Pacita Abad]] (1946–2004) stuffed and stitched her painted canvases for a three-dimensional effect, combining this technique (which she called ''[[trapunto]]'', after a kind of [[quilt]]ing technique) with free-wheeling [[mixed media]] effects, riotous color, and abstract patterning suggestive of festive homemade textiles, or of party trappings such as streamers, balloons, or confetti. The total effect is joyously extrovert and warm – quite opposed to both the minimalist and pop art versions of "cool".

In reference to the shaped paintings of [[Jack Reilly (artist)|Jack Reilly]] (born 1950), Robin Landa emphasizes the power of the shaped canvas to create a sensation of movement: "Many contemporary artists feel that the arena of painting can be greatly extended by the use of shaped canvases. Movement is established in the container (canvas) itself as well as in the internal space of the container."&lt;ref name="Landa" /&gt; A 1981 review in ''Artweek'' stated "These intricately constructed pieces are related to wall sculpture, bridging the gap between painting and sculpture, they have an illusionary sculptural presence."&lt;ref name="Artweek"&gt;Jaconson, Linda. ''Two Dimensional Reliefs'', Artweek, Vol.12, Nov 21, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional function of the shaped canvas in Reilly's earlier work was to emphasize the ambiguity of pictorial space in [[abstract art]].

The Argentine artist Ladislao Pablo Győri (born 1963) became interested in non-representative and rigorous geometry formulations in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lpgyori.net/ lpgyori.net Győri's ''digital works, art and poetry, 1984/2003, Madí Paintings-Relief'']&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the paintings of the aforementioned Rhod Rothfuss led him to work in the realization of Madí Turning Paintings-Relief (irregular frame) and 3D digital animations of those geometric structures. [[Gyula Kosice]] (sculptor, poet, theorist, and one of the founders of the Argentine avant-garde of the 1940s) wrote: "He has rationally computerized the primordial ideas of Madi Art... I am convinced that his works radiate an undeniable quality and originality."&lt;ref name="f25vy"&gt;Győri, Ladislao Pablo. ''First 25 Visual Years'', ARTgentina, 2010, p. 29, {{ISBN|978-987-05-8040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-rectangular paintings==
Artists have often departed from the norm, especially in circumstances requiring special commissions, an example being the paintings [[Henri Matisse]] created for [[Albert C. Barnes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/jholt/archives/001911.html Barnes mural] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720033955/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/jholt/archives/001911.html |date=2011-07-20 }}. Accessed August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Nelson Rockefeller]].

In certain instances shaped canvas paintings can be seen as painting in relationship to sculpture and to wall relief. During the early to mid-1960s many young painters born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s made the transition from painting flat rectangles to painting shaped canvases; some of those artists decided to make sculpture and some artists like [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Frank Stella]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]] did both. Other materials can be used in place of canvas. More viable materials might obviate some of the drawbacks of shaped canvas.

'''''Siberia''''' is an American supernatural drama series shot in the style of a reality television show where 14 contestants must survive in the Siberian territory of [[Tunguska event|Tunguska]]. Shortly after arrival, the contestants notice strange things and are abandoned by the production of the reality show. The show was filmed in [[Birds Hill Provincial Park]] just north of [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2353073/NBC-Siberia-scorned-Russians-frozen-Cold-War-time-warp.html New NBC show Siberia is scorned by Russians for stereotyping and being 'frozen in a Cold War time warp'], Will Stewart, Daily Mail, July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered on [[NBC]] on July 1, 2013.

It was met with generally favorable reviews from critics and viewers, with average viewership per episode coming in around 2.03 million viewers. [[Metacritic]] scored the show with a 63 out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/siberia|title=Siberia Season 1 Review|work=Metacritic|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season concluded on September 16, 2013. The show was independently financed and only licensed to NBC and therefore has not been officially cancelled. The producers are in talks to renew the series either on NBC or another platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/Siberia/comments/3hhyp3/im_so_confused_about_whether_or_not_season_2_will/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Sixteen reality-show contestants, each hoping to win $500,000, arrive in a Siberian forest to take part in a reality show. Two are immediately eliminated, and 14 settle in for the contest. The unexpected death of a fellow contestant throws them off, but they eventually all accept it as an accident. Strange events continue to happen, and when a contestant is injured and no help arrives, they realize they will have to band together to survive in a land they do not understand. More unusual events happen that parallel the ones natives experienced 100 years earlier during the [[Tunguska event]].

The show is described as having a "''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''-meets-''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' premise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/06/07/nbc-siberia-trailer/|title=NBC's 'Siberia' trailer: It's 'Lost' meets 'Survivor' -- EXCLUSIVE|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=June 7, 2013 |work=InsideTV|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is compared to ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and ''[[The River (U.S. TV series)|The River]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/siberia-review-nbc-1200502591/ |title=Review: "Siberia" |last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=June 28, 2013|work=Variety|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| ShortSummary    = Season finale. A squad of Russian black ops soldiers arrives at the research station to kill the reunited contestants but is attacked by the Valleymen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23252">'''The Twelve of England''' (in Portuguese: '''''Os Doze de Inglaterra''''') is a [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[chivalry|chivalric]] legend of 15th-century origin, famously related by the poet [[Luís de Camões]] in his 1572 ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' (Canto VI). It tells the story of twelve Portuguese knights who travelled to England at the request of twelve English ladies to avenge their insult by a group of English knights.

== Legend ==
According to the legend, in the 1390s, twelve [[Kingdom of England|English]] knights insulted&lt;ref&gt;Camões does not make the content of the insult explicit; but Pedro de Mariz (1598) and Manuel Correia (1613) say the English knights simply called the ladies "very ugly" - too ugly to be loved, and too ugly to serve in the ducal household, and challenged any man to prove them wrong. Camões insinuates the insult arose only after the ladies refused to yield to the knights' advances.&lt;/ref&gt; twelve [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]] of the household of the Duchess of Lancaster. The ladies appealed to their master, [[John of Gaunt]], [[Duke of Lancaster]], but he was unable to find any English champions to defend the honor of the ladies. The twelve offending knights, renowned for their martial prowess, were too widely feared. Recalling his Iberian campaigns of the 1370s and 1380s, and the bravery of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] knights he encountered there, Lancaster recommended that they search for a champion among them.

In one version of the legend,&lt;ref&gt;de Mariz (1598: [https://books.google.com/books?id=aSSNbW3vzAQC&amp;pg=PT326#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.140])&lt;/ref&gt; John of Gaunt wrote down the names of twelve Portuguese knights from memory, had the ladies draw lots to be matched with a knight, and then had each of the ladies write a letter of appeal to their champion. John of Gaunt wrote a separate letter himself to his son-in-law, [[John I of Portugal]], asking him to grant the Portuguese knights permission to travel to England for this noble endeavor.

(In another version, related in [[Teófilo Braga]]'s poem, John the Gaunt made an open request to John I, and scores of Portuguese knights applied, from which twelve were selected from an urn by Queen [[Philippa of Lancaster]] in [[Sintra]].&lt;ref&gt;Braga, 1902: [https://books.google.com/books?id=boYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Doze%20de%20Inglaterra%22%20Fernao%20Lopes&amp;pg=PA95#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.95]&lt;/ref&gt; Their exact match with an English lady was sorted later - John of Gaunt shuffled the anonymous chivalric mottoes of the twelve knights, and had each of the twelve ladies select one, only learning the exact identify of their champion afterwards.)&lt;ref&gt;Braga, (1902, [https://books.google.com/books?id=boYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false, p.207])&lt;/ref&gt;

The twelve were scheduled to set out by ship from [[Porto]], but one of them, [[Álvaro Gonçalves Coutinho]], nicknamed ''o Magriço'' told the others to go ahead without him, that he would make his way overland via Spain and France.

The eleven knights set sail from Porto and landed in England, where they were well received in London by the Duke of Lancaster and the ladies, but there was great nervousness about whether Magriço would arrive on time. Magriço travelled overland at a languid pace, taking time to meander on the route, and visit various curious locations along the way.

When the day of the [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] arrived, legendarily held at [[Smithfield, London]],&lt;ref&gt;Braga, 1902: p.300&lt;/ref&gt; there was still no news of Magriço, leaving the damsel destined to be defended by him (named 'Ethwalda' in one version) quite distraught. But just as the fight was about to be enjoined, Magriço arrived on the scene with great fanfare, just in time to take his position alongside his compatriots, heartening the distressed lady.

The twelve Portuguese champions successfully dispatched the offending English knights that day, in what was characterized as an unusually hard and brutal fight. The ladies' honor was successfully defended. But a few of the English knights had been killed in the tournament field, and in the aftermath, the Portuguese were threatened with revenge by the friends of the fallen. Fearful of being betrayed if they lingered in England, the Portuguese knights applied to John of Gaunt to secure them passage back to Portugal quickly. However, Magriço, still possessed by a spirit of adventure, decided to linger on in northern Europe, and eventually entered the service of the [[Count of Flanders]] for some time. [[Álvaro Vaz de Almada, 1st Count of Avranches|Álvaro Vaz de Almada]] also went on adventures in continental Europe (legendarily engaging in a duel with a German knight in [[Basel]]).

== Origins ==
The legend of the "Twelve of England" was famously related by Portuguese poet [[Luís de Camões]] in his 1572 epic poem ''[[Os Lusíadas]]''. In Canto VI, Stanzas 40-69, while [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|fleet]] was crossing the Indian Ocean, a soldier named Fernão Veloso&lt;ref&gt;Fernão Veloso is a historical figure, see [[João de Barros]], ''Decadas da Asia'' (1552), Dec. I, Lib. IV, Ch. II, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.283]&lt;/ref&gt; regales his fellow Portuguese sailors with the story of the "Twelve of England" to pass the time and inspire their bravery.&lt;ref&gt;In English translations, see W.J. Mickle, 1776, ''The Lusiad, or the discovery of India, an epic poem'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=6NUpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.247], T.M. Musgrave, 1826, ''The Lusiad, an epic poem'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qoDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.229]; R.F. Burton, 1880, ''The Lusiads'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=0IkGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.230], and J.J. Aubertin (trans.) 1878-84, ''The Lusiads of Camoens'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ogGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false vol. 2, p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have found some versions of the legend prior to Camões's telling, notably a mid-15th-century manuscript known as ''Cavalarias de Alguns Fidalgos Portugueses''.&lt;ref&gt;''Cavalaria'' was first published in Magalhães Basto (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcelos]]'s 1567 ''Memorial das Proezas da Segunda Tavola Redonda'' (which precedes Camões by a few years) briefly mentions that 'thirteen' (not twelve) Portuguese knights were dispatched to England "to defend the ladies of the Duke of Lancaster".&lt;ref&gt;Vasconcelos ''Memorial'' (1567: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zbXBWiM6FkYC&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ch. 46, p.234])&lt;/ref&gt; The summaries by [[Pedro de Mariz]] (1598) and [[Manuel Correia]] (1613), although published after Camões, seem to rest on pre-Camões sources.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro de Mariz (1598 [https://books.google.com/books?id=aSSNbW3vzAQC&amp;pg=PT326#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.140]); Manuel Correia (1613: [https://books.google.com/books?id=O8SZR8-HH9YC&amp;pg=RA2-PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.175]&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was retold in various versions after Camões, with occasional embellishments and variations.&lt;ref&gt;See Costa (1935) and Hutchinson (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The twelve===
The identities of the twelve of the legend have been subject to speculation. An early 17th-century commentator [[Manuel Correia]] names five (Coutinho, Almada, Agostim, Lopo Pacheco, and Pedro Homem)&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Correia (1613: [https://books.google.com/books?id=O8SZR8-HH9YC&amp;pg=RA2-PA175-IA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.175]&lt;/ref&gt; while the remaining seven were identified in a 1732 tract by Védouro.&lt;ref&gt;[[Teófilo Braga]] (1874: [https://books.google.com/books?id=K7kGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA433#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 433-34]; 1902: [https://books.google.com/books?id=boYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Doze%20de%20Inglaterra%22%20Fernao%20Lopes&amp;pg=PA95#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.95],[https://books.google.com/books?id=boYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.298]); Pimentel (1891, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fGQuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.141ff]). Curiously, these authors seemed to have overlooked the account of José Soares da Silva, whose 1732 ''Memórias para a Historia de Portugal'' (vol. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v16BO2fh6ngC&amp;pg=PA367#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ch. 281, p.1364]), also supplies a complete list as well as a few more details about the twelve. For a rough English translation of Silva's text, see T.M. Musgrave's note in 1826 trans. ''The Lusiad: An epic poem''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7qoDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA494#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.494]&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Portuguese noble families would later claim an ancestor of theirs was among the twelve, expanding the list enormously, the following is most generally accepted list of the twelve:

(Musgrave 1826 trans., [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qoDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA495#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.495])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See genealogy of [http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=39062 João Pereira da Cunha Agostim] at GeneAll.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Common alternates to the above list are:

* [[:pt:João Fernandes Pacheco|João Fernandes Pacheco]], lord of [[Ferreira de Aves]], brother of [[:pt:Lopo Fz Pacheco|Lopo Fernandes Pacheco]],&lt;ref&gt;Genealogy of [http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=12552 João Fernandes Pacheco]&lt;/ref&gt; progenitor of the [[Duke of Escalona|Dukes of Escalona]] in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]&lt;ref name = silva/&gt; - commonly substituted in place of Almada 'o Justador'.&lt;ref&gt;Almada 'o Justador' is wholly omitted and definitively replaced with João Fernandes Pacheco by José da Fonseca in his 1846 Paris edition of ''Lusiadas'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0JEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA508#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.508]. See Pimentel, 1891: p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vasco Annes da Costa]], the first named "[[Corte-Real family|Corte-Real]]", ''fronteiro-mor'' of [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]] in the [[Algarve]], ancestor of the Corte-Real explorers and captains of [[Terceira Island]] of the [[Azores]] - to bring the number up to 'thirteen', as originally stated by Vasconcelos.&lt;ref&gt;Corte-Real's presence among the twelve was first proposed by Francisco Soares Toscano in his 1623 ''Parallelos de Principes e Varoens Illustres'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=nedHAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.193]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Teófilo Braga]]'s 1902 poem, the twelve English knights are named as Austin (killed in the opening fight by Álvaro Vaz de Almada), Athelard, Blundell, Loveday, Argenton, Clarency, Corleville, Otenel, Turneville, Morley, Glaston and Reginald (who fought Magriço in the last fight).&lt;ref&gt;T. Braga, 1902: [https://books.google.com/books?id=boYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.203-04]&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve English ladies are also named: Adhelm, Egberte, Oswalda, Jorceline, Luce, Florence, Egwin, Gotslina, Gerlanda, Ailmer, Tatwine and Ethwalda (Magriço's lady).&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; These names are purely literary fiction by Braga, with no known historical counterparts.

==History==
While the particulars of the legend are doubtlessly fanciful, there may be some (slim) historical basis for such an encounter&lt;ref&gt;For a review of possible historicity, see Costa (1935) and Hutchinson (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; If such an event happened, it would have to be sometime after 1387 (when the [[Anglo-Portuguese alliance]] was sealed by the marriage of [[John I of Portugal]] and [[Philippa of Lancaster]], daughter of [[John of Gaunt]]) and before the death of John the Gaunt in 1399. Narrowing the window further, it was probably sometime after 1389, when John of Gaunt returned to England from his failed Iberian campaign, and before the death of John of Gaunt's wife, the Duchess of Lancaster, [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]] in 1394.&lt;ref&gt;The 15th-century ''Cavalarias'' identifies the Duchess as Constance of Castile, thus placing the date for this event definitely before her death in 1394. Braga (1902) prefers to identify the Duchess with Gaunt's third wife, [[Katherine Swynford]], the duchess from 1396 to 1399.&lt;/ref&gt; The common date frequently cited is 1390.&lt;ref&gt;Soares da Silva (1732: p.1364).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duchess's [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] nationality may lend credence to such an event, and her twelve ladies-in-waiting were also, likely, Castilian rather than English, which may explain John of Gaunt's difficulty in finding English champions to pick up arms against their English brethren in their defense.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson, 2007"&gt;Hutchinson, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1390s also marks a difficult period in John of Gaunt's political life, at a low point in his fortunes, trying to navigate an England riven with great tension between King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and the English nobility. With the humiliating failure in Iberia still stinging, it was not unlikely disgruntled English knights might have taken to poking at the Duke of Lancaster and his household, in particular the Castilian Duchess who could be blamed for the hare-brained Iberian adventure to begin with.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson, 2007"/&gt; Finally, it is possible that if the event happened as early as 1389-1390, Lancaster may not have had to send to Portugal for knights, but may have had a few already in his entourage - Portuguese knights who served with him in the Castilian campaign and accompanied him to England, possibly as a bodyguard when John of Gaunt was still uncertain as to what kind of reception he might receive at home. Add a few others from his son-in-law's embassy, and there might have been enough Portuguese knights in England at the time to engage in some sort of tournament over some offense against Lancaster's household.

Setting the event in the early 1390s, however, eliminates many of the identified twelve, who were merely children at the time, if born at all. But it is probably safe to assume that the list is largely fanciful and anachronistic anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel (1891: p.150).&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the named knights were known to have gone abroad at some point - e.g. [[Álvaro Vaz de Almada, 1st Count of Avranches|Álvaro Vaz de Almada]] served for a long time in England and was made a [[Knight of the Garter]] and [[Count of Avranches]] in 1445; [[Soeiro da Costa]] fought in Aragon and Italy in the early 15th century, and was at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415; [[Álvaro Gonçalves Coutinho]], the ''Magriço'' himself, is reported to have fought in tournaments in France. The French chronicle of [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]] records a chivalric fight (over women) in Saint-Ouen in 1414 between three Portuguese knights (named simply D. Álvares, D. João and D. Pedro Gonçalves) and three [[Gascony|Gascon]] knights (François de Grignols, Archambaud de la Roque and Maurignon).&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel (1891: p.144-45)&lt;/ref&gt; News of the feats of various Portuguese knights abroad in different countries - filtered back home in the early 15th century and somehow, inchoatly and anachronistically, congealed in popular memory into a single English tournament set around 1390.

Another influence in this story is the rise of the [[Arthurian legend]], probably brought to the Portuguese court by Philippa of Lancaster.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson (1988, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the "Twelve of England" evokes the image of John I of Portugal, as some sort of Portuguese King Arthur, sending out his knights of the [[round table]] in feats of chivalry, saving distant damsels in distress (a marked change from the old [[reconquista]] tales of battling Moors.) The number - twelve - is also not accidental. As pointed out by Camões himself, it happens to match the [[Twelve Peers]] of [[Charlemagne]], that other great source of [[chivalric]] literature, re-popularized in the 16th century by [[Boiardo]] and [[Ariosto]] ("For the Twelve Peers, I put forth the Twelve of England, and their ''Magriço''", [[Luís de Camões|Camões]] ''Lusiadas'', Canto I, Stanza 12&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Aubertin transl. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8KoDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 1.12]&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Cultural references ==
In the 1820s, Portuguese [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Almeida Garrett]] worked for many years on an extended poem, ''Magriço ou Os Doze de Inglaterra'', which used the story of the twelve as a device for wider philosophical meanderings, which was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Braga (1902: p.299-300). After nine long years, Garrett abandoned the poem in 1832. The fragments were published in a posthumous volume of his collected works in 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Many decades later, in 1902, [[Teófilo Braga]] composed his own more straightforward poetic version of the story of the twelve, with a more [[nationalist]] tone, apparently inspired by his research into Camões and Garrett, but also possibly motivated by the [[1890 British Ultimatum]], which had provoked a strong anti-British feeling in republican-nationalist circles in Portugal at that time.

The legend took a new life when the [[Portugal national football team]] made their debut at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] hosted in England. Led by eventual top-scorer [[Eusébio]], they reached third place in the tournament. The Portuguese newspaper press gave the fabled team the nickname ''Os Magriços'', in reference to the "Twelve of England". Although the legend was familiar to the Portuguese public, it became even more prominent in the aftermath of the World Cup campaign.

{{Thoreauviana |expanded=Core}}
The '''Thoreau Society''' is a [[literary society]] devoted to the works of [[Henry David Thoreau]], it is based in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Massachusetts]], USA. Established in 1941, it  has long contributed to the dissemination of knowledge about Henry David Thoreau by collecting books, manuscripts, and artifacts relating to Thoreau and his contemporaries, by encouraging the use of its collections, and by publishing articles in two Society periodicals.

The Thoreau Society archives are housed at the Walden Woods Project's Thoreau Institute Library in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]]. This repository includes the collections of Walter Harding and Raymond Adams, two of the foremost authorities on Thoreau and founders of the Thoreau Society; and those of [[Roland W. Robbins]], who uncovered Thoreau's Walden house site.

== Mission==
*To stimulate interest in and foster education about Thoreau's life, works, and philosophy and his place in his world and ours,
*To encourage research on Thoreau's life and writings,
*To act as a repository for Thoreauviana and material relevant to Thoreau,
*And to advocate for the preservation of Thoreau Country.

== Members==

Thoreau Society members represent a wide range
of professions, interests, and hometowns across
the United States and around the [[world]]. They are connected
by the conviction that Henry Thoreau had
important things to say and crucial questions to
ask that are just as significant in our time as in his.

Through its programs, publications and projects,
The Thoreau Society is committed to exploring
Thoreau's observations on living with self, society
and nature, and encouraging people to think about
how they live their own lives.

==Activities==

===Annual Gathering===
Four days of indoor and outdoor sessions and excursions in and around Concord focused on a different theme each year. The Thursday–Sunday program is scheduled in early July.

'''Turkmeneli''', also known as '''Turkmenland''',&lt;ref name=Richx&gt;{{citation|last=Rich|first=Paul J.|year=2008|title=Iraq and Rupert Hay's Two Years in Kurdistan|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|page=x|isbn=1461633672}}&lt;/ref&gt; and historically as '''Turcomania''',&lt;ref name=Anderson&amp;Stansfield56&gt;{{citation|last1=Anderson|first1=Liam|last2=Stansfield|first2=Gareth|year=2009|title=Crisis in Kirkuk: The Ethnopolitics of Conflict and Compromise|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|page=56|isbn=0812206045}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-tr|Türkmeneli|lit=Land of the Turkmens}}) is a political term used by the [[Iraqi Turkmens|Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman]] minority in [[Iraq]] to define the vast swath of territory in which they have historically had a dominant population.&lt;ref name=Strakes369&gt;{{citation|last=Strakes|first=Jason E.|year=2009|title=Current Political Complexities of the Iraqi Turkmen|journal=Iran &amp; the Caucasus|volume=13|issue=2|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term incorporates the Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman homelands running from Iraq's border with [[Turkey]] and [[Syria]] and diagonally down the country to the border with [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=Anderson&amp;Stansfield56/&gt;

In particular, the Turkmen/Turkoman consider the capital of Turkmeneli to be [[Kirkuk]] and its boundaries also include [[Tel Afar]], [[Mosul]], [[Erbil]] (a part of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]) , [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]], and [[Tuz Khurmato]].&lt;ref name=Anderson&amp;Stansfield57&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Osman243&gt;{{citation|last=Osman|first=Khalil|year=2015|title=Sectarianism in Iraq: The Making of State and Nation Since 1920|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1317674871|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Liam Anderson and Gareth Stansfield, the Turkmen/Turkoman note that the term "Turcomania" – an [[Anglicized]] version of "Turkmeneli" – appears on a map of the region published by [[William Guthrie]] in 1785, however, there is no clear reference to Turkmeneli until the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Anderson&amp;Stansfield56/&gt;

==The Turkmen/Turkoman homeland==
The Iraqi Turkmen/Turkomans generally consider several major cities, and small districts associated with these cities, as part of their homeland.&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu&gt;{{citation|last=Oğuzlu|first=Tarik H.|year=2004|title=Endangered community:The Turkoman identity in Iraq|journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs|volume=24|issue=2|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major cities claimed to be a part of Turkmeneli, in a north-to-south order, include: [[Mosul]], [[Erbil]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Salahaldeen]] and [[Diala]], [[Tal Afar]], [[Sancar]], [[Altun Kupri]], [[Kifri]], [[Khanaqin]], [[Kizilribat]], [[Bakuba]] and [[Mendeli]].&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu/&gt; Consequently, the Turkmeneli region lies between the Arab areas of settlement to the south and Kurdish areas to the north.&lt;ref name=Oğuzlu/&gt;

==Prospects of an autonomous region==
[[File:Iraqi Turkmen man in Kirkuk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An Iraqi Turkmen man climbs a pole in [[Kirkuk]] for a photo with the hanging flag.]]
[[File:Iraqi Turkmen woman holding a placard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Iraqi Turkmen woman holding a placard written in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: "Kerkük'ü hiçbir güç Kürtleştiremez" (No power can Kurdify Kirkuk).]]
According to Khalil Osman there has been "a raft of federalist schemes" proposed by various Turkmen/Turkoman political parties.&lt;ref name=Osman243/&gt; For example, one controversial proposal to set up Turkmeneli as a Turkmen/Turkoman automonous region included the areas nortwest of Iraq, from [[Tel Afar]] in [[Ninewah Province]], through Kirkuk/Ta'amim Province and Tuz Khurmatu District in [[Saladin Governorate|Salah al-Din Province]] in north-Central Iraq, to [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]] in the [[Diyala Province]] in the northeast of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=Osman243/&gt; 

Vahram Petrosian suggests that the [[Iraqi Turkmen Front]]'s (ITF) forwarding of the idea of the recognition of Turkmeneli may pave the way for a future Kurdish-Turkmen conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Petrosian|first=Vahram|year=2003|title=The Iraqi Turkomans and Turkey|journal=Iran &amp; the Caucasus|volume=7|issue=1/2|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Wassim Bassem reported that the Turkmen/Turkoman have been calling for their own independent province in the Tal Afar district.&lt;ref name=Bassem2016&gt;{{cite web|last=Bassem|first=Wassim|year=2016|title=Iraq’s Turkmens call for independent province|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/turkmens-iraq-mosul-tal-afar.html|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their demands had coincided with calls for the establishment of other new provinces for the Christian and the Yazidi minorities.&lt;ref name=Bassem2016/&gt;

On 17 July 2017, Turkmens proposed that [[Tel Afar]] and [[Tuz Khurmatu]] to become an autonomous Turkmen region and asked for a "special status" for [[Kirkuk]] in a summit in Baghdad under the name "Future of Turkmens in United Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iraqi-turkmen-to-propose-special-status-for-kirkuk/819747] Iraqi Turkmen to propose ‘special status’ for Kirkuk&lt;/ref&gt;Also asked to "training and equipping the [[Turkmen Brigades (PMU)|Turkmen Hashd al-Shaabi forces]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iraq-meeting-tackles-turkmens-future-in-post-daesh-era/820477] Iraq meeting tackles Turkmens' future in post-Daesh era&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Duveneck Whistling Boy.jpg|thumb|''The Whistling Boy'', [[Frank Duveneck]] (1872)]]
'''Whistling''' without the use of an artificial [[whistle]] is achieved by creating a small opening with one's lips and then blowing or sucking air through the hole. The air is moderated by the lips, curled tongue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Whistle With Your Fingers|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/04/08/how-to-whistle-with-your-fingers/|publisher=[[The Art of Manliness]]|date=April 8, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, teeth or fingers (placed over the mouth) to create [[turbulence]], and the curled tongue acts as a [[resonance|resonant]] chamber to enhance the resulting sound by acting as a type of [[Helmholtz resonance|Helmholtz resonator]].

==Techniques==
{{listen | help = no | pos = right| filename = Human_whistling.ogg | title = Whistling | description = A human whistling. | format = [[Ogg]]}}
Pucker whistling is the most common form in much Western music. Typically, the tongue tip is lowered, often placed behind the lower teeth, and pitch altered by varying the position of the tongue. Although varying the degree of pucker will change the pitch of a pucker whistle, expert pucker whistlers will generally only make small variations to the degree of pucker, due to its tendency to affect purity of tone. Pucker whistling can be done by either only blowing out or blowing in and out alternately. In the 'only blow out' method, a consistent tone is achieved, but a negligible pause has to be taken to breathe in. In the alternating method there is no problem of breathlessness or interruption as breath is taken when one whistles breathing in, but a disadvantage is that many times, the consistency of tone is not maintained, and it fluctuates.

Many expert musical palatal whistlers will substantially alter the position of the tongue to ensure a good quality tone. Venetian gondoliers are famous for moving the tongue while they whistle in a way that can look like singing. A good example of a palatal whistler is [[Luke Janssen]], winner of the 2009 world whistling competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?King_of_the_whistles_challenges_Boyle_for_top_talent&amp;in_article_id=638189&amp;in_page_id=34 |title=King of whistles challenges Boyle for top talent |author=Jessica Satherly |date=April 28, 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LeMondeSiffler.jpg|thumb|Various finger techniques (''[[Le Monde illustré]]''  14 January 1893)]]
Finger whistling is harder to control but achieves a piercing volume. In Boito's opera ''[[Mefistofele]]'' the title character uses it to express his defiance of the Almighty.

Whistling can also be produced by blowing air through enclosed, [[Hand flute|cupped hands]] or through an external [[Wind instrument|instrument]], such as a whistle or even a blade of grass or leaf.

== Competitions==
One of the most well known whistling competitions is the International Whistlers Convention (IWC). Since 1973, this annual event takes place in Louisburg, North Carolina. The awards go to whistlers ranging from international male and female, teenage male and female, and even grandchildren. It has been customary for the Governor of the State of North Carolina to sign a declaration declaring the week of the IWC as "Happy Whistlers Week," for citizens and visitors to honor the art of whistling and to participate in the scheduled events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IWC Main Website|url=http://www.whistlingiwc.com/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Guinness World Records]], the highest [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] human whistle ever recorded was measured at 4,186&amp;nbsp;Hz, which corresponds to a C8 [[musical note]]. This was done by Michael Stuart in Richmond, Virginia, on January 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records, Highest note whistled|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-note-whistled}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest pitch whistle ever recorded was measured at 174.6&amp;nbsp;Hz, which corresponds to a F3 musical note.  This was accomplished by Jennifer Davies of Dachau, Germany on November 6, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records, Lowest note whistled|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/lowest-note-whistled}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most people whistling simultaneously was 853, which was organized at the [[Spring Harvest]] event at Minehead, UK on April 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records, Most people whistling|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-people-whistling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As communication==
On [[La Gomera]], one of Spain's [[Canary Islands]], a traditional [[whistled language]] named ''[[Silbo Gomero language|Silbo Gomero]]'' is still used. At least nine separate whistling sounds are used to produce usually four vowels and five consonants, allowing this language to convey unlimited words. This language allowed people (e.g. shepherds) to communicate over long distances in the island, when other communication means were not available. It is now taught in school so that it is not lost among the younger generation. Another group of whistlers were the Mazateco Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico. Their whistling aided in conveying messages over far distances, but was also used in close quarters as a unique form of communication with a variety of tones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Whistled_languages.html?id=l1RiAAAAMAAJ Busnel &amp; Classe 1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistling can be used to control trained animals such as dogs. A [[Shepherd's whistle]] is often used instead.

Whistling has long been used as a specialized communication between laborers. For example, whistling in theatre, particularly on-stage, is used by flymen (i.e. members of a [[fly crew]]) to cue the lowering or raising of a [[Batten (theater)|batten]] pipe or [[Flats (theatre)|flat]]. This method of communication became popular before the invention of electronic means of communication, and is still in use, primarily in older "hemp" houses during the set and strike of a show.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Maureen.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qcU7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 A History of Pantomime]'', p. 31 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asbury, Nick.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWkwS5RHQMoC&amp;pg=PT134 Exit Pursued by a Badger: An Actor's Journey Through History with Shakespeare]'', p. 134 (Oberon Books 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
[[File:Erik Satie Musique sifflee (Le siffleur-Clodine Tardy) 29e Festival des vendanges (arts de la rue) Suresnes 2012.ogg|thumb|Whistling at the 29th Festival of Street Art in [[Suresnes]], [[France]] in 2012]]
The range of pucker whistlers varies from about one to three octaves. [[Agnes Woodward]] &lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Agnes: ''Whistling as an Art'' (Carl Fischer, New York 1923)&lt;/ref&gt; classifies by analogy to [[voice type]]s: soprano (c"-c""), mezzo (a-g'") and alto (e or d-g")&lt;ref&gt;Page x. These are written pitches, presumably sounding an octave higher and corresponding to [[Scientific pitch notation|C5-C7 &amp;c]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many performers (also known as '''siffleurs''') on the music hall and [[Vaudeville]] circuits were professional whistlers, the most famous of which were [[Ronnie Ronalde]] and [[Fred Lowery]]. The term ''puccalo'' or ''puccolo'' was coined by Ron McCroby to refer to highly skilled jazz whistling.&lt;ref&gt;Sheff, David.  [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085638,00.html "They Laughed When Ron McCroby Puckered Up, but Now He's Whistlin' Jazz, Not Dixie"], ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' (August 8, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistling is featured in a number of television themes, such as [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|''Lassie'']], ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and [[Mark Snow]]'s title theme for ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Snow called it the "signature whistle" that gave the music part of its "scariness". {{cite news | url = https://www.npr.org/2016/01/22/463971641/as-x-files-returns-meet-the-man-behind-the-theme-song | website = [[NPR]] | last = Greiving | first = Tim | title = As 'X-Files' Returns, Meet The Man Behind The Theme Song | date = January 22, 2016 | accessdate = January 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also prominently features in the score of the movie ''[[Twisted Nerve]]'', composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]], which was later used in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill]]''.

Prominent in classic songs such as [[Bobby McFerrin]]'s "[[Don't Worry, Be Happy]]" and [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]' "[[Wind of Change (Scorpions song)|Wind of Change]]", whistling has also been integrated in many contemporary pop hits such as [[Flo Rida]]'s "[[Whistle (Flo Rida song)|Whistle]]", [[Selena Gomez]]'s "[[Kill Em with Kindness (song)|Kill Em With Kindness]]", [[Florida Georgia Line]]'s "[[Sun Daze]]", [[Foster the People]]'s "[[Pumped Up Kicks]]", [[Maroon 5]]'s "[[Moves Like Jagger]]", [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]' "Home", [[OneRepublic]]'s "Good Life", [[Adam Lambert]]'s "Ghost Town", [[Kanye West]]'s "[[All Day (Kanye West song)|All Day]]", [[Peter Bjorn and John]]'s "[[Young Folks]]" and The Seekers "Georgy Girl".

==By spectators==
Whistling is often used by spectators at sporting events to express either enthusiasm or disapprobation. In the United States and Canada, whistling is used much like applause, to express approval or appreciation for the efforts of a team or a player, such as a [[starting pitcher]] in baseball who is taken out of the game after having pitched well. In much of the rest of the world, especially Europe and South America, whistling is used to express displeasure with the action or disagreement with an official's decision, like [[booing]]. This whistling is often loud and cacophonous, using [[finger whistling]].

==Superstitions==
In many cultures, whistling or making whistling noises at night is thought to attract bad luck, bad things, or [[Demon|evil spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tate|title=Things Fall Apart – Ch 2|url=http://www.wssb.wa.gov/content/Classrooms/tate/content/freshman/Things%20Fall%20Apart/ch-2.htm|publisher=Washington State School for the Blind|accessdate=May 20, 2012|date=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Traditions|url=http://www.fantasticasia.net/?p=17|publisher=Fantastic Asia Ltd.|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belide Tribe 22.000|url=http://www.indonesiatraveling.com/sumatra/sumatra-intro/189-riau.html|publisher=Indonesia Traveling|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evil Eye......

In the UK there is a superstitious belief in the "Seven Whistlers" which are seven mysterious birds or spirits who call out to foretell death or a great calamity. In the 19th century, large groups of coal miners were known to have refused to enter the mines for one day after hearing this spectral whistling. The Seven Whistlers have been mentioned in literature such as ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by Edmund Spenser, as bearing an omen of death. [[William Wordsworth]] included fear of the Seven Whistlers in his poem, "Though Narrow Be That Old Man's Cares". The superstition has been reported in the [[Midlands (England)|Midland Counties]] of England but also in [[Lancashire]], Essex, [[Kent]], and even in other places such as North Wales and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth Mary |title=Rustic speech and folk-lore |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rB1AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 |publisher=H.

In Russian and other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] cultures, and also in [[Romania]] and the [[Baltic states]], whistling indoors is superstitiously believed to bring poverty ("whistling money away"), whereas whistling outdoors is considered normal. In Estonia it is also widely believed that whistling indoors may bring bad luck and therefore set the house on fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/369/ ''Passport'' magazine article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistling on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, N. V. M. "Whistling Up the Wind: Myth and Creativity." ''Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints'' 31.2 (1983): 216–226.&lt;/ref&gt; This is regularly alluded to in the [[Aubrey-Maturin]] books by [[Patrick O'Brian]].

[[Theatrical superstitions|Theater practice has plenty of superstitions]]: one of them is against whistling. A popular explanation is that traditionally sailors, skilled in rigging and accustomed to the [[boatswain's pipe]], were often used as [[Stagehand|stage technicians]], working with the [[Counterweight fly system|complicated rope systems]] associated with [[Fly tower|flying]]. An errant whistle might cause a cue to come early or a "sailor's ghost" to drop a set-piece on top of an actor. An offstage whistle audible to the audience in the middle of a performance might also be considered bad luck.

[[Transcendental whistling]] (''chángxiào'' 長嘯) was an ancient Chinese [[Daoist]] technique of resounding breath yoga, and skillful whistlers supposedly could summon supernatural beings, wild animals, and weather phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indra Jātrā,''' most commonly known as '''Yenyā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: येँयाः) is the biggest religious street festival in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]. Ye means "Kathmandu" and Ya means  "celebration", together it means "celebration inside Kathmandu" in Nepal Bhasa. The celebrations consist of two events, '''Indra Jātrā''' and '''Kumāri Jātrā'''. '''Indra Jātrā''' is marked by masked dances of deities and demons, displays of sacred images and tableaus in honor of the deity [[Indra]], the king of heaven.

Indra Jatra was started by King Gunakamadeva(गुणकामदेव) to commemorate the founding of the Kathmandu city in the 10th century.&lt;ref name=GP1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=6671&amp;cat_id=10|title=Indra Jatra, Munindra Ratna Bajracharya | publisher='''Gorkhapatra'''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumari Jatra began in the mid-18th century. The celebrations are held according to the [[lunar calendar]], so the dates are changeable. This year (2018), the festival takes place from 21st to 28th of September, and the main day of attraction falling on 24th.

==Opening ceremony==
[[File:Yosin raising.jpg|thumb|200px|Raising the Yosin pole]]
The festival starts with '''Yosin Thanegu''' (योसिं थनेगु), the erection of Yosin or Linga, a pole from which the banner of Indra is unfurled, at Kathmandu Durbar Square. The pole, a tree shorn of its branches and stripped of its bark, is obtained from a forest near [[Nala, Nepal|Nālā]], a small town 29&amp;nbsp;km to the east of Kathmandu. It is dragged in stages to Durbar Square by men pulling on ropes.

Another event on the first day is '''Upāku Wanegu''' (उपाकु वनेगु) when participants visit shrines holding lighted incense to honor deceased family members. They also place small butter lamps on the way. Some sing hymns as they make the tour. The circuitous route winds along the periphery of the historic part of the city. The procession starts at around 4 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/travel-tips-and-articles/2281| title = Kathmandu's Indra Jatra Festival| work = | publisher = Lonely Planet| year=2012| accessdate = 1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrations consist of Lakhe dance, Pulu Kisi dance, chariot procession of Kumari and a procession of girls dressed like various deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://voiceofsikkim.com/2011/09/12/indra-jatra-celebrated/| title =Indra Jatra celebrated| work =The Voice of Sikkim | publisher =| date=11 September 2011| accessdate = 30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title= Himalaya Darpan |url= http://epaper.himalayadarpan.com/PUBLICATIONS/HD/HD/2013/09/19/ArticleHtmls/19092013008024.shtml?Mode=1|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper= Himalaya Darpan |date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 2017 the [[Newar people]] of the state gathered at [[Namchi]], [[South Sikkim district]] for the celebration, first time in the district.

==In Terai==

Indra Jatra is also observed in some districts of Terai (Nepal and Indian Northern Bihar) as Indra Puja according to the local traditions. Rituals are different than in the Kathmandu Valley but the festival is observed around the same time indicating a common origin of the festival, probably during the Lichhavi period.

==Mythology==
According to legend, [[Indra]] (Hindu god-king of heaven), disguised as a farmer, descended to earth in search of ''parijat'' ([[Nyctanthes arbor-tristis|Night jasmine]]), a white flower his mother Basundhara needed to perform a ritual. As he was plucking the flowers at Maruhiti, a sunken water spout at [[Maru, Kathmandu|Maru]], the people caught and bound him like a common thief. He was then put on display in the town square of Maru in Kathmandu. (In a reenactment of this event, an image of Indra with his hands bound is put on display at Maru and other places during the festival.)

His mother, worried about his extended absence, came to Kathmandu and wandered around looking for him. (This event is commemorated by the procession of Dagin (दागिं) through the city. Pulu Kisi (alternate name Tānā Kisi), a wicker representation of an elephant, also runs around town reenacting Indra's elephant searching frantically for its master.)&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, A. W. (2004) ''Caturmāsa: Celebrations of death in Kathmandu, Nepal.'' CNWS Publications. {{ISBN|9789057890987}}. Page 53. Retrieved 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the city folk realized they had captured Indra himself, they were appalled and immediately released him. Out of appreciation for his release, his mother promised to provide enough dew throughout the winter to ensure a rich crop. It is said that Kathmandu starts to experience foggy mornings from this festival onwards because of this boon.&lt;ref&gt;Burbank, Jon (2002). ''Cultures of the World: Nepal.'' Marshall Cavendish. {{ISBN|9780761414766}}. Page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guru&gt;{{cite web |url= http://guru.com.np/indrajatra.htm|title=Indrajatra | publisher='''guru.com.np'''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closing ceremony==
On the last day, the yosin pole erected at Durbar Square is taken down in a ceremony known as '''Yosin Kwathalegu''' (योसिं क्वथलेगु). It marks the end of the festivities.

==Open air theater==
Yenya is also the season of open air theatre productions. Performances depicting social themes, satire and comedy are held on dance platforms or makeshift stages at market squares all over the [[Kathmandu Valley]] on the sidelines of the sacred festival. The plays, known as Dabu Pyākhan (दबू प्याखं), have a history going back centuries.

The '''Öre''' ({{IPA-sv|²œːrɛ|pronounced}}) is the centesimal subdivision of the [[Swedish krona]]. In the Swedish language, the plural of ''öre'' in indefinite form is either ''öre'' or ''ören'', whereas the singular definite form is ''öret'' and the plural definite is ''örena''. 

1 krona (SEK) = 100 öre (CSEK)

The name derives from the Latin ''[[aureus]]'' (golden), the name of a coin worth 25 [[denarius|denarii]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The corresponding subdivisions of the [[Norwegian krone|Norwegian]] and [[Danish krone]]s are called [[øre]].

== History ==
During the Middle Ages, the öre was a unit of Swedish currency equal to 1/8 of a ''[[mark (money)|mark]]'', 3 ''[[örtug]]ar'' or either 24, 36 or 48 ''[[Swedish penning|penning]]ar'' (depending on the geographical area in which it was used). It was already a unit of account in the 11th century, but was not minted as a coin until 1522. This öre was withdrawn in 1776, but returned in 1855 as 1/100 of the [[Swedish riksdaler|riksdaler]]. The riksdaler was replaced by the ''krona'' in 1873 (one riksdaler equalling one krona), but ''öre'' remained the name of the minor unit. 

The last öre coin was withdrawn in 2010, but the centesimal subdivision is still used in non-cash contexts such as bank balances and cashless transactions, while bills to be paid in cash are [[cash rounding|rounded]] to the nearest krona.
