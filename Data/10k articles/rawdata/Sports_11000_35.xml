'''1779 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 25 September — Duggan Fearns defeated Harry Sellers at [[Slough]] by a first-round knockout after 1 minute and 30 seconds to claim the Championship of England title. This is the only fight in which Fearns is known to have been involved and little is known of him except that he was born c.1754 in Ireland. He never defended his title which was eventually reclaimed by Sellers. The next known title fight was not until 1785 when Sellers met William Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/fearns-duggan.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Duggan Fearns].  Retrieved on 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] defeated the [[Non-international England cricket teams|England XI]] four times.
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the 18th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Richard Aubrey Veck]] 280
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Lamborn (Hambledon cricketer)|Lamborn]] 18

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* Inaugural running of [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]], sometimes called the Epsom Oaks for differentiation purposes, on [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom Downs]]. The second-oldest of the five [[British Classic Races]], the race is named after [[Oaks Park (London)|Oaks Park]], an estate located to the east of [[Epsom]] which was leased to the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|12th Earl of Derby]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Punter's Friend |last1=Waterman |first1=Jack |year= 1999 |publisher=Queen Anne Press |location=Harpenden, Herts, UK |isbn=1852916001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5213">The '''1958 [[British West Indies Championships]]''' was the second edition of the [[track and field]] competition between British colony nations in the Caribbean. A total of eighteen events were contested, all of them by men – women's events were not added until the following year.&lt;ref name=GBR&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/bwic.htm British West Indies Championships]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George de Peana]] of British Guiana defended his [[5000 metres]]/[[10,000 metres]] double from the previous edition. Trinidadian sprinters [[Hendrickson Harewood]] and [[Clifton Bertrand]] also defended their titles in the [[100 metres]] and [[200 metres]], respectively. Betrand added the [[400 metres]] title to his 200&amp;nbsp;m to become the first person to win two different sprint events at the competition.&lt;ref name=GBR/&gt;

The Trinidad and Tobago national championships were not held that year, as the country's governing body focused on hosting the wider regional tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttnaaa.org/compete/champs/index.html Trinidad &amp; Tobago National Championships]. NAAATT. Retrieved on 2015-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The host nation topped the medal table at the competition, winning ten of the eighteen events on offer. Jamaica came second, with four gold medals, followed by British Guiana on three. [[William Gittens]]'s gold for Grenada in the [[400 metres hurdles]] made his country's first medallist at the championships, and also the first winner from outside of the three aforementioned nations.&lt;ref name=GBR/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14345">The XXVIII edition of the '''[[Caribbean Series]]''' (''Serie del Caribe'') was played in {{by|1986}}. It was held from February 4 through February 9 with the baseball champion teams of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Águilas Cibaeñas]]; [[Mexico]], [[Águilas de Mexicali]]; [[Puerto Rico]], [[Indios de Mayagüez]], and [[Venezuela]], [[Tiburones de la Guaira]]. The format consisted of 12 games, each team facing the other teams twice. The games were played at [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]] in [[Maracaibo]], [[Venezuela]].

==Summary==
Ten years after their first Caribbean Series title, the Mexican club won again under the guide of veteran [[Cananea Reyes]]. Mexicali made history by winning three of four games in its last at-bat, two of them against the Dominican Republic.

Mexico was [[shutout|shut out]] twice in its first three games, but after four contests all four teams were tied at 2–2 for the first time in Series history. Mexicali finished strong and defeated the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico to win the title, after host Venezuela was stopped by the Dominicans in the final contest of the tournament. Venezuela had crushed Mexico, 11–0, in their first confrontation, but the Mexicans took revenge in their second matchup with a 14–0 thumping. The other three victories of Mexicali were by one run difference. 

Pitchers [[Jim Leopold]] and [[Jaime Orozco]] took two victories apiece, while the offensive support came from C [[Francisco Estrada]], SS [[Houston Jiménez]] and CF [[John Kruk]]. The inspired Mexican club also included DH [[Nelson Barrera]], 1B [[Lorenzo Bundy]], RF [[Roy Johnson (1980s outfielder)|Roy Johnson]], 2B [[Juan Navarrete]], and Ps [[Salomé Barojas]] and [[Sid Monge]], among others. In addition, Cananea Reyes joined Cuban skipper [[Nap Reyes]] as the only managers to win two Series titles.

The clubs from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela tied for second place with 3–3 records. 

The Dominican Republic's Águilas, managed by [[Winston Llenas]], were a favorite to grasp the Series trophy, as the team was headed by players such as C [[Tony Peña]], 2B [[Juan Samuel]], 3B [[Domingo Ramos]], SS [[Alfredo Griffin]], LF [[Miguel Diloné]], 1B [[Rufino Linares]] and CF [[Luis Polonia]].  The Águilas outscored their rivals, 36 to 30, but also topped the tournament with 15 [[error (baseball)|errors]]. [[Eric Plunk]], who posted a 1-0 record and a 3.21 ERA in two starts, was a bright spot in a pitching staff that included [[José Bautista (pitcher)|José Bautista]], [[Ravelo Manzanillo]], [[Pascual Pérez (baseball)|Pascual Pérez]] and [[Bob Patterson]].

The Venezuelan Tiburones, managed by [[José Martínez (infielder)|José Martínez]], wasted home field advantage and was the only team outscored, 34 to 27. 1B [[Andrés Galarraga]] hit .407 and slugged .703, driving in five runs while leading the batters in home runs (2) and doubles (2). RF [[Tony Armas]] batted .300 with one homer and  three RBI, and was very solid at defense. Starters [[Ubaldo Heredia]] (1-0, 0.00 ERA), [[Bryan Clark (baseball)|Bryan Clark]] (1-0, 0.00 ERA) and [[Odell Jones]] (1-0, 3.60 ERA) combined for the three victories of the team, receiving some strong bullpen support from [[Luis Aponte]] (two saves, 0.00, 5.0 IP), [[Wilfredo Flores]] (0.00, 6⅔ IP) and [[Luis Sánchez (baseball)|Luis Sánchez]] (1.00 ERA, 3.0 IP). Other players in the roster included P [[Bill Mooneyham]], C [[Toby Hernández|Tobias Hernández]], and IFs [[Carlos Martínez (infielder)|Carlos Martínez]], [[Gus Polidor|Gustavo Polidor]], [[Al Pedrique]] and [[Ángel Salazar (baseball)|Argenis Salazar]].

Mayagüez of Puerto Rico was managed by [[Nick Leyva]] and finished last with a 2–4 record. The team scored a second-best 31 runs, but lost two one-run games. 3B [[Randy Ready]] went 14-for-30 and captured both the batting title (.467) and the RBI lead (7), winning [[Caribbean Series Most Valuable Player|Series Most Valuable Player]] honors. His 14 hits tied a tournament record, which was set by [[Pedro Formental]] in the [[1953 Caribbean Series|1953 Series]]. Another highlight came from [[Luis DeLeón]], who hurled a two-hit, complete game shutout against the eventual champions. Among the other roster members were Ps [[Luis Aquino]], [[Edwin Correa]], [[Bill Earley]], [[José Guzmán]], [[Jesús Hernáiz]], [[Dale Mohorcic]], [[Ray Searage]] and [[Candy Sierra]]; C [[Angel Rodríguez (catcher)|Angel Rodríguez]]; DH [[Luis Quiñones]]; IFs [[Wally Joyner]], [[Willie Lozado]], [[Al Newman]] and [[José Oquendo]], as well as OFs [[Bobby Bonilla]], [[John Cangelosi]] and [[Henry Cotto]].

===Format===
The season is played over fourteen rounds, allowing every team to play each other twice, once at home and once away. The top four teams on the [[Standings|ladder]] at the conclusion of the [[Season (sports)#Regular_season|regular season]] qualify for the [[Playoffs|finals series]]. In the first week of the finals series, the 1st ranked team hosts the 2nd ranked team in the major semi-final (with the winner of that match to qualify for the [[Grand Final]]) and the 3rd ranked team hosts the 4th ranked team in the minor semi-final (with the loser of that match eliminated). The loser of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the minor semi-final in the preliminary final. The winner of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the preliminary final in the Grand Final.&lt;ref name="FixturePDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.supernetball.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/11055241/SSN2018_v5-Fixture.pdf|title=Suncorp Super Netball 2018 Season Fixture|work=Suncorp Super Netball|date=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129043244/https://assets.supernetball.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/11055241/SSN2018_v5-Fixture.pdf|archivedate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule changes===
[[Netball Australia]] announced a change to the points system for the regular season, with [[bonus points]] being introduced. Under the new system, teams earn 4 points for a win and 1 point for every quarter won in a match. A drawn match earns a team 2 points and drawing a quarter earns no points. The winning team can earn a maximum of 8 points per match.&lt;ref name=Rules&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/2018/04/20/new-rule-changes-to-be-implemented-in-season-2/|title=New Rule Changes To Be Implemented In Season 2|work=Suncorp Super Netball|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, teams can request up to two [[Time-out (sport)|time-outs]] per half and at any point in time while play is in progress, any one member of the team bench (players and team officials) listed on the official score sheet shall be permitted to move up and down their team bench within the bench zone to communicate with their on-court or off-court players. Finally, [[umpires]] can now award a penalty pass for delaying play or intimidation and quarter time and half time breaks will be increased by one and three minutes respectively.&lt;ref name=Rules/&gt;

===Broadcast===
The [[Nine Network]] televised two matches each round during the regular season and also televised all finals matches. [[Telstra]] televised the other two matches each round. Every match of the season was available to be streamed live via the Netball Australia App. Unlike 2017, Nine telecast their two matches on the main channel, rather than secondary channel [[9Gem]]. The two matches broadcast on Nine were on Saturday and Sunday afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewomensgame.com/news/netball-moving-to-nine-could-do-wonders-for-the-game-489704|title=Netball moving to Nine could do wonders for the game|date=26 April 2018|work=The Women's Game}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cageball''' is a [[sport]] invented by the football coach [[Jörg Berger]], seeking a way to play [[football (soccer)|football (American soccer)]] despite bad winter conditions.

It is similar to traditional indoor football, although with some changes: as the name implies, one plays in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]]. Due to the enclosed environment, the game is faster and more dynamic, and putting greater emphasis on football technique.

== Playing field ==
Cageball is played on [[artificial turf]]. The playing field is usually 23x15 metres, but can vary somewhat due to hall constraints. The entire field is surrounded by a one-metre-high wall or fence, out of which extends a net for a further four metres upwards. This way, the ball is always in play, obsoleting all out-of-bound rules. Usually, a Cageball team consists of three field players and a goalkeeper, the latter which can also assume a "flying" role.

== Rules ==
Normal football rules apply when it comes to [[Foul (sports)|fouls]] and deliberate hand usage. Free kicks must be immediately carried out. The [[offside (sport)|offside]] is not observed, and there are no throw-ins or [[goal kick]]s.

'''Cardiff Arms Park''' ({{lang-cy|Parc yr Arfau Caerdydd}}), also known as '''The Arms Park''' and the '''[[BT Sport]] Cardiff Arms Park''' for sponsorship reasons from September 2014, is situated in the centre of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. It is primarily known as a [[rugby union]] stadium, but it also has a [[bowling green]]. The Arms Park was host to the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in 1958, and hosted four games in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]], including the third-place play-off. The Arms Park also hosted the inaugural [[Heineken Cup]] Final of [[1995–96 Heineken Cup|1995–96]] and the following year in [[1996–97 Heineken Cup|1996–97]].

The history of the rugby ground begins with the first [[Bleacher|stands]] appearing for spectators in the ground in 1881–1882.&lt;ref name="Reminiscences" /&gt; Originally the Arms Park had a cricket ground to the north and a rugby union stadium to the south. By 1969, the cricket ground had been demolished to make way for the present day rugby ground to the north and a second rugby stadium to the south, called the National Stadium. The National Stadium, which was used by [[Wales national rugby union team]], was officially opened on 7 April 1984, however in 1997 it was demolished to make way for the [[Millennium Stadium]] in 1999, which hosted the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] and became the [[national stadium]] of Wales. The rugby ground has remained the home of the [[semi-professional]] [[Cardiff RFC]] yet the professional [[Cardiff Blues]] regional rugby union team moved to the [[Cardiff City Stadium]] in 2009, but returned three years later.

The site is owned by [[Cardiff Athletic Club]] and has been host to many sports, apart from rugby union and cricket; they include athletics, association football, [[greyhound racing]], tennis,&lt;ref name="Tennis"&gt;{{cite web |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Post_War.html |publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; Cricket Archive |title=Post-war developments in Sophia Gardens |accessdate=17 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727115510/http://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Post_War.html# |archive-date=27 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British baseball]] and [[boxing]]. The site also has a [[bowling green]] to the north of the rugby ground, which is used by Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club, which is the bowls section of the Cardiff Athletic Club.&lt;ref name="Glanmor"/&gt; The National Stadium also hosted many music concerts including [[Michael Jackson]], [[David Bowie]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[U2]].

The hotel was built by [[Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Morgan]], during the [[reign]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref name="Red House"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/large/item/GTJ73155/|publisher=[[Culturenet Cymru]]|title=Cardiff Arms Hotel, Broad Street, Cardiff, late 19th century|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff Arms Park was named after this hotel.&lt;ref name="Demolished"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=48207 |publisher=University of London &amp; History of Parliament Trust |title='The older inns of Cardiff', Cardiff Records: volume 5 (1905), pp. 438–445. |accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1803, the Cardiff Arms Hotel and the Park had become the property of the [[Marquess of Bute|Bute]] family.&lt;ref name="Cricket ground" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/Teach/a_recreation.html |publisher=Glamorgan Record Office |title=Parks and Gardens |accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arms Park soon became a popular place for sporting events, and by 1848, [[Cardiff Cricket Club]] was using the site for its cricket matches.&lt;ref name="Cricket ground" /&gt; However, by 1878, Cardiff Arms Hotel had been demolished.&lt;ref name="Demolished"/&gt;

The [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|3rd Marquess of Bute]] stipulated that the ground could only be used for "recreational purposes".&lt;ref name="Bute" /&gt; At that time Cardiff Arms Park had a [[cricket]] ground to the north and a rugby union ground to the south. 1881–2 saw the first stands for spectators; they held 300 spectators and cost £50.&lt;ref name="Reminiscences"&gt;{{cite book |author=Red Dragon |title=''Reminiscences of the Cardiff Rugby Football Club'', "Opening ceremony of the new stands, Cardiff Arms Park", 5 October&amp;nbsp;1912 |year=1912 |publisher=Cardiff Rugby Football Club }}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect was [[Archibald Leitch]], famous for designing [[Ibrox Stadium]] and [[Old Trafford]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.structurae.de/persons/data/index.cfm?ID=d006772|publisher=Nicolas Janberg ICS |title=Archibald Leitch |accessdate=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, new standing areas were constructed along the entire length of the ground, with additional stands erected in 1896.&lt;ref name="Stands"/&gt;

=== 1912 redevelopment ===
By 1912, the Cardiff Football Ground, as it was then known, had a new south stand and temporary stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground.&lt;ref name="Reminiscences" /&gt; The south stand was covered, while the north terrace was initially without a roof.&lt;ref name="Reminiscences" /&gt; The improvements were partly funded by the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] (WRU).&lt;ref name="Stands" /&gt; The opening ceremony took place on 5 October 1912, with a match between [[Newport RFC]] and Cardiff RFC. The new ground was opened by [[Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart]].&lt;ref name="Reminiscences" /&gt; This new development increased the ground capacity to 43,000 and much improved the facilities at the ground compared to the earlier stands.&lt;ref name="Reminiscences" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stands"&gt;{{cite web  |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Rugby.html|publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; CricketArchive |title=Rugby at Cardiff Arms Park |accessdate=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 [[John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute]], had sold the entire site and it was bought by the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited for £30,000, it was then leased to the Cardiff Athletic Club (cricket and rugby sections) for 99 years at a cost of £200 per annum.&lt;ref name="Glanmor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris [[CBE]] LLD (Hons)|first=Kenneth M|title=''The Story of the Development of the National Rugby Ground'' 7 April&amp;nbsp;1984 |year=1984 |publisher=[[Welsh Rugby Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North and South Stand redevelopments ===

[[File:Cardiff Arms Park New North Stand.jpg|thumb|The 1934 new North Stand, rugby ground, Cardiff Arms Park]]

During 1934 the cricket pavilion had been demolished to make way for the new North Stand,&lt;ref name="Cricket ground" /&gt; which was built on the rugby union ground, costing around £20,000.&lt;ref name="Record Office"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Leisure.html |publisher=Glamorgan Record Office |title=''Cardiff: the building of a capital'' |accessdate=5 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020103532/http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Leisure.html# |archive-date=20 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1941 the new North Stand and part of the west [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] had been badly damaged in [[the Blitz]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Millennium"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3558.php |publisher=Millennium Stadium plc |title=History of the Millennium Stadium-Cardiff Arms Park Site |accessdate=29 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007045937/http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3558.php |archivedate=7 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a general meeting of the WRU in June 1953, they made a decision, "That until such time as the facilities at [[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|Swansea]] were improved, all international matches be played at Cardiff".&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; At the same time, plans were made for a new South Stand, which was estimated to cost £60,000, however the [[Tendering|tender]] price came out at £90,000, a compromise was made, and it was decided to build a new upper South Stand costing £64,000 instead, with the Cardiff Athletic Club contributing £15,000 and the remainder coming from the WRU.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; The new South Stand opened in 1956, in time for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref name="Millennium" /&gt; This brought the overall capacity of the Arms Park up to 60,000, of which 12,800 spectators were seated and the remainder standing.&lt;ref name="Stands" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Millennium" /&gt;

[[File:Clubhouse, Cardiff Athletic Club.jpg|thumb|left|Cardiff Athletic Club]]

The Arms Park hosted the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, which was used for the athletics events, but this event caused damage to the drainage system, so much so, that other rugby unions ([[Rugby Football Union|England]], [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]]) complained after the Games about the state of the pitch.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; On 4 December 1960, due to torrential rain, the [[River Taff]] burst its banks with the Arms Park pitch being left under {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water.&lt;ref name="Cardiff Time" /&gt; The Development Committee was set up to resolve these issues on a permanent basis. They looked at various sites in Cardiff, but they all proved to be unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; They also could not agree a solution with the Cardiff Athletic Club, so they purchased about {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of land at Island Farm in [[Bridgend]],&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; which was previously used as a [[prisoner-of-war camp]]. It is best known for being the camp where the biggest escape attempt was made by German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in Great Britain during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Island"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandfarm.fsnet.co.uk/ |publisher=islandfarm.fsnet.co.uk/ |title=Island Farm, Prisoner of War Camp: 198 / Special Camp: XI |accessdate=15 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819152744/http://www.islandfarm.fsnet.co.uk/ |archivedate=19 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to problems including transport issues [[Glamorgan County Council]] never gave outline planning permission for the proposals and by June 1964 the scheme was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; At that stage, the cricket ground to the north was still being used by [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]], and the rugby union ground to the south was used by the national Wales team and Cardiff RFC.

By 7 October 1966, the first floodlit game was held at Cardiff Arms Park, a game in which Cardiff RFC beat [[Barbarian F.C.|the Barbarians]] by 12 points to 8.&lt;ref name="Cardiff Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/cons.htm|publisher=Cardiff Council|title=Cardiff Timeline|accessdate=29 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305021030/http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/cons.htm#|archive-date=5 March 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Stadium redevelopment ===
The National Stadium, which was also known as the Welsh National Rugby Ground, was designed by Osborne V Webb &amp; Partners and built by G A Williamson &amp; Associates of [[Porthcawl]] and Andrew Scott &amp; Company of [[Port Talbot]].&lt;ref name="Library"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item10/10307 |publisher=Culturenet Cymru |title=Cardiff Arms Park, 1997 |accessdate=1 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503200119/http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item10/10307# |archive-date=3 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P.D. |last=Thompson |page=204 |chapter=24: The Millennium Stadium—Cardiff Arms Park |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o0BsU6JbpYAC |publisher=E &amp; FN Spon |location=London |title=Stadia, Arenas &amp; Grandstands |accessdate=4 September 2008 |isbn=978-0-419-24040-2 |editor1-last=Thompson |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Tolloczko |editor2-first=J.J.A. |editor3-last=Clarke |editor3-first=J.N. |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After agreement from the Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold of the south ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club would move to [[Sophia Gardens]] and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would move out of the south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt;

}}

On 17 October 1970, the new North Stand and the [[Cardiff RFC]] ground was completed, the North Stand cost just over £1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; The West Stand was opened in 1977 and the new East Terrace was completed by March 1980. By the time the final South Stand had been completed and the stadium officially opened on 7 April 1984, the South Stand had cost £4.5&amp;nbsp;million. At the start of the project, the total cost was estimated at £2.25&amp;nbsp;million, although by time it was finished in 1984, it had risen by nearly four times that amount.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt;

Both stadia had approximately east-west alignment: the rugby ground to the north (Castle Street) end; the National Stadium to the south (Wood Street) end. The original capacity was 65,000 but this had to be reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to [[all-seater stadium]] would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500. This capacity would have been much less than [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] and the other major rugby venues and also less than the demand for tickets to major events.&lt;ref name="Stadia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panstadia.com/vol3/33-022.htm |publisher=panstadia.com |title=In the heart of the city |accessdate=1 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201100708/http://www.panstadia.com/vol3/33-022.htm |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A world record crowd of 56,000 for a rugby union club match watched [[Llanelli RFC]] beat [[Neath RFC]] by 28 points to 13 points in the final of the Schweppes Cup ([[WRU Challenge Cup]]) on 7 May 1988.&lt;ref name="Cardiff Time" /&gt; The first evening game to be played under [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] was held on 4 September 1991 at 8.00&amp;nbsp;pm, between Wales and [[France national rugby union team|France]].&lt;ref name="Relics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyrelics.com/Museum/topics/Tickets.htm |publisher=rugbyrelics.com |title=This night time international against France opened the new floodlights at Cardiff Arms Park |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last international match to be held at the National Stadium was between Wales and [[England national rugby union team|England]] on 15 March 1997, and the last ever match that was held at the National Stadium was on 26 April 1997 between Cardiff and [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]], Cardiff won the SWALEC Cup ([[WRU Challenge Cup]]) by 33 points to 26 points.&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/wruchallengecup.php |publisher=Napit.co.uk |title=WRU Challenge Cup |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Millennium Stadium ===
[[File:Millennium Stadium and Cardiff Arms Park.jpg|thumb|left|The Millennium Stadium (''south ground'' - right) and Cardiff Arms Park (''north ground'' - left)]]
{{Main|Millennium Stadium}}

In 1997, just thirteen years after the National Stadium had opened, it was considered too small and did not have the facilities required of the time and it was demolished and a new stadium, the Millennium Stadium, was built in its place (completed to a north-south alignment and opened in June 1999). This would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site.&lt;ref name="The Stadium"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3557.php |publisher=[[Millennium Stadium]] |title=Background to the Millennium Stadium Project |accessdate=5 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009115105/http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3557.php |archivedate=9 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Millennium Stadium is on roughly two thirds of the National Stadium, Cardiff Arms Park site, it is currently no longer using the Arms Park name.&lt;ref name="Millennium" /&gt; The official website confuses the issue as well, one part states that "The Millennium Stadium is located on Westgate Street in Cardiff; next to the Cardiff Arms Park". whereas another section specifically refers to the stadium as "The Millennium Stadium, on the Cardiff Arms Park"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3564.php|publisher=Millennium Stadium |title=Stadium in relation to Cardiff City Centre|accessdate=8 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603202622/http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3564.php |archivedate=3 June 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed redevelopment ===

An agreement in principle was reached in December 2015 between the landlord of the stadium site ([[Cardiff Athletic Club]]) and its tenant (Cardiff Blues) to give the club a 150-year lease on the stadium site.&lt;ref name="Degrees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/multi-million-pound-redevelopment-cardiff-10577785#rlabs=1%20rt$category%20p$7|publisher=[[Media Wales]] |title=The multi-million pound redevelopment of Cardiff Arms Park is now a step closer|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could see the redevelopment of the Arms Park, including a new 15,000 seater stadium at 90 degrees to the existing stadium costing between £20 million and £30 million and surrounded by new offices and apartments.&lt;ref name="Degrees"/&gt;

More detailed negotiations will begin with a final approval expected early in 2016.&lt;ref name="Degrees"/&gt; If the final agreement goes ahead, Cardiff Athletic Club would receive an upfront payment of approximately £8 million.&lt;ref name="Degrees"/&gt; As part of the agreement, the bowls section would have to vacate its current site at the Arms Park and move to a new facility.&lt;ref name="Degrees"/&gt; At present Cardiff Blues pay Cardiff Athletic Club rent of around £115,000 per annum, however this would nearly double to around £200,000.&lt;ref name="Degrees"/&gt;

Only the rugby ground and the Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club now use the name Cardiff Arms Park. The rugby ground has two main stands, the North Stand and the South Stand. Both the Stands have [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] below [[seating]].&lt;ref name="Seating"/&gt; The other stands in the ground are the Westgate Street end (currently known as the Coastal Cottages Family Stand),&lt;ref name="Seating"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffblues.com/tickets/seating_plan.php|publisher=[[Cardiff Blues]]|title=Seating Plan|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has rows of seating below [[Luxury box|executive boxes]], plus the club shop, and the River Taff end (the Barry Nelmes Suite, named after Barry Nelmes, the former Cardiff RFC captain),&lt;ref name="Seating"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffblues.com/news/3402.php#.VrB6jvmLTIU|publisher=[[Cardiff Blues]]|title=Official opening ceremony of "Barry Nelmes" disabled suite at Cardiff Arms Park|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has 26 executive boxes.&lt;ref name="Arms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freewebs.com/tims92/og041cardiffblues.htm|publisher=T.S.

The South Stand of the rugby ground formed a complete unit with the North Stand of the National Stadium. Now the same structure of the South Stand of the rugby ground is also physically attached to the North Stand of the Millennium Stadium. This section is known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair and President of the WRU.&lt;ref name="Glanmor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/old-battles-reignite-over-shared-2308785 |date=25 October 2006 |publisher=WalesOnline |title=Old battles reignite over shared ground plans |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came about because the WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the Millennium Stadium, and the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] Commission would not provide any additional funds to be used for the construction of a new ground for Cardiff RFC. The Millennium Stadium was therefore built with the old [[reinforced concrete]] structure of the National Stadium (North Stand) and the new steel Millennium Stadium structure built around it.

There was doubt about the future of the Arms Park after 2010 following the move of the [[Cardiff Blues]] to the [[Cardiff City Stadium]]. Cardiff RFC Ltd, the company that runs Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC, still has a 15-year lease on the Arms Park, but talks are underway to release the rugby club from the terms of the lease, to enable the [[Millennium Stadium]] to be redeveloped with a new North Stand and adjoining convention centre. However, it still has the original requirement on the lease, that the land will only be used for "recreational purposes", as stipulated by the Bute family. But the Arms Park site is a prime piece of [[real estate]] in the centre of Cardiff, which means that it may be difficult to sell the land to [[property developers]]. The estimated value of the whole Arms Park site could be at least £25&amp;nbsp;million, although with the "recreational use" requirement, its actual value could be a lot less than that figure.&lt;ref name="Glanmor"/&gt; A decision by Cardiff Athletic Club on the future of the Arms Park has yet to be made.&lt;ref name="Ninian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0600soccer/0200news/tm_headline=stadium-switch-turns-spotlight-on-arms-park&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19816411&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html |publisher=[[Media Wales]] |title=Stadium switch turns spotlight on Arms Park |accessdate=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Cardiff Blues]] regional rugby union team made a £6&amp;nbsp;million bid for the Arms Park, later the WRU made an increased bid of £10&amp;nbsp;million for the site. Both bids were rejected by the trustees of the Cardiff Athletic Club.&lt;ref name="Bids"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/02/23/wru-made-10m-bid-for-cardiff-arms-park-91466-28220384/|publisher=[[Media Wales]] |title=WRU made £10m bid for Cardiff Arms Park|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012 [[Cardiff Blues]] announced that they would be making a permanent return to Cardiff Arms Park following declining attendances at the Cardiff City Stadium.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/17995008|publisher=BBC News|title=Cardiff Blues announce return to Arms Park |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2013 off-season, the pitch at the Arms Park was replaced with an artificial [[FieldTurf]] surface, intended to prevent any adverse weather conditions from affecting the rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff Blues get go ahead with artificial pitch following WRU approval |url=http://www.cardiffblues.com/news/6415.php |work=cardiffblues.com |publisher=Cardiff Blues |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiff Arms Park is best known as a rugby union stadium, but [[Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club]] (CABC) was established in 1923,&lt;ref name="Bowls"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabcbowls.co.uk/|publisher=Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club |title=Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club |accessdate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ever since then, the club has used the Arms Park as its bowling green.

The Les Spence Memorial Gates were erected in memory of the former Cardiff RFU player, who captained the team in 1936-37. He was born in 1907 and became chairman of the Cardiff RFU and president of the WRU between 1973 and 1974. He was awarded an MBE and died in 1988.&lt;ref name="Les"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historypoints.org/index.php?page=les-spence-memorial-gates-cardiff|publisher=History Points |title=Les Spence Memorial Gates, Cardiff Arms Park|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Club has produced two Welsh international bowlers; Mr. C Standfast in 1937 and Mr. B Hawkins who represented Wales in the 1982 World Pairs and captained Wales in 1982 and 1984.&lt;ref name="Bowls"/&gt;

== Usage ==

=== Association football ===
The Riverside Football Club, founded in 1899, played some matches at the Arms Park until 1910, when they moved to [[Ninian Park]],&lt;ref name="Record Office" /&gt; and later became [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City Football Club]].

On 31 May&amp;nbsp;1989, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] played its first international game against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the National Stadium in a [[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 4|World Cup qualifying match]], which ended goalless. It was also the first ever international [[Association football|football]] match held in Great Britain that was watched by all-seater spectators.&lt;ref name="Football"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pursey MBE |first=Ivor |date=May 1989 |title=History In The Making: Wales V.

The adjoining Cardiff Rugby Club ground has also been used for Association Football. In July 1995, [[Ton Pentre F.C.|Ton Pentre]] played two [[Intertoto Cup]] games there, against Heerenveen (Netherlands) and Uniao Leiria (Portugal) as their own ground was not suitable. The Heerenveen game - the first ever soccer match to be played there - kicked off at 6pm on Saturday 1 July 1995 and resulted in the Dutch side winning 7-0. The Wales U-21 team have also played a home game there in the late 1990s.

=== Athletics ===
In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest sporting event ever held in Wales; however, it would not have been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the [[greyhound]] track.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt; It would turn out to be the last time that [[South Africa at the Commonwealth Games|South Africa would participate in the Games]] until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1961.

=== Baseball &amp; British baseball ===
Baseball was established early on in Cardiff, and one of the earliest of games to be held at the Arms Park was on 18 May&amp;nbsp;1918. It was a charity match in aid of the Prisoner of War Fund between Welsh and American teams of the U.S. Beaufort &amp; U.S. Jupiter. [[British baseball]] matches have also regularly taken place at the Arms Park and hosted the annual England versus Wales international game every four years.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weltchmedia.com/baseball.html |publisher=Welsh Baseball Union |title=The web page of the Welsh Baseball Union |accessdate=6 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225182851/http://www.weltchmedia.com/baseball.html |archivedate=25 February 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grangealbionbaseball.co.uk/9.html |publisher=Grange Albion Baseball Club |title=Grange Albion Baseball Club |accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games are now usually held at [[Roath Park]].

=== Boxing ===
The first [[boxing]] contest held at the Arms Park was on 24 January 1914, when [[Bombadier Billy Wells]] beat Gaston Pigot by a [[knockout]] in the first round of a 20-round contest.&lt;ref name="Boxing 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxrec.com/date_search.php?yyyy=1914&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=24|publisher=[[BoxRec]]|title=Cardiff Arms Park, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxing contests were held later on 14 June 1943, 12 August 1944, 4 October 1951 and 10 September 1952.&lt;ref name="Box"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxrec.com/location.php?country_code=UK&amp;region_name=null&amp;towncity_name=&amp;towncity_id=22698&amp;venue_name=&amp;venue_id=27613&amp;yyyy=&amp;submit=Go|publisher=[[BoxRec]]|title=Cardiff Arms Park, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 25,000 spectators watched international boxing on 1 October 1993, at the National Stadium with a [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) [[Heavyweight]] title bout between [[Lennox Lewis vs. Frank Bruno|Lennox Lewis and Frank Bruno]]. It was the first time that two British-born boxers had fought for the world heavyweight title.&lt;ref name="Bout"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/10/sports/boxing-bruno-vs-lewis-a-personal-battle-of-britain.html |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |title=Bruno vs. Lewis: A Personal Battle of Britain|accessdate=15 November 2009 | first=Gerald | last=Eskenazi | date=10 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lennox Lewis|Lewis]] beat [[Frank Bruno|Bruno]] by a [[Knockout|technical knockout]] in the 7th round, in what was called the "Battle of Britain".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxing2007.com/PressRelease/2008/MaskaevPeterStatistics.htm |publisher=pound4pound.com|title=WBC Statistics|accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; On 30 September 1995, [[Steve Robinson (boxer)|Steve Robinson]] the [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO) World Featherweight Champion, lost against [[Naseem Hamed|Prince Naseem Hamed]] at the rugby ground in 8 rounds.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A28661691|publisher=BBC|title=Cardiff's greatest fight nights |accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cricket ===
In 1819 [[Cardiff Cricket Club]] was formed and by 1848 they had moved to their new home at the Arms Park.&lt;ref name="Cricket History"&gt;{{cite web  |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Early_Cricket.html |publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; CricketArchive |title=Cardiff Arms Park – a short History – Early Cricket in Cardiff |accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]], at the time not a [[First-class cricket|first-class]] county, played their first match at the ground in June 1869 against [[Monmouthshire County Cricket Club|Monmouthshire Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name="Early Cricket"&gt;{{cite web  |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Early_County_Cricket.html |publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; CricketArchive |title=Cardiff Arms Park – a short History – Early County Cricket at the Arms Park|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county club played their first [[County Championship]] match on the ground in 1921,&lt;ref name="Championship cricket"&gt;{{cite web  |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Glamorgan_First_Win.html|publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; CricketArchive |title=Cardiff Arms Park – a short History – Championship cricket at the Arms Park|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; competing there every season (except while first-class cricket was suspended during the Second World War) until their final match on the ground against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in August 1966.

Cardiff Cricket Club played their final game at the ground against Lydney Cricket Club on 17 September 1966. Both Cardiff Cricket Club and Glamorgan then moved to a new ground at [[Sophia Gardens]] on the opposite bank of the River Taff to the Arms Park following work on the creation of the national rugby stadium.&lt;ref name="County End"&gt;{{cite web  |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/County_End.html|publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; CricketArchive|title=Cardiff Arms Park – a short History – The end of county cricket at the Arms Park|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first first-class cricket match to be held on the ground was between West of England and East of England, on 20 June 1910. In all more than 240 first-class matches were played on the ground, all but two involving Glamorgan as the home team.&lt;ref name="Grounds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Grounds/90/381_f.html|publisher=CricketArchive|title=First-Class Matches played on Cardiff Arms Park|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one [[List A cricket]] match was played on the ground, Glamorgan's [[Gillette Cup (England)|Gillette Cup]] fixture against Somerset on 22 May 1963.&lt;ref name="Gillette"&gt;{{cite web  |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/Grounds/381_a.html |publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; CricketArchive |title=Glamorgan List A Matches played on Cardiff Arms Park|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greyhound racing ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plans for the Arms Park.jpg|thumb|Map showing the greyhound track around original football (rugby union) ground (south ground) and the cricket ground with pravillion (north ground)]] --&gt;

To help pay for the upkeep of the site, a greyhound track was built in 1927. The first meeting was held on 7 April 1928. The Arms Park (Cardiff) Greyhound Racing Company Limited signed a 50-year [[lease]] in 1937, with Cardiff Athletic Club{{spaced ndash}}the owners of the Arms Park{{spaced ndash}}having no rights to break the agreement or to review the rental until 50 years expired.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt;

The circumference of the track was a large 452 yards with long straights of 160 yards. An 'outside Sumner' hare was used and race distances consisted of 300, 500, 525 and 700 yards. The kennel facilities were at nearby Cefn Mably in St Mellons and the leading event was the Glamorgan Cup held over 500 yards. In 1932 a notable greyhound called Beef Cutlet made his debut at the track at Arms Park. Beef Cutlet won the Glamorgan Cup and set a new track record, in 28.41sec. Cutlet’s Waterhall kennels based trainer John Hegarty would later become a Racing Manager at the track. A neighbouring track, the [[White City Stadium, Cardiff|White City]] closed in 1939 and the [[Welsh Greyhound Derby]] was transferred to the Arms Park from White City, Cardiff in 1945.&lt;ref name="Genders 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the three races that formed the triple crown along with the [[English Greyhound Derby]] and [[Scottish Greyhound Derby]]. The track continued to host the race annually.

After the war the greyhound company introduced floodlights and in 1958 the entire surface required relaying after the Commonwealth Games had finished. In 1971 the Welsh Greyhound Derby was given 'classic' status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books Ltd|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 the Cardiff City Council announced that a revamp of the Arms Park site would not include greyhound racing. The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh Greyhound Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 greyhound fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race. Cardiff City Council had taken less than ten minutes to reject a plan to switch greyhound racing to nearby Maindy Stadium.&lt;ref name="Genders 1981"/&gt;

=== Rugby union ===
In 1876, the Cardiff RFC was formed and soon after they also used the park. On 12 April 1884, the first international match was played at the ground between Wales and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], when 5,000 people watched Wales beat Ireland by two tries and a drop goal to nil.&lt;ref name="Development" /&gt;

The Arms Park rugby ground became the permanent home of the [[Wales national rugby union team]] in 1964. Later, the National Stadium was also home to the [[WRU Challenge Cup]] from 1972 until the match held at the Stadium on 26 April 1997, at a much reduced capacity, between Cardiff RFC and [[Swansea RFC]]. Cardiff RFC won the match 33–26.&lt;ref name="Challenge Cup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wru.co.uk/86_641.php |publisher=Welsh Rugby Union |title=Konica Minolta Cup: a brief history |accessdate=7 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430014638/http://www.wru.co.uk/86_641.php |archivedate=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Stadium is best known as the venue for what is considered to be "[[the greatest try ever scored]]" by [[Gareth Edwards]] for [[Barbarian F.C.|the Barbarians]] against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in what is also called "the greatest match ever played" on 27 January 1973.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/1973-All-Blacks-Barbarians-DVD/dp/B000UO9CPK|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=1973 All Blacks vs Barbarians DVD|accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final result was a win for the Barbarians. The score, 23–11, which translates to 27–13 in today's scoring system.

The scorers were:
&lt;br /&gt;
Barbarians: [[Try|Tries]]: [[Gareth Edwards]], [[Fergus Slattery]], [[John Bevan (rugby)|John Bevan]], [[J. P. R. Williams|J P R Williams]]; [[Try#Conversion|Conversions]]: [[Phil Bennett]] (2); [[Penalty (rugby)|Penalty]]: Phil Bennett.
&lt;br /&gt;
All Blacks: Tries: [[Grant Batty]] (2); Penalty: [[Joseph Karam]].

The National Stadium hosted four games in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]], including the third-place play-off.&lt;ref name="World Cup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therugbyworldcup.co.uk/1991.html |publisher=therugbyworldcup.co.uk |title=RWC 1991 Staged in Europe |accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Stadium was also host to the inaugural [[Heineken Cup finals|Heineken Cup final]] of [[1995–96 Heineken Cup|1995–96]] when [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] beat Cardiff RFC by 21–18 after extra time, in front of 21,800 spectators.&lt;ref name="1995 Cup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/79_119.php |publisher=ERC |title=Toulouse Win Inaugural Tournament |accessdate=29 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229005136/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/79_119.php |archivedate=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following final in [[1996–97 Heineken Cup|1996–97]] was also held at the National Stadium, this time it was between [[CA Brive|Brive]] and [[Leicester Tigers]]. Brive won the match 28–9, in front of a crowd of 41,664.&lt;ref name="1996 Cup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/80_118.php |publisher=ERC |title=Brive the Champions |accessdate=29 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229005141/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/80_118.php |archivedate=29 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the rugby ground hosted all the games in Pool A of the [[2008 IRB Junior World Championship]] and also the semi-final on 18 June 2008, in which [[England national under-20 rugby union team|England]] beat [[South Africa national under-20 rugby union team|South Africa]] 26–18.&lt;ref name="2008 Cup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&amp;click_id=18&amp;art_id=vn20080619070737915C982514 |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |title=England kill off Baby Boks' world title hopes |accessdate=19 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blues Vs Edinburgh at the Arms Park.jpg|thumb|Cardiff Blues versus Edinburgh, 17 May 2009]]
Until February 2012, it had been assumed that the last professional rugby union game to take place at the Arms Park was on 17 May 2009, when [[Edinburgh Rugby|Edinburgh]] beat the Cardiff Blues 36–14 in a [[Pro14|Celtic League]] match during the [[2008–09 Celtic League|2008–09]] season.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/5339760/Edinburgh-beat-the-Blues-in-final-game-at-Cardiff-Arms-Park.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Edinburgh beat the Blues in final game at Cardiff Arms Park
|accessdate=3 April 2011 |first=Graham |last=Clutton |date=17 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on Tuesday, 7 February 2012, it was confirmed that Cardiff Blues would face [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]] at the Arms Park on Friday, 10 February 2012. The [[Pro14|Pro12]] League game result was a win for the Cardiff Blues 22–15 and attendance of 8,000. The following Tuesday, it was announced that the match against [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] on Friday, 17 February, would also be at the Arms Park, resulting in a Blues win, 21–14 and attendance of 8,600. The agreement signed during 2009 tied Cardiff Blues to a 20-year contract to play a maximum of 18 games per season for a set fee, rather than per match at [[Cardiff City Stadium]]. But on 23 February, it was announced that the two Welsh 'derbies' against the [[Scarlets]] and the [[Ospreys (rugby union)|Ospreys]] would be played at Cardiff City Stadium, rather than the Arms Park, because of Cardiff Blues' anticipation that the attendance figures would far exceed the maximum capacity of 9,000. On 8 May 2012, it was announced that [[Cardiff Blues]] would be returning to the Arms Park on a permanent basis after just three years at the [[Cardiff City Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/17995008 |publisher=BBC |title=Cardiff Blues announce return to Arms Park |accessdate=30 June 2012 |date=8 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2014, the rugby ground hosted the final of the [[2013–14 European Challenge Cup|2013–14 Amlin Challenge Cup]] in which [[Northampton Saints]] beat [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] 30-16.&lt;ref name="Amlin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/27489558|publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Amlin Challenge Cup final: Bath 16-30 Northampton|accessdate=25 May 2014 |date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing tradition ==

The National Stadium was known primarily as the venue for massed voices singing such hymns as "[[Cwm Rhondda]]", "[[Calon Lân]]", "[[Men of Harlech]]" and "[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]" ("Land of my Fathers" – the [[national anthem]] of Wales).&lt;ref name="Australian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auswelshmalechoir.org.au/pages/history1.html |publisher=The Australian Welsh Male Choir |title=Praise the Lord, we are a musical Nation |accessdate=11 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312165556/http://www.auswelshmalechoir.org.au/pages/history1.html |archivedate=12 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary atmosphere including singing of the crowd was said to be worth at least a try or a goal to the home nation.&lt;ref name="Singing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffmatchday.co.uk/home.html |publisher=Cardiff Match Day |title=Cardiff Arms Park, The Millennium Stadium, Cardiff |accessdate=27 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of singing has now passed on to the Millennium Stadium.&lt;ref name="Singing"/&gt;

The Arms Park has its own choir, called the [[Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir]]. It was formed in 1966 as the Cardiff Athletic Club Male Voice Choir, and today performs internationally with a schedule of concerts and tours. In 2000, the choir changed their name to become the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir.&lt;ref name="Choir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malevoicechoir.net/capmc/|publisher=cardiffarmsparkmalechoir.co.uk|title=Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir|accessdate=11 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514044039/http://www.malevoicechoir.net/capmc/|archivedate=14 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clarkson Cup''' ({{lang-fr|La Coupe Clarkson}}) is an [[ice hockey]] trophy, which since 2009 has been awarded to the winner of the Canadian Women's Hockey Championship.  Like the [[Stanley Cup]], it was created by and named after a former [[Governor General of Canada]]:  [[Adrienne Clarkson]].

Though initially awarded in 2006 to the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian national women's hockey team]], it was intended to be awarded to the top women's club in Canada. From 2006 to 2008, it was not awarded, owing to a number of rights issues between Clarkson, [[Hockey Canada]], and the artists responsible for making the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/272389 Clarkson Cup in limbo over ownership rights]. ''Toronto Star'', 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 2009, the Clarkson Cup has been awarded, as intended, to the top women's club team.   It is viewed as the ''Stanley Cup of women's hockey''.&lt;ref name=HHOF-ClarksonCup&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhof.com/htmlSilverware/silver_splashclarksoncup.shtml |title= Clarkson Cup |date= 2017 |publisher= Hockey Hall of Fame }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IIHF-2009-03-24&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iihf.com/channels0809/ww/news/news-singleview/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3266&amp;cHash=03a28f833dbdafc5d1152738a8045937 |title=

==History==

===Origins===
When the [[2004–05 NHL season]] was cancelled because of [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]], the Stanley Cup was not awarded for the first time since the 1918-19 [[Spanish flu]] pandemic.  In February 2005, Clarkson proposed that, since the Stanley Cup was to be awarded to the best professional hockey team of the year (even though there were Canadian teams in the [[American Hockey League]], which plays for the [[Calder Cup]]), it should be awarded to the best women's hockey team because they were still playing. That idea was brought to [[Susan Fennell]], the Commissioner of the [[National Women's Hockey League (1999–2007)|National Women's Hockey League]] (and also Mayor of Brampton).  In a media interview, Fennell commented that while the women had great respect for the Stanley Cup, it belonged to men's hockey, and that the women actually did have a cup of their own, but simply one with no name.  Fennell then came up with the idea that the Governor General should consider lending her name to the women's hockey championship cup, as Lord Stanley had done years before for the men's hockey championship.  Clarkson was thrilled with the idea and later met with Fennell at [[Rideau Hall]], where it was agreed that the women's hockey championship trophy would be named the Clarkson Cup.

Originally, the NWHL Championship Cup was to have a new name placed on it. However, On September 14, 2005, Clarkson announced the creation of a new trophy for women's hockey.

The Clarkson Cup is made of silver and was designed by [[Nunavut Arctic College]] in [[Iqaluit]].  Canadian silversmith Beth M. Biggs was commissioned to make the Clarkson Cup.  She designed and built the sterling trophy and collaborated with three Inuit artists: Okpik Pitseolak, Therese Ukaliannuk, and Pootoogook Qiatsuk. The Inuit artists designed some of the decoration on the trophy.  There are images of [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]] (one of the most powerful figures in Inuit tradition), Arctic animals, ancient masks, and the flowers of the provinces and territories of Canada.  The actual cup portion of the trophy is not much bigger than a large coffee mug.

===Early problems===
The trophy was awarded to the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian national women's hockey team]] on July 10, 2006, with the expectation that [[Hockey Canada]] would take over the trophy and how it was to be awarded.  However, complications arising due to the rights to the trophy (Clarkson wanting full rights to the trophy from the artists in order to turn the trophy over to Hockey Canada, while the artists wanting Hockey Canada to instead license the Cup in order to collect royalties from its use) and the splintered top level of women's club hockey at the time resulted in the trophy not being awarded for three years.

At the time of the creation of the Clarkson Cup, there were two top professional women's hockey leagues in Canada: the [[National Women's Hockey League (1999)|National Women's Hockey League]] in Eastern Canada and the [[Western Women's Hockey League]] in Western Canada (with one team from [[Minnesota]]) — the latter being formed from two former NWHL teams (the [[Calgary Oval X-Treme]] and [[Edmonton Chimos]]) due to travel costs, with no interleague championships to determine a true national champion.  Though the two leagues were expected to merge in 2007 (with the five-team WWHL being absorbed into the 11-team NWHL as a new "western division"), logistics differences (due to playoff scheduling) made the merger impossible — the WWHL playoffs were finished before the [[Esso Women's Nationals]], while the NWHL playoffs had yet to begin (and would not conclude until after the Nationals and the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|world championships]]).  The NWHL folded at the conclusion of the 2006–07 season, with the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] taking its place.  Though the CWHL and WWHL agreed on a format that would determine a national champion (to be decided with each league sending its two best teams to the Esso Women's Nationals, with the intent that it would be split off as a separate tournament from the senior women's tournament in the future), the Clarkson Cup remained unavailable — the [[Abby Hoffman Cup]] would be awarded in its place until the Clarkson Cup became available.

===2009 to present===
In March 2009, Clarkson and the artists behind the Clarkson Cup settled their licensing dispute, allowing the trophy to be presented.  The inaugural Canadian National Women's Hockey Championship was held later that month, at the [[K-Rock Centre]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], featuring an identical format to that used for the Esso Women's Nationals the previous year for club teams.  The [[Montreal Stars]], champions from the East, prevailed over the [[Minnesota Whitecaps]] in the finals of the championship, which also saw the [[Brampton Thunder|Brampton Canadettes-Thunder]] and the [[Calgary Oval X-Treme]] participate.  Clarkson was on hand to present the trophy to the Stars upon their victory. Like the first Stanley Cup champion of 1893, the first Clarkson Cup champions come from Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;IIHF, [http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/montreal-wins-first-clarkson-cup.html?tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1235862000&amp;tx_ttnews%5BpL%5D=2674799&amp;tx_ttnews%5Barc%5D=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=187&amp;cHash=93f761d353 "Montreal wins first Clarkson Cup"], 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2010, the "Clarkson Cup" trademark application that Adrienne Clarkson filed on July 21, 2006, matured into a [[registered trademark]].&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), [http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do;jsessionid=0001g5DbKxXTOMMxYytjnhpXgg3:-52L6HB?lang=eng&amp;status=OK&amp;fileNumber=1310154&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1 "Clarkson Cup" a/n:1310154 r/n:TMA773887] Canadian Trade-marks Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The trophy consists of a [[Loving cup]] with the coat of arms of former Governor General [[Adrienne Clarkson]].

The pedestal is engraved with hockey masks and base engraved with flowers of each province in Canada.

There are several bands attached that have the names and years of each winning team.

==Champions==

The championship game is not played in the home town of any of the CWHL teams, but at a neutral site.

'''Compression garments''' are pieces of clothing that fit tightly around the skin. In medical contexts, compression garments provide support for people who have to stand for long periods or have poor [[Circulatory system|circulation]]. These come in varying degrees of compression, and higher degree compression sleeves, such as sleeves that provide compression of 20–30 mmHg or higher, typically require a doctor's prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year = 2016 |url = http://www.seattlecca.org/shine/oncology-products/compression-garments/about-compression-sleeves-and-garment#3 |title = Seattle Cancer Care Alliance| publisher = seattlecca.org | accessdate = 2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compression garments worn on the legs can help prevent [[deep vein thrombosis]] and reduce swelling, especially while traveling.

In sports, form-fitting compression sportswear, usually made of [[spandex]], is commonly worn by athletes and in exercise to prevent [[Chafing (skin)|chafing]] and [[rash]]es.

==Maternity==
A '''bellyband''', '''wrap''', or '''abdominal binder''' is a compression garment which resembles a [[tubetop]] worn over the abdomen of expectant mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Curtis |first=Glade B. |last2=Schuler |first2=Judith |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Curtis &amp; al.}} |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4z__CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA414 414] |title=Your Pregnancy: Week by Week, ''8th ed.'' |date=2016 |publisher=Da Capo Press }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Belly wraps are also very commonly worn postpartum. Belly wraps are typically prescribed for abdominal support, making it easier for people with back pain to perform day to day tasks, as well as to help mothers with their posture and potential back problems post delivery.

==Stockings==
{{main|Compression stockings}}
Compression stockings are specialized hosiery designed to help prevent the occurrence of and guard against further progression of various medical disorders.

80 years ago, a pair of lady's stockings began the "age of synthetics." &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-75-years-ago-nylon-stockings-changed-world-180955219/|title=How 75 Years Ago Nylon Stockings Changed the World|last=Cutlip|first=Kimbra|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Museum of American History holds the experimental stockings that were created in 1937 to test the viability of the first man-made fiber that was created entirely in a lab.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nylon was thought to have the strength of steel and the sheerness of cobwebs. These stockings became a very hot commodity when they were first released for public purchase. Their demand was so high that four million pairs sold in the first four days.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nylon's impact on fashion was immediate, but the invention sparked a revolution. Nylon's original name was fiber-66.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Stockings became so important to a woman's image that, during World War II, when stockings were not being sold because all nylon was diverted to military use, women began painting their legs with makeup, trying to create the image of nylon stockings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Sportswear==
[[File:Chiara Simionato in action (08-12-2007) 3.jpg|thumb|A speedskater in a bodysuit]]
[[File:Grand Slam Moscow 2012, Set 2 - 022.jpg|thumb|A beach volleyball player in tights]]
Compression sportswear is usually worn by athletes, including shirts, shorts, [[tights]], sleeves, socks, or underwear. They are [[form-fitting garment]]s often made from a [[spandex]]-type material.

One small study of compression shorts found no change in sprint time, but found some gait changes that might reduce injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/0264041031000101971 |vauthors=Doan BK, Kwon YH, Newton RU |title=Evaluation of a lower-body compression garment |journal=J Sports Sci |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=601–10 |date=Aug 2003 |pmid=12875311 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study of calf sleeves found no change in sprint times and gait; larger reviews have found no evidence that compression garments can improve athletic performance beyond the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/11/398929121/compression-clothes-advantage-could-be-placebo-effect | title=Compression Clothes' Advantage Could be Placebo Effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through testing repeat-sprint and throwing performance in cricket players, one study found that there was a significant difference by way of higher mean skin temperature, lower 24-hour post exercise [[Creatine kinase|CK]] values and lower 24-hour post exercise ratings of muscle soreness when wearing compression garments. However, the study failed to find any significant difference in sprint performance, throwing performance, heart rate, or various blood tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17341589 |year=2007 |author1=Duffield |first2=M |last3=Edge |title=Comparison of three types of full-body compression garments on throwing and repeat-sprint performance in cricket players |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=409–14; discussion 414 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.033753 |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |first3=J.|last2=Portus |pmc=2465357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In materials testing, the compressive garment provided increased flexion and extension, which could help reduce hamstring injuries. They also reduced impact by 27% compared to American football pants alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12875311 |year=2003 |author1=Doan |first2=YH |last3=Newton |first3=RU |last4=Shim |first4=J |last5=Popper |first5=EM |last6=Rogers |first6=RA |last7=Bolt |first7=LR |last8=Robertson |first8=M |last9=Kraemer |first9=WJ |title=Evaluation of a lower-body compression garment |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=601–10 |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |doi=10.1080/0264041031000101971|last2=Kwon  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that compressive garments can improve long term vertical jump height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1996/08000/Influence_of_Compression_Garments_on_Vertical_Jump.9.aspx|title=Influence of Compression Garments on Vertical Jump Performan... : The Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research|work=LWW|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the material used, compression garments can be designed to keep athletes cool or warm depending on the requirements of the sport.  This is why you will see both athletes in the winter and summer olympics wearing similar looking compression outfits.  For example, speedskaters can wear compression bodysuits in the cold rink, while beach volleyball players can wear a similar-looking piece made out of a more breathable, lightweight blend.  Both athletes will use moisture wicking materials such as nylon and spandex to keep them lightweight, while cotton would retain moisture and weigh them down in action.  In addition, speed skaters take advantage of the aerodynamic advantage they can get from wearing a skintight suit, while a beach volleyball player has the added benefit of SPF 50+ garments to keep them protected on a sunny day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/fitness/workouts/268-compressed-for-success|title=The compression clothing phenomenon - Women's Health &amp; Fitness|website=www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The athletes pictured show the diverse range of benefits that make compression garments so popular in a wide range of sports and designs.

Other purported benefits of compression sportswear are:
*Keeping the muscles warm to prevent muscle strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeleywellness.com/fitness/active-lifestyle/article/skinny-compression-shorts|title=Benefits of Wearing Compression Shorts|website=@berkeleywellness|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Helping relieve pain from muscle stiffness and soreness.&lt;ref name="The Compression Clothing Craze"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/gear/sports/the-compression-sportswear-craze-20131108|title=The Compression Clothing Craze|work=Men's Journal|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:WrestlingUSAF Flag.jpg|thumb|Wrestlers wear compressing, elastic clothing.]]

*Stabilizing joints.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Shorts and tights===
Compression shorts and tights are [[underwear|undergarments]] usually worn by athletes.  They are [[form-fitting garment]]s and when worn, cover the athlete's waist to mid or lower thigh, similar to [[cycling shorts]].
[[File:Hurdler.jpg|thumb|Hurdler in full compression uniform]]
More recently, [[jockstrap]]s have declined in popularity with young male athletes, and garments such as compression shorts have seen an increase in popularity, arguably because of their comparable function and less embarrassing looks.  Many are available with a [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|cup pocket]], a sewn-in pocket that can hold a protective cup.  It is arguable that compression shorts do not keep cups in the proper position, tight to the body and not moving, as a jockstrap can.  Some players wear the compression shorts over the traditional jockstrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2123007/|title=Where have all the jockstraps gone?|work=Slate Magazine (2005-07-22)|date=2005-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compression shorts are also popular among female athletes, especially among those who wear [[skirts]] or [[kilts]] during games. In those situations, athletes wear compression shorts under the skirt so if they fall over and their skirts ride up, their underwear will not be exposed. This is seen particularly in [[women's lacrosse]] and [[field hockey]] (both being limited contact sports in which players often wear skirts). In this situation, compression shorts are colloquially identified as [[spandex]] shorts.  Women also wear compression shorts in tennis, where, most recently, compression shorts have been produced with ball pockets for convenience.

=== Post-workout benefit ===
Compression garments have been shown to help athletes during the active recovery process. Research shows that following a high intensity treadmill workout, compression garments helped to decrease the heart rate and lactic acid buildup in athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Dale I.|last2=Mason|first2=Dale G.|last3=Delphinus|first3=Elias M.|last4=McLellan|first4=Christopher P.|date=2011-12-01|title=Do compression garments enhance the active recovery process after high-intensity running?|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=25|issue=12|pages=3264–3268|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e31821764f8|issn=1533-4287|pmid=22082795|citeseerx=10.1.1.671.5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a study by Duffield R. and M. Portis, although there were few observed changes during their event, cricket players wearing compression garments showed fewer blood markers of muscle damage and reported less soreness during the 24-hour post-workout period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffield|first=Rob|last2=Portus|first2=Marc|date=2007-07-01|title=Comparison of three types of full-body compression garments on throwing and repeat-sprint performance in cricket players|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=41|issue=7|pages=409–414; discussion 414|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.033753|issn=1473-0480|pmc=2465357|pmid=17341589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have supported the idea that compression garments are effective in reducing post-workout declines in jump height, minimizing strength loss, decreasing swelling, and easing muscle soreness after competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.active.com/running/articles/is-compression-gear-really-effective?page=3|title=Is Compression Gear Really Effective?|date=2012-12-11|work=ACTIVE.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constant Lestienne''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃stɑ̃ lɛstjɛn}}; born 23 May 1992) is a French professional tennis player. He competes mainly in the [[ITF Men's Circuit]] and [[ATP Challenger Tour]].
He has won two ATP Challenger Tour singles titles. In addition, he has won five singles titles and three doubles titles in the ITF Men's Circuit.
.&lt;ref name="itftennis" /&gt;

==Career==
Lestienne reached his first career ATP World Tour singles main draw (where he lost in the first round to [[Pablo Carreño Busta]]) at the [[2015 Estoril Open – Singles|2015 Estoril Open]] after winning two singles qualifying matches.

===Betting scandal===
In September 2016 Lestienne was suspended for seven months and fined $10,000 by the [[International Tennis Federation]] for betting on tennis matches. The [[Tennis Integrity Unit]] (TIU) in cooperation with French online gambling regulator ARJEL found that Lestienne had bet on 220 tennis matches between February 2012 and June 2015. None of these matches were his own. Half of the ban is suspended and his fine will be halved if he cooperates with the TIU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tour player Constant Lestienne banned for seven months after betting on tennis matches|url=http://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12110/10587008/tour-player-constant-lestienne-banned-after-betting-on-tennis-matches|publisher=[[SkySports]]|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennis : Constant Lestienne suspendu sept mois pour avoir parié sur des centaines de matchs|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/tennis/article/2016/09/21/tennis-constant-lestienne-suspendu-sept-mois-pour-avoir-parie-sur-des-centaines-de-matchs_5001317_1616659.html|publisher=[[Le Monde]]|language=French|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coolray Field ''' (formerly known as '''Gwinnett Stadium''') is a 10,427-seat [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] [[baseball park]] in unincorporated [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]] (with a mailing address in [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]]).  It is the home field of the [[Gwinnett Stripers]], the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Farm team#Baseball|affiliate]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]], and [[Atlanta United 2]], the [[United Soccer League]] affiliate of [[Atlanta United FC]].

==History==
Coolray Field hosted its first regular season baseball game on April 17, 2009, a 7–4 [[Gwinnett Braves]] loss to the [[Norfolk Tides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=G-Braves' Loss Can't Ruin New Team's Home Opener|first=Ben|last=Beitzel|url=http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/news/2009/apr/18/g-braves039-loss-can039t-ruin-new-team039s-home/|newspaper=[[Gwinnett Daily Post]]|date=April 18, 2009|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium site is located approximately two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) east of the [[Mall of Georgia]] along [[Georgia State Route 20|Georgia 20]], between [[Interstate 85 (Georgia)|Interstate 85]] and [[Georgia 316]].

The {{convert|44|acre|ha|adj=on}} site was previously [[arable land|farmland]] and [[forest]]. An additional {{convert|73|acre|km2}} of mostly forest around it became a [[mixed-use]] project, after a February 2009 [[rezoning]] by the Gwinnett County Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BOC Approves Rezoning Near Stadium|first=Jamie|last=Ward|url=http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/news/2009/feb/04/boc-approves-rezoning-near-stadium/|newspaper=[[Gwinnett Daily Post]]|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naming rights]] are held by Coolray, an air conditioning and plumbing company based in nearby [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]].

The stadium construction and maintenance is being paid by the taxpayer-funded Gwinnett County government, but the Stripers will keep most of the [[revenue]] from ticket and concession stand sales. The [[municipal bond]]s used to pay for the stadium run for 30 years (until 2038), but the Stripers have an option to back out of the [[contract]] after only half of that time (in 2023), if the county does not maintain the facility at an acceptable level. This would leave county taxpayers responsible for the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Contract Bringing Braves AAA Farm Team to Gwinnett Signed Tuesday|first=Arielle|last=Kass|url=http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/news/2008/apr/02/contract-bringing-braves-aaa-farm-team-to/|newspaper=[[Gwinnett Daily Post]]|date=April 2, 2008|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first season, it was revealed that [[parking]] revenue was a fraction (about 15%) of what was expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gwinnett Braves Parking Revenue Falls Short of County Expectations|first=Patrick|last=Fox|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett/gwinnett-braves-parking-revenue-188884.html|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=November 6, 2009|accessdate=November 6, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108172929/http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett/gwinnett-braves-parking-revenue-188884.html|archivedate=November 8, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gwinnett Braves (renamed to the Stripers in 2017) moved to the stadium in 2009 when the [[Atlanta Braves]] moved their affiliate, the [[Richmond Braves]], after 43 seasons (1966–2008) in [[Richmond, Virginia]].  They are located 35 miles northeast of their parent club's stadium, [[SunTrust Park]] in unincorporated [[Cobb County]]—the second-shortest distance between a Triple-A team and its major league parent (behind only the [[Pacific Coast League]]'s [[Tacoma Rainiers]], based 26 miles south of Seattle). They have held this distinction since moving to Gwinnett County; the Braves played at [[Turner Field]] in Atlanta at the time.

Coolray Field features 19 luxury suites, a 30-foot-by-40-foot video board in right-center field, a 6-foot-by-42-foot LED board along the left-field wall and chairback seating complete with cupholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 Gwinnett Braves Digital Media Guide|url=http://www.milb.com/documents/2012/04/05/27948772/1/2012_Gwinnett_Braves_Digital_Media_Guide.pdf|publisher=[[Gwinnett Braves]]|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Honda Sports Award''' is an annual award in the [[United States]], given to the best [[college athletics|collegiate]] female athlete in each of twelve sports. There are four nominees for each sport, and the twelve winners of the Honda Award are automatically in the running for the [[Honda-Broderick Cup]] award, as the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year. Three other athletes are honored as the [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] Athlete of the Year, [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] Athlete of the Year, and Inspiration Award winner.

==Process==
Winners are selected in each of the 12 [[NCAA]]-sanctioned sports by a panel of more than 1,000 NCAA administrators. Three other athletes are honored as the Division II Athlete of the Year, Division III Athlete of the Year, and Inspiration Award winner. Each woman is selected not only for her superior athletic skills, but also for her leadership abilities, academic excellence and eagerness to participate in community service.

At the end of the year, one deserving athlete will be chosen as the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year and receive the coveted Honda-Broderick Cup. Past winners of this prestigious award include [[Jackie Joyner]] and [[Mia Hamm]].

[[Honda#Marketing|Honda]] has donated more than $2 million in grants and scholarships to the universities over the course of the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">'''Lithuania National Stadium''' is a new multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], that is under construction since 1987. It will be used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and will host the home matches of the [[Lithuania national football team]]. The stadium will have a capacity of 25,000 people. It would replace the use of [[S. Darius and S. Girėnas Stadium]], [[Žalgiris Stadium]], and [[LFF Stadium]]. The construction was temporarily abandoned since March 2010. The minister of interior, Dailis Alfonsas Barakauskas, has said that it was expected to be finished by 2016 to a cost around [[LTL]] 260 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vilnius: Construction of national stadium to restart one more time|url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2013/05/vilnius_construction_of_national_stadium_to_restart_one_more_time|website=stadiumdb.com|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stadium construction was revitalized in early 2016. It was planned to be completed between 2019 and 2020 at the cost of about [[EUR]] 80–100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gudavičius|first1=Stasys|title=Valstybės šimtmečiui nespės: Nacionalinio stadiono finišas ir vėl atidedamas|url=http://www.vz.lt/2016/04/22/valstybes-simtmeciui-nespes-nacionalinio-stadiono-finisas-ir-vel-atidedamas|website=vz.lt|accessdate=31 January 2018|language=lt-LT|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the construction was not continued and a new competition for the building of the stadium was announced in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finišo tiesioji dėl nacionalinio stadiono Vilniuje: yra du projektai|url=https://www.15min.lt/verslas/naujiena/kvadratinis-metras/nekilnojamasis-turtas/finiso-tiesioji-del-nacionalinio-stadiono-vilniuje-bent-vienas-projektas-tikrai-yra-973-893862|website=15min.lt|accessdate=31 January 2018|language=lt-LT|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samkus|first1=Mindaugas|title=Nacionalinis stadionas: svarbiausios datos|url=https://www.15min.lt/verslas/naujiena/kvadratinis-metras/nekilnojamasis-turtas/nacionalinis-stadionas-svarbiausios-datos-973-919144|website=15min.lt|accessdate=31 January 2018|language=lt-LT|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[snooker]], under normal circumstances, the '''maximum [[Break (snooker)|break]]''' is 147,&lt;ref name="British Phrasebook"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Elizabeth|last1=Bartsch-Parker|first2=Roibeard|last2=O'Maolalaigh|first3=Stephen|last3=Burger|title=British Phrasebook|year=1999|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Hawthorn, Vic.|isbn=0-86442-484-1|page=146|url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=qcR7uwgf5BEC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22maximum+break%22+snooker&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OUe1T-XqEsPStAaq9JnDDA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maximum%20break%22%20snooker&amp;f=false|edition=1st|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''maximum''', a '''147''', or orally, a '''one-four-seven'''. This score is attained by potting all 15 {{Cuegloss|Red ball|reds}} with 15 {{Cuegloss|Black ball|blacks}} for 120 points, followed by all six {{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colours}} for a further 27 points, all in a single {{Cuegloss|break}} i.e. without any misses.&lt;ref name="British Phrasebook"/&gt;

[[Joe Davis]] made the first officially recognised maximum break in a 1955 exhibition match in London. In 1982, [[Steve Davis]] achieved the first recognised maximum in professional competition, which was also the first maximum to occur during a [[Broadcasting of sports events|televised match]]. The following year, [[Cliff Thorburn]] became the first player to make a maximum in [[1983 World Snooker Championship|a World Championship]].

Maximum breaks have always been rare in snooker. It took until 2013 for 100 maximums to be scored in professional competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/25284182|title=UK Snooker Championship 2013: Selby makes 100th 147 break|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they have gradually become more frequent in the game. Only eight maximums were achieved in the 1980s, but 26 were attained in the 1990s and 35 in the 2000s. So far in the 2010s, over 70 maximums have been achieved.

The record for the [[#Total maximum breaks|most maximum breaks in professional competition]] is held by [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] with 15. He also holds the [[#Chronometrical|record for the fastest competitive maximum break]], at just over five minutes, which he achieved at the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 World Championship]]. 

Breaks greater than 147 are possible if there is a {{Cuegloss|free ball}} before any of the reds have been potted, though this situation is itself extremely unusual. Only one break of over 147 has occurred in professional competition, when [[Jamie Burnett]] made a break of 148 in the qualifying stages of the [[2004 UK Championship (snooker)|2004 UK Championship]].

==History==
[[Joe Davis]] compiled the first officially recognised maximum break on 22 January 1955, in a match against [[Willie Smith (billiards player)|Willie Smith]] at [[Leicester Square Hall]], London.&lt;ref name="times24jan1955"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=24 January 1955 |page=12 |title=Maximum Snooker Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Billiards Association and Control Council]] initially refused to accept the break since the match was not played under their rules. At the time the professionals played using a rule (now standard) whereby after a foul a player could compel the offender to play the next stroke. It was only at a meeting on 20 March 1957 that they recognised the break. Davis was presented with a certificate to commemorate his achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=21 March 1957 |page=4 |title=J Davis's Record Recognized}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match between Davis and Smith was played as part of a series of events marking the closure of Leicester Square Hall. The hall, known as Thurston's Hall until 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=18 September 1947 |page=6 |title=Billiards and Snooker}}&lt;/ref&gt; had hosted many important billiards and snooker matches since its opening in 1901, including 12 [[World Snooker Championship]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=17 January 1955 |page=3 |title=Farewell Leicester Square - Hall of Memories lost to Billiards}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] made the first tournament maximum break in the 1979 Holsten Lager International, but this did not count as an official maximum as the break was made on a non-templated table used during the event.&lt;ref name="Snooker.org"/&gt; The first official maximum break in professional competition was by [[Steve Davis]] in the [[1982 Classic (snooker)|1982 Classic]] at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in [[Oldham]], against [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |title=Stephen Hendry progress in balance despite 147 maximum break |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/snooker/5238033/Stephen-Hendry-progress-in-balance-despite-147-maximum-break.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=14 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z8pYGGGV?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/snooker/5238033/Stephen-Hendry-progress-in-balance-despite-147-maximum-break.html |archivedate= 2 June 2011 |date=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; winning a car for the achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sportinglife.com/snooker/news/article/663/9062843/snookers-historic-maximum-breaks| title = Snooker's historic maximum breaks | accessdate = 14 February 2014| date = 7 December 2013| publisher=SportingLife}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first televised maximum.&lt;ref name="Guinness-Davis"/&gt; The following year, [[Cliff Thorburn]] became the first player to make a maximum at the [[1983 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], in the fourth frame of his second round match against [[Terry Griffiths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/snooker/news/article/663/9062843/snookers-historic-maximum-breaks|title=Snooker's historic maximum breaks|accessdate=14 February 2014|date=7 December 2013|publisher=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1994–95 season, the maximum break remained a rare feat, with only 15 compiled official maximums. But starting with 1994–95, a maximum break has been achieved every season thereafter;  the 13 maximums scored in the 2016–17 season is the highest number to date. The one-hundreth officially recognised maximum break in professional competition was made on 7 December 2013 by [[Mark Selby]] in the 7th frame of his semi-final match at the [[2013 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] against [[Ricky Walden]].&lt;ref name="2013 Selby 147"/&gt; Since then, another 39 maximum breaks have been officially recorded in professional competition.&lt;ref name="Official 147s" /&gt; Englishman [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has compiled fifteen ratified competitive maximum breaks, the most by any professional player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocket Flies To Magical Maximum |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0,,13165~4346839,00.html |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |date=4 December 2014 |accessdate=5 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208111600/http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0%2C%2C13165~4346839%2C00.html |archivedate=8 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following him are [[Stephen Hendry]] with eleven, [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] with eight, and [[Ding Junhui]] with six. O'Sullivan also holds the record for the fastest competitive maximum break at just over 5 minutes, which he set at the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 World Championship]].&lt;ref name=Deadspin /&gt;

=== Match-winning maximum breaks ===
Tournament games are won when one of the players manages to win more than half of the scheduled frames.  For example, if a match is scheduled to have a maximum of 7 frames, a player wins the game when winning a 4th frame, regardless of how many frames the other player has.

===Chronometrical===
*Ronnie O'Sullivan's first 147 break against [[Mick Price (snooker player)|Mick Price]] in their second round tie at the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 world championship]] set a still-standing world record for the fastest maximum in the history of the game. [[Guinness World Records]] recorded the time of the break at 5 minutes and 20 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fastest 147 break in snooker |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-147-break-in-snooker/ |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an investigation undertaken by [[Deadspin]] in 2017 revealed that the time recorded by Guinness is incorrect, as a result of the timer being started too early on the BBC footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ronnie O’Sullivan’s fastest maximum in history was faster than official time |date=28 April 2017 |publisher=[[Eurosport]] |url=https://www.eurosport.co.uk/snooker/world-championship/2016-2017/ronnie-osullivans-fastest-maximum-in-history-was-faster-than-official-time_sto6146498/story.shtml |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaks are not officially timed in snooker and the official [[rules of snooker]] do not specify how they should be timed, instead leaving the timing to the discretion of the broadcaster.&lt;ref name=Deadspin&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Tippett |title=The Greatest Break In Snooker History Was Even Better Than Anyone Realized |date=27 April 2017 |publisher=[[Deadspin]] |url=https://deadspin.com/the-greatest-break-in-snooker-history-was-even-better-t-1794695566 |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Snooker]] has since suggested that a break starts when the player strikes the cueball for the first time in a break which would result in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds,&lt;ref name=Deadspin /&gt; and this is the time that World Snooker now officially acknowledges.&lt;ref name="WorldSnooker Bio of O'Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronnie O'Sullivan|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/players/ronnie-osullivan/|date=11 January 2015|publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]]|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this methodology for timing breaks is inconsistent with the one employed in shot clock events where timing for a player's shot begins when the balls have come to rest from his opponent's previous shot, and under this convention the break would have been timed at 5 minutes and 15 seconds.&lt;ref name=Deadspin /&gt; At one time,&lt;!-- source is from 2005 --&gt; O'Sullivan held the times for the four fastest maximum breaks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guffoo.cz/danny/ronnie/index.php?nid=1380&amp;lid=cs&amp;oid=167377&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prize money ==
In professional tournaments there was usually a substantial prize awarded to any player achieving a 147 break. For example, [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]]'s maximum at the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 World Championship]] earned him £165,000. Of this, £147,000 was for making the 147 break and £18,000 was for achieving the highest break of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embassy World Championship 1997 |url=http://www.snooker.org/trn/9697/wc_res.shtml |publisher=Snooker.org |accessdate=28 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6484HUVV2?url=http://www.snooker.org/trn/9697/wc_res.shtml |archivedate=22 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was however abolished in the [[Snooker season 2010/2011|2010/2011 season]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In the [[Snooker season 2011/2012|2011/2012 season]] World Snooker introduced a roll-over system for the maximum break prize money, the "rolling 147 prize".&lt;ref name="Rolling 147"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rolling 147 Totals |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0,,13165~2396104,00.html |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |accessdate=31 October 2011 |date=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930140427/http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0%2C%2C13165~2396104%2C00.html |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A maximum break is worth £5,000 in the televised stages and £500 in qualifying stages of major [[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] events.

At the [[2016 Welsh Open (snooker)|2016 Welsh Open]], [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] defeated [[Barry Pinches]] 4–1 in the first round. In the fifth frame of the match, O'Sullivan declined the opportunity to make a maximum break, potting the pink off the penultimate red and completing a break of 146. He stated afterward that the prize money of £10,000 was not worthy of a 147. World Snooker chairman [[Barry Hearn]] called the decision "unacceptable" and "disrespectful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/35581281|title=Ronnie O'Sullivan criticised after turning down 'too cheap' 147 at Welsh Open|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=16 February 2016|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaks exceeding 147==
A break higher than 147 can be achieved when an opponent {{Cuegloss|Foul|fouls}} before any reds are potted, and leaves the incoming player {{Cuegloss|Snooker|snookered}} (blocked) on all 15 reds. The player can nominate one of the other {{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colours}} as a red, known as a "{{Cuegloss|free ball}}", which carries the same value as a red for just that shot. If the free ball is potted, the referee places back this colored ball on its original location, ''de facto'' creating a setup as if there were 16 reds in total, thus creating a potential maximum break of 155 if a player starts from a free ball position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Selby Makes Historic 147 |date=7 December 2013 |work=World Snooker |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/selby-makes-historic-147/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107132534/http://www.worldsnooker.com/selby-makes-historic-147/ |archivedate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2004, during qualifying for the [[2004 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], [[Jamie Burnett]] became the only player to record a break of more than 147 in tournament play, when he scored 148 against [[Leo Fernandez]].  He took the brown as the free ball, then potted the brown again followed by the 15 reds with 12 blacks, two pinks and a blue, then the six colours.&lt;ref name="burnettguardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Everton|first=Clive|title=Burnett's break goes one better|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/oct/18/snooker.cliveeverton|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=18 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snooker.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/3750162.stm |title=Scot Burnett compiles 148 break |date=16 October 2004 |accessdate=21 January 2007 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6484HUVZP?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/3750162.stm |archivedate=22 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New ASU Stadium''' on the campus of [[Alabama State University]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]] is a 26,500-seat stadium that replaces the [[Cramton Bowl]] as the host venue for the [[Alabama State Hornets football]] team.  The first game in the New ASU Stadium was the 89th Turkey Day Classic on November 22, 2012 in which the Hornets hosted the [[Tuskegee Golden Tigers football|Tuskegee Golden Tigers]]. The game was a sell-out and was televised nationally on [[ESPNU]]. The Hornets lost the first ever game in their new stadium 27-25 due to a late two-point conversion by Tuskegee.

The stadium's current capacity sits at 26,500 but the project was designed to allow for future expansion that can expand the capacity to 55,000.&lt;ref name="growth"&gt;{{cite web |title=$62 million Alabama State stadium sets stage for growth across Montgomery|url=http://blog.al.com/montgomery/2012/11/new_asu_hornets_stadium_sets_s.html|work=AL.com|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red Berets Football Club''' was a [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Nakuru]], [[Kenya]]. It was based in [[Nairobi]] until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kenya07.html RSSSF&amp;nbsp;– Kenya 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its home ground was the [[Afraha Stadium]], but due to its unavailability in 2008, the club played its home games at the [[Greensteds School]] Grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kenya08.html RSSSF&amp;nbsp;– Kenya 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was founded in 1980 and owned by the [[Kenya Police]]. In 2000 it won promotion from the [[Kenyan Nationwide League|Nationwide League]] to the [[Kenyan Premier League|Premier League]], where it stayed until they were relegated at the end of the [[2010 Kenyan Premier League|2010 season]], after which it was disbanded as it was under immense pressure from its sponsors to produce good performances, contrary to the season they had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Red Berets FC disbanded |url=http://www.michezoafrika.com/Kpl/Red-Berets-FC-disbanded/896.aspx |author=Dennis Machio |publisher=MichezoAfrika.com |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rizal Memorial Coliseum''' is one of two [[indoor arena|indoor sporting arenas]] located inside the [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], the other being the [[Ninoy Aquino Stadium]]. The capacity of the coliseum is 8,000.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco]] building within the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex was designed by [[Juan Arellano]] and was built in 1934 by the engineering firm of Pedro Siochi &amp; Co., Inc.&lt;ref name="scored"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sembrano|first1=Edgar Allan|title=Erap plan to convert Rizal Coliseum into a mall scored|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/245636/erap-plan-convert-rizal-coliseum-mall-scored/|accessdate=29 November 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippine Sports Commission]] (PSC) unveiled plans for the conversion of the Rizal Memorial Coliseum into a Philippine Sports Museum and the Asian Games Museum which houses the memorabililia of Philippine and Asian sports icons and hall of famers. The current location of the PSM is located at the 2nd floor of the PSC building inside the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. There was a plan to demolish the site before the PSC's announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://balita.net.ph/2016/01/20/rizal-memorial-coliseum-gagawing-home-of-sports-hall-of-famers/|title=Rizal Memorial Coliseum, gagawing 'Home of Sports Hall of Famers'|trans-title=Rizal Memorial Coliseum will turned into a 'Home of Sports Hall of Famers'|language=Filipino|publisher=Balita|last=Oredo|first=Angie|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2016, Manila Mayor [[Joseph Estrada]] announced that the city government is making a partnership with businessman Ricky Razon to convert the facility into a commercial center which will include a mall and cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clapano|first1=Jose Rodel|title=Manila to turn Rizal coliseum into mall|url=http://www.philstar.com/metro/2016/11/23/1646558/manila-turn-rizal-coliseum-mall|accessdate=24 November 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was criticized by the Heritage Conservation Society questioning if Manila needs another shopping mall. The [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts ]] also stated that the city government of Estrada never consulted the agency regarding their plans on the sports venue in particular despite promising to cooperate with the government body on [[cultural conservation]] in a meeting initiated by the Manila government on May 2016.&lt;ref name="scored"/&gt;

'''Shoulder programming''' is a type of pre-event and post-event [[broadcast programming]] as a companion to [[broadcasting of sports events|live sporting events]]. This type of programming may be multi-platform and include both  [[Television program|television]] and [[radio program]]s. Due to exclusive content or access, it may be included in a [[Sports broadcasting contracts in the United States|broadcast rights]] package for a particular sport or event. The purpose is to expand revenue opportunities through radio or [[television advertisement|television advertising]] or increased exposure to a [[pay-per-view]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deninger|first1=Dennis|title=Sports on Television: The how and why Behind what You See|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|pages=100–101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MitTh_reHL8C|accessdate=28 February 2015|isbn=9780415896757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===NFL===

[[NFL Primetime]], [[Monday Night Countdown]], and ''SportsCenter Monday Kickoff'' have each been companion [[National Football League]] (NFL) programming for [[Monday Night Football]] on [[ESPN]]. Monday Night Football was highly rated on ABC from 1970 to 2005, but since ESPN took over in 2006, it could more directly surround the franchise with programming in the time-slots before and after the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capon|first1=Noel|title=The Marketing Mavens|publisher=Crown Religion/Business/Forum|pages=128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zZZB6PstbCkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 February 2015|ref=2|isbn=9780307394477|date=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UFC===

The first [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) event on [[UFC on Fox]] was [[UFC 121|UFC 121: Lesnar vs. Velasquez]] a title card between [[Junior dos Santos]] and [[Cain Velasquez]] in 2011. Networks such as [[Fox Deportes]], ''Fuel TV'' (since re-branded [[Fox Sports 2]]  and [[Fox Sports Radio]] broadcast many hours of programming leading up to and during the fight. Programming included specials by both Fox Deportes and Fuel TV. Replays of the previously-held Velasquez vs Lesnar fight and the weigh-in were aired by Fox Deportes and Fuel TV, respectively. Live radio coverage of the fight was broadcast by Fox Sports Radio. Other programming included a UFC primetime special and the pre-fight and post-fight shows by Fuel TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plenty Of Shoulder Programming For UFC's Network Debut On Fox|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Closing-Bell/2011/11/11/Fox-UFC.aspx?hl=Octagon&amp;sc=0|website=Sports Business Daily|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

ESPN has been criticized for devoting more or less air-time to a sport depending on whether it has rights to the primary organization or league of that sport. Examples include less air-time for [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), including the cancellation of [[NHL 2Night]] following their expiration of ESPN's rights contract and expanding air-time for [[NASCAR]] and the [[Arena Football League]] following rights deals.&lt;ref name="At ESPN, conflict of interest is business as usual"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schreiber|first1=Le Anne|title=At ESPN, conflict of interest is business as usual|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?id=2866241|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thika United Football Club''' is an [[association football]] club based in [[Thika]], [[Kenya]], which currently competes in the [[Kenya Super League]], the second tier of the [[Kenyan football league system]]. They play their home games at the Thika Sub-County Stadium.

The club was formed in 2000 as ''Beirut FC''. The following year, after being promoted to the [[Nationwide League (Kenya)|Nationwide League]] (second level), it adopted new name, ''Medisca Thika'', after its then sponsors. The current name (Thika United FC) has been in use since 2003, which was also its first year in the top flight under the sponsorship of Brookside Dairies. Midfielder Matthew Dickinson hit the headlines of local and some national newspapers when he left local team Brislington Badgers in Bristol, England, to travel to Kenya to gain nationality and happened to earn himself a lengthy contract with Thika United.&lt;ref name="nationcoke_30jan11"/&gt;

==History==
Thika United made their top flight debut in 2002 and finished third in 2006 and 2009.&lt;ref name="nationcoke_30jan11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/sports/Thika-coach-hopes-patience-will-pay--/960656-1098210-13ikqxf/index.html|date=30 January 2011|title=Thika coach hopes patience will pay|last=Kitula|first=Sammy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thika United regained promotion to the [[Kenya Premier League]] after beating Ushuru F.C. 2-1 on aggregate in the 2017 Kenya Super League promotion playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/thika-united-survive-kpl-promotion-battle/1g7ewsl26w7fp1ot7emjsqqmxv|title=Thika United survive KPL Promotion Battle|publisher=goal.com|date=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were relegated back to the Kenya Nationwide League after one season, finishing bottom of the [[Kenyan Premier League]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.soccerway.com/national/kenya/premier-league/2018/regular-season/r45235/|title=Summary - 2018 Kenya Premier League|publisher=soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
