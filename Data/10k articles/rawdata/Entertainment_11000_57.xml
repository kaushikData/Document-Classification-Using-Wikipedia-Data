'''''4''''' is a 2007 Australian [[documentary film]] directed by [[Tim Slade (Director)|Tim Slade]] exploring [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]'' through the eyes of four violinists in four countries. Each musician represents a season appropriate to his or her country: [[Sayaka Shoji]] plays Spring in Japan, [[Niki Vasilakis]] plays Summer in Australia, [[Cho-Liang Lin]] plays Autumn in the United States, and [[Pekka Kuusisto]] plays Winter in Finland.

The film was nominated for two Australian Film Institute Awards, an International Documentary Association Award, as well as awards at the Banff World Television Festival. It won several awards, including a Gold HUGO in Chicago. It has sold to more than 20 international broadcasters and screened at more than 25 international film festivals.

It screened on NHK in Japan in December 2010, and on PBS stations in the USA in May 2011, and continues to sell via DVD in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, as well as via online sales.

==Box office==
''4'' took $118,270 at the box office in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office'']&lt;/ref&gt;
It grossed back its production budget via theatrical release, broadcast, DVD, CD Soundtrack and ancillary sales.

The '''Adult Film Association of America''' ('''AFAA''') was the first [[United States|American]] association of [[pornographic film]] producers. It fought against [[censorship]] laws, attempted to defend the industry against prosecution for [[obscenity]], and held an annual [[#Erotic_Film_Awards|adult film awards ceremony]]. Founded in 1969, it continued separate operation until 1992 when it merged with [[Free Speech Coalition#Legal advocacy|Free Speech Legal Defense Fund]].&lt;ref name="afwg0593" /&gt; The organization was also host to the '''Erotic Film Awards''' which were held from 1977 until 1986.

== History ==

=== Origin, 1970s and 1980s ===
It was founded in 1969 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], with Sam Chernoff of Astro-Jemco Film Co. as the first [[president]]. Other notable presidents included [[film producer]] [[David F. Friedman]], elected the third president in 1971, and re-elected four times before becoming [[Chairman]] of the Board, and erotic actress and [[magazine]] publisher [[Gloria Leonard]], who became president in 1986.&lt;ref name="afw0187"&gt;"10th Annual Erotic Awards," ''Adam Film World'', January 1987, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

It held adult [[film awards]] ceremonies for 10 years during the [[Golden Age of Porn]]. The first awards ceremony was held July 14, 1977, at the [[Ebell of Los Angeles|Wilshire Ebell Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] while religious protesters picketed outside,&lt;ref name="afw1277"&gt;Thomas H. Hilton, "The First Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World'', December 1977, pp. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt; as they would several years thereafter.&lt;ref name="rimmer"&gt;[[Robert Rimmer]], ''The X-Rated Videotape Guide'', Prometheus Books, 1993. {{ISBN|0-87975-799-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afw0179"&gt;Frank Thistle, "The Second Annual Erotica Awards," ''Adam Film World'', January 1979, pp. 24-27, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hs1179"&gt;"Silver Spoonfuls: A Star Is Porn," ''High Society'' magazine, November 1979, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afw0180"&gt;Jules Griffon, "The Third Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World'', Vol. 7, No. 8, January 1980, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="genesis0180"&gt;Ken Gaul, "California Split—Oscar Night in XXX-Film Land," ''Genesis'' magazine, January 1980, pp. 58-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pornstars8011"&gt;Richard Milner, "Erotica '80 Awards", ''Porn Stars, the Stag Erotic Series'', November–December 1980, pp. 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheri0784"&gt;"Go for Bold: Stars and stares compete at the 8th Annual Erotica Awards," ''Cheri Magazine'', July 1984, pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt; "These feverish protesters are such a familiar part of the ritual, they really should be listed in the program," sex news magazine ''Cheri'' stated after the 1983 awards.&lt;ref name="cheri1183"&gt;"Winners, Sinners &amp; Skin", ''Cheri'' magazine, November 1983, pp. 32-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of pornography on video, in early 1986 the AFAA renamed itself '''Adult Film and Video Association of America (AFVAA)'''&lt;ref name="cheri0187" /&gt; and added a new award category, [[#Best Adult Video|best adult video]]. The 10th annual awards, held at the Sheraton Premiere Hotel in Los Angeles on June 29, 1986, were the last.

The association changed its name again in 1987 to the '''Adult Video Association (AVA)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Williams, [http://www.xbiz.com/articles/18467 "Gloria Leonard" feature], XBIZ.com, Dec. 6, 2006; retrieved June 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; No awards were given for 1987.&lt;ref name="afwg1988dir"&gt;"Award Winners: Adult Film Association of America Erotica Award", ''Adam Film World Guide'', Vol. 3, No. 12, March 1988, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in mid-1988 they were replaced by an annual Night of the Stars dinner-dance and legal fundraiser,&lt;ref&gt;Bob Johnson, [http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=135778&amp;mi=all&amp;q=night+of+the+stars "Free Speech Coalition Reaches 20-Year Milestone Fighting the Good Fight,"] Xbiz.com, retrieved June 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth of which it held in June 1992 with more than 500 people in attendance, the association's biggest show ever.&lt;ref name="afwg0593" /&gt; [[#Lifetime_Achievement_Awards|Lifetime Achievement Awards]] were presented at the Night of the Stars, however, film awards were discontinued.

=== 1990s ===
By February 1992, the tables were turned – association members "picketed the Public Forum on Pornography sponsored by religious groups who hope to institute [[Motion Picture Production Code|morality codes]] back into all movies made."&lt;ref name="afwg0593"&gt;Jeremy Stone, "1992: The Year in Porn", ''Adam Film World Guide'', May 1993, pp. 6-7 &amp; 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1992, Video Vixens [[Trading Cards]] for [[Collecting|collectors]] were released with part of the profits going to the AVA. That same month, the AVA and Free Speech Legal Defense Fund, which had been organized in 1991, unified to create a new [[umbrella organization]], the '''[[Free Speech Coalition]] (FSC)'''.&lt;ref name="afwg0593" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discountadultshopping.com/glorialeonard/glorialeonardbiography.html |title=The Life Of Legendary Porn Actress Gloria Leonard|website=discountadultshopping.com|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role as the [[trade association]] of the [[sex industry|adult entertainment industry]]&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; was taken over by the FSC, which acknowledges the AFAA as its first [[ancestor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freespeechcoalition.com/aboutus.htm History of the Free Speech Coalition], Archived at: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513064546/http://www.freespeechcoalition.com/aboutus.htm |date=May 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AFAA award history===
[[Pornographic film actor|Pornographic actress]] [[Marilyn Chambers]] presented the very first award for [[#Best Picture|best erotic motion picture]] to the L. Sultana production of ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]'', while runner-up was ''Count the Ways'', produced by Virginia Ann Perry.&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt; [[Jennifer Welles]] and [[Jamie Gillis]] were the first winners in the [[#Best Actress|best actress]] and [[#Best Actor|best actor]] categories. Pornographic actor [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] told the crowd at the first year's awards, "In the not-too-far distant future we will proudly say that we were pioneers."&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt;

Retroactive awards of merit were also given to five movies considered best from 1955 to 1975: ''[[Tonight for Sure]]'', ''Not Tonight, Henry!'' ''[[Trader Hornee]]'' and ''Sometime Sweet Susan''. ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' was also honored as one of the top-grossing of all movies, including mainstream films, of [[1972 in film|1972]]. Board chairman Friedman said the AFAA was "much too busy fighting legal battles" in the early days to hold awards ceremonies, so these [[#Special Awards|special awards]] were intended to make up for not having presented them in the past.&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt;

For a time the most notable erotic film awards were those of the AFAA, considered to be "the closest thing the porn world's got to filmdom's [[Academy Award|Oscar]] derby."&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt; Many stars would arrive in chauffeur-driven limousines while some would vie for attention by arriving in a four-horse [[carriage]], a Roman [[chariot]], a [[horse]] or even an [[elephant]].&lt;ref name="afwg0582"&gt;"The 5th Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World Guide'', May 1982, pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The third annual awards "drew a festive crowd of some 600 porn-people plus several hundred hard-core fans to the [[Hollywood Palladium]]."&lt;ref name="afw0180" /&gt; Subsequent awards shows even attracted celebrities such as ''[[Godfather Trilogy|The Godfather]]'' director [[Francis Ford Coppola]],&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afwg0884"&gt;Kent Smith, "The 8th Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World Guide'', Vol. 2, No. 2, August 1984, pp. 22–25.&lt;/ref&gt; singer [[Stephen Bishop (musician)|Stephen Bishop]]&lt;ref name="afwg0884" /&gt; and [[gonzo journalism|gonzo journalist]] [[Hunter S. Thompson]]&lt;ref name="cheri0187"&gt;[[Candida Royalle]], "Porn On Parade: The 1986 AFAA Awards", ''Cheri Magazine'', Vol. 11, No. 6, January 1987, pp.40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; to be part of the audience and comedian [[Jackie Gayle]]&lt;ref name="afwg0884" /&gt; and singer [[Jaye P. Morgan]] of ''[[The Gong Show]]'' to be part of evening's entertainment.&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; The fifth and eighth awards ceremonies were videotaped and offered to cable and subscription television&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; and for sale on [[VHS]] cassettes while the seventh was taped for an August 1983 broadcast on [[Playboy TV]]. Other awards during the [[Golden Age of Porn|porno chic]] era included ''[[Adam Film World]]'s'' X-Caliber awards, first given out in 1975 and based on votes of fans,&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt; ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine's Erotic Movie Awards, first presented in 1977 and the [[Critics' Adult Film Association#CAFA Awards|Critics Adult Film Awards]], bestowed by a [[New York City|New York]]-based group of [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] adult sex film critics from 1981 to 1987.

By the third awards ceremony in 1980, although the concept was seen as positive, adult entertainment magazine ''[[Genesis (magazine)|Genesis]]'' reported they were "beginning to generate as much controversy as the regular [[Academy Award]]s, or more."&lt;ref name="genesis0180" /&gt; While it seemed "politicking" gave the Best Film award to ''Legend of Lady Blue'' over heavy favorites ''Sex World'' and ''Take Off'', the "most glaring lack of any validity" was shown by giving the best actor award to [[Aldo Ray]]. "The Erotica Awards are supposed to be presented to sex-film performers who both 'act' well and 'perform' well. In ''Sweet Savage'', not only did Aldo Ray not 'act' particularly well—his part was simply gratuitous...he never even performed at all. The fact is he never even took his clothes off, nor did he show up to receive his award."&lt;ref name="genesis0180" /&gt; Aside from that, ''Sweet Savage'' was released "well into 1979" and the films nominated were supposed to have been released in 1978, leaving the impression the AFAA gave him the award to "capitalize on his name and to obtain more media coverage."&lt;ref name="genesis0180" /&gt; ''Adam Film World Guide'', however, reported the following year's awards, which were presented in July 1981, "covered films released from mid-1980 to the middle of '81",&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; which could have meant ''Sweet Savage'' was eligible for awards in 1979 if the same time frame was considered. Meanwhile, ''Adam Film World'' noted Ray's award "was not surprising considering that one of the announced functions of the aFAA and its annual awards is to upgrade the image of the adult film industry in the public eye."&lt;ref name="afw0180" /&gt;

Originally the Erotica Awards were determined by vote of the "association's membership of more than 700 producers, distributors and theater operators."&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; However, in later years the AFAA ceremony was increasingly accused of bias, with a "belief among some that the West Coast producers were controlling what films received the awards" after ''Amanda By Night'' was passed over for best film at the 1981 awards.&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; Starting with the awards presented in 1982, the AFAA decided to appoint an independent jury of three persons not associated with the adult film industry to make the final choices from the five finalists in each category.&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; Jurors subsequently included an assortment of men and women such as a sexologist,&lt;ref name="cheri0186"&gt;"Film Strips: 'X' Marks the Spot," ''Cheri Magazine'', January 1986, pp. 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Robert Rimmer]]&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; and journalists such as [[Brendan Gill]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt; and other publications including ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]''.&lt;ref name="afw0187" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afaa7"&gt;AFAA, "Seventh Annual Erotica Awards," official program, June 23, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, criticism continued, especially for the best erotic scene victory of ''Virginia'' in 1984, which led to the founding of the [[X-Rated Critics Organization]] and its [[XRCO Award|Heart-On Awards]].&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; The role of adult film awards has been mostly supplanted by the [[AVN Awards]], which also launched in 1984.

=== Credo ===
The AFAA had a credo that "recognized the responsibilities of adult filmmakers to the general public":&lt;ref name="holliday"&gt;[[Jim Holliday]], ''Only the Best'', Cal Vista, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
1. That films of adult subject matter will be produced for and exhibited to adult audiences and that persons not of legal age will not be admitted.
2. That the definition of an "adult" is that designation set by the constituted authorities of the community but in no event any persons under the age of 18 years.
3. That we will produce and exhibit only films that are in conformity with the Free Speech Provisions of the Constitution of the United States of America.
4. That we will respect the privacy of the general public in our advertising and public displays.
5. That we in ''no manner'' will condone, produce or exhibit child pornography in any form.

After the [[#Erotic_Film_Awards|Erotic Film Awards]] were discontinued, the association resumed presenting Lifetime Achievement Awards at its annual "Night of the Stars" fundraising event, starting in mid-1988.

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
{{note|suppactor|1}} ''Adam Film World'' recorded the winner of this category in 1979 as having been a tie between Roger Caine and John Seeman.&lt;ref name="afw0180" /&gt; ''Cinema-X'' magazine recorded Roger Caine as the sole winner.&lt;ref name="cinemax0180" /&gt;

{{note|language|2}} This award was called "Best Foreign Language Film" at the 1977 and 1981 awards shows. It was not awarded after 1981.

{{note|foreign|3}} IMDb states this movie, while advertised as the first X-rated movie made in Russia, was actually made in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0249711|Librianna, Bitch of the Black Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|year|4}} ''Adam Film World'' reported both ''Seven Into Snowy'' as winner of "Best Musical Score" and also ''Get Your Nose Out Of My Pantyhose'' won "Best Original Musical Score", a different award,&lt;ref name="afw0179" /&gt; in 1978. However, the AFAA's seventh and eighth annual programs, which list previous years' winners, make no mention of ''Get Your Nose Out of My Pantyhose'' or any separate "Original" score award. As well, IMDb states "Get Your Nose Out of My Pantyhose" is not a movie, but a song from a movie called ''Breaker Beauties'', so ''Adam Film World's'' report of an "Original" score award may be erroneous.

{{note|song|5}} The official 8th Annual AFAA Erotic Film Awards program lists both songs as having won the award,&lt;ref name="afaa8p" /&gt; however Jim Holliday's ''Only the Best'' book only mentions "With You" from ''Roommates'' as winning.&lt;ref name="holliday" /&gt; ''Cheri'' magazine's coverage of the awards doesn't mention the category at all.&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt;

{{note|year|6}} This award was called "Best Production Values" at the 1979 and 1980 awards shows.&lt;ref name="pornstars8011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afaa7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afaa8p" /&gt;

{{note|year|7}} ''Adam Film World''&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt;' and ''Cinema Blue''&lt;ref name="cinemablue" /&gt; coverage of the first Erotica Awards both listed ''Not Tonight, Henry!'' as having won "Best Adult Film 1961-65" and ''Tonight For Sure'' as having won "Best Adult Film 1955-60". However, ''Not Tonight, Henry!'' premiered Dec. 30, 1960&lt;ref name="afi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/|title=AFI CATALOG|work=afi.com|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles, while ''Tonight For Sure'' premiered in L.A., Oct. 25, 1962,&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; so it's likely an error by the AFAA resulted in each film being given the award for the other's time period. Nominee ''Sinderella and the Golden Bra'' was listed in the correct time period. [[Jim Holliday]]'s book, ''Only the Best'', lists the movies as having won in the correct time periods, however.&lt;ref name="holliday" /&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Analogue-A-Hate-Story-Question.png|thumb|left|The game's primary interface, featuring one of the two primary characters, the AI *Hyun-ae]]

''Analogue: A Hate Story'' is a [[visual novel]] featuring semi-static [[manga]]-style character images, and focused on reading text logs. Using the mouse and keyboard, the player interacts with the ''Mugunghwa''{{'}}s main computer to read log entries, communicate with the AIs, and occasionally enter commands directly into the vessel's computer system. At any time in the game, the player can save their game, adjust options, etc.

The main user interface allows the player to read through [[Epistolary novel|various diaries and letters]] that reveal the game's backstory and insight into its many (deceased) characters. For the most part, navigating this interface is similar to navigating a basic e-mail system, in that messages are chronologically arranged and searchable. They are grouped in usually numbered "blocks", released to the player by *Hyun-ae or *Mute throughout the game. For the most part, the AIs release blocks "out of order", or do not release all entries in a block, forcing the player to assemble the timeline of events out of what clues they have, and draw certain conclusions independently until (or if) the AIs can be convinced to be more forthcoming. In most cases, the player can, after reading a log entry, show its content to the currently active AI. This is the primary process by which additional information and message blocks are revealed. Players can also type in an entry's [[alphanumeric]] ID in the main log menu to obtain it directly, as long as its corresponding block is decrypted.

Communication with *Hyun-ae and *Mute is limited to choosing responses to [[yes-no question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meer|first=Alec|title=Wot I Think – Analogue: A Hate Story|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/29/wot-i-think-analogue-a-hate-story/|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, *Hyun-ae explains that the ship's disrepair may have led to the language parsing systems to malfunction, forcing her to put the interface together from scratch.&lt;ref name="*Hyun-ae 001"/&gt; Though *Hyun-ae and *Mute almost never communicate directly, the player can act as a go-between, taking a list of direct questions from *Mute to *Hyun-ae. This is a major turning point in the game, as the player not only receives answers to the questions, but has occasional opportunities to voice a third opinion on the events that led to the ''Mugunghwa's'' current state. The player can also access the ''Mugunghwa's'' override terminal, which can be used to decrypt data log blocks, switch between AI, change costumes for *Hyun-ae, adjust the behavior of some ship systems (a key aspect for the [[#Plot|meltdown sequence]]), and more. The override terminal works like a basic text parser system similar to Unix shell commands, accepting only a very limited vocabulary of instructions that must be typed directly and correctly.

Due to the branching nature of the story, the game must be played more than once to unlock all logs to complete the game, as it is impossible to reveal all log entries and information from the AIs in one playthrough. A log system separate from the game's save files displays all discovered logs from all playthroughs, effectively tracking the player's overall completion.

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===
Set several thousand years in the future, ''Analogue'' revolves around the ''[[Hibiscus syriacus|Mugunghwa]]'' ({{korean|hangul=무궁화|hanja=|rr=Moogoonghwa}}), a [[generation ship]] that lost contact with Earth some 600 years prior to the events of the game. For reasons initially unclear, society aboard the ship had degraded from that of modern, 21st Century [[South Korea]], to the intensely patriarchal culture of the medieval [[Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ligman|first=Kris|title="Namjon yeobi": 'Analogue: A Hate Story'|url=http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=7769|work=The Border House|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer|title=Analogue: A Hate Story Is The Darkest Visual Novel I've Played|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/06/13/analogue-a-hate-story-is-the-dark-visual-novel-ive-played/|work=Siliconera|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, the ship's clocks were reset to year 1, and the colonists began using [[Hanja]] characters to read and write. The reasons for why such a cultural shift has occurred is lost to time, leaving the player to formulate the cause on their own. Over the three centuries after the shift, the ship's birth rates began to gradually decline, to below the "replacement rate" of noble families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Analogue: A Hate Story|developer=[[Christine Love (visual novelist)|Christine Love]]|date=February 1, 2012|platform=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] ([[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]])|quote='''*Mute''': I don't know if you've noticed, but the ''Mugunghwa''{{'}}s birth rates are... well, it's not good. They had been bad for generations, but they were just getting worse and worse. Among noble families, they weren't even at replacement rate anymore. I have no idea why. Nobody really ever wanted to acknowledge it. So what I'm saying it... even ignoring the fact that he wanted, and her suggestion was wrong, I don't think the Emperor would have to contrive it so that there weren't any noble daughters of proper age. The simple fact of the matter is, eugh, that sort of incest ended up being necessary. And apparently didn't help, since even she couldn't deliver a son anyway! No awful and inappropriate theories are necessary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By year 322, the ship inexplicably went dark, falling into a state of severe disrepair.

In ''Analogue''{{'}}s present, 622 years later, the ''Mugunghwa'' is discovered in orbit above [[Antares#Companion star|Antares B]], a star system ''[[wikt:en route|en route]]'' to its destination. A friend of the protagonist's, a dispatch officer, is the one who discovers the ship on their radar; this catches the attention of the Saeju Colony Historical Society (which suggests that humans have established planetary colonies beyond Earth), who sponsors the recovery of any remaining text logs that can explain the ship's disappearance.&lt;ref name=intro /&gt; The dispatch officer gives the unnamed [[silent protagonist]], an independent [[Detective|investigator]], this "job" in the introduction message for its isolation from social situations; this implies that the protagonist is somewhat [[asocial]],&lt;ref name=intro /&gt; but beyond this their personality and background is based almost entirely upon the player's decisions. The protagonist encounters two AI cores within the ship's computer. The first, *Hyun-ae ({{korean|hangul=현애|hanja=|rr=Hyeon-ae}}), is a bright, cheerful girl who loves [[cosplay]], and is highly curious about the player and the future they come from. The other, *Mute,&lt;ref name=intro /&gt; is the ship's security AI and self-proclaimed "social creature", who outranked all but Emperor Ryu, her master and Captain of the ship. The AIs dislike one another intensely, apparently due to the event that led to the ship's demise. The logs the player must recover are written by members of the Imperial Ryu family, the noble Kim and Smith families, and those linked to them. The game relies heavily on this [[unreliable narrator]] mechanic, where the AI characters and log entries thematically withhold key information from the player in order to add to the importance of certain elements of the plot (e.g. the administrator password to the ship's computer).

===Story===
In ''Analogue''{{'}}s introductory cutscene, the protagonist receives a message from a colleague, who tasks them with accessing the text logs aboard the ''Mugunghwa'', and download as many as possible, as sponsored by the Saeju Colony Historical Society.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt; After enabling the system AI using a [[Linux]]-style [[Terminal emulator|terminal]], *Hyun-ae greets the player, pleasantly shocked to find an external connection. She expresses her gratitude to the player for contacting the ship "after so many years", and promises that she will do her utmost to help access the logs.&lt;ref name="*Hyun-ae 001"/&gt;

As the player reads the logs, *Hyun-ae provides commentary on the letters and diaries of the late inhabitants of the ''Mugunghwa''. A key series of logs discovered with *Hyun-ae is the diary of the Pale Bride, a sick girl on the ship who was placed in stasis so her compromised [[immune system]] could be cured by future medical technology not available during her lifetime. The Pale Bride was brought out of stasis many years later by the descendants of her immediate family, the Kim family, in order to serve as a fertile young bride to Emperor Ryu In-ho, captain of the ''Mugunghwa''. She found herself in a culturally reverted, deeply [[misogynistic]] society, writing that "[e]veryone's so uneducated and stupid".&lt;ref name="5-EU22"/&gt; The Pale Bride, accustomed to the more liberal society of her own time, has difficulty assimilating with this reverted culture, and often describes youthful rebellions in her diary entries.

After giving the player a key entry from the Pale Bride's diary, *Hyun-ae reveals that she is the AI form of the Pale Bride, and asks the player to decrypt a block of restricted data by entering the override terminal in super-user mode (accessible only by entering a certain password). While attempting to do so, the player encounters a corrupted AI core and is forced to restore it to proceed. This activates *Mute, who reveals that *Hyun-ae may be linked to the ship's demise by referring to her as "that murderous bitch".&lt;ref name="*Mute 001"/&gt; As only one of the AIs can be active at a time (determined by keying in Linux-like terminal commands), the path through the story and the revelations contained within the many logs and messages branch based on decisions made by the player - most relevantly, which AI receives the most attention.

Upon reaching one of two criteria (obtaining a certain percentage of the games logs, or showing *Hyun-ae any one of *Mute's questions), the game's main climax occurs—the ''Mugunghwa''{{'}}s [[nuclear fission]] reactor enters meltdown, endangering the AI cores, valuable data, and the protagonist. The player must execute a series of commands to safely shutdown the reactor and vent out residual heat, all within 20 minutes. The player must choose which AIs they will continue the story with prior to meltdown; leaving their separate cores on consumes too much power for the backup power system, and it is not possible to activate the dormant AI from this point onwards. Once the player has safely disabled the reactor, saving the life of the active AI, the game will continue similarly to before, with the player accessing logs and the surviving AI providing commentary. Each AI reveals a different side of the Mugunghwa's story: *Hyun-ae will assist in uncovering the Pale Bride's perspective, while *Mute yields logs from the noble families of the ship. More interaction will take place between the player and the AI, until a pivot is reached with the relationship and one of the five endings will occur.&lt;ref name="5-EU22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="9-AREW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="5-IR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="5-TT8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="5-EU54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="5-EU9A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="5-EUX12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="7-EUX25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="9-ATAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="9-TR8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="6-EUY22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11-AA02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11-AA03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11-BB01"/&gt;

Eventually, it is revealed that the Pale Bride (now *Hyun-ae) was brutally treated by the Kim family after they awoke her from stasis.&lt;ref name="5-EU22"/&gt; After many small rebellions and increasingly serious punishments, going so far as to refusing to be wed to Emperor Ryu, to whom she had been promised as a bride and [[concubine]], her adoptive parents&lt;ref name="11-AA03"/&gt; cut out her tongue to prevent the young girl from speaking out against men (a trauma *Mute was unaware of to the game's present).&lt;ref name="7-EUX25"/&gt; After her marriage, Hyun-ae became close friends with the Emperor's first wife, Empress Ryu Jae-hwa.&lt;ref name="10-RZ061"/&gt; She calls her "stronger than I ever was", not letting men order her around "while still knowing her place"; as well as the only person to notice Hyun-ae's muteness and failing health. Upon the Empress's sudden death, Hyun-ae's sorrow and rage ultimately drove her to kill everyone she hated aboard the ''Mugunghwa'' by deactivating its [[life support]] systems.&lt;ref name="6-EUY22"/&gt; As the crew suffocated to death, she retreated into the computer system as an AI by using a "neurosynaptic" scan of her brain and a copy of *Mute's AI coding, which she used to deactivate the security AI up until ''Analogue''{{'}}s present. This explains the *Hyun-ae's hatred of the Kims, *Mute's hatred of *Hyun-ae, and acts as a key factor for the player's decisions.

The first two endings involve *Hyun-ae leaving the Mugunghwa with the protagonist, either as a companion or lover.&lt;ref name="ending 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ending 2"/&gt; In the third ending, the protagonist leaves without taking either AI with them (either by not saving the ship from meltdown in time, or by prematurely downloading the logs before the end of the AI commentary has been reached).  This conclusion can also be reached if the player opts not to download the AI data during the final conclusion.&lt;ref name="ending 3"/&gt; The fourth ending involves "kidnapping" *Mute, effectively relieving her of her duties on the ship.&lt;ref name="ending 4"/&gt; The fifth ending, which can only be accessed by "cheating" (searching manually for a log which would not normally appear on the story branch in question), involves taking ''both'' AIs as a harem.&lt;ref name="ending 5"/&gt; The game can also end by penalty for disagreeing too much with an AI, causing the angered AI to permanently disconnect the protagonist from the ship's computer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Analogue: A Hate Story|developer=Christine Love|date=February 1, 2012|platform=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] ([[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the "bad priorities" ending, which occurs when the player downloads the logs ''during'' the meltdown sequence, which takes too much time, killing them in the explosion.

==Development and release==
When looking for a setting to place ''Analogue'', Christine Love settled on Korea's [[Joseon Dynasty]], saying that it had "always fascinated me the most for a number of reasons, not all of them negative." Among those reasons was how women were dehumanizingly treated then compared to the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. "The plot is moved mostly by the Pale Bride, the modern girl who can't understand what's going on…but the crux of it, really, was trying to get into the heads of everyone else[:] the men and women who have internalized all these awful misogynist ideals and take them completely for granted as the way things are. So the story really just formed itself around that question: what would it be like to be a woman in that society? History didn't care about the answer, but I do. The rest—the modern-thinking woman who can't possibly survive [*Hyun-ae], the women who are forced to navigate family politics, the men who are complicit in this whole system but can't just be dismissed as bad people [Smith]—all came naturally in that attempt to answer it."&lt;ref name="VN interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Moment in Time with THE Woman ''(Internet Archive)'' |url=http://www.vnsnow.com/christinelove.htm |accessdate=17 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030202712/http://www.vnsnow.com/christinelove.htm |archivedate=October 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Christine Love on Creating Inclusive Games |url=http://www.1up.com/features/interview-christine-love-creating-inclusive |accessdate=28 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205033945/http://www.1up.com/features/interview-christine-love-creating-inclusive |archivedate=5 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Love|first=Christine|title=Love on Love|url=http://blog.scoutshonour.com/|accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love had mixed feelings about the AI characters during development. For instance, *Hyun-ae, as the Pale Bride, underwent almost no change from being a girl of modern times who couldn't understand the society she was thrust into. *Mute, apart from her position as the ship's security AI,  was an unknown with, as Love stated, "how she'd end up turning out."&lt;ref name="VN interview"/&gt; As *Mute's "cheerful misogyny" began to define itself through her dialog, however, Love "started to hate her, especially with every line I wrote… Then she started to grow on me[. I]t was never really her fault she was like that[;] it was just her way of surviving, I realized."&lt;ref name="VN interview"/&gt; Neither character gave her much surprise, but Love "definitely never anticipated feeling so much sympathy for *Mute."&lt;ref name="VN interview"/&gt;

In an informal [[Kotaku]] interview, Love revealed that she considered being drunk while writing a "necessity", due to the Joseon dynasty's reprehensible history and the nature of the research of social agendas against women. Despite her disgust at the philosophies behind ''Analogue's'' misogyny, Love expressed her interest in how "ideas take root...Nobody ever just wakes up one day and says[,] 'yeah, I hate women, I wish we'd stop letting them read.'"&lt;ref name="kotaku.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5937012/how-easily-women-could-lose-all-their-rights-as-told-by-a-game |title=How Women Could Easily Lose All Their Rights, As Told By A Game |first=Patricia |last=Hernandez |date=August 23, 2012 |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bloggers and gaming media sites noted the mechanics and interface of the game as well as the plot, such as 2chan.us&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2chan.us/wordpress/2012/02/01/analogue-a-hate-story-a-literary-and-intellectual-delight/ |title=Blog Archive » Analogue: A Hate Story: A Literary and Intellectual Delight |publisher=2chan.us |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209222418/http://2chan.us/wordpress/2012/02/01/analogue-a-hate-story-a-literary-and-intellectual-delight/ |archive-date=2012-02-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Killscreen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/killscreen/194-review-christine-loves-visual-novel-analogue-a-hate-story-points-the-way-to-a-new-literature-and-a-better-world/ |title=Review: Christine Love's visual novel "Analogue: A Hate Story" points the way to a new literature, and a better world. &amp;#124; Kill Screen |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://killscreendaily.com/articles/reviews/longest-hate-story-ever-told/|title=The Longest Hate Story Ever Told|work=Kill Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2chan labelling it as a "literary and intellectual delight."

''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' gave ''Analogue'' 76 out of a 100, noting in particular to the skilfulness of the author's structural talent.&lt;ref&gt;PC Gamer UK, issue 237&lt;/ref&gt; Alec Meer of [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] said the brightness of the art was contradictory to the gloomy themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/29/wot-i-think-analogue-a-hate-story/ |title=Wot I Think – Analogue: A Hate Story |first=Alec |last=Meer |date=February 29, 2012 |work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 26, 2013, ''Analogue'' holds a Metascore of 62 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=mc&gt;{{cite web|title=Analogue: A Hate Story|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/analogue-a-hate-story|work=Metacritic|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
Christine Love announced that a sequel to ''Analogue'' titled ''Hate Plus''.&lt;ref name="kotaku.com"/&gt; Originally planned to be DLC before becoming full sequel release on 19 August 2013. According to an article&lt;ref name="kotaku.com"/&gt; by Kotaku's Patricia Hernandez, the sequel takes place after the events aboard the Mugunghwa and will feature the player returning to Earth and discovering how society on board the ship broke down. Those that finished the original game are able to import their save games into the sequel so that any decisions made will be part of the new story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hateplus.com/|title=Hate Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Endings 1, 2, 4, and/or 5, ''Hate Plus'' reveals the events that took place aboard the ''Mugunghwa'', prior to the shift into the Joseon-like society depicted in the original ''Analogue''.

'''''Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel''''' is a [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by the Montreal branch of [[Visceral Games]] and released on March 26, 2013 by [[Electronic Arts]] for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. It is the third game in the ''[[Army of Two (series)|Army of Two]]'' series, following 2008's ''[[Army of Two]]'' and 2010's ''[[Army of Two: The 40th Day]]''. The game takes place in Mexico and pits T.W.O. against a drug cartel known as La Guadaña (Spanish for "the Scythe"). It is the first game in the series to run on the [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite 2]] game engine, whereas the previous two ran on [[Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine 3]]. The demo for the game was released on March 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/asia/news/army-of-two-the-devils-cartel-demo-out-now|title=Army of TWO The Devil's Cartel Demo Out Now&amp;nbsp;— EA News|last=YLIM|first=|publisher=[[Electronic Arts|EA]]|date=2013-03-13|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second to last game developed by Visceral Montreal.&lt;ref name="Gameinformer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/02/21/report-army-of-two-developer-suffers-layoffs.aspx|title=Visceral Montreal Employee Confirms Entire Staff Let Go|last=Marchiafava|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|date=2013-02-21|accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received mediocre reviews; criticism was drawn towards the game's removal of the co-op interactions, being only able to play as Alpha, and the game's story. ''The Devil's Cartel'' was also a commercial failure for Electronic Arts.

==Gameplay==
Where as the last two games focused around characters, Salem and Rios, ''Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel'' focuses around two new T.W.O. operatives named Alpha and Bravo. It is speculated{{By whom|date=April 2018}} that the reasoning behind the unidentified names is to give the player the feeling that it is them fighting through the missions.

Returning from the first game is the Overkill mode, which makes both players invincible for a short period of time. However, features such as back to back, playing rock, paper and scissors with your partner, and other co-op interactions have been removed in favor of a more fast-paced gameplay. Competitive multiplayer from the second game does not return to focus on a richer co-op experience.

===Features===
It has been noted that the game features more customization options compared to the previous games in the series. ''The Devil's Cartel'' features a mask creator which allows players to completely customize their masks, thus giving their TWO operative its own persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De4I4-LlUuI|title=Mask Customizations|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=2013-02-07|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers can pre-order the ''Overkill Edition'' which comes with bonus weapons, masks, outfits, and missions that are not available with the standard version of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.origin.com/store/ea/en_US/pd/productID.235159000|title=Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel&amp;nbsp;— Origin|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Shortly after being recruited into T.W.O. (Tactical Worldwide Operations), Alpha and Bravo join T.W.O. and complete a training session. T.W.O. founders Tyson Rios and Elliot Salem give them their masks and bring the two new recruits on a rescue operation to save multiple hostages in a cartel compound. During the operation, Estaban Bautista and his henchman leave as Rios, Salem, Alpha, and Bravo raid the compound. Only one hostage is found alive, a girl named Fiona. Salem attempts to persuade the group to leave, not wanting to risk their lives to save Fiona who is not part of their misson objective.Rios insist that she's innocent and that he wont leave her behind, Alpha and Bravo agree, Salem then decides to go alone and leave. During Salem's escape, a thug destroys Salem's vehicle, leaving Rios, Alpha, and Bravo attempting to rescue him, but Rios injures his right leg in the process. Alpha and Bravo save the girl from cartel forces and evacuate with Rios, lamenting the loss of Salem.

Five years later, T.W.O. is hired by Mayor Cordova, a Mexican politician seeking to bring down La Guadaña and kill its leader, Bautista. The T.W.O. operatives believe nothing will go wrong until the convoy's movement is interrupted by La Guadaña's forces. Alpha and Bravo survive constant waves as Cordova escapes. Alpha and Bravo push their way to the Cartel's forces to City Hall for extraction. T.W.O. operative Mason drives them out of the city but is killed when the Cartel ambush them on the road at a gas station. Alpha and Bravo meet Mason's contact, Fiona who aids the team in bringing down La Guadaña and killing Bautista. Fiona gives Alpha and Bravo intelligence that Cordova fled to a local church that is serving as a La Guadaña compound.

Alpha and Bravo fight through a hotel resort to encounter El Diablo, La Guadaña's top Lieutenant, learning that El Diablo killed a large number of T.W.O. operatives and captured Cordova. El Diablo sets charges off in the hotel resort, blowing it in half to make his escape leaving Alpha, Bravo &amp; Fiona trapped inside. Alpha, Bravo and Fiona survive El Diablo's counterattack, and the trio go the Church, listening in on Bautista's interrogation with Cordova. El Diablo alerts them as the duo fight their way to Fiona. Surviving a train disaster, Alpha, Bravo and Fiona temporarily rescue Cordova while surviving T.W.O. operatives die protecting the mayor. Alpha, Bravo and Cordova navigate through a mexican ghetto &amp; are captured after trying to rescue T.W.O. operative Bradley, but to no avail.

Alpha, Bravo and Cordova are tortured by the cartel in a room. El Diablo reveals his true identity as Salem, who survived the explosion and was forced to face the Cartel by himself. Surviving, he joined forces with Bautista and feels betrayed by Rios and the duo for not "checking" to see if he was alive. Salem kills Cordova for calling him a "monster" and leaves. Alpha and Bravo escape and regroup with T.W.O. operatives Anthony "Baker" Barnes and Charles "Chuy" Rendall, requesting for extraction. Rios is among to hear of Salem's betrayal and orders him to be kept alive and brought to him.

Fiona tells the team that Salem and Bautista are hiding at a hacienda. Alpha, Bravo, Baker, and Chuy lead a T.W.O. strike force with assistance from Mexican Special Forces to raid the hacienda. During the raid, Bautista kills Chuy and Baker. Fiona pursues him, but is captured and relocated to a quarry. Alpha and Bravo are extracted by Rios via helicopter to rescue Fiona.

The trio crash as Alpha and Bravo save Rios, who tells them to get Fiona as he will catch up. Alpha and Bravo successfully regroup with Fiona, who kills Bautista for taking her. However, Salem reveals that killing him was part of his plan and holds Fiona at gunpoint. Salem tells of the times he risked his life for Rios (especially to "save Hong Kong" and took a bullet for Rios, implied of [[Army of Two: The 40th Day|the previous installment]]), and kills Fiona. Rios charges at Salem, Salem shoots Rios in the abdomen and flips him off of a two-story balcony before escaping.

Alpha and Bravo regroup with Rios, who orders them to kill Salem, changing his mind on saving him. Alpha and Bravo corner Salem, who attacks them with an armored vehicle. Destroying the vehicle, Bravo is given the command to kill Salem, but instead allow the Mexican Special Forces take him into custody. Rios, Alpha, and Bravo think ahead of what to do next. They promise to oversee Fiona's burial, carry out an extended vacation, and then sign on for the next mission. Meanwhile, Salem etches the name Alice on his prison cell wall. In the post-credits epilogue, Salem is seen smiling when an armored guard and an unidentified visitor approach him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwpodKSLDDI|title=Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel&amp;nbsp;— All Cutscenes (FULL) [HD]|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=2013-03-26|accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
''Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel'' received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 3 version 56.25% and 58/100&lt;ref name=GRPS3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS3 /&gt; and the Xbox 360 version 54.24% and 54/100.&lt;ref name=GRX360 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCX360 /&gt;

The game was heavily criticized for the removal of the co-op interactions, being only able to play as the Alpha character, and the game's story.

Daniel Krupa of [[IGN]] gave the game a 5 out of 10, criticizing the enemy AI as moronic, insipid environments, cover mechanics being frustrating, the gameplay being monotonous, but praised the ally AI for being reliable. In the Verdict, Krupa said: "Devil's Cartel feels like a hollowed-out version of previous Army of Two games. The distinctive edges have been sanded down, creating something that's not just generic but unrelated to what went before. The humour has been drained and long-time fans might feel aggrieved by the decision to sideline Salem and Rios in favor of these lame characters. If you absolutely must experience the mediocrity first hand, Army of Two: Devil's Cartel is still probably best played with a friend... but friends don't let friends play tedious mediocre games."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/03/29/army-of-two-the-devils-cartel-review Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel review]. IGN. Daniel Krupa. 29 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Grisham of [[GamesRadar]] found ''The Devil's Cartel'' to be fun and awarded it four in a half stars. Grisham stated at the end of his review; "Army of Two: Devil's Cartel seems to accomplish exactly what it set out to do, offering an intense, impressive two-player co-op experience that's heavily customizable and replayable. While it won't likely scratch the itch of those looking for a more traditional shooter game--namely, competitive online multiplayer--it's an original concept set inside familiar trappings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/army-of-two-the-devils-cartel-review/ Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel review] [[GamesRadar]]. Richard Grisham. 29 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On more negative side, Kevin VanOrd gave the game 5 out of 10, criticizing all of the series' best aspects being removed or toned down, the gunplay being forgettable, forgettable story and characters, the cooperation between players being very little, and problems with the AI but praised the some fun set pieces, the more open levels give you room to maneuver, and cover system encourages fluid movement. VanOrd said in verdict; "Previous Army of Two games stood apart in their own ways, not always excelling, but still willing to hew their own paths. Engaging the opposition in a Shanghai zoo, escaping across a collapsed skyscraper, saving civilians from menacing threats--these are small but meaningful moments that might be etched on your psyche from the series' past. There's nothing here to make a mark: no creativity on display, no clever competitive modes, no sense of accomplishment. There's only a seven-hour campaign, optional missions in which you try to keep the overkill meter consistently replenished, and the knowledge that in a month, you won't remember having played Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/army-of-two-the-devils-cartel-review/1900-6406201/ Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel] [[GameSpot]]. 29 March 2013. Kevin VanOrd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer.net]] scored the game with a 5 out of 10. Whitehead said at the end of his review of the game; "''The Devil's Cartel'' is functional and fuss-free, a game that delivers the expected genre tropes with as little imagination and as much bluster as possible. It's not a bad game, but nor does it have anything beyond basic mechanical competence to mark it out as "good" - and even that competence wobbles more than it should. In a few years' time, I'll probably look back over my Xbox Live profile and be surprised to see that not only did they make a third ''Army of Two'' game, but that I apparently played and completed it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-28-army-of-two-the-devils-cartel-review Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel review - Ready, steady, bro.] By Dan Whitehead Published 28/03/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the negative response, Visceral Games executive producer Julian Beak said that "''The Devil's Cartel'' suffered "low morale"".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamerant.com/army-of-two-developer-issues/ ‘Army of Two: The Devil’s Cartel’ Producer: Game Suffered From Low Morale] By Patrick Dane. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales ===
''Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel'' was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in North America on March 26, 2013. The game later launched in Japan and Europe on March 28, and 29, respectively. ''The Devil's Cartel'' was not successful as EA's previous month releases, due to the game being released the same month as ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' and ''[[BioShock Infinite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/18/march-2013-npd-industry-slumps-another-10-percent-while-bioshock-infinite-tops-the-charts/ March 2013 NPD: Industry slumps another 10 percent as BioShock Infinite tops the charts] JEFF GRUBB APRIL 18, 2013 3:30 PM&lt;/ref&gt; The game sold over 260,000 copies worldwide.

==Reception==

===Volume 1===
Writing for IGN, Craig Harris rated ''Atari Greatest Hits Volume 1'' 6 out of 10, and said that the 30 dollar price was too high: "At most, this game is a 20 dollar value." Harris noticed that the Nintendo DS's small screen can not properly display games with [[vector graphics]]: "the 256 by 192 [[pixel density]] just can't display the fine visual details of ''Gravitar'', ''Lunar Lander'', and ''Asteroids''." However, he praised the title's "excellent multiplayer support" and "spot-on emulations".&lt;ref name='IGN review'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/09/atari-greatest-hits-volume-1-review | title = Atari Greatest Hits Volume 1 Review - IGN | accessdate = 2013-04-11 | last = Harris | first = Craig | date = 2010-11-08 | publisher = [[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Morgen at GamingBits.com gave it 3.5 of 5 stars in a generally positive review. Harris and Morgen both said that many of the included titles would not hold gamers' attention for very long.&lt;ref name='GamingBits'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamingbits.com/game-review-bits/atari-greatest-hits-volume-1-review/ | title = Atari Greatest Hits: Volume 1 review | accessdate = 2013-04-11 | last = Morgen | first = Alex | date = 2010-11-10 | publisher = [[GamingBits.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nintendo Power]] rated it 5 out of 10, while [[Nintendo Gamer]] gave it 22 out of 100.&lt;ref name='GameRankings for vol1'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerankings.com/ds/605167-atari-greatest-hits-volume-1/index.html | title = Atari Greatest Hits Volume 1 for DS - GameRankings | accessdate = 2013-04-11 | publisher = [[GameRankings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autism spectrum disorder]]s (''ASD''s) or autism spectrum conditions (''ASC''s) describe a range of conditions classified as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s in the [[DSM-5]], used by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name=DSM5Autism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Autism spectrum disorder fact sheet |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |work=DSM5.org |year=2013 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006210933/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many [[wikt:neurodivergent|neurodivergent]] people and conditions, the popular image of autistic people and autism itself is often based on inaccurate media representations.&lt;ref name=Trapped&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarrett|first=J C|title=Trapped children: popular images of children with autism in the 1960s and 2000s.|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|date=June 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=141–53|doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9135-z|pmid=21225325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MMR vaccine theory==
{{main article|MMR vaccine controversy#Media role}}
The MMR vaccine was the subject of controversy resulting from publication of a (now retracted) 1998 paper by [[Andrew Wakefield]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=MMR&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wakefield A, Murch S, Anthony A|author-link=Andrew Wakefield|title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet|volume=351|issue=9103|pages = 637–41|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0|pmid=9500320|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|accessdate= 5 September 2007|display-authors=etal}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|20137807}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been "dishonest";&lt;ref name=Irresponsible&gt;{{cite news|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|title=Andrew Wakefield found 'irresponsible' by GMC over MMR vaccine scare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/andrew-wakefield-mmr-vaccine|newspaper=The Guardian (London)|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the ''[[BMJ]]''.&lt;ref name=Fraud&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |title=Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=342 |issue= |pages=c7452 |year=2011 |pmid=21209060 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |doi = 10.1136/bmj.c7452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2007 article in ''[[BMC Public Health]]'' postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had "created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against".&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K |title=Parents' champions vs. vested interests: who do parents believe about MMR?

''[[PRWeek]]'' noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.&lt;ref name=PRWeek&gt;[http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1007378/Reputation-survey-MMR-panic-subsides "Reputation Survey: MMR panic subsides."] ''[[PR Week]]'', 2 June 2010: 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but "now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence".&lt;ref name=AgeOld&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poland GA, Jacobson RM |title= The Age-Old Struggle against the Antivaccinationists |journal= N Engl J Med |volume= 364 |issue= 2 |pages= 97–9 |date= 13 January 2011 |pmid= 21226573 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp1010594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the media in the sensationalization of the MMR vaccination issue was discussed by the ''[[BMJ]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The original paper has received so much media attention, with such potential to damage public health, that it is hard to find a parallel in the history of medical science.

==Autism diagnoses in notable individuals==
{{further information|Societal and cultural aspects of autism#Notable individuals}}
Media speculation of historical figures on the [[autism spectrum]] is based on reported behavior and anecdotal evidence rather than any clinical observation of the individual.  [[Fred R. Volkmar|Fred Volkmar]] of the [[Yale Child Study Center]] has remarked that "there is unfortunately a sort of cottage industry of finding that everyone has Asperger's".&lt;ref name=GoodeNYT&gt;{{cite news|title=CASES; A Disorder Far Beyond Eccentricity|author=Goode, Erica

Additionally, media speculation of contemporary figures as being on the autism spectrum has become popular in recent times.  [[New York magazine|''New York'' magazine]] reported some examples, which included that [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] suggested that [[Bill Gates]] is autistic, and that a biographer of [[Warren Buffett]] wrote that his prodigious memory and "fascination with numbers" give him "a vaguely autistic aura." The magazine also reported that on ''[[Celebrity Rehab]]'', Dr. Drew Pinsky deemed basketball player [[Dennis Rodman]] a candidate for an Asperger's diagnosis, and the [[UCLA]] specialist consulted "seemed to concur". [[Nora Ephron]] criticized these conclusions, writing that popular speculative diagnoses suggest autism is "an epidemic, or else a wildly over-diagnosed thing that there used to be other words for."&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=Autism Spectrum: Are You On It?|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/autism-spectrum-2012-11/|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Sowell]] has criticized ''Time''{{'s}} diagnosis of Bill Gates, saying that the people diagnosing him have not seen him personally.&lt;ref name="sowell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sowell|first1=Thomas|title=The Einstein Syndrome : bright children who talk late|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465081417|pages=142, 189|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=046508141X|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Steinberg]] has also criticized the literary portrayals of Warren Buffett and [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]] as autistic, writing these men are able to compensate more completely than a truly autistic child or adult whose language deficiencies and cognitive deficits can often put him at a level of functioning in the mentally retarded range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Paul|title=Asperger’s History of Overdiagnosis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/opinion/aspergers-history-of-over-diagnosis.html?scp=1&amp;sq=asperger&amp;st=cse|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3209">The '''Ballroom Dancers' Federation''' was founded in 1958 to give a voice to competitive [[ballroom dancers]]. A previous organisation, called the Competitors' Federation had been disbanded soon after its formation in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdfonline.info/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009003146/http://www.bdfonline.info/index.php |archivedate=2009-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the BDF is:
:1. To promote the spirit of good fellowship and sportsmanship and to protect and advance the interests of professional competitors and professionals in general.
:2. To further the goodwill and co-operation between those who utilise the services of its members and the governing Dance Sport bodies.

These general aims are interpreted mainly from the point of view of professional competitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdfonline.info/info_detail.php?info_id%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203131550/http://www.bdfonline.info/info_detail.php?info_id=2 |archivedate=2009-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though many of its activities do also benefit amateur competitors.

The Federation has been responsible for starting many events: 
*The International Congress held biennially at the British Open Championships in Blackpool, where lectures on all aspects of the profession are presented. 
*The Night of 100 Stars, which is the showcase for the Dance Sport industry. 
*The type of world championships known as ''Classic Show Dance'' and ''South American Show Dance'', were originally called ''segue events'' which was the innovation of the BDF. 
*Twenty-five years ago, the Federation resurrected the ''Star Championships'' originally run by the now defunct [[The Star (London)|Star newspaper]] in the famous [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]]. Later the Championship was held in the Great Room of the [[Grosvenor House]] on [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] together with a dinner dance called the Star Ball. 
*The BDF awards have grown to be one of the most prestigious award ceremonies in the world today. 
*The Ballroom Dancers’ Federation have undertaken the responsibility of organising European and World Championship events granted by the [[World Dance Council]] to Great Britain. This has been achieved with the support of generous sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdfonline.info/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009003146/http://www.bdfonline.info/index.php |archivedate=2009-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates from the Executive Committee of the Federation sit on the board of directors for the [[British Dance Council]]; the Federation sees a major part of its role as bringing about changes in the BDC.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Korean words and phrases]]}}
'''''Batoo''''' is a Korean [[Go variants|variant]] of the board game [[Go (game)|Go]]. The name stems from a combination of the [[Korean language|Korean]] words ''baduk'' (“Go”) and ''juntoo'' (“battle”). It is played entirely in [[cyberspace]], and differs from Go in a number of ways, most noticeably in the way in which certain areas of the board are worth different point values. The other principal difference is that both players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special “hidden stone”, which affects the board as a regular [[Go equipment#Stones|stone]] but is invisible to the opponent. It was launched in November 2008.&lt;ref name=fairbairn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fairbairn|first1=John|last2=Hall|first2=T. Mark|publisher=Slate &amp; Shell|year=2009|page=73|isbn=9781932001433|title=The Go Companion: Go in History and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Batoo is usually played on an 11x11 [[Go equipment#Board|board]], although some games may take place on boards as large as 13x13. Boards in Batoo usually have plus-point and minus-point spots. When a player plays on these spots, they will either gain or lose five points. Different "maps" will have different plus-point locations and minus-point locations. Before the game begins, both players place a "base build", consisting of three marked stones. When players are making their base-builds, they cannot see their opponent's base build. If there is any overlap, a minus-point will replace the pair of stones. Base stones are worth 5 points each, as opposed to a normal stone which is worth only 1.

The player who starts is the one who makes the highest bid of points to their opponent for the privilege. This process is also known as "turn-betting". Once the base-building and the turn-betting end, both players have 25-second intervals to make each move. For every stone on the board, a player will gain 1 point. If a player takes more than 25 seconds to make their move, they lose 2 points (unless a 'special ability' character is used) and a new 25-second interval begins. If more than 3 25-second intervals are taken by any player during the game, that player loses the game. The territory each player has at the end of the game is then added to the score.

== Hidden stone ==
The most unusual aspect about Batoo is the Hidden Stone. Once per game, every player may play a Hidden Stone instead of a normal stone. The Hidden Stone is not revealed to the opponent until they play a move where the Hidden Stone is located or until they locate it with a scan. A player may play a "scan" for 2 points, where they click a spot on the board and discover whether or not the Hidden Stone is on it. The player may make a normal or hidden stone move following the scan.

== Characters, special abilities, and customization == 
A player can select one of three characters that grant the player special abilities. A fourth character can be bought using the in-game currency. The players can also buy different color substitutes for black stones [dark red, dark green, dark violet, dark blue] and can also buy different-looking boards with different themes with the in-game currency.

== Ranking ==
Player ability in Batoo is determined by "levels". Learners start at level 5, and can progress up to level 35.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Bourgeois tragedy''' (German: ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'') is a form of [[tragedy]] that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the [[the Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeois|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.

==In England and France==
There are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see [[domestic tragedy]]), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: [[George Lillo]]'s ''[[The London Merchant]]; or, [[the History of George Barnwell]]'', which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first ''tragédie bourgeoise'' was ''Sylvie'' by [[Paul Landois]], which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by [[Denis Diderot]]: ''Le fils naturel'' was first staged in 1757 and ''Le père de famille'' in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.

==Heroes in classical tragedy==
While ordinary people had always been the subject of [[comedy|comedies]], classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. [[Aristotle]] articulates this idea in ''ars poetica'' (''The Poetics'') and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German [[Martin Opitz]], perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as [[Andreas Gryphius]]' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King [[Charles I of England]]), [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]] (the wife of [[Theseus]], a mythical king of [[Athens]]) or [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]], serve as tragic protagonists.

==In Germany==
In Germany, where the new genre was called ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'', it was especially successful.  Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany. However, [[Christian Leberecht Martini]]'s drama ''Rhynsolt und Sapphira'' is slightly older. Lessing's ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie''. Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are ''Die Soldaten'' by [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1776) and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Kabale und Liebe]]'' (1784). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/503446347|title=Exemplarity and mediocrity : the art of the average from bourgeois tragedy to realism|last=1968-|first=Fleming, Paul,|date=2009|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804769983|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=503446347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Bourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.

=== Broadcast safe High Definition video ===

Digital broadcasting is very different from analog.  The NTSC and PAL standards describe both transmission of the signal and how the electrical signal is converted into an image.  In digital, there is a separation between the subject of how data is to be transmitted from tower to TV, and the subject of what content that data might contain.  While data transmission is likely to be a fixed and consistent affair, the content could vary from High Definition video one hour, to SD multicasting the next, and even to non-video datacasting.  In the US, [[8VSB]] transmits the data, while [[MPEG-2]] encodes pictures and sound.

==Broadcast safe audio==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Broadcast engineers in [[North America]] usually line up their audio gear to nominal reference level of 0&amp;nbsp;dB on a [[VU meter]] aligned to +4dBu or -20dBFs, in [[Europe]] equating to roughly +4 dBm or -18 [[dBFS]]. Peak signal levels must not exceed the nominal level by more than +10&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.shure.com/shure-notes/shure-tech-tip-vu-and-ppm-audio-meters-an-elementary-explanation/|title=Shure Tech Tip: VU and PPM Audio Meters – An Elementary Explanation|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast audio as a rule must be as free as possible of [[Gaussian noise]], that is to say, it must be as close to the [[noise floor]], as is reasonably possible, considering the storage or transmission medium.

Broadcast audio must have a good [[signal-to-noise ratio]], where speech or music is a bare minimum of 16db above the noise of the recording or transmission system. For audio that has a much poorer signal-to-noise ratio (like [[cockpit voice recorder]]s), sonic enhancement is recommended.

==Non-Standard Video==
Although almost any video gear can create problems when broadcast, equipment aimed at consumers sometimes produces video signals which are not broadcast safe. Usually this is to reduce the cost of the gear, since a non-standard video signal in the home might not create the problems that one might find in a broadcast facility.
Potential flaws exist with:

* '''VHS and 8&amp;nbsp;mm:''' Consumer devices generally lack [[time base correction]] that may cause problems with [[genlock]] and sync with some analogue and digital broadcast equipment. Consumer analogue video systems have greater system noise and lower chrominance and luminance than is normal for standard definition TV. As a general broadcast engineering rule all analogue videotape origin material should be genlocked before transmission, but this is not mandatory or necessary for all conditions. All analogue videotape by default is broadcast safe under normal playing conditions.
* '''Older videogame systems:''' Video game consoles before the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation]] and 8-bit [[home computer]]s generated a video signal lacking the half scan line needed to make [[interlaced video|interlace]] happen. This subtle simplification caused NTSC sets to scan 240p/60 instead of [[480i60]], with similar results for [[PAL]]. While this actually improved picture quality for the kind of [[Low-definition television|low-definition images]] that videogames of this era generated, such a signal modification could cause problems in a broadcast environment as the signal behaviour is outside the original television system specifications. Genlocking—but not timebase correction—are the recommended broadcast engineering solutions.
* '''Computer video signals:''' Computer video can be set up to run at many different frame or field rates, ranging 50 frame/s to more than 240 frame/s. Computer video is generally progressive by default, but many interlaced modes exist. A [[scan converter]] is typically needed to convert these signals to one of the many acceptable broadcast standards, such as 59.97&amp;nbsp;Hz or 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.  This type of conversion typically degrades the quality of the broadcast image, usually resulting with either "motion artifacts" or a lower resolution. It is recommended that the display rate be set to equal the target television rate if possible.

== In digital television only environments ==
In nations that have fully converted to digital television, broadcast safe analogue television takes on a slightly different meaning. All broadcasting systems will have been mostly converted to digital only outputs, leaving fewer entry points for analogue television signals.

What this means is that all devices that feed to the television transmitter must take in and feed standard analogue television signals into the transmission chain. Mostly it is up to the switcher to notify if there is non-broadcast safe video to the programmer. However, due to the limitations of many switchers for DTV and HDTV it ultimately is up to the automation systems to alert the programmer of non-broadcast safe video inputs.

As a matter of broadcast engineering practice, 4:3 analogue television signals will always pose the most problems with broadcast safe compliance. The use of portable and cheap timebase-genlock systems for analogue television inputs in the digital television studio will be clearly mandatory for the next 50 years.{{OR|date=November 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8641">Throughout the years, numerous conservative activists have accused [[CBS News]] of perpetuating a [[liberal bias]] in its news coverage. The [[Media Research Center]], a right-wing media watchdog group led by [[L. Brent Bozell, Jr.|L. Brent Bozell]], has been especially critical about what it has perceived to be unduly favorable coverage of liberal topics by CBS, especially during the tenure of ''CBS Evening News'' anchor [[Dan Rather]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrc.org/projects/rather20th/welcome.asp 20 Years On the ''CBS Evening News'': Dan Rather's Outrageous Liberal Bias], Media Research Center, c. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrc.org/BozellColumns/newscolumn/2001/col20010322.asp Remembering the Ratherisms], Media Research Center, 22 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2001 book ''[[Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News]]'', former CBS correspondent [[Bernard Goldberg]] extensively criticized Rather's management of CBS News and what he claimed was Rather's combative efforts to skew the network's coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://regnery.com/regnery/011205_bias.html |title=Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News |publisher=Regnery Publishing, Inc. |date=December 2001 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism scandals==
=== 1960s ===
In 1964, Rep. [[James B. Utt|Jimmy Utt]] (R-Cal.) filed a libel suit against CBS regarding a CBS Reports "Case History of a Rumor" program. He claimed the defendants had "'entrapped' him into giving a television interview that turned out to be a 'cross examination' by Roger Mudd, who acted as 'prosecutor, judge, and jury.'" The case was dismissed. Utt died in office in 1970 and was succeeded by [[John G. Schmitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger|last=Mudd|title=The Place To Be|isbn=978-1-58648-576-4|location=New York|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 1966, CBS News president [[Fred Friendly]] resigned in protest after the network declined to show hearings of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] regarding the expanding [[Vietnam War]] in favor of reruns of [[I Love Lucy]]. The decision, made by the network's vice president of broadcasting, John M. Schneider, specifically related to the testimony of [[George F. Kennan]] not being shown, in contrast to [[NBC News]], which was showing it live.

===Subsidization of Haitian invasion===
In 1971, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and the [[House Commerce Committee]] issued reports claiming that CBS News financially subsidized Project Nassau, a planned 1966 invasion of Haiti intended to overthrow then-dictator [[François Duvalier]]; CBS News allegedly became involved in the plot in order to shoot the invasion for a television documentary. However, the participants in the invasion were arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] before it could be carried out. In a [[deposition (law)|deposition]], ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'' reporter Tom Dunkin claimed that [[Jay McMullen]], a CBS producer, told him that he had "spent a lot of time and money on this project and had nothing to show for it." CBS was denounced by Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], who accused the network of disseminating "self-serving propaganda."&lt;ref name="Tech"&gt;MIT archives, "TECH", Mar 23, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Killian documents===
{{see also|Killian documents controversy}}

On September 8, 2004, two months before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' broadcast a report by Dan Rather claiming that a series of memos had surfaced criticizing President [[George W. Bush]]'s service record in the Texas [[Air National Guard]], purportedly discovered in the personnel files of Bush's then-commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Jerry B. Killian]]. However, independent analysis of the documents in question -- particularly analysis of their anachronistic typographic conventions -- strongly suggested that they were actually forgeries.

Despite initially defending the authenticity of the documents, Rather and CBS eventually admitted that they were misled about how they were obtained; Rather, however, has continued to insist that the documents weren't conclusively proved to be forged. After an internal investigation, CBS dismissed four producers and allegedly hastened Rather's retirement as anchor of the ''CBS Evening News''. Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS in 2007, claiming that the network and its management had made him a "[[scapegoat]]" in the Killian story. In 2009, Rather's lawsuit was dismissed.

===Plagiarism===
On the April 4, 2007, broadcast of the ''CBS Evening News'', Katie Couric gave a one-minute commentary about the importance of reading. However, it was later discovered that Couric's commentary was substantially lifted from a column by [[Jeffrey Zaslow]] in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Despite the personal flavor of the piece -- with Couric saying how she still remembered receiving her first library card -- it was later determined that a producer had written the commentary instead of Couric, and that she had plagiarized from Zaslow's column. CBS quickly fired the producer and promised changes to its procedures.

===Benghazi Incident===
Steve Kroft, Co-Editor of ''60 Minutes'', interviewed [[Barack Obama]] immediately following the noted Rose Garden press conference held in response to the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. CBS withheld significant parts of the interview that confirm the President's refusal to acknowledge the attack as a confirmed act of terror despite the prominence that arose following the second presidential debate. CBS quietly released the footage just two days before the 2012 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50134495n&amp;tag=mg;60minutes|title=Obama suspects Libya attack targeted Americans|work=cbsnews.com|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2014, reporter [[Sharyl Attkisson]] resigned from CBS News, citing what she saw as the network's liberal bias, an outsized influence by the network's corporate partners, and a lack of dedication to investigative reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Pavlich| first =Katie| title =Citing Liberal Bias, Investigative Reporter Sharyl Attkisson Resigns From CBS News| publisher =Townhall| date =10 March 2014| url =http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/03/10/breaking-investigative-reporter-sharyl-attkisson-resigns-from-cbs-news-n1806639| accessdate = 10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her upcoming book, Attkisson also reports about how her computer was hacked, deleting stories about the Benghazi attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/28/reporter-sharyl-attkisson-says-feds-hacked-compute/|title=Reporter Sharyl Attkisson says feds hacked computer, CBS protected Obama|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/27/highly-sophisticated-hacking-sharyl-attkisson-computers/|title=The highly sophisticated hacking of Sharyl Attkisson's computers|author=Howard Kurtz|work=Fox News|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misrepresentation of 2017 Chicago torture incident===
In January 2017, after the events of the [[2017 Chicago torture incident]] took place, CBS Radio News reported, "The viral video of a beating and knife attack in Chicago suggests the assault had racial overtones. CBS’s Dean Reynolds tells us the victim is described as a mentally challenged teenager. In the video he is choked and repeatedly called the n-word. His clothes are slashed and he is terrorized with a knife. His alleged captors repeatedly reference [[Donald Trump]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/online/cbs-radio-deceptively-implies-chicago-torturers-were-white-trump-supporters-victim-was-black/ CBS Radio Deceptively Implies Chicago Torturers Were White Trump Supporters, Victim Was Black], mediaite.com, January 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This description was criticized by conservatives,  including [[Armstrong &amp; Getty|Jack Armstrong and Joe Getty]] at the San Francisco CBS Radio News affiliate [[KGO (AM)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kgoradio.com/2017/01/05/armstrong-getty-brick-and-mortar-sales-are-down-bigly/ Armstrong &amp; Getty: Brick and mortar sales are down bigly], [[KGO (AM)]], January 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Carriers at War''''' is a [[computer game]] series developed by [[Strategic Studies Group]].

==Publication history==
''[[Carriers at War (video game)|Carriers at War]]'' was developed in 1992 for PC-DOS/MS-DOS and 1993 for Mac OS. ''[[Carriers at War II|Carriers at War II: Fleet Carrier Operations in Southeast Asia 1936-1946]]'' came out in 1993. An updated version of ''Carriers at War'' was released on June 8, 2007. The current release is the latest in a long history of this title dating back to 1984 for ([[Apple II]]) and ([[Commodore 64]]) entitled ''[[Carriers at War 1941-1945: Fleet Carrier Operations in the Pacific]]''.

''Carriers at War: Construction Kit'' was published in 1993, and ''The Complete Carriers at War: Fleet Carrier Operations in World War II'' was published in 1996.

==Reception==
A 1987 overview of World War II simulations in the magazine ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' rated the original ''Carriers at War'' four of five points and stated that "it excels in flexibility, options and limited intelligence".&lt;ref name="brooks198704"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Kilobyte Was Here! | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=37 | date=May 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1987&amp;pub=2&amp;id=37 | accessdate=17 April 2016 | last=Brooks | first=M. Evan | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1993 survey in the magazine of wargames gave it three stars out of five, stating "Highly recommended for the 8-market", and rated the revised DOS version three-plus stars, criticizing the lack of a campaign.&lt;ref name="brooks199309"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=110 | title=Brooks' Book of Wargames: 1900-1950, A-P | work=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1993 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M. Evan | pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the magazine said that the 8-bit version was "one of the first computer wargames to approach the complexity of board wargame simulations while still remaining playable and fun", and that the DOS version "was a milestone in computer wargame history".&lt;ref name="coleman199406"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''''Co-opetition: A Revolution Mindset that Combines Competition and Cooperation''''' is a non-fiction book on [[coopetition]] (co-operative competition), [[business strategy]], and [[game theory]] by [[Adam M. Brandenburger]] and [[Barry J. Nalebuff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385479506|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title=Co-Opetition Paperback by Adam M. Brandenburger, Barry J. Nalebuff |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was initially published by [[Crown Business]] on May 1, 1996. As of 2015, the book is still available in its 9th printing.

==Overview==
Coopetition or co-opetition is a neologism coined to describe the concept of cooperative competition. Coopetition is a [[portmanteau]] of cooperation and competition.

The text discusses at length the notion of coopetition, a business strategy gained from game theory to demonstrate when it is better for competitors to work together rather than to go up against one another in contest. The authors use many examples to show the simultaneous interplay between competition and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/17487/co-opetition-by-adam-m-brandenburger/|publisher=penguinrandomhouse.com|title=About Co-opetition|accessdate=2015-05-06|first=|last=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research added to previous industry analysis such as [[Michael Porter]]’s [[five forces model]], which focused almost entirely on competition between businesses.

==Review==
{{quote|At one time or another, everyone wants life to be more rational and scientific. Then we wouldn't have to spend so much late-night time on the phone with friends, playing out scenarios of the possibilities life offers. Corporate executives aren't exempt from this desire. They too spin scenarios, of the bottom-line variety. This must have been the audience Adam M. Brandenburger and Barry J. Nalebuff had in mind when they wrote Co-opetition, a book about "the game theory strategy that's changing the game of business," as they put it. Mr. Brandenburger, a Harvard Business School professor, and Mr. Nalebuff, who teaches at the Yale School of Management, believe businesses can become more competitive by cooperating, hence the neologism "co-opetition." ... The authors never really make clear what distinguishes game theory from good business sense. Decision-making is looking upside, downside, matching advantage against disadvantage, marrying a weakness to a strength and occasionally doing something "counterintuitive" that actually makes complete sense in context. Since the book is full of good stories, it's hard not to recommend it, but readers looking for science are likely to be disappointed.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">'''Dewey, Cheatem &amp; Howe''' is the [[gag name]] of a [[fiction]]al [[law]] or [[accounting]] firm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwatUOmKCrUC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=dewey+cheatem+and+howe&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q=dewey%20cheatem%20and%20howe&amp;f=false|author=Gerald P.

The gag name pokes fun at the perceived propensity of some lawyers and accountants to take advantage of their clients: The name of the firm is a [[pun]] on the phrase "Do we cheat 'em? And how!" This gag name is also used more broadly as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]] for any hypothetical law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fullname Citation Style|url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Distrib/Sources/fullname/fullname-doc.ps|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|access-date=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LaTeX letter using "appmhead" styles|url=http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/Letterhead/Sample1.html|publisher=[[University of Colorado Boulder]]|access-date=2010-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611171817/http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/Letterhead/Sample1.html|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math 103, Fall 2009, questions for final exam televised review, with solutions|url=http://rutv.rutgers.edu/pdf/math-103-f09-solutions.pdf|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|access-date=2010-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702220834/http://rutv.rutgers.edu/pdf/math-103-f09-solutions.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Your Clients - Consumer Protection - Fall 2002|url=http://law.gsu.edu/mbudnitz/fall02/meetclients_law7155.pdf|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|access-date=2010-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115062752/http://law.gsu.edu/mbudnitz/fall02/meetclients_law7155.pdf|archivedate=2009-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Memo Assignment|url=http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/ccorcos/fall2002/Researchmemoassignment.htm|publisher=[[Louisiana State University]]|access-date=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second name varies somewhat with regards to spelling (Cheetem, Cheater, Cheethem, Cheatham, etc.), but also to the word upon which it is based (Screwum, Burnham, etc.).

==Examples==
[[File:Car Talk Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe.jpg|thumb|right|The name of the DC&amp;H corporate offices is visible on the third floor window above the corner of Brattle and JFK Streets, in [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].]]
[[Tom and Ray Magliozzi]], of [[National Public Radio|NPR's]] ''[[Car Talk]]'' radio program, named their business corporation "Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe". Their corporate offices were located on a third-floor office at the corner of Brattle and JFK Streets in [[Harvard Square]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The Magliozzi brothers declared that they established DC&amp;H in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/about/history/|publisher=[[Car Talk]] (cartalk.com)|title=The History of Car Talk|access-date=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular poster for ''[[The Three Stooges]]'' features the Stooges as bumbling members of such a firm, although the actual episodes use the name "Dewey, Burnham, and Howe". [[The Three Stooges (2012 film)|The 2012 film]] uses this example, among similar ones such as [[Colorectal surgery|proctologists]] "Proba, Keister, and Wince" and [[Divorce| divorce lawyers]] "Ditcher, Quick, and Hyde." In the film ''Heavenly Daze'', Moe and Larry deal with a crooked attorney named "I. Fleecem" (I fleece 'em).

The champion [[Standardbred]] race horse [[Deweycheatumnhowe]] takes his name from this pun. On August 3, 2008, that undefeated horse won [[harness racing]]'s most prestigious event, the [[Hambletonian Stakes]], run at the [[Meadowlands Racetrack]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njsea.com/news.aspx?year=2008&amp;id=118 New Jersey Sports &amp; Exposition Authority, August 2, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615075251/http://www.njsea.com/news.aspx?year=2008&amp;id=118 |date=June 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants exist on the theme. The British magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' uses "Sue, Grabbitt, and Runne" ("[[lawsuit|sue]], grab it and run") when satirizing the legal profession, reflecting the magazine's experience defending from [[defamation]] lawsuits. In a set of legal forms published for lawyers and other legal professionals,{{Vague|date=March 2009}} one fictitious law-firm name is "Skrewer, Widow &amp; Children." The narrating presidential aide in [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]]'s novel ''The White House Mess'' came from the law firm of "Dewey, Scruem, and Howe".

[[Robin Williams]] used a variant of the pun when making a joke about the [[Bernard Madoff]] fiasco and the fact that his name is pronounced as "made off" by saying "What's next, a law firm called Dewey, Fuckyou and Howe?"

The novel ''[[Gump and Co.]]'', [[Winston Groom]]'s sequel to ''[[Forrest Gump (novel)|Forrest Gump]]'', names "Dewey, Screwum, &amp; Howe" as legal representation for members, including [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]], of a New York firm accused of [[insider trading]].

In an episode of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Luke Danes|Luke Danes]] ([[Scott Patterson]]), while dealing with his wife's irritating divorce lawyer, jokes that his own lawyer is Don Dewey at "Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe."

In an episode of ''[[Prison Break]]'', [[Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell]] states that he won a large sum of money after sustaining an injury on an oil rig, thanks to his lawyers at "Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe".

In an episode of ''[[Friends]]'', [[Chandler Bing]]'s boss states that the company they both work for has signed a contract with a new law firm: "Dewey, Cheatem and Howe". It is, of course, in the context of an office party, shortly before the boss is heard giving the punchline "Twenty dollars Sister, same as in town.".

The 1989 video game ''[[Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals]]'' features a law firm by this name, though only the second partner, Suzi Cheatem, makes an actual appearance in the game.

The novel ''[[The Plague Dogs]]'' by [[Richard Adams]] features a firm of architects by the name of "Sir Conham Goode, Son, and Howe".

In an episode of ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'' (Season 01 Episode 09, time index 0:05:41) the document that has the Judge's ID stamp lists the Plaintiff as being represented by "Donald Dewey of the law firm Dewey, Chetham and Howe".

In the video game, ''[[The Sims 4]]'', Sims in the Business career go to work at the "Dewey, Cheatem &amp; Howe" offices.

In one [[Stunt Dawgs]] comic book story, the Stunt Scabs' lawyer introduces himself as Slyme Whiplash and the law firm he works for as "Dewey, Cheatam and Howe".

'''Dudu Topaz''' ({{lang-he|דודו טופז}}; September 20, 1946 – August 20, 2009) was an [[Israel]]i [[TV]] personality, [[comedian]], actor, [[screenwriter]], playwright, author and [[radio]] and [[television]] host. In August 2009 he committed suicide while incarcerated, having been criminally charged with conspiring violence against prominent media figures in Israel.

== Biography ==
'''David Goldenberg''', later Dudu Topaz, was born in [[Haifa]], in then [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]) to Lilly and Eliyahu Goldenberg. His father was a radio announcer, actor and [[television director|director]]. After his army service, Topaz studied acting in London. Upon his return, he performed with the [[Haifa Theatre]] and appeared in entertainment shows around the country. Topaz was married three times and had three sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dudu Topaz: Israeli television personality |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6874630.ece |website=Times Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525004038/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6874630.ece |archivedate=May 25, 2010 |date=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entertainment career ==
[[File:Dudu Topaz &amp; Rachel Haramati - 1984.jpg|thumb| 180px| Topaz with radio producer Rachel Haramati at [[Kol Israel]] radio, Tel Aviv (1984)]]
In the 1970s, he took part in an Israeli radio show called "לצון נופל על לצון" (loosely:"A pranker falls for a prank"). His first job in television was as an English teacher in the [[Israeli Educational Television]]. In the early eighties Topaz began to direct television game shows in [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]]. The most successful of those was the game show "Play It" (שחק אותה). Topaz was a television host in the Israeli public TV [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]] in the eighties and early nineties, as well as running some successful [[sketch comedy]] shows on stage. 

In the nineties he was the host of popular show "Rashut Habidur" (The Entertainment Authority), later renamed "Ha'Rishon Ba'Bidur" (The First at entertainment), that aired for 11 seasons between 1994-2004 on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] commercial channel, and is one of the highest rated shows ever aired on commercial TV in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-mago.co.il/Editor/calt-233.htm|title=דודו טופז ועד משה רבנו|website=אימגו מגזין מאמרים}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show ended, Topaz hosted several other shows on other channels, but in May 2007 he announced that he would no longer host TV shows, but would pursue other careers such as acting and documentary film making.

==Controversy==
In 1981, Topaz gained notoriety from comments he made during an [[Israeli Labor Party]] political rally in Tel Aviv's  Malchei Yisrael Square (later renamed [[Rabin Square]]) when he said: "It's a pleasure to see the crowd here, and it's a pleasure to see that there are no ''chahchahim'' (derogatory slang word alluding to [[Mizrahi Jews|Israeli Jews of Middle Eastern background]]) who ruin election gatherings. The [[Likud]]'s ''chachchahim'' are at ''Metzudat Ze'ev''." (Likud party headquarters)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 31, 2009|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1243346510982&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Dudu Topaz arrested for ordering attack on TV execs|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges and suicide ==
[[File:The Grave of Dudu Topaz.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Dudu Topaz's grave, inscribed ''David Goldenberg'', in the "Yarkon" cemetery.]]
In May 2009, Topaz was arrested on suspicion of ordering, organizing and paying for a series of attacks on top-level TV executives Avi Nir and Shira Margalit and showbiz agent Boaz Ben-Zion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=July 3, 2009|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1244034988743|title=Editorial:The Dudu Topaz show|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three were beaten by assailants and sustained serious injuries. Topaz was also accused of planning attacks against television figures [[Zvika Hadar]], [[Erez Tal]], and [[Avri Gilad]], [[Israel Hayom]] editor-in-chief Amos Regev, his ex-wife Roni Chen, and her husband Haim Zenati,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3733358,00.html|title=Entertainer Dudu Topaz indicted|date=18 June 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a second assault against Ben-Zion after judging that the first had not been severe enough. Topaz allegedly went on this revenge spree because his show was taken off the air, and because he was rejected by rival channels and newspapers for which he offered to write guest columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=July 3, 2009|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Dudu-Topaz-Israel-Talk-Show-Host-To-Be-Held-In-Police-Cells/Article/200907115328082?f=vg|title=Israel Talk Show Host Dudu Topaz Remanded|publisher=[[Sky News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2009, it was reported that Topaz had confessed to having ordered the assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3725211,00.html|title=TV star Topaz admits to ordering assaults on top media figures|date=6 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topaz was later also indicted for drug possession, due to allegations that for the previous three years, Topaz had purchased [[cocaine]] from Ofir Sasportas, one of the other suspects in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3738483,00.html|title=State to add drug charges to Topaz indictment|date=29 June 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EA Montreal''' is a Canadian [[video game developer|video game development studio]] owned and operated by [[Electronic Arts]]. The studio is based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec|Québec]]. It was inaugurated by EA on March 17, 2004.&lt;ref name="EAMontrealOpen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/eas-montreal-studio-open-for-business-6091643|title=EA's Montreal Studio open for business|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|last=Navarro|first=Alex|date=2004-03-17|accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio was founded by Alain Tascan a former [[Ubisoft]] and [[BAM! Entertainment]] executive. It is one of a few examples where EA created a new studio instead of acquiring one. In 2006 with the acquisition of Jamdat, its Montreal offices were moved to the location of EA Montreal studio.

EA Montreal and EA Mobile Montreal are operated separately, however. In 2007, following the split of EA development studios into four labels, EA Montreal became part of EA Games Label ([[Frank Gibeau]], President). EA Montreal is responsible for two original franchises: ''[[Boogie (video game)|Boogie]]'' and ''[[Army of Two (series)|Army of Two]]'' as well as other titles where it collaborates with other EA studios.

The Visceral Montreal studio was closed in February 2013.&lt;ref name="Gameinformer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/02/21/report-army-of-two-developer-suffers-layoffs.aspx|title=Visceral Montreal Employee Confirms Entire Staff Let Go|last=Marchiafava|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|date=2013-02-21|accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, EA announced layoffs in the Mobile division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Futter|first=Mike|title=[Updated] "Key Development Studio" EA Montreal&amp;#39;s Mobile Division Hit With Layoffs - News - www.GameInformer.com|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/04/11/rumor-ea-montreal-mobile-division-hit-with-layoffs.aspx|work=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop Corporation|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further layoff on the Mobile Division took place in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/235973/Report_Layoffs_strike_EA_Montreal.php|title=Report: Layoffs strike EA Montreal|author=Alex Wawro |work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=2015-02-06|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, EA announced the creation of Motive Studios,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ea.com/motivestudios/&lt;/ref&gt; a new Montreal-based operation led by [[Jade Raymond]]. [[Motive Studios|Motive]] is co-located at EA Montreal with [[BioWare]], which has maintained a Montreal studio operation under the leadership of studio director Yanick Roy.

EA Montreal studio is located at 3 [[Place Ville-Marie]], downtown [[Montreal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9228">'''Films Albatros''' was a French [[film production]] company established in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Drazin. ''The Faber Book of French Cinema''. London: Faber &amp; Faber, 2011. p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed by a group of [[White émigré|White Russian]] exiles who had been forced to flee following the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]] and subsequent [[Russian Civil War]]. Initially the firm's personnel consisted mainly of Russian exiles, but over time French actors and directors were employed by the company. Its operations continued until the late 1930s.

==History==
Faced with increasingly difficult working conditions in Russia after the revolution of 1917, the film producer [[Joseph N. Ermolieff|Joseph Ermolieff]] decided to move his operations to Paris where he had connections with the Pathé company. Arriving in 1920 with a group of close associates, Ermolieff took over a studio in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil-sous-Bois]] in the eastern suburbs of Paris and began making films through his company Ermolieff-Cinéma. His co-founder of the company was [[Alexandre Kamenka]], another Russian exile, and when in 1922 Ermolieff moved to Germany, Kamenka, together with his colleagues [[Noë Bloch]] and Maurice Hache, took over the company and re-established it as the Société des Films Albatros. He also set up a distribution company called Les Films Armor in order to control the distribution of his own films.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abel, ''French Cinema: the First Wave, 1915-1929''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Various explanations have been given for the choice of the name Albatros: the name of a boat which brought some of the émigrés from Russia; a symbol of White Russia; an incident with an albatros on the journey. As well as adopting the image of the albatros as its symbol, the company took the motto "Debout dans la tempête" ("upright in the storm").&lt;ref&gt;"Le cinéma russe en exil: l'aventure des Films Albatros": [http://www.cinematheque.fr/expositions-virtuelles/albatros/index.htm online exhibition at Cinémathèque française] (2009). [Retrieved 26 December 2015. In French.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the group of Russian artists who stayed to work with Albatros were the directors [[Victor Tourjansky]] and [[Alexandre Volkoff]], the art director [[Alexandre Lochakoff]], the costume designer Boris Bilinsky, and the actors [[Ivan Mosjoukine]], [[Natalya Lisenko|Nathalie Lissenko]], Nicolas Koline, and Nicolas Rimsky.&lt;ref&gt;''The French Cinema Book'', edited by Michael Temple and Michael Witt. London: British Film Institute, 2004. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this Russian company initially favoured Russian themes, Kamenka quickly realised the need for greater integration with French film production, and they turned increasingly to French subjects. In 1924 a number of Kamenka's Russian associates left Albatros, and Kamenka offered opportunities to several  innovative French film-makers including [[Jean Epstein]], [[Jacques Feyder]], [[Marcel L'Herbier]] and [[René Clair]].

Kamenka's production policy combined prestige projects with openly commercial films,&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire du cinéma français'', sous la direction de Jean-Loup Passek. Paris: Larousse, 1987. p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his consistent record made him the most successful French producer during the 1920s, according to [[Charles Spaak]], who came to the company as a script-writer in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abel, ''French Cinema: the First Wave, 1915-1929''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kamenka successfully achieved international distribution for many of his films (even in Soviet Russia with which his company had so little political sympathy&lt;ref name="beylie"&gt;Claude Beylie, ''Une histoire du cinéma français''. Paris: Larousse, 2005. p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;) and from 1927 he entered into co-production arrangements with production companies in other European countries, driven by growing financial difficulties in the French film industry. The arrival of sound pictures posed a serious difficulty for Albatros which had hitherto relied considerably upon Russian actors, especially Mosjoukine whose accent precluded a successful transition into the talking era.&lt;ref name="beylie" /&gt;

The company's output diminished in the 1930s, but it achieved one further artistic success of note when [[Jean Renoir]] joined them for his 1936 adaptation of Gorki's ''[[The Lower Depths (1936 film)|Les Bas-fonds]]''. By this time, Albatros was the longest surviving film company operating in France,&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Andrew, ''Mists of Regret''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; but with the outbreak of World War II, Kamenka wound up the company which had remained particularly associated with silent cinema.

A '''flute circle''' is an organization of musicians which focuses on the [[Native American flute]].
Flute circles typically meet periodically to engage in educational and recreational
activities surrounding the instrument.
Most flute circles offer instruction on the Native American flute,
especially for flutists who are new to the instrument.
Many flute circles have a facilitator with experience in group music facilitation and
[[humanistic education|humanistic music education]]
to structure the activities and the music-making.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of the Native American flute in community music is notably different from traditional uses of the
instrument for courtship, hunting, or ceremony.&lt;ref name="Densmore1957"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This new use of the instrument has not been without controversy,
and flute circles are generally advised to use the instrument in a respectful manner because of
these considerations.&lt;ref name="Wapp1984a"&gt;

Many flute circles focus on raising the level of [[musicality]] of the participants
across a range of levels of musical experience using basic [[Ternary form|song forms]], [[Musical improvisation|music improvisation]], and techniques of experiential [[music education]].
These techniques include [[duet]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] improvisation forms that include [[Drone (music)|drone]]s, [[ostinato]] patterns, and [[call and response]] forms.&lt;ref name="Oshinsky2008"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–25}}
Facilitation forms include ''traveling ensembles'', ''showcasing'', ''segmenting'', and general ''conducted improvisations'' &amp;mdash;
techniques that are shared with other community music structures such as
[[drum circle]]s.&lt;ref name="Hull1998"&gt;

While some flute circles focus on aspects of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous cultures]]
and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]],
they do not typically relate to a single culture or tribe.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;

Flute circles can also organize events for participants to play at events,
festivals, school presentations,
or in service settings such as senior centers, elder facilities, and group homes.
Flute circles have also engaged in their own concerts, produced music albums,
and broadcast live music performances.&lt;ref name="ThrivingFluteCircles"&gt;

== Community music ==

Flute circles are one type of community music gathering. Other types include [[drum circle]]s, community choirs, facilitated dance, and community orchestras. However, Mary Jane Jones argues in her thesis that flute circles have particular attributes not found in other types of community music gatherings:
{{quote |text=If the goal of flute players is to express themselves through a Native American-based musical means, it could be argued that they should be able to do that just as effectively through drumming or dancing. The answer may lie with the fact that, as a wind instrument, the flute uses not just the hands, but also the breath. Singing is the ultimate form of personal musical expression. The sound is formed from within the body and the words from within the mind. For people who feel that their voices are inadequate or are hindered from singing traditional Native songs because of their inability to speak their ancestral language, using the breath to produce sound through a simple cylinder may serve as a satisfying substitute. The flute can give them a voice.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

== Organizations ==

Several national organizations have formed to provide support to local flute circles:

* [http://worldflutesociety.org/ WFS] &amp;mdash; [[World Flute Society]] (U.S.A.)
* [http://flutetree.org/ FTF] &amp;mdash; FluteTree Foundation (U.S.A.) (formerly RNAFF, Renaissance of the North American Flute Foundation)
* [http://jifca.com/ JIFCA] &amp;mdash; Japan Indian Flute Circle Association (日本インディアンフルートサークル協会) (Japan)

A roster of registered flute circles is maintained by WFS&lt;ref name="WFS_Roster" /&gt;
and FTF.&lt;ref name="RNAFF_Roster"&gt;{{cite web

=== Statistics ===

As of March 13, 2016, the roster of flute circles in this article listed 189 organizations in 9 countries, including flute circles in 44 States of the United States and 5 Provinces of Canada.

==== Historical ====
The chart below depicts the historical number of flute circles registered with the WFS (shown in darker blue) and its predecessor organization, the International Native American Flute Association ("INAFA") (shown in lighter blue).

The data for years prior to 2016 were gathered on March 13, 2016 from historical WFS and INAFA web pages provided by the [[Wayback Machine]].
The data for 2016 and 2017 were gathered from the live WFS web site on March 4, 2016 and January 3, 2017, respectively.

The data point for each year was taken on the first date in the year that the respective web site was updated. Data for the years 2012&amp;ndash;2014 represents the shift in organizations from INAFA to WFS.
The data roughly agrees with the Jones thesis, which reported 115 flute circles on the INAFA roster in 2010.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis" /&gt;{{rp|53}}

'''''Friendship!''''' is a 2010 German film directed by [[Markus Goller]].

==Plot summary==
Berlin 1989: After the fall of the Berlin wall, Veit (Mücke) and his friend Tom (Schweighöfer) decide to fly to [[San Francisco]]. Veit claims that he wants to travel to San Francisco because of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] which is "The westernmost point in the world." Tom is also fascinated by the idea and goes there with his friend.

Because the money they have saved is not quite enough they both book a flight to New York.  Arriving there with only 55 dollars, a few clothes and some self-made films, Tom learns the real reason for Veit's desire to travel to San Francisco: Veit's goal above all else is to see his father again, who 12 years ago fled from the GDR and whose only sign of life is an annual birthday postcard.   Veit wants to wait in front of the post office in San Francisco on his birthday - to meet his father when he sends the annual birthday card to him.   They decide to travel further by hitch-hiking, because the remaining money would only buy them a train ticket to New Jersey.

A comic book graphic artist named Daryll takes them both in his AMC Pacer in the direction of San Francisco. Daryll brings them both to a bar where they can show their film in the hopes of earning a little money.   They meet two young girls who invite them to their house. Because the parents come back earlier than expected, Tom and Veit have to leave the house in a hurry and spend the night in the wilderness.

The next morning they get a free breakfast in a diner. Then Veit brings one of the customers - a biker - the wallet which he had forgotten on the table. The gang of bikers takes the two to the West. However, during a rest a fight starts between Veit and a drunk biker. Tom is injured in the teeth as he tries to get between them. Another biker Hope loans Veit and Tom his brother's car, under the condition that they deliver it to Hope's brother near San Francisco. The biker also tells them that he has no key for the trunk. Despite the suspicions of the two that they could be carrying drugs or weapons, they accept the offer. Actually, there are pieces of ''Star Wars'' merchandise in the trunk. The boys only discover this when they were stopped by the police who forcibly open the trunk.

In [[Silver City, New Mexico]], they got to know Zoey, who speaks German thanks to her German mother and at whose place they spend two nights. In the local cinema, they show a documentary about the DDR and are subsequently invited to meet the Mayor. In the town they sell painted pieces of concrete as supposedly authentic pieces of the Berlin Wall so that they can pay for necessary repairs to the car.  At last the trio drives in the direction of San Francisco. At a stopover in [[Las Vegas]], Veit and Tom go to a gay club in Russian army clothes to strip in order to earn money for Tom's necessary dental treatment. While Veit waits in the hotel room for the other two, Tom spends the night with Zoey. This angers Veit, since he is in love with her too, and he drives off alone. Tom has a bad conscience and finally leaves Zoey, and it is unclear if the two will see each other again.

Tom and Veit meet again in front of the San Francisco post office and reconcile. While Veit has gone to get them a pizza, Tom believes he recognizes Veit's father, who is walking to the post office with a postcard in his hand. As a result, Tom speaks to him. After an initial hesitation, the stranger explains that he is not Veit's father, who was shot on the wall as he tried to escape. This man had at that time put his own application for a departure, which was granted by the Stasi on the condition that in the place of the dead victim (Veit's father) on the Berlin Wall, he should send letters and cards to the victim's relatives in order to make them believe that the escape attempt did not end in death.

Before Veit returns with the pizza, the stranger has gone, leaving Tom with the postcard. Tom tells Veit that his father is dead and Veit runs off aimlessly through San Francisco. Tom follows him to the Golden Gate Bridge where they embrace each other. The film ends with them delivering the car to Hope's brother.

==Production background==
The movie is based on a real-life journey of the producer Tom Zickler, who started out with friends after the fall of the Wall in order to travel to San Francisco. They also could only fly to New York because of money and needed to hitchhike the rest of the way. He hardly spoke any English and needed to work in a [[strip club]] to earn money.

''Friendship!'' was produced by Wiedemann &amp; Berg Film Production in cooperation with Brown Entertainment and SevenPictures. The film was the first movie project distributed by the German [[Columbia Pictures]]/German [[Sony Pictures]] Film Production.

The parents of Tom's character are played by the actual parents of Matthias Schweighöfer. The sketches of the graphic artist who brought Tom and Veit in the car are redolent of the cartoon characters ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]''. The character is also reminiscent in appearance and manner of the Canadian artist [[John Kricfalusi]].

==Reviews==
''The Encyclopedia of International Films'' describes the comedy as "good humored, well crafted, carefully designed [[buddy movie]], to which stands the skillful and sophisticated production in blatant disparity to the cliche-ridden and simplicity of the content. Kino.de summarizes, "it is seldom that someone in the wild west so explosively breaks in as these two easterners have." [...] ''Friendship!'' is the first feature film project by Markus Goller. It is beneficial to him that he lives in the U.S. and learned his work as a commercial director. Because rarely before has a German director put so well into picture the endless American hinterland."

Critic.de writes; "From the beginning, the mystery of Veit's past makes a tragic undertone. The real purpose of his journey is his father, who fled from the DDR years ago and now lives in San Francisco. The only sign of life since then was an annual birthday postcard to his son, Veit wants to catch him and so the trip soon becomes a race against time. [...] We finally find out how he actually did it and with this begins ''Friendship!'' Then however timidly on explicit political terrain - how successful this is, is argumentative, but with the opinionated gesture of coming from the same home ''The Lives of Others'' (2006) the film has little in common."

Johannes von der Gathen, author of dpa, described the film as "entertaining, but arg silly comedy that lead straight and without subtleties of socialist rain in the neo-capitalist eaves."  "It can be the [...] Director [...] of a cliché about the clash of cultures. If the producers Max Wiedemann and Quirin Berg, a few years ago with the Oscar-winning "The Lives of Others" managed a sensation, you could celebrate similar success with this half-hearted humor and casserole might be greatly doubted. But the screenplay by Oliver Ziegenbalg lurches too listless of Gag to Gag, in between there are then some criticism of capitalism before the movie quite openly bathing in nostalgia again "MovieMaze however, wrote: "Though the crew shoots in some places significantly over target also, but everything is possible in all an entertaining road movie with a good dose of slapstick."

konfenster.de voted the film to be Film of the Month in January 2010 and recommended it as an educationally valuable film, suited for classroom discussion. The film offers easy entertaining access to the historical and political background of GDR time and reunited Germany. From the contrast between two countries with different systems, director Markus Goller creates all kinds of comical sparks."  
 
==Reception==
''Friendship!'' premièred on 11 January 2010 in the Cinemaxx on the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin.  The official German premiere was on 14 January of that year. In Germany, the production was watched by 336,777 viewers by the end of the first weekend it was displayed and with a 908 people average audience in 371 cinemas was placed right after the James Camerons' ''Avatar'' (2009) on the second place of the cinema charts.

In total the comedy stayed in the top 20 in the charts for seven weeks and recorded about 10.3 million Euro in the box office until May 2013, with 1,597,200 viewers. In the official ranking of the most seen cinema movies of the year 2010, the production took the 14th place. Nevertheless, ''Friendship!'' advanced to the most successful German film production of the year.

The '''Gay Christian Network''' ('''GCN''') is a [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[straight ally]] organization and [[ecumenical]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian ministry|ministry]] founded in 2001 by [[Justin Lee (activist)|Justin Lee]] and administered from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] in the [[United States]].

The organization operates an online community "[[safe space]]" for [[social network]]ing and support; hosts the GCN Conference, the world's largest annual LGBT Christian [[Meeting|conference]] each January; organizes local [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] groups; and produces resources including GCN Radio, a weekly [[podcast|internet radio program]],&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;{{cite web

As of August 2015, the organization has over 30,000 members around the world.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

{{quotebox|align=right|width=50%|'''Guided by the light and love of Christ, GCN is transforming attitudes toward LGBT people across denominations and cultures.''' We do this by equipping churches, educating lay people, building supportive communities, influencing key thought leaders, fostering self-acceptance, and advocating on behalf of the marginalized and oppressed. Together, we are creating a world where the next generation of LGBT youth will grow up fully loved and embraced by their families, churches, and neighbors; and where Christians worldwide will live up to their calling as instruments of grace and defenders of the outcasts.|source=—Mission statement}}

==History and Purpose==
GCN was founded in 2001 as an [[online community]] to provide support to gay Christians. Founder [[Justin Lee (activist)|Justin Lee]] had struggled for years to reconcile his own Christian faith with his sexuality, so he set up GCN as a way to support others in similar situations.&lt;ref name="BizJournal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Neela. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/us/12evangelical.html "Gay and Evangelical, Seeking Paths of Acceptance"], ''The New York Times'', December 12, 2006. Accessed February 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As the organization grew, its mission expanded. In 2008, GCN officially adopted five "missional directions": promoting spiritual growth, cultivating safe community, supporting family and friends, educating and encouraging the church, and engaging the wider LGBT community and the world.&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher = Gay Christian Network
  | url = http://www.gaychristian.net/mission.php?
  | format = website
  | accessdate = 2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee has said that GCN aims "to change hearts and minds in the church, and to provide support to parents and to pastors as they are wrestling with these issues in their own families and congregations."&lt;ref name="BizJournal"/&gt;

=== Change in Leadership===
On July 19, 2017, it was announced that GCN and Justin Lee went their separate ways.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;Due to irreconcilable differences about the direction and future of the organization, Justin Lee and the GCN Board of Directors have agreed to his amicable separation from the organization. Justin Lee will no longer serve as the executive director of GCN, effective May 4, 2017. Neither Justin nor the Board will publicly discuss the reasons behind Justin's departure other than to affirm that it was a practical business decision intended to allow for the growth of this important work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geekyjustin.com/statement-on-gcn/|title=An important message. – Justin Lee|website=geekyjustin.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The GCN Conference==
According to GCN, its conference is the largest annual LGBT Christian event in the world. The conference includes a wide variety of workshops that explore the LGBT and Christian landscapes, particularly where they intersect.

=== Workshops ===

Some past workshops have discussed:
* The Bible and Homosexuality
* Support for Parents
* Resources for Pastors and Churches
* Race and Intersectionality
* Making a Real-World Impact
* The Trans Community and the Church
* Supporting LGBT Youth
* Side B and Celibacy
* Couples' Communication
* Prayer and Spiritual Growth
* Responding to Homophobia

=== Speakers ===

The GCN Conference attracts keynote speakers and performers from a variety of perspectives, known nationally and internationally for their faith work. Past conferences have included names such as Philip Yancey, Rachel Held Evans, Vicky Beeching, Jeff Chu, Peter Gomes, Tony Campolo, and more.

The 2016 GCN Conference will include Rev. Allyson Dylan Robinson, believed to be the first openly transgender person to be ordained by a Baptist church; the Rev. Broderick Greer, Episcopal Curate specializing in conversations at the intersection of social media, queer theology, black theology, American history, racial justice, and human rights; Justin Lee, the founder and executive director of GCN; and Tracey Lind, recipient of the Human Rights Campaign Equality Award, who has been named Woman of Achievement by the YWCA Greater Cleveland, and has been honored through the National Council of Church's Circle of Names program.

==Financial support==
In the [[United States]], the Gay Christian Network, like most churches, is an [[Internal Revenue Code]] [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] that provides resources and support to its members.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Like church membership, people participate in the Gay Christian Network ministry without financial cost.  Members and supporters can choose to offer financial support for administration and programming through one-time and/or recurring free-will donations.&lt;ref name="Pledge"&gt;{{cite web

==Theology==
Members of The Gay Christian Network have a diverse set of [[theology|theological beliefs]] from [[liberal Christianity|very liberal]] to [[Conservatism|very conservative]].

The organization's "Statement of Faith" is broadly consistent with orthodox Christian beliefs, asserting the existence of one God, the divinity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, the Bible as the authoritative word of God, and the importance of living holy lives in service to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaychristian.net/statementoffaith.php|title=Our Statement of Faith|website=www.gaychristian.net|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond that, the organization does not take public stands on most theological issues; instead, it offers support to individuals in a wide variety of Christian sects and denominations, including but not restricted to [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]/[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], [[Baptist]], [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Disciples of Christ]], [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], [[Metropolitan Community Church]], [[Pentecostal]] and other [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatic]] churches, [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Quaker]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[United Church of Christ]], and unaffiliated/[[nondenominational]] Christians.

==Sex and Christianity==

Members of the Gay Christian Network have expressed a wide variety of opinions concerning gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender life and how it should be lived from a Christian perspective. For instance, the site is committed to being a safe haven both for members who believe it is okay for gay Christians to enter into healthy, [[Long term relationship|committed relationships]] (including sex) and for those who believe that the [[Bible]] prohibits such behavior and requires [[chastity]]. On the site, these two positions have been nicknamed ''Side A'', i.e., those members who believe that homosexual activity is not sinful, and ''Side B'', i.e., those who believe that God does love gay people but does not accept homosexual activity.

It should be noted that the ''Side A'' members are ''not'' advocating promiscuity or other casual sexual behaviors; many of them are looking for a [[monogamy|monogamous]], marital relationship (e.g. a [[civil union]]). Similarly, the ''Side B'' members are ''not'' advocating an ex-gay position; many of them believe that God is not asking them to change their sexual orientation, but simply that they remain sexually chaste. As the site describes the two sides:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here at GCN, we have two types of gay Christians. '''On one side''' are those who are in gay relationships or hope to be someday. '''On the other side''' are those who view their same-sex attractions as a temptation, and strive to live celibate lives. We call these views '''Side A''' and '''Side B''', and both are well-represented at GCN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaychristian.net/index.php? GCN Homepage] (website). Gay Christian Network. Retrieved on 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although both sides have strong contingents on the site, many members have not fully decided which side they belong to. For these members, the site provides a safe place in which to think through these issues and the resources to help people make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see [http://www.gaychristian.net/greatdebate.php? The Gay Christian "Great Debate"] (website). Gay Christian Network. Retrieved on 2008-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of the variety of opinions is that many ''Side A'' members on the site choose to remain sexually abstinent until they are in a committed relationship and/or legal marriage. These types of beliefs exemplify the conflicts that some gay Christians have encountered with the mainstream gay community.

==Reception in the media==
The ministry gained national attention with the founder's appearance on the [[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]] television program's ''Gay-to-Straight Debate'' in 2006 where Lee argued against [[conversion therapy]].  Lee debated an ordained priest who was a former prostitute who claimed sexual reorientation therapy works.&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;{{cite web

[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/us/12evangelical.html?scp=2&amp;sq=%22justin+lee%22+gay&amp;st=nyt "Gay and Evangelical, Seeking Paths of Acceptance"], ''The New York Times'', December 12, 2006. Accessed February 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's website has become well-known enough that it was recently mentioned as a resource in the syndicated advice column ''[[Annie's Mailbox]]'', written by two former editors for [[Ann Landers]]. The column lists GCN alongside such denominational gay Christian groups as [[IntegrityUSA]] ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]), [[DignityUSA]] ([[Catholic]]), [[Seventh-day Adventist Church#Offshoots and schisms|Seventh Day Adventist Kinship International]], the GLBT-focused [[Metropolitan Community Church]] denomination, and  [[PFLAG]], the nation's largest support network for parents, siblings, children and friends of GLBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creators.com/lifestylefeatures/annies-mailbox/annie-s-mailbox-r-2008-02-06.html ''Annie's Mailbox''], 6 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry has also been mentioned (often alongside or through an interview with Lee) in articles on gay Christians and their fight for inclusion in the church, such as the article "Progressive Christians see hope for gay marriage"&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Colbert. [http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ne&amp;article_code=3531 "Progressive Christians see hope for gay marriage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314095655/http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ne&amp;article_code=3531 |date=2008-03-14 }}, ''InNewsweekly.com'', 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Associated Press]] article "Gays, lesbians join the chastity movement," which interviews members of the site's "Waiting for Marriage" group.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff McMillan. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003727929_webvirginity31.html "Gays, lesbians join the chastity movement"], ''Associated Press'', 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry's annual conference was featured as part of an article on the gay Christian rock group Canaan, some of whose members are also regular contributors to the site.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Bearden.

{{term|[[180-degree rule]]}}
{{defn|A basic guideline regarding the on-screen spatial relationship between a character and another character or object within a scene.

{{defn|A basic {{gli|editing|film editing}} guideline that states the camera should move at least 30 degrees relative to the subject between successive shots of the same subject.

{{defn|A type of lighting whereby a {{gli|spotlight}} accentuates a single {{gli|character}} or other subject and sometimes a few props in a {{gli|scene}}, so that the focus of the scene is on the subject and not its surrounding environment.

Cameo lighting derives its name from the art form in which a light relief figure is set against a darker background. It is often achieved by using {{gli|barn doors|barn-doored spotlights}}.

'''''Hornblower and the Crisis''''' is a 1967 historical novel by [[C. S. Forester]]. It forms part of the [[Horatio Hornblower]] series, and as a result of Forester's death in 1966, it was left unfinished.  There is a one-page summary of the last several chapters of the book found on the final page, taken from notes left behind from the author.  It was the eleventh and last book of the series to be published, but it is fourth in chronological sequence.

Several other writers have written conclusions, notable efforts being that of Bob Smith, member of the [http://csforester.eu C S Forester Society], published in 2010 and ''The Jamaican Affair'' by John Mahon, published in 2012 as an ebook by [http://www.johnmahon.us/jm_book_TJAo1805.html eNetPress].

==Plot summary==
Hornblower has just finished his tour blockading Brest in command of the Royal Navy sloop ''Hotspur''. As he travels back to England for his next assignment, he is asked to participate in the [[court martial]] of ''Hotspur's'' new captain and officers. ''Hotspur'' ran aground and was lost the day after Hornblower turned over command.

Following the court martial, the officers travel back to England with Hornblower. On their way, they are pursued by a French brig, which they engage and disable. During the battle, Hornblower boards the brig and finds important papers in the French captain's quarters. Back in England, he travels to the Admiralty with the documents. He arrives at the same time as the disappointing news that the French fleet under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] has escaped into [[Ferrol, Spain]] after an [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|indecisive engagement]].

Hornblower presents a daring plan to the [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|Secretary of the Navy]], to send false orders to Villeneuve, made possible because the papers brought by Hornblower include an example of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s new signature. The orders are to draw Villeneuve out of a safe harbour and into a decisive engagement with [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]].

The unfinished book stops at the point where Hornblower is persuaded to attempt the mission himself. Notes left by Forester indicate that Hornblower would carry out the mission accompanied by South American revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]], with Hornblower posing as his servant. They deliver the false orders to Villeneuve without arousing suspicion, prompting him to take his fleet to sea; this ultimately leads the destruction of the Franco–Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

This book also includes two short-stories, "[[Hornblower and the Widow McCool]]" (a.k.a. "Hornblower’s Temptation"), set early in Hornblower's career, and "[[The Last Encounter]]", set in 1848 when he is living on his country estate in old age and retirement.

''Iron Eagle'' was followed by three sequels: ''[[Iron Eagle II]]'', ''[[Aces: Iron Eagle III]]'', and ''[[Iron Eagle on the Attack]]'', with Gossett being the only actor to have appeared in all four films.

The basis of the fictional story in the film relates to real life attacks by the [[United States]] against [[Libya]] over the [[Gulf of Sidra]], in particular the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|1981 Gulf of Sidra incident]].

==Plot==
Doug Masters, son of veteran [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilot Col. Ted Masters, is a hotshot civilian pilot, hoping to follow in his father's footsteps. His hopes are dashed when he receives a notice of rejection from the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]]. Making matters worse is the news that his father has been shot down and captured by the fictional Arab state of Bilya while patrolling over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Despite the incident occurring over [[international waters]], the Arab state's court finds Col. Masters guilty of trespassing over their territory and sentences him to [[Hanging|hang]] in three days. Seeing that the U.S. government will do nothing to save his father's life, Doug decides to take matters into his own hands and come up with his own rescue mission. He requests the help of Col. Charles "Chappy" Sinclair, a [[Vietnam veteran]] pilot currently in the [[Air Force Reserve]], who, while not knowing Col. Masters personally, had a favorable run-in with him years prior to meeting Doug and "knew the type." Chappy is skeptical at first; but Doug convinces him that, with his friends, he has full access to the airbase's intelligence and resources and can give him an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 fighter]] for the mission. To Doug's surprise, Chappy had already begun planning a rescue operation himself after he learned the outcome of Col. Masters' trial. The combined efforts of Chappy and Doug's team result in a meticulously planned mission and the procurement of two heavily armed F-16B jets, with Doug flying the second unit.

On the day of Col. Masters' scheduled execution, Doug and Chappy fly their jets to the Mediterranean Sea and cross into Bilyan airspace. The Bilyan military responds, and in the ensuing battle Doug and Chappy take out three [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] fighters and destroy an airfield, with Chappy's plane being hit by anti-aircraft fire. He tells Doug to climb to a high altitude and play the tape he made him the night before, then his engine fails and Doug listens as Chappy's fighter goes down. Chappy's recorded voice gives Doug encouragement and details that help him to complete the mission and rescue his father. Making the enemy believe he is leading a [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]], Doug threatens the enemy state into releasing his father for pickup. Before Doug lands his plane, Col. Masters is shot by a sniper, causing Doug to destroy the airbase and engulf the runway with [[napalm]] to keep the army at bay while he lands and picks up his wounded father. Just as they take off, Doug and his father encounter another group of MiGs led by Col. Akir Nakesh, himself an [[ace pilot]]. The lone F-16 and Nakesh's MiG engage in a [[dogfight]] until a missile from Doug finishes off Nakesh. Low on fuel and ammunition, the F-16 is pursued by the other enemy MiGs when a squadron of U.S. Air Force F-16s appear, warding off the MiGs before escorting Doug and his father to [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[West Germany]].

While Col. Masters is being treated for his wounds, Doug is reunited with Chappy, who had ejected from his plane and was picked up by an [[Egypt|Egyptian]] [[fishing trawler]]. The two are summoned by an Air Force judiciary panel for their reckless actions. Seeing that any form of punishment for the duo would expose an embarrassing lapse in Air Force security, the panel forgoes prosecution as long as Doug and Chappy never speak of their operation to anyone. In addition, Chappy convinces the panel to grant Doug admission to the Air Force Academy. Days later, a plane assigned by the President returns to the U.S., reuniting Doug, Chappy, and Col. Masters with family and friends.

==Production==
According to writer/director [[Sidney J. Furie]], the film's working title was ''Junior Eagle''. The script was turned down by every studio before it was picked up by Joe Wizan, former head of [[20th Century Fox]]. Wizan then handed the script to producer [[Ron Samuels]], who likened it to the old [[John Wayne]] westerns.&lt;ref name="L.A. Times"/&gt;
Although their F-16s are featured in the movie poster, the [[United States Air Force]] has a long-standing policy about not cooperating on any film involving the theft of an aircraft. Consequently, the filmmakers turned to the [[Israeli Air Force]] for the necessary aerial sequences. The filming in [[Israel]] took six weeks, with the flight sequences choreographed by Jim Gavin, whose earlier works include ''[[Blue Thunder]]''.&lt;ref name="L.A. Times"/&gt;

The aircraft used for both the American and the "Bilyan" air forces were Israeli jets: single-seat F-16As, two-seat F-16Bs, and [[IAI Kfir|F-21/C-2 Kfirs]] simulating MiG-23s (the latter painted with imaginary national markings).&lt;ref name="imdbtrivia"&gt;{{cite web | title = Iron Eagle trivia | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091278/trivia | work = [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] | accessdate = 2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The F-16s were given American national roundels and tail codes that only superficially resembled actual USAF markings, but retained their Israeli desert camouflage, a paint scheme that has never been used on USAF F-16s. The cockpit displays depicted in the film were all simulated, and did not bear any resemblance to an early model F-16's actual instrumentation (with the exception of the heads-up display, which was somewhat accurate). Additionally, the "Hades" bomb employed by Doug against the Bilyan airfield was a fictional weapon, though its effects were similar to real-life [[napalm]].

The character of Colonel Charles "Chappy" Sinclair was inspired by the real life U.S. Air Force General [[Daniel_James Jr.|Daniel "Chappie" James, Jr]]. General James was a member of the famed all-black [[Tuskegee Airmen]], and also flew fighter jets in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He later became the first black four-star General in U.S. history.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack album was issued by [[Capitol Records]] on LP and cassette, and later on compact disc. It features songs by [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[King Kobra]], [[Eric Martin (singer)|Eric Martin]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[Adrenalin (band)|Adrenalin]], and more.

In 2008, [[Varèse Sarabande]] released the original musical score by [[Basil Poledouris]] as part of their CD Club.

==Box office and reception==
''Iron Eagle'' earned US$24,159,872 at the U.S. box office.&lt;ref name="Mojo"/&gt; Although the movie was not a major success at the cinema, it generated US$11 million in home video sales, enough to justify a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cassette Sales Help `Iron Eagle II` To Fly|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-01-16/features/8701040030_1_ron-samuels-shooting-site-tri|work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=''Sun Sentinel''|date=1987-01-16|accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "a total waste of time", saying it "achieves a kind of perfection of awfulness that only earnest effort can produce."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Iron Eagle': Middle-east Rescue Mission |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1986-01-17|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-17/entertainment/ca-773_1_iron-eagle-middle|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Kevin | last=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine commented that the film has "breakneck action and some dandy dogfights", but the dialogue is simply laughable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''Iron Eagle'' Review |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine |date=1985-12-31 |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792029.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home video==
''Iron Eagle'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] by [[CBS/FOX Video]] in 1986. On October 1, 2002, it was released on [[DVD]]. On February 3, 2009, it was reissued on DVD by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] in a double-feature set with the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7803807 |title='&amp;#39;Last Action Hero'&amp;#39;/'&amp;#39;Iron Eagle'&amp;#39; DVD |publisher=CDUniverse.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Isolation (disambiguation)}}
In [[contact juggling]], [[poi spinning]], [[hooping]] and other types of [[object manipulation]], an '''isolation''' is an [[illusion]] whereby a prop appears to float in space, with the performer's hands and body moving around it. In reality the performer is supporting the prop, and countering his or her movement relative to the prop. 

[[Michael Moschen]] is originally credited for developing several of the techniques for ball isolations (as well as hoops and other props) and since his original performance of 'Light' in the late 1980s, the idea has developed into a wide variety of techniques. One of the most important developments was the combination of crystal ball isolations and body-[[popping]]/[[locking (dance)|locking]]/waving dance styles, as seen in the styles of, amongst others, Nik Robson and [[Matt Hennem]] in the '90s.

'''Joannie "Nan" Taylor''' (also '''Jackson''') (Born 7 July 1933) is a fictional character in ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]''. She is one of the main characters of the show and is portrayed by [[Catherine Tate]]. She has since gone on to be the main character of a number of specials.

== Character history ==

===''The Catherine Tate Show''===
Joannie is most often referred to as "Nan". She is an obnoxious [[cockney]] woman in her seventies who frequently swears at and criticises other people. She is often visited by her well-mannered grandson, Jamie ([[Mathew Horne]]) whom she refers to when visitors come "'e ain't got a job", even though Jamie is in fact at university. His visits usually start off well enough, with Nan showing how grateful she is that he has come to see her. However, the situation usually takes a turn for the worst after she starts to make unfavourable comments about her neighbours, family, or home help visitors. Nan is mostly very pleasant to visitors, but after they leave, she criticises and rants about them. Sketches in series one show Jamie taking her to a [[pound shop]], which ends with shambolic consequences. Joannie complains to her grandson about her home help visitor, whom she refers to as a "fucking [[Māori people|Māori]]". She also calls her new great-grandchild ugly. Her [[catchphrase]], delivered at the crucial point of each sketch, is "What a fucking liberty!"

In series two, Nan spends less time in her [[Apartment|flat]]. She makes a disastrous visit to the doctor and spends two weeks in [[hospital]]. True to form, she does not suffer in silence, complaining about her fellow patients, accusing a nurse of stealing from her and caustically surveying the food menu. While in hospital, her grandson brings his first girlfriend to visit her. Unfortunately, his girlfriend has an abnormally large nose, provoking Nan's insulting behaviour as she becomes fixated with it, even offering her some old [[bed sheet|sheets]] to use for [[facial tissue|tissues]]. Another sketch sees Joannie arrive home from her friend Lena's [[funeral]], where she is very upset, until she realises that the deceased actually owed her £15. She quickly gets over her grief and is overcome with rage, coupled by the fact she had spent another £25 on a wreath. In the last episode of Series 2, [[Peter Kay]] guest stars as one of Nan's friends who thinks Jamie is [[gay]] and describes it as a disability. In the 2005 Christmas special, a sketch features Nan attending a Christmas party in an old people's care home. [[Charlotte Church]] makes a guest appearance as herself, where she starts to sing a Christmas song for the guests, which prompts Nan to exclaim, "what a load of ole' shit!"

In series three, [[Leslie Phillips]] plays another of Nan's friends, who is himself very much like her, evident when he says "What a fucking liberty" after Nan visits him in hospital and leaves him a present which he did not like, she had also used the phrase after receiving the same gift, which she re-gifted . [[Sheila Hancock]] appears as Nan's sister June, who lives in Spain and is equally as foul-mouthed as Nan. They reveal that most of their family were London gangland career criminals and mass murderers, with nicknames such as "Clownface", "Wallopnuts" and "Longsocks". Nan also made a characteristic appearance on ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'', in which she was pleased to discover his show had bought her a new armchair, but soon got annoyed when she learned that they had entered her house without her permission to deliver it, upon which she stormed off the set, exclaiming "Paul O'Grady? What a load of old shit!" Nan has at least one daughter, Diane, who is the mother of Jamie and a granddaughter, Gail, who bore Nan's "ugly" great-grandchild, Francesca. She initially believes the child to have been named [[Tesco|Tesco's]]. The Christmas 2007 special introduced us to Diane herself, played by [[Kathy Burke]], who was exactly like Nan in that she swore at and criticized people behind their backs. The sketch ends with both of them saying "What a fucking liberty!" together.

===Charity sketches===
In a sketch made especially for ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief 2007]]'', Nan appears on the game show, ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', hosted by [[Noel Edmonds]]. In the sketch, Nan plays a game of ''Deal or No Deal'', in which she uncovers the five highest amounts of money in the first five boxes. As the boxes are opened, she makes an offensive comment about the player opening it, targeting their weight, earrings, and glasses. Being given an offer of £199 by the Banker, Nan accepts the offer happily, having already cheated and looked in her box and found that it only contained £50. Later in 2007, she did a Sport Relief sketch, about the World Cup. In 2010, she appeared on Comic Relief, receiving a cheque for her local community centre. Nan has also appeared in [[Holby City]]'s hospital, because of her [[ingrown toenail]], a 2013 [[Children in Need]] sketch.

This is a list of [[planet]]s appearing in the [[fiction]]al ''[[Transformers]]'' universe.

==Akalo==
'''Akalo''' (also known as Archa Nine) is the 9th planet in the Arca System. It is an organic [[forest]] planet that is populated by the Akalouthians (a technological primitive people).

==Andellor==
'''Andellor''' is a [[library]] planet for a highly evolved society.

==Antilla==
'''Antilla''' is an ancient ringed planet which was the site of an early [[Autobot]] colonization effort. This colony was wiped out by the deadly plague known as Cosmic Rust as seen in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Cosmic Rust."

Antilla is also home to adorable creatures known as Antillan Bumble-Puppies.

==Arkus==
'''Arkus''' is a planet that is a home to robotic creatures that first appeared in the 3H Comics.

==Aquatron==
'''Aquatron''' was a planet introduced in the novel ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'' notable for being almost entirely covered in water. It was part of the Quintesson Empire and its inhabitants were enslaved as part of the illusion of the Quintesson "Co-Prosperity Sphere." Aquatron was a Cybertronian colony, and its native inhabitants-the Aquatronians and the Sharkticons-are of Cybertronian descent. The Autobots and Decepticons arrive here and quickly learn that the planet is under Quintesson control, after one of the planet's artificial rings-used to gather and fire energy-disables both their ships. A massive battle then ensues between the Cybertronians and the Sharkticons, with the Sharkticons later abandoning the Quintessons in temporary favor of Megatron. However, the awakening of a massive Quintesson jellyfish known as the Hydratron-which while dormant had served as a continent/city for the inhabitants of the planet-proved devastating, and the Autobots and the Decepticons eventually left the planet behind. One benefit of their visit was that Aquatron was freed from Quintesson rule and fell to the jurisdiction of a massive race of underwater Transformers, including one known as Leviacon. The planet was also inhabited by the [[Pirahnacons]], a deadly race that fed upon Transformers.

Known inhabitants of Aquatron include:

* '''Inquirata the [[Curator]]''' - A Quintesson better known by his title of Curator, Inquirata was stationed on Aquatron to lure the Autobots and Decepticons there. He did so through the use of a replica of the [[Matrix of Leadership]], and hoped to earn the favor of his superiors and be returned to Quintessa. His aspirations were dashed when the Sharkticons rebelled, and he was later killed by Tyrannicon.
* '''Doctor Xeros''' - A Quintesson [[physician]] who worked as the Curator's direct subordinate. He was later killed by the Sharkticons after Megatron took control of them.
* '''Tyrannicon''' - A Sharkticon general created by the Quintessons to lead their enslaved army, and several sizes larger than many of his troops. Tyrannicon forced the Autobots and Decepticons on Aquatron to surrender to him, and was then dispatched to lead the invasion of Cybertron. His forces later rebelled against him under Megatron's command, and he returned to Aquatron, killing the Curator before engaging Megatron in battle. He succeeded in claiming the Matrix replica that had given Megatron control of the Sharkticons and had his own power increased by it, but was killed by the Hydratron.
* '''Leviacon''' - A giant Transformer with a [[whale]]-like alternate form, Leviacon and his race were enslaved by the Quintessons. After Megatron disrupted the Quintessons' control of Aquatron's inhabitants, Leviacon came to Optimus Prime's aid, taking him to face the Curator and later saving him and Megatron from annihilation. He and his people then reclaimed their planet, bidding the Autobots farewell.
* '''The [[Gamekeeper]]''' - A massive, cyborg creature resembling a [[lobster]], the Gamekeeper resided in the bowels of the Hydratron, where he maintained the Quintessons' vicious aquatic pets. On rare occasions he would devour prisoners himself, such as the Sharkticons who dreamed of a future liberator. Unbeknownst to him, that liberator arrived in the form of Decepticon leader Megatron, who with Optimus Prime managed to destroy the Gamekeeper.

==Chaar==
{{Redirect|Chaar|the Indian film|Chaar (film)}}
'''Chaar''' (in Japan, '''Jarr''') appeared in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' television series, debuting in [[List of The Transformers episodes|The Five Faces of Darkness (Part 1)]] in season three. It is a small, burned-out husk of a planet in distant space, easily mistaken for a smudge on a map. It apparently supported a civilization at one point, as abandoned structures are seen on the surface. The surface is desolate and lacks vegetation, but some native lifeforms still exist, including an enormous [[spider]].

Following [[Unicron]]’s attack on [[Cybertron]] in 2005, the [[Autobot]]s reclaimed Cybertron, and the surviving [[Decepticon]]s (who were without their leader [[Galvatron]] at the time) were forced to withdraw to Chaar, where they struggled to eke out an existence, relying on the meager amounts of Energon that could be acquired from other worlds. Eventually, [[Cyclonus]] set out to find Galvatron but, in his absence, the [[Quintessons]] supplied the Decepticons with Energon in return for their assistance in launching an attack against the Autobots. With the return of Galvatron, the alliance was restructured, but the ensuing attack on Cybertron ended in failure, resulting in the Decepticons again returning to Chaar, which served as their base of operations for the remainder of the series.

After [[Earth]] and Cybertron, Chaar appeared in more episodes of the [[The Transformers (TV series)|original television series]] than any other planet.

Chaar was also mentioned in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', but as an asteroid belt, not a planet.

Circuit Planet was used for a race between the Autobots and Kicker in the episode "Crash Course." It was won by Arcee and Misha Miramond. Circuit Planet was later destroyed by Megatron who was controlling Unicron's body.

==Combatron==
'''Combatron''' is a planet that was established as colony world that by [[King Atlas (Transformers)|King Atlas]] until a war erupted that left it all but devoid of life.

==Cybertron==
{{Main|Cybertron}}

Chicago Sun-Times; August 11, 1986; by Patricia Smith&lt;/ref&gt; Cybertron is populated by mechanical life forms of variable size who can transform into all kinds of machinery. These are called Cybertronians, or Transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.02/transformers.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404085605/http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.02/transformers.html |title=Animerica: Animerica Feature: TransACTION |archivedate=4 April 2004 |work=animerica-mag.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daffodil II==
'''Daffodil II''' is a luxurious all-natural planet.

==Darhos==
'''Darhos''' is a planet that was a veritable paradise. As time went on, certain groups began to monopolies control of the resources and money, leading to vast class split. Now Darhos’ decadent ruling class lives in the lap of luxury, eating, drinking and enjoying the pleasures of the flesh amidst architecture and fashion that seems a mad blend of many of Earth’s ancient cultures while the poverty-stricken citizens live in slums. Should the disenfranchised attempt to rise up against their self-proclaimed masters, they would be captured and thrown into labor camps in the barren northern hemisphere.

==Delta Pavonis IV==
'''Delta Pavonis IV''' is a planet where the inhabitants are anthropomorphic [[cat]]s and anthropomorphic [[dog]]s. It was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "The Big Broadcast of 2006."

Versions of this planet are known to exist in many dimensions within the multiverse, and it frequently becomes involved in the conflicts of the Transformers. Perhaps too frequently. Whenever something (or someone) leaves, escapes, or is otherwise ejected from [[Cybertron]], there's a disproportionate chance it will eventually wind up on Earth.

In some universes, Earth becomes the post-apocalyptic planet [[#Gaea|Gaea]]. In other universes, Earth is the planet that formed around [[Unicron]] as seen in ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.

==Edaps==
'''Edaps''' is a planet that supports mechanized life.

'''Ganzvort''' is a planet. All that is known about it is that it has a region called New Jersey.

==Ghennix==
'''Ghennix''' is a planet. It was featured in Marvel Comics where it was devoured by Unicron.

==Gigantion==
'''Gigantion''', or '''Giant Planet''', is a fictional planet home to giant [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] in the animated television program ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]''. It is referred to as '''Gigalonia''' in ''Transformers: Galaxy Force'', the Japanese version of the show. Much like how Velocitron is referred to as both "Velocitron" and "Speed Planet", Gigantion has a similar dual name. Its actual name was revealed in the episode "Balance".

Gigantion is home to one of the four Cyber Planet Keys and is one of the four ancient Transformer colonies. The titanic Transformers of Gigantion are large and powerful where their size are compared the combined forms of the known Combiners on both the Autobots' side and the Decepticons' side. The Gigantion Transformers are fortunately not much given to violence and warfare. Most are gentle and peaceful, desiring only to hone their skills and build ever grander structures. They work closely with the small Mini-Con Transformers, who can tackle the delicate tasks too refined for the heavy manipulators of their bulk comrades.

Once part of a star system within the [[Milky Way galaxy]], the planet fell into a spatial rift and was transported to a distant universe. The only Transformers to escape this fate were a quartet of Mini-Cons consisting of Jolt, Six-Speed, Reverb, and Safeguard. Vector Prime eventually discovered and saved them, and they became the Mini-Con Recon Team. Each Transformer on Giant Planet has a Mini-Con partner. The larger Transformers all become construction vehicles with the Mini-Cons integrated into both modes. Gigantion's [[de facto]] leader is [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]. The Transformers from this world have accents that sound Scottish or Irish.

The Giant Transformers have a habit of building giant cities and abandoning them, with older cities (the oldest of which are buried deep within the planet's crust) forbidden by planetary law by erasing their data so no one could come back. The planet was once the target of an attack from the mysterious Planet X, its inhabitants having eradicated most every other civilization in their universe and seeking to subjugate Gigantion's populace as their next conquest. Gigantion's people, however, retaliated, with its inhabitants modifying themselves including their planet with help from the Cyber Planet Key into becoming large enough to combat the invasion.

This eventually led Planet X's inhabitants to use their planet-busting weapon in a last-ditch effort to win the war, but the weapon overloaded and destroyed Planet X. Horrified and saddened by their part in the extinction of an entire race, Gigantion's inhabitants remodeled themselves into construction vehicles and took up their custom of building and then abandoning cities, perhaps as a form of self-punishment, focusing their energies solely on creation, not destruction. The Giant Transformers built cities underground and used holographic images of the sky on the top to make things nice. They started at the very center where they left the greenery. They have many mottoes like "Safety First" and "Always look forward, never back". Gigantion is mentioned in the first chapter of ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]''.

Known inhabitants of Gigantion include:

* '''[[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]''' - The acting leader of Gigantion. He transforms into an excavator.
* '''Quickmix''' - The right-hand mech of Metroplex. He transforms into a cement mixer truck.
* '''Menasor''' - An inhabitant of Gigantion who is displeased with the planet's laws. Menasor temporarily sided with the Decepticons. He transforms into an excavation machine.
* '''Drill Bit''' - The Mini-Con partner of Metroplex. He transforms into a twin drill machine.
* '''Stripmine''' - The Mini-Con partner of Quickmix. He transforms into a treaded vehicle with a cannon on top.
* '''Heavy Load''' - The Mini-Con partner of Menasor. He transforms into a dump truck.
* '''Overcast''' - The leader of the Gigantion Mini-Con Team. He transforms into a military cargo plane.
* '''Longarm''' - Member of the Gigantion Mini-Con Team. He transforms into a double-crane truck.
* '''Deepdive''' - Member of the Gigantion Mini-Con Team. He transforms into a submarine.
* '''Repeater''' - Member of the Steel Reinforcement Team. He transforms into a Gepart Anti-Aircraft Truck.
* '''Rock Krusher''' - Member of the Steel Reinforcement Team. He transforms into a tunneling machine.
* '''Saw Boss''' - Member of the Steel Reinforcement Team. He transforms into a bucket-wheeled excavator.
* '''Unnamed crane''' -
* '''Unnamed dump truck''' -

==Goo==
'''Goo''' is the name of many garbage planets in the original Transformers television series, debuting in the season 3 miniseries ''The Five Faces of Darkness''. Goo is filled with [[Waste|garbage]] and belongs to the [[Junkions]], and takes its name from a powerful adhesive that clings to anything unless disabled. After the [[Quintessons]] blew up Quintessa in an attempt to destroy the [[Autobot]]s, the Autobots were set adrift in space until they landed on Goo. The Autobots were attacked by a giant garbage truck that killed [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]] before [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]] could disable it. Later the Quintessons found out that the Autobots were alive on Goo. They made an alliance with the [[Decepticon]]s, who were without their leader, [[Galvatron]], and attacked the Autobots on Goo. When Galvatron returned, he was furious that the Decepticons had abandoned him. He attacked the Decepticons and Quintessons with an army of Sweeps, before being placated by Quintesson manipulation. As the Autobots fled, Galvatron destroyed the planet of Goo. Later, the Junkions were able to repair and resuscitate Springer. Another Goo planet was featured in the episode "Chaos," where the Autobots discovered that the Decepticons had come into possession of crystals produced by the monstrous Chaos that could pierce any metal.

Home of one of four [[Cyber Planet Key]]s (which exists in the form of a statue called the Beast Totem) and ancient Transformer colonies sent to reacquire them. The Beast Totem is in a temple where there are different wall carvings of Earth's animal life. All of Jungle Planet's inhabitants have animal alternate forms. Jungle Planet is a lush, green planet that contains dangerous volcanic activity, dangerous seismic activity, [[Thunderstorm|lightning storms]], and monstrous sentient plant. The Jungle Planet Transformers took animal alternate modes.

For a time, the Jungle Planet Transformers were leaderless leaving their world torn by violence and poverty. Many were taken under the tutelage under [[Zen]]-master [[Backstop (Transformers)|Backstop]] in the way of non-violence and self-defense. Eventually, [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], a student of Backstop, grew impatient with his people's suffering and forced a rebellion against those taking advantage of the chaos, strong-arming his way into leadership position in a series of battles to determine who would be strong enough to become leader. Corrupted by his new-found power and position, Scourge forced a "peace through tyranny" campaign, bringing his people the peace and prosperity he promised them, but only through a dictatorship ruled by the credo of "might makes right." However, Scourge couldn't totally rid himself of his old master's teachings and he enforced a strict series of laws regulating disputes being settled only through formal duels of strength with sabotage and especially unjustified death of a defeated foe as the planet's highest offense.

Overhaul was sent to acquire the Cyber Planet Key here while being told not to interact with its inhabitants. This ended up being the opposite when Overhaul was rescued from a seismic activity by Backstop. While protecting Snarl from Scourge and Megatron, Overhaul was transformed into Leobreaker as a result of a combination of tapping into the power of Jungle Planet's Cyber Planet Key and scanning a wall-carving of a [[lion]]. Eventually, Leobreaker, Backstop, and Snarl convinced [[Optimus Prime]] to rethink his credo of non-interaction with local customs in order to acquire the Key.

The ''Hyperborea'' ship would later carry the people of Jungle Planet to safety (along with another ship, [[Ogygia]]), after the planet was consumed by the Black Hole. However, when the Black Hole was destroyed, the planet was restored. When the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Jungle Planet back into its orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The Jungle Planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. The combined strength of Scourge, the Autobots, the former Decepticons (Dark Crumplezone, Ransack, Thunderblast, and Thundercracker), and their allies from the various planets were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.

Known inhabitants of Jungle Planet include:

* '''[[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]''' - The [[dictator]] of Jungle Planet, a former student of Backstop, and an old friend of Snarl. He transforms into a quadrupedal [[dragon]].
* '''Snarl''' - A student of Backstop and an old friend of Scourge. He transforms into a [[gray wolf]].
* '''Backstop''' - A wise [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] on Jungle Planet and a Zen-master of Scourge, Snarl, and Undermine. He transforms into a [[black rhinoceros]].
* '''Undermine''' - An enforcer of Scourge and the brother of Repugnus. He transforms into a [[Spinosaurus]].
* '''Brimstone''' - An enforcer of Scourge. He transforms into a [[Pteranodon]].
* '''Wreckloose''' - An enforcer of Scourge who only appeared in the toyline. He transforms into a [[Komodo dragon]].
* '''Repugnus''' - An inhabitant of a swamp near the Steel Shard Mountains and the brother of Undermine. Unlike Undermine, Repugnus doesn't agree with Scourge's methods. He transforms into a [[Spinosaurus]].
* '''Shrapnel''' - He was referenced on Undermine's Cyber Key bio.

Also on Jungle Planet are generic Transformers that each resemble a different animal such as a [[Brontosaurus]], an [[owl]], a [[lobster]], a [[deer]], a [[giraffe]], and a tropical bird.

==Junkion==
'''Junkion''', also known as '''the Planet of Junk''' is the home planet of the Junkions, a group of Transformers who transform into motorcycles. The planet and the Junkions first appeared in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. It is not really a planet in the normal sense of the word, but rather, a landfill in space that has accumulated enough mass to be held together by gravity. Depending on the storyline, it has been depicted as either a traditional spherical planet or as an elongated slab. In the original movie art and storyboards, the Planet of Junk was intended to be a spherical planet, with several rounded slabs seeming to rise off of its surface. In the end, only the "northernmost" rounded section of the planetoid was retained on film. In the third volume of the Devil's due comics the android [[Serpentor]] downloaded information on the history of [[Cybertron]] from [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]. Mentioned among that information was the [[Quintessons]], [[Alpha Trion]], [[Megatron]] and Soundwave, the planet of Junk, a warrior named [[Optimus Primal]] and the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]]. In ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'', the Autobots aboard the Ark come upon the planet Junkion where they meet [[Wreck-Gar]] and the other Junkions. It is later discovered that Junkion is made up of the wreckage of various ships drawn together by the gravity of the [[Requiem Blaster]], and subsequently ripped apart when the blaster is stolen by the Decepticons.

Known inhabitants of Junkion are:

* '''[[Wreck-Gar]]''' - Leader of the Junkions in most continuities, Wreck-Gar is a curious robot with a mustache and a beard. In the Generation 1 continuity, he–like most Junkions–turns into a motorcycle and is incredibly resilient, able to quickly put himself back together after being damaged. He and all the Junkions learned how to speak English from human television broadcasts received across space, and as such when they talk they typically do in quotations from television, such as "Offer expires while you wait-operators are standing by." In ''Transformers: Exiles'', Wreck-Gar turns into a Cybertronian garbage truck and speaks by shouting, often necessary when operating near his planet's smelting furnaces. He forms an uneasy alliance with the Autobots when they arrived on the planet, but proves less accommodating when their conflict with Megatron rips the planet apart. He and several other Junkions are later captured by Thundertron and the Star Seekers, a band of pirates, and forced to build a space bridge into their vessel, the ''Tidal Wave.'' In ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'', Wreck-Gar is used to lure the Decepticons into a Star Seeker trap, but takes advantage of the confusion to escape and make his way back to Junkion.
* '''Junkyard''' - Junkyard is unlike most junkions, and usually speaks quite normally using just plain English, without referencing TV shows or media. He is a very skilled in business and is a very skilled technician. Direct combat is not his forte. Junkyard is also known as Junkheap.
* '''Scrapheap''' - Scrapheap is a rebellious junkion, whose average day is racing motorcycles in knock down rallies. Like most junkions he is usually quoting TV and media. He wants to start a career of his home planet, and will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
*  '''Nancy''' - Nancy is a Junkion who appears to be the consort of the Junkion leader, Wreck-Gar, and seems to have some sort of relationship with a him as well. Nancy just like all Junkions can be blasted to pieces without taking any noticeable permanent damage, and is capable of repairing herself within seconds. Nancy is the only known female junkion, and the only transformer with a human name.
* '''Pinion''' - A Junkion tasked with loaded junk into a furnace for recycling. He was later revealed to be one of the components of [[Nexus Prime (Transformers)|Nexus Prime]].
* '''Axer''' - Not a true Junkion, but rather a Decepticon bounty hunter stranded on the artificial planet by an accident with a wrecked ship. Axer professed loyalty to Megatron, but was reluctant to share all his information with his supposed leader. He was later captured by the Star Seekers near the end of ''Exiles'', but helped Wreck-Gar escape in order to effect his own return to the Decepticons in ''Retribution.'' Unfortunately, Megatron had little use for the double-agent, and turned him over to Soundwave for torture.
* '''Shearbolt''' - A Junkion who was found murdered by the Autobots after being impersonated by Makeshift, the Decepticon Shifter.
* '''Detritus''' - A close advisor to Wreck-Gar.
* '''Cannonspring''' - One of Nexus Prime's components, whose ship ended up on Junkion after a space bridge accident. Apparently killed, he was revived in the close proximity of Pinion, Chaindrive, Clocker, and Mainspring, and the five of them reunited into their true form.

==Jörmungandr==
'''Jörmungandr''' is a [[Snake|serpent]]-shaped planet. It was featured in the ''Beast Wars Neo'' manga where it was Cohrada's homeworld.

==Kaiba-5==
'''Kaiba-5''' is a planet that was referenced in ''[[Transformers: The Game]]''.

==Klo==
'''Klo''' appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]] ''[[Transformers (comics)|Transformers]]'' comic book series, and is notable for being the location of the final battle of both the U.S. and UK versions of the series. Klo was introduced in issue #80 in the U.S. version,&lt;ref name="TFArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfarchive.com/comics/marvel/?s=us_71_80#80|title=TFArchive - Transformers Comics - Marvel Comics Guide|work=tfarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #331 in the UK version.&lt;ref name="TFArchive"/&gt; Klo is a beautiful, peaceful planet, rich in natural resources and inhabited by benign, harmless creatures called Klozians. The planet was invaded by [[Decepticon]]s under [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]]'s leadership, after the [[Transformers]] had won the war against [[Unicron]]. Following Unicron's death, [[Cybertron]] seemed to be in danger of being destroyed, so the Decepticons fled the planet in search of new worlds to conquer. They selected Klo, where they started mercilessly slaughtering the native Klozians. The [[Autobot]]s tracked the Decepticons to Klo and attempted to rescue the Klozians, but weak leadership from [[Grimlock]] led to heavy casualties by the Autobots and their forces were nearly wiped out. Finally, a newly resurrected [[Optimus Prime]] and the Last Autobot arrived on Klo, and while Optimus Prime fought against Bludgeon, the Last Autobot resurrected the dead Autobots. Facing invincible opposition, Bludgeon and his Decepticons retreated back into space and Optimus Prime and his Autobots stayed to help the Klozians rebuild their planet.

==Lanarq==
'''Lanarq''' is a robotic planet who waged a centuries-long war with Xetaxxis.

==Lithone==
'''Lithone''' was a planet populated by intelligent Transformer-like machine life. It was destroyed by [[Unicron]] in the Earth year 2005. The last known survivor of the planet, Kranix, was sentenced to death and executed by the [[Quintesson]]s after being found "innocent" of an unspecified crime (It is rumored that the [[Quintesson]]s often judge lifeforms with the crime of "stealing" Cybertron from them 12 million years prior, as seen in the Five Faces of Darkness miniseries, but Kranix was from Lithone, so the "jury reach a verdict" of innocent—yet Kup and Hot Rod, of Cybertron, were found innocent in the film as well).

In the script and in the Marvel Comics ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' adaptation, the Lithonians could transform into [[starship|spaceships]]. Lithone has also been referenced as "Glithos" or "Glinthos" due to the unclear articulation of its last surviving native, Kranix, before his execution.

==Lucifer==
'''Lucifer''' is a planet that is under the control of the Decepticons.

==LV-117==
'''LV-117''' is a planet in an unknown part of space that contains dangerous robot-eating animals.

==Mumu-Obscura==
'''Mumu-Obscura''' was a militarily contested and strategically significant world in the Eigerson-48 star system, until a group of warriors called the Reapers exterminated its population and poisoned its resources. It was featured in IDW Comics.

==Nebulos==
'''Nebulos''', sometimes known as '''Nebulon''', is a [[planet]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Transformers universes]].

Nebulos is a somewhat [[Earth]]-like planet far away from both Earth and [[Cybertron]], and is the home to a [[human]]oid race known as the Nebulans. The planet and its inhabitants were first introduced as the back story for [[Hasbro]]'s new [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] and [[Targetmaster]] toys, later expanded by the [[Powermaster (Transformers)|Powermaster]] toys. These toys are [[robot]]s that transform into [[vehicle]]s or [[animal]]s, and include Nebulan sidekicks that transform into the robot's head, into a [[weapon]], or into the vehicle's [[engine]]. The toys themselves never expanded on Nebulon or its inhabitants, but both the TV series (in its fourth and final season) and the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Transformers (comics)|comic book]] did, with drastically different, mutually inconsistent versions. In the TV series, the Nebulons were shown to be green-skinned. The planet Nebulos does not exist in the Japanese continuation of the franchise. Thus, with no Nebulos and no Nebulons, a different origin was given for the Headmaster and Targetmaster Transformers.

In the Marvel comic book, Fortress Maximus had grown weary of the [[civil war]] on Cybertron, and led a group of Autobots in search of a new planet where they could live in peace. They settled on Nebulos, but the Decepticons followed them. The comic book version of Nebulos is an idyllic, peaceful world where [[war]] has long since been discontinued and all weapons have been locked away. It is governed by a council of peers. The arrival of the Transformers scared the Nebulans, and they were forced to hold an emergency council meeting to deal with these strange new creatures. The Autobots wanted to live in peace with the Nebulans, but the Decepticons wanted to conquer them and kill the Autobots, so the Autobot-Decepticon civil war restarted on Nebulon. Both sides allied themselves with Nebulans, the Autobots generally with common people who had become familiar with them and did not see them as a threat, and the Decepticons generally with [[criminal]]s or corrupt [[politician]]s. The Nebulans, fearing the Transformers' civil war would plunge their own world back into war, finally banished the Transformers and their Nebulan sidekicks back into space, where they finally arrived on Earth.

In the TV series, the Transformers arrived on Nebulos in the three-part episode ''The Rebirth'', which were the only episodes of the fourth season, and the last episode ever produced in the United States. The [[Autobot]]s' spaceship was plunged to Nebulos accidentally by a gigantic [[Voltage spike|power surge]] from the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]], and the [[Decepticon]]s followed them. The TV show version of Nebulos is a hostile, dying world, where a group of eleven rulers known as "[[Hive (Transformers)|The Hive]]" controls the entire world from an underground city, abusing their power for their personal pleasure and oppressing the workers with various [[mechanics|mechanical]] devices controlled by their minds. Upon seeing the Autobots, the Nebulon workers mistook them for machines controlled by The Hive, and imprisoned them, later to destroy them. However, an attack by the Decepticons convinced the workers that the Autobots were good guys, and so they were released and allied themselves with the workers. The Decepticons did the same with the members of The Hive (after being co-erced).

In the Ladybird books continuity, the Nebulans were a race of small transforming robots. The Nebulans have appeared once more in [[IDW Publishing]]'s new continuity, in [[The Transformers: Stormbringer]]. Their planet was attacked by [[Thunderwing]] as part of an unholy pact to rejuvenate Cybertron. Despite the best efforts of the local Decepticon cell (led by [[Dreadwind]] and [[Darkwing]]) much of the planet was devastated. It also appeared chronologically earlier in the [[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]] issue on [[Ultra Magnus]], where [[Scorponok]] was already seen to be developing the [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] process. Nebulos was also mentioned by [[Swindle (Transformers)|Swindle]] in the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' episode, ''Decepticon Air''.

Nebulos is also featured in several stories of the "Ask [[Vector Prime]]" [[Facebook]] feature. Among these were the ''Armada'' storyline, in which the Nebulans Hi-Q and Arcana were responsible for Overload and Rollout being merged into a Headmaster being in order to save them both from debilitating medical conditions,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AskVectorPrime/posts/725582070907099&lt;/ref&gt; and a split reality in which the monstrous Zarak Maximus was born from the fusion of Mo Zarak with the remains of Fortress Maximus and Scorponok.

***'''Zarak''' - The evil leader of the Hive and creator of the Decepticon Headmaster giant [[Scorponok]].

==New Kaon==
'''New Kaon''' is a planet where all kinds of Decepticons that are fleeing from the Autobots take refuge. It was featured in the comic book tie-in to ''[[Transformers Animated]]''.

==Ocean Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Ocean Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly covered in an ocean.

==Paradise==
'''Paradise''' is a planet that is a natural wonderland of vast [[jungle]]s, roaring [[river]]s and [[waterfall]]s, smoking [[volcano]]es, and beasts of all shapes and sizes, all co-existing in harmony with the tribes of human-like beings living there. Although choosing to live a primitive existence dressing in robes made from animal skins and living in yurts, the people of the planet Paradise defy appearances by being intelligent, well-spoken creatures.

In the ''Transformers: Headmasters'' episode "Head Formation of Friendship," Paradise was targeted by Galvatron and the Decepticons who were on a quest to drain the energy from planets until they are driven away by the Autobots.

==Paradron==
'''Paradron''' is a peaceful, Energon-rich planet, accessible only through a vortex. Several Autobots fled there when the war against the Decepticons began and set up a colony there. The Autobot [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]] was one of the inhabitants of this planet. It was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Fight or Flee" when the Decepticons discovered this planet and enslaved the pacifist Autobots. After the Autobots rescued the pacifist Autobots, Rodimus Prime had Paradron destroyed with most of its inhabitants being transferred to Cybertron.

In [[Fun Publications]]' ''Shattered Glass'' storyline, Paradron was a prison planet where Optimus Prime exiled some of his more dangerous Autobot enemies, including Ultra Magnus and Wreck-Gar.

==Pequod==
'''Pequod''' is an oceanic planet that is home to large [[whale]]-like creatures called the Klud. It was featured in Marvel Comics.

==Pirate Planet==
'''Pirate Planet''' is a planet where [[space pirate]]s of all kinds store their loot.

==Plains Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Plains Planet''' (also called '''Grass Planet''') was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly filled with grasslands.

==Planet Q==
'''Planet Q''' is a desert planet that was featured in ''[[Transformers: Energon]]''. It was home to Alpha Q, Scorponok, and the Terrorcons, and was consumed by Unicron prior to the start of the series. Alpha Q's desire to restore his home planet using Unicron's power served as his primary motivation throughout ''Energon'', and was also the reason for Rodimus' willingness to work with him.

==Planet X==
'''Planet X''' is the name of two different planets in the ''Transformers Universe, the first of which was seen in ''[[Transformers: Victory]]''.

The Planet X featured in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' was first seen in a recording found by the human Lori and the Velocitronian leader, Override, after the latter's battle with [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] on Giant Planet. It was shown to be a highly advanced world like Cybertron, purple in color, with two golden rings around it forming an X pattern. Later, it would be revealed that Planet X was the dominant force in the alternate universe that Giant Planet had been drawn into. It was capable of non-orbital space travel and annihilating less advanced civilizations it came across. This, however, caused life in its universe to 'die' and, in an attempt to rectify the problem, its denizens sought out another life-rich planet to subjugate. The planet they found, Giant Planet, did not take kindly to being invaded, and its inhabitants reformatted themselves into larger forms with help of the Cyber Planet Key in order to combat the threat of the off-worlders.

Left with few options and little hope of victory, the inhabitants of Planet X powered up their ultimate weapon: a [[Death Star]]-like planetary cannon, in order to wipe out the transformers on Giant Planet. Unfortunately, the cannon was too powerful for them to control and the result destroyed their world. The survivors, including [[Soundwave (Transformers)#Transformers: Cybertron|Soundwave]] and [[Sideways (Transformers)#Transformers: Cybertron|Sideways]], were scattered all across their universe, and were eventually thrown into the Transformers' proper universe.  Believing Giant Planet to be at fault for their home planet's destruction, the various Transformers plotted revenge against them. In addition, the Giant Planet Transformers also felt at least partially responsible for Planet X's annihilation. This created their custom of building cities and then abandoning them, which became a perpetual, planet-wide act of penance. Eventually, Sideways and Soundwave managed to return to Giant Planet, and sought the [[Cyber Planet Keys]] in order to exact their revenge.

"Ask [[Vector Prime]]" would later feature Planet X in additional storylines, often involving its origin. In one reality, it was the broken body of Unicron from ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', shunted into another dimension by the energies of the Matrix of Leadership. Arriving on the edge of the Earth solar system of that reality, Unicron set out to repair himself but was hindered by the actions of Megatron utilizing a Star Harvester. As in the ''Energon'' series, Unicron revived many of the Transformers he had previously consumed in an effort to expedite his recovery, and the new race renamed their home Planet X. They then traveled to the world of the ''Victory'' series and attacked it, but the efforts of the Autobots using Zone energy split the planet into two: the beautiful world seen in ''Victory'' and one virtually identical to the ''Cybertron'' version, which was later destroyed by the inhabitants of an alternate Gigantion known as Gigalonia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AskVectorPrime/posts/673768952755078&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions included a ''Cybertron'' Planet X that was once part of the Liege Maximo's Cybertronian Empire, and another in which Planet X was once the home of a smaller scale Unicron who used a cyber key to unite himself with his former homeworld and domain.

==Pz-zazz==
'''Pz-zazz''' is a highly technological planet. Pz-zazz was hopelessly corrupted by [[crime]] until an ancient bird icon was returned to its place and purified the planet.

==Quintessa==
'''Quintessa''' is the home planet of the infamous [[Quintesson]]s as seen in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. Unlike most other planets, Quintessa was shown having a more [[spiral]]-like shape than a simple sphere. The Quintessons eventually destroyed their own home planet in the Generation 1 continuity. In the ''Prime'' continuity, Quintessa is the capital of the so-called "Quintesson Co-Prosperity Sphere," and its location is a closely guarded secret.

==Regalis V==
'''Regalis V''' is a planet filled with thick [[jungle]]s and filled with ambulatory [[plant]]s. It was featured in the ''[[Beast Machines]]'' episode "Home Soil" as the planet where the Cybertronian crew that Botanica was a part of landed.

==Thrull==
'''Thrull''' is the planet that Galavatron ended up on after being thrown out of Unicron as seen in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "The Five Faces of Darkness" Pt. 1. An inhospitable world consisting of plasma lava and rock, its environment led to the degradation of Galvatron's logic circuits, making him even more unstable and dangerous than he had been previously. Upon being revived and escaping the planet, Galvatron fired an energy blast that caused Thrull to explode.

==Torkulon==
'''Torkulon''' is a planet whose main source of commerce is [[psychotherapy]]. [[Galvatron]] was brought there for treatment in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Webworld", following his increasingly erratic behavior following the event of ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. The entire planet was a living computer whose circuitry was woven by arachnid-like beings known as the Alya, and manipulated by a furry humanoid race of size comparable to the Transformers themselves. Despite multiple methods used, the Torkulon were unable to cure Galvatron, who madness infected the planet and caused it to go out of control. Galvatron himself then destroyed the Torkulon computer core, leaving the planet devastated, though with the possibility of rebuilding.

==Twin Star==
'''Twin Star''' is a group of two diametrically opposed planets Sperity and Tourin. It was featured in ''[[Transformers: Headmasters]]''.

* '''Sperity''' is rich in energy and covered in glistening cities that are inhabited by small robots.
* '''Tourin''' is a barren and lifeless planet with rocky deserts on its surface.

==Unicron==
{{Main|Unicron}}
'''Unicron''' is a fictional character from the [[Transformers universes|''Transformers'' universe]] and [[Transformers (toyline)|toyline]]. Created by [[Floro Dery]], he was introduced in the 1986 animated film ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A brief history of the Transformers |work=Malaysia Star |date= |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2004/11/9/features/20041108160036&amp;sec=features |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622055026/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2004%2F11%2F9%2Ffeatures%2F20041108160036&amp;sec=features |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reprised that role in Atari's 2003 [[Transformers (2003 video game)|Transformers video game]]. Unicron is a prodigiously large robot whose scale reaches planetary proportions, and he is also able to transform into a mechanical [[planet]]. Unicron's origin has expanded over the years from simply being a large robot to being a God of chaos who devours realities. He often employs the help of [[Decepticons]] in his work. In some stories, he is considered part of the origin of the Decepticon forces.

==Varas Centralus==
'''Varas Centralus''' is a planet situated in the Kol star system. It is featured in IDW Comics.

==Vehicon==
:''For the Transformers group, see [[Vehicon]]''.

'''Vehicon''' is a planet where Reverse Convoy is the leader of the Autobots.

==Velocitron==
'''Velocitron''' (known as '''Speedia''' in ''Galaxy Force'' and '''Speed Planet''' in promotional materials) is a [[fiction]]al planet featured in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' and is the location of one of four ancient Transformer colonies that lost contact with the home world of [[Cybertron]] long ago, along with [[Earth (Transformers)|Earth]], Jungle Planet, and Gigantion. Each of these colonies possess a [[Cyber Planet Key]], containing a fragment of the power of [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]]. The name Velocitron is used infrequently. The planet is more commonly referred to as "the Speed Planet" or simply "Speed Planet." The planet's full, formal name appears to be "Velocitron, the Speed Planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panelsonpages.com/?p=5401|title=Rolling Out for 25 Years – Cybertron|work=Panels on Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variable [[desert]] planet, it was [[terraformed]] into a global race track with the pursuit of perfect speed and performance the primary motivating force in its society and culture. Disputes are settled in formal races with the winner claiming victory over the dispute as well. Automated repair machines maintain the race courses, which include tracks featuring various environments and obstacles as well as simpler straightforward courses. Characteristics of Velocitron's inhabitants include translucent wheels of unknown material, and double-barrelled long-range weaponry.

The planet's leader is [[Override (Transformers)|Override]] as she is the fastest of all Velocitronian Transformers with no equal planetside. She holds semi-annual planetwide races to determine the next leader with the planet's Cyber Planet Key (which exists in the form of a trophy called the Planet Cup) awarded to the winner. The location of Velocitron was first re-discovered by [[Megatron]] using the map he had stolen from [[Vector Prime]]. Vector Prime himself later located the planet as well, by studying a copy of the Atlantis Pattern found at a museum in Mexico.

[[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] felt right at home on the planet and participated in the planet-wide race alongside a few of his [[Autobot]] comrades, despite reservations by [[Optimus Prime]] who advised them not to interact with any of the inhabitants. Despite quarreling with his companion [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]], Hot Shot managed to overcome the challenges of Speed Planet and won the great race. In addition to gaining Override's friendship, the Autobots also learned a valuable lesson about interacting with the inhabitants of the different planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crushable.com/entertainment/transformers-cybertron-dvd-review/|title="Transformers Cybertron": DVD review|work=Crushable}}&lt;/ref&gt; The starship that carried the Cyber Planet Key to this world was named ''[[Ogygia]]''.

In the final episode of ''Transformers: Cybertron'' the "''Speedia 500''" race is held to determine the leader of Velocitron, which Hot Shot wins. [[Dirt Boss]] comes in second, Ransack in third, Dark Crumplezone in fourth, Brakedown in fifth, and Clocker in sixth. Override didn't even compete, as she joins the new Space Bridge project led by Optimus Prime. The name of the race is a reference to the Japanese name of the planet, which is Speedia.

Velocitron is one of the planets mentioned in the first chapter of ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]'' in which many Cybertronians are populated. The sequel novel ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'' features Optimus Prime and the other Autobots aboard the ''Ark'' coming to Velocitron where they meet Blurr and Override. Velocitronians are obsessed with speed, so that their lives are centered around going faster or helping others race. The Autobots soon discover a war brewing on Velocitron between Override and Ransack, the former sympathizing with the Autobots while the latter finds Decepticon philosophies more appealing. The two sides soon see conflict, and after the Ark's departure are visited not only by Megatron and the Decepticons but also by a group of pirates known as the Star Seekers under Thundertron. Velocitron in this continuity is also threatened by the instability of its sun, which is threatening to go supernova.

''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' included a mention of Velocitron by that series' version of Blurr, who notes that it consists of "all roads, no speed limits."

Known inhabitants of Velocitron are:

* '''Override''' - A female Transformer and the leader of Velocitron. In ''Cybertron'' Override refuses to turn over the Cyber Planet Key to anyone unless they can win the planet's biggest race. After the Autobots succeed, she joins their cause throughout the rest of the series. In ''Exiles'', she and Ransack are the rival rulers of the planet and their disputes turn into armed conflict shortly after the arrival of the Autobots. Despite this, she fights bravely against Ransack's forces, an invading crew of pirates, and even the arrival of the Decepticons.
* '''Brakedown''' - The oldest living inhabitant of Velocitron.
* '''Clocker''' - A young inhabitant of Velocitron that is often seen with Brakedown in ''Cybertron''. In ''Exiles'', he quickly becomes attached to the Autobots and departs Velocitron with them along with Mainspring. He was later revealed to be one of the five components of [[Nexus Prime (Transformers)|Nexus Prime]].
* '''Crumplezone''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who was recruited by Megatron.
* '''Dirt Boss''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who temporarily sided with the Decepticons.
* '''Ransack''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who was recruited by Megatron in ''Cybertron.'' In the novel ''Exiles'', he is one of two leaders of Velocitron and quickly expresses Decepticon sympathies. When Megatron arrives he initially believes that the two of them will be equals, but Megatron quickly makes it clear that he is in command.
* '''Skyfall''' -
* '''Swerve''' -
* '''Mainspring''' - A Velocitronian mechanic loyal to Override and part of Blurr's pit crew. He later left Velocitron with the Ark and was subsequently revealed to be one of Nexus Prime's components.
* '''Hightail''' - One of Ransack's loyalists in ''Exiles'', Hightail believes that he previously went by another name but forgot it after long ages.
* '''Armco''' - A Velocitronian welder with no strong allegiance to either Ransack or Override. He was later contacted by the Autobot Prowl and asked to provide information in the event that Megatron's agent-not known at that time to be the Shifter Makeshitft-gave specifics on when Megatron would be arriving on the planet.
* '''Backfire''' - Another of Ransack's flunkies, Backfire warmed to the Decepticon cause due to feeling oppressed by Velocitron's social order, where only the fastest competitors would receive sponsorship. He found work as a mechanic, but found it degrading since he received only a fraction of the glory he felt he deserved for making the victories of others possible. As such, he hoped that under Megatron's regime he would be treated as he deserved. His enthusiasm prompted Makeshift, Megatron's spy aboard the Ark, to make him Megatron's contact amongst Ransack's forces.
* '''Blueshift''' - One of Override's engineers in ''Exiles.''
* '''[[Blurr]]''' - A racer native to Velocitron only in the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' continuity. One of Velocitron's fastest racers-not to mention talkers-he helps the Autobots by providing them with one of the fragments of the Blades of Time, previously built into the Speedia Trophy. When hostilities break out on Velocitron, he becomes a firm supporter of Override.
* '''Syncol''' - A Velocitronian mechanic who had the misfortune of mistaking [[Starscream]] for [[Silverbolt]] when the former arrived on Velocitron. Fortunately, after being questioned by the Seeker and Megatron, he was allowed to go free.

==Vs'Qs==
'''Vs'Qs''' is actually a moon, not a planet. Vs'Qs is a barren, desolate place, devoid of any natural life. Vs'Qs was the place where the body of [[Optimus Prime]] happened to land on, having been blasted off into space randomly after his death. The [[Matrix of Leadership]] contained within the body was found during the [[Matrix Quest]].

==Wednesday==
'''Wednesday''' is an [[ocean]] planet that is the home of Princess Rage, a Transformer who can turn into a [[jellyfish]]. It was featured in the ''Beast Wars Neo'' manga.

==Xeptos==
'''Xeptos''' is a planet in the Microverse.

==Xetaxxis==
'''Xetaxxis''' is a robotic planet that waged a centuries-long war with Lanark.

==Yst==
'''Yst''' is an Earth-like planet that existed 700 lightyears away from the Unicron Singularity.

==Zamojin==
'''Zamojin''' is a planet sealed by a quadrant lock by the Quintessons and was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "The Face of Nijika." It is an advanced samurai culture with telepathic power generated by starlight.

'''Maverick''' was an American entertainment company founded in 1992 by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Frederick DeMann]], and Veronica "Ronnie" Dashev, and formerly owned and operated by [[Warner Music Group]]. It included a recording company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), book publishing, music publishing, a Latin record division (Maverick Musica), and a television production company. The first releases for the company were Madonna's 1992 coffee table publication ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'' and her studio album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'', which were released simultaneously to great controversy.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

DeMann was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 1998. [[Guy Oseary]] increased his stake in the company and took control as Chairman and CEO. Madonna and Dashev left in 2004 after a lawsuit between Maverick and Warner Music Group.

==History==
Maverick Records was launched in April 1992 as a unit of the Maverick entertainment company. It was a joint venture between [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Frederick DeMann]], Veronica "Ronnie" Dashev and [[Time Warner]],&lt;ref name="NYT - $60 million"&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Holden |authorlink=Stephen Holden|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/20/arts/madonna-makes-a-60-million-deal.html |work=[[The New York Times]]| title=Madonna Makes a $60&amp;nbsp;Million Deal| accessdate=May 27, 2008|date=April 20, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its name was combined from the names of three of the founders; '''Ma'''donna, '''Ve'''ronica and Frede'''rick'''. The company had divisions for recording, music publishing, television, film, merchandising and book publishing. The venture was part of a $60 million recording and business deal between Madonna and [[Time Warner]] . It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equalled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with [[Sony]].{{r|NYT - $60 million}}

At the time of its launch. the company was bi-coastal; having offices in both [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]. The record company division of Maverick also consisted of sub-label, Maverick Musica (a Miami, Florida-based satellite label focusing on Latin-American music) and Maverick Music Publishing. The first releases for the company were Madonna's 1992 coffee table publication, ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'' and her studio album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' which were released simultaneously to great controversy.&lt;ref name="SEX and Erotica"&gt;{{cite news |first= Gregory |last= Kirschling| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,365681,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly| title=The Naked Launch| accessdate=May 27, 2008|date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial success==
[[File:Platinum records, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Juliens Auctions Preview 2011-03-08.jpg|thumb|Platinum record (''middle'') for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 greatest hits album, ''[[GHV2]]'', released by Maverick Records.]]
Maverick's first commercial success was with the [[Candlebox (album)|self-titled debut album]] by [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]-based [[grunge]] band [[Candlebox]]. Released in 1993, the album would be RIAA-certified quadruple platinum in the United States. The following year, the label signed Canadian musician [[Alanis Morissette]], whose third album (and Maverick debut) ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' was released in 1995, and would be eventually certified 16x platinum in the U.S. (with international sales of $33 million)–making it the best selling album in the label's history, and of the 1990s.

DeMann was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 1998, after which [[Guy Oseary]] increased his stake in the company and took control as chairman and CEO.

Throughout the 1990s to the middle 2000s, Maverick would also release albums by [[Erasure]], [[Michelle Branch]], [[Meshell Ndegeocello]], [[U.N.V.]], [[Dana Dane]], N-Phase, [[Dalvin DeGrate]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Cleopatra (band)|Cleopatra]], [[Tyler Hilton]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Deftones]], [http://www.smrcamp.com/ Summercamp], [[No Authority]] and [[William Orbit]]. "I'm happy with Maverick as a label," observed The Prodigy's [[Liam Howlett]]. "They respect their bands; even the ones who aren't selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Elliott|title=Their year: The Prodigy|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] #137|date=February 1998|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation and decline==
By the early 2000s, Maverick saw its commercial fortunes decline and business operations financially unravel.  In March 2004, the label and Madonna filed suit against Warner Music Group (and its former parent company, Time Warner), claiming that mismanagement of resources and poor [[Accountancy|bookkeeping]] had cost the company millions of dollars.  Warner filed a countersuit, alleging that Maverick had lost tens of millions of dollars on its own.{{r|labelsuit}}&lt;ref name=labelsuit2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3570563.stm |title=Madonna's label sues record giant |publisher=BBC |date=March 26, 2004|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3570563.stm|title=Entertainment - Madonna's label sues record giant|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2004, the dispute was resolved when Maverick shares owned by Madonna and Dashev were purchased&amp;nbsp;— which effectively exiled the two of them from the company, as it then became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music Group.  Then Maverick CEO [[Guy Oseary]], meanwhile, retained his position until WMG purchased his label shares in 2006.&lt;ref name=labelsuit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/madonna/30546|title=Madonna sells record company|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=June 9, 2008|date=August 26, 2007|first=Jason|last=Shawhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the band [[Lillix]], which at the time was signed to the label, claimed that the Maverick label no longer existed and that all the artists were now handled by Warner Bros. directly. In 2007 the record company folded.&lt;ref name=Hampp2014&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/6289026/u2-and-madonna-manager-guy-oseary-is-trying-to-reinvent-the-music-biz |title=U2 and Madonna Manager Guy Oseary Is Trying to Reinvent the Music Biz |last=Hampp |first=Andrew |date=October 17, 2014 |website=Billboard |access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the label's most successful artists, Alanis Morissette and Michelle Branch, left in the late 2000s. Branch left in 2007 after disbanding [[The Wreckers]], while Morissette left in 2009 after the release of ''[[Flavors of Entanglement]]''. Madonna's recording contract remained with [[Warner Bros. Records]] under a separate agreement until 2009.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2001, Maverick Picture Company was rebranded as simply Maverick Films and was solely managed by Madonna and [[Guy Oseary]], CEO of another Maverick division, Maverick Records. In 2004, Madonna and Dashev were bought out of Maverick after a lawsuit with Warner Music Group and they no longer have an interest in the company.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In August 2008, company head Mark Morgan and Oseary split with Oseary retaining the rights to the Maverick name while Morgan retain ownership of the company's projects and changing the name to [[Imprint Entertainment]].&lt;ref{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/maverick-films-splits-1117990252/|title=Maverick Films splits|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=August 8, 2008|work=Variety|access-date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Maverick Records brought teenage file-sharer, Whitney Harper, to court and won the case. Harper was ordered to pay $750 per song for the three dozen uploaded on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/court-rejects-teens-appeal-in-internet-music-case/|title=Court rejects teen's appeal in Internet music case|date=November 29, 2010|work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is known as ''Harper v. Maverick Recording Co.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loeb.com/articles-ipentertainmentcaselawupdates-20101208-harpervmaverickrecordingco|title=Harper v. Maverick Recording Co.|publisher=Loeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Maverick Records co-released [[Greyson Chance]]'s debut album ''[[Hold On 'til the Night]]'', but other than that the label has remained in dormancy.

The '''Mexican sex comedies film genre,''' generally known as '''Ficheras film''' or '''Sexicomedias''' is a [[Film genre|genre]] of [[sexploitation]] and [[Mexploitation]]{{CN|date=February 2016}} films of the [[Mexican cinema]] that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s. It is recognized as a collection of usually low quality films with [[Low-budget film|low budgets]]. Although the films had sexual tones and used [[double entendre]], they were not particularly explicit. The genre is possibly based on the [[Commedia sexy all'italiana|Italian erotic comedies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/ficheras.html 1976-1982: Los años de las "Ficheras"]&lt;/ref&gt; The popular term for it came from the film ''Las ficheras,'' produced and released in 1975, which described the experiences of many women who entertained men at nightclubs.

The settings and plots of these films tended to be simple. Though they enjoyed box-office success and were popular, they are now generally regarded as poor examples of Mexican cinema {{by whom?|date=December 2017}}; moreover, they frequently received classification as being unsuitable for minors.

Some of the films of this Mexican genre included ''El rey de las ficheras,'' ''La pulquería,'' ''Muñecas de medianoche,'' ''[[Bellas de noche]],'' and ''Entre ficheras anda el diablo.''

The best-known Mexican actors and actresses who were known to have participated in ficheras films were:
* [[Sasha Montenegro]]
* Angélica Chaín
* [[Andrés García]]
* [[Mauricio Garcés]]
* Lina Santos
* [[Lyn May]]
* [[Marcia Bell]]
* Leticia Perdigón
* Carmen Salinas
* Alfonso Zayas
* Jorge Rivero
* Alberto Rojas "El caballo"
* Rafael Inclán
* Roberto Ibañez
* Leopoldo García Peláez Benítez "Polo Polo"
* Antonio Raxel
* Raúl Padilla "El Choforo"
* Miguel M. Delgado
* Luis de Alba
* René Ruíz "Tun Tun"
* Pedro Weber "Chatanooga"
* César Bono
* Eduardo de la Peña "Lalo el Mimo"
* [[Rossy Mendoza]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6079">The '''Montreal International Games Summit''' (MIGS), also known as le Sommet International du jeu de Montréal (SIJM), is a conference on video games. The first edition was held in 2004 and usually takes place in November at le Palais des Congrès de Montréal.  The summit was founded in order to meet the needs of the rough 9000 video game workers in Quebec.  The mission of the summit is to expand the exposure of the video game community and industry in Quebec as well as develop the expertise of the Quebec video game industry.  MIGS is currently the leading professional gaming summit of the East Coast,&lt;ref&gt;http://mtldgtl.com/en/migs/&lt;/ref&gt; and is arguably the largest game development event in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2008/11/12/montreal-international-game-summit-to-open-to-the-public-for-the-first-time&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall aims of MIGS are to promote, train, network, and hire potential players in the gaming industry.  Professionals attending the summit partake in lectures and presentations largely oriented around how to better specific aspects of the industry, such as art and VFX, business, and design.&lt;ref&gt;http://mtldgtl.com/en/migs/about/&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, MIGS has partnered with many of the leading electronic and game development companies in Canada, including Ubisoft and Warner Bros. Games.  The Montreal International Gaming Summit is networked similarly to the Electronic Entertainment Expo, using the same application in order to facilitate interaction between industry players and their associates.  It was only in 2008, during the fifth summit, did MIGS become an event that was open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2008/11/12/montreal-international-game-summit-to-open-to-the-public-for-the-first-time&lt;/ref&gt;  2013 marked the tenth annual Montreal International Gaming Summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrifce.gouv.qc.ca/portail/_scripts/Actualites/ViewNew.asp?strIdSite=la&amp;NewID=13099&amp;lang=en{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
==Events==

===Business Lounge===
The Business Lounge is designed in order to establish collaboration and finalize ideas by key decision makers in the industry.  It is located away from the summit itself as only professional members of the industry may attend.&lt;ref&gt;http://mtldgtl.com/en/business-lounge-2/&lt;/ref&gt;  Most corporate figures that attend the summit also make appearances at the business lounge, as it is a hub for most corporate decisions at the summit.  Attendees at the lounge may also attend exclusive cocktail events, where they may interact with other corporate figures and keynotes speakers at the summit.

====Online Meeting Application====
The Online Meeting Application is an application that is utilized at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).  This application is used to book meetings with summit attendees.&lt;ref&gt;http://mtldgtl.com/en/business-lounge-2/&lt;/ref&gt;  The application was developed by Game Connection, and allows attendees to contact industry figures directly, manage scheduling, and promote themselves as players in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.e3expo.com/attendee/2165/e3-meeting-application-powered-by-game-connection/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expo Zone===

'''''Mother's Happiness''''' is a 1926 Chinese drama film directed by [[Shi Dongshan]] and written by [[Zhu Shouju]], starring [[Zhou Wenzhu]] as a devoted rural mother who reared 4 children by herself after her husband died from an accident. It is one of the earliest extant Chinese films, but a portion is still missing. Like most Chinese films from this period, it is a black-and-white [[silent film]] with both Chinese and English [[intertitle]]s.

The English title is ironic, because the mother in the story hardly enjoyed any happiness in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China on Screen: Cinema and Nation|last=Berry|first=Chris|last2=Farquhar|first2=Mary|isbn=0-231-13706-0|year=2006|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
After the birth of her children, a rural mother becomes so devoted to them that she completely neglects her ill-tempered husband. When her baby becomes ill, she even tries to commit suicide, fortunately the baby recovers. Her husband, who works for a wealthy man, is blamed and fired after the man's son squanders twenty thousand dollars. He sulkily returns home, beats up his naughty son, and accidentally drinks himself to death with the wrong type of alcohol. After his death, the mother works as a seamstress and manages to send all her children to a private school. At school, the children are bullied by a kid from a wealthy family, but the teacher never punishes him.

(Part missing)

Decades later, the children are all married. The eldest son has a crude wife who disrespects the mother. The second daughter-in-law is respectful but unhealthy. The eldest daughter lives in a wealthy household with servants, but she is completely unfilial. Even when she returns home for brief visits (just to impress the neighbors, as she says), she treats the entire family with contempt. Another daughter, who is widowed, also lives away from home.

Both sons set off for jobs in the city, and the mother is left behind with the second daughter-in-law. The eldest son wants to send money home but is stopped by his stern wife. He gives the money to his brother to send home, but the second son squanders all the money on a lascivious woman. With no income to pay the rent, the mother and the second daughter-in-law have to seek shelter with her eldest daughter. The daughter accepts them, but calls them servants in front of her friends. Her ill-tempered husband is disgusted by the mother's impoverished appearance and lashes out at her.

The second son loses his job as a result of persistent tardiness and poor performance. He tries to borrow money from his mistress but discovers that she has a new lover who happens to be his best friend. Meanwhile, the mother is driven away from her daughter's house and comes to the city to visit the brothers. Eventually she falls terminally ill, and all her children reunite before her deathbed. The mother tells the second son to kneel in front of his wife, and is pleased that he finally repents.

'''''Mountain''''' is a [[simulation game|simulation video game]] developed by [[David OReilly (artist)|David OReilly]] and published by [[Double Fine Productions]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in July 2014. The game is an [[idle game]] in which the only influence the player can have on the game is at the start of the game where the player is tasked to draw objects. The game is designed to be played in the background while the player uses other applications.

==Gameplay==
''Mountain'' is described by its creator [[David OReilly (artist)|David OReilly]] as  a "Mountain Simulator, Relax em’ up, Art Horror etc." game, featuring little interactivity from the player.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/07/you-are-mountain/374543/ | title = You Are Mountain | first = Ian | last = Bogost | date = July 17, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon starting the game, the player is asked to draw responses to a series of questions, described by OReilly as "more psychologically invasive than anything Facebook wants to know about you".&lt;ref name="latimes reveal"/&gt; The game uses that input to generate a model of a mountain, floating in space, surrounded by a small sphere of atmosphere. At this point, the game lacks significant interactivity; while the player can rotate the view around the mountain and zoom in and out, they cannot affect the mountain in any way. The game is set to be run in the background as the player does other activities on their computer.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

Over the course of the game, the mountain slowly rotates as accelerated time progresses through day and night cycles and through seasonal changes: the player will see snow form and melt on the mountain, and plants trees grow and wither out. Randomly, the mountain may be hit by everyday objects which then become embedded in the mountain indefinitely. The mountain periodically offers its thoughts to the player as the game progresses.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; After around fifty hours while the game has been running, the mountain meets its fate when it crashes into a passing giant star, ending the game, at which point the player can start the game over with a new mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://toucharcade.com/2014/07/09/spoiler-alert-i-just-beat-david-oreillys-mountain-and-got-it-on-video/ | title = Spoiler Alert: I Just Beat David O'Reilly's 'Mountain' and Got it On Video | first = Eli | last =  Hodapp | date = July 9, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Touch Arcade]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
David OReilly had developed a number of fictional video game sequences for the movie ''[[Her (film)|Her]]'' (2013). Following his involvement, OReilly had interest in creating a real video game, wanting "to explore in patterns and iterations of patterns".&lt;ref name="latimes reveal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-animator-from-her-makes-real-video-game-20140612-column.html| title = More invasive than Facebook: 'Mountain' from creator of games in 'Her' | first = Carolina | last =  Miranda | date = June 12, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the idea of simulating a mountain as "an iconic zen thing", and that the size of mountains dwarf that of the human experience;&lt;ref name="latimes reveal"/&gt; mountains further "defy objectification because they can't be owned or put in a museum".&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt; OReilly described ''Mountain'' as "visual silence", and that it is "about letting go of control" while one watches the simulation.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/220443/There_is_nothing_to_do_in_OReillys_Mountain__and_thats_a_good_thing.php | title = There is nothing to 'do' in OReilly's Mountain - and that's a good thing | first = Leigh | last= Alexander | date = July 8, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop the game, OReilly started learning the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity engine]] himself. To complete ''Mountain'', gained assistance from Damien Di Fede who did most of the game's coding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://motionographer.com/2014/07/15/david-oreilly-mountain/ | title = David O’Reilly: Mountain Q&amp;A | first = Justin | last = Cone | date = July 14, 2014 | accessdate =  April 3, 2017 | work = Motiongrapher }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OReilly had revealed the game during the Horizon video game showcase held at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] during the same week in June as the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]].&lt;ref name="latimes reveal"/&gt; The game was published by [[Double Fine Productions]] under their "Double Fine Presents" label aimed for small [[independent video game|indie games]].&lt;ref name="polygon release"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/1/5861910/double-fine-publishes-her-game-creators-mountain-simulator-mountain | title = Double Fine publishes 'Her' game creator's mountain simulator, Mountain | first = Alexa Rae | last = Correira | date = July 1, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was initially released on July 1, 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[iOS]] platforms;&lt;ref name="polygon release"/&gt; the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was delayed until August 19, 2014 due to the cost of getting the Unity plugin for Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/08/19/the-incredibly-bizarre-game-mountain-has-arrived-on-android/ | title = The Incredibly Bizarre Game MOUNTAIN Has Arrived On Android | first = Ryan | last = Whitwam | date = August 19, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Android Police]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; OReilly had initially visioned the game to run as a background application for personal computers, and thus had not spent a great deal of time optimizing the [[iOS]] version through the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity engine]]. However, within a week of its release, ''Mountain'' was one of the top-selling titles on various [[app store]] charts, prompting OReilly to develop more optimization for the iOS and pending Android versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-07-barely-interactive-mountain-simulator-nearly-tops-the-ios-charts | title = Barely interactive "mountain simulator" nearly tops the iOS charts | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = July 7, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The game was generally praised by reviewers as a novel concept for a game,&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verge"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5857458/mountain-game | title= Playing a mountain simulator is surprisingly emotional | first = Andrew | last = Webster | date = July 1, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work =[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-playing-her-animator-david-oreilly-mountain-video-game-20140705-column.html | title = Playing 'Her' animator David OReilly's hypnotic video game 'Mountain' | first = Carolina | last =  Miranda | date = July 7, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; though because of its limited interactivity, many players were discontent with the title, comparing it to a [[screensaver]] rather than a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/why-the-media-loves-mountain-but-steam-users-are-calling-it-a-screensaver/ | title = Why critics love Mountain, but Steam users are calling it "worthless" | first = Tyler | last = Wilde | date = August 20, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Kotzer of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' compared the game to the [[Tamagotchi]] toys, though lacking the need to constantly attend to the toys' demands and instead letting the player decide when to see how the mountain is progressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-video-game-lets-you-own-your-own-tamagotchi-mountain | title = This Video Game Let's You Own Your Own Tamagotchi Mountain Pet | first= Zack | last = Kotzer | date = July 7, 2014 |  accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others described the title as a passive ''[[Katamari]]'' game, watching how the mountain accumulates stuff over the course of the game.&lt;ref name="verge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/before-everything-there-was-just-a-mountain- | title = Before Everything, There Was Just A Mountain | first = Caty | last = McCarthy | date = March 28, 2017 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[US Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers found the title pretentious; Ben Kuchera of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the game may have been a joke by OReilly, and expressed he lacked the same type of wonder that other journalist had found for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/3/5868087/mountain-indie-game-joke-satire-self-loathing | title = Mountain could be a $1 joke, and I think I'm the butt | first=  Ben | last = Kuchera | date = July 3, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult prostitution==
Prostitution between adults is legal for women and men over 18 years of age if they register with municipal authorities and carry a health certificate. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119170.htm |title= 2008 Human Rights Report: Peru|accessdate=2007-11-29 |website= US Department of State |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brothels]] must be licensed.

==Child prostitution==
[[Child prostitution]] is illegal. Penalties for pimps and clients of underage prostitutes range from four to eight years in prison. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Child prostitution is common in the country, and especially in Peru’s isolated Amazonian mining communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alfonso-daniels/child-prostitution-boomin_b_1086278.html|title=Child Prostitution Booming in Peruvian Amazon|first=Alfonso Daniels Emergency Media Manager for Save the Children|last=International|date=14 November 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Amazonian department of [[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]] the illegal exploitation of [[gold]] has dramatically increased the recruitment and coercion of adolescents into prostitution through false employment offers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.peruviantimes.com/la-republica-expose-on-child-prostitution-in-peruvian-amazon-mining-towns/10555 |title= La Republica: Exposé on child prostitution in Peruvian Amazon mining towns|accessdate=2009-11-16 |website= Peruvian Times |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[poverty]] and [[Economic inequality|inequality]] are important causes of child prostitution, part of the problem is also a social attitude that views sex--including paid sex--between adult men and adolescent girls as normal.
Luis Gonzalez-Polar Zuzunada, president of La Restinga (an [[Iquitos]]-based nonprofit organization that works with at-risk children) said about teenage prostitution:"It's not seen as a crime. People think that's the way it is. Here, anyone is a potential client."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0602361.htm |title= In Peruvian jungle city, church works to help child prostitutes|accessdate=2009-11-16 |website= Catholic News Service |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Peruvian government recognizes [[child sex tourism]] to be a problem, particularly in [[Iquitos]], [[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]], and [[Cuzco]]. &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/123363.pdf |title= Human Trafficking|accessdate=2009-11-16 |website= US Department of State |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Peru}}
Peru is a source, transit point, and destination for [[human trafficking|trafficked]] persons. The majority of human trafficking occurs within the country.

Many trafficking victims are women and girls from impoverished rural regions of the Amazon, recruited and coerced into prostitution in urban nightclubs, bars, and brothels, often through false employment offers or promises of education.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Domestic trafficking occurs particularly in districts located in the [[Andes]] or the [[Amazon jungle]], to bring underage girls into cities or mining areas to work as prostitutes. Victims are recruited by friends or acquaintances and through newspaper and [[Internet]] advertisements or street posters offering employment; some victims are recruited by local employment agencies that offer poor young women from rural areas relatively well-paid "restaurant work" in [[Lima]], [[Cusco]], major coastal cities, and abroad. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
 
The principal victims and groups at high risk for trafficking are children and young women from rural or poor urban areas, persons living in poverty, persons with disabilities, victims of domestic abuse, illiterate persons, and persons lacking birth certificates or other identification documents.

Peru also is a destination country for some [[Ecuadorian]] and [[Bolivia|Bolivian]] women trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Peru as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Peru2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282730.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barwon Heads boatshed Stevage.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The boatshed in Barwon Heads used as a set in ''SeaChange'' was redeveloped into a restaurant.]]

In [[Australia]]n culture, a '''seachange''' (or '''sea change''') is a form of [[human migration]] that involves individuals abandoning [[Urbanism|city living]] in favour of a perceived 'easier life' in rural coastal communities. The term was popularised by the popular Australian [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] television series ''[[SeaChange]]'', which triggered the phenomenon of many city-dwellers mimicking the drama's protagonist's escape from urban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/salty-waters-and-village-vibe-20090212-862p.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Salty waters and village vibe | date=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately  comes from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea change|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sea1.htm|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The result of this phenomenon (known as the 'sea change effect') is a rapid boom in [[tourism]] and [[real estate]] development in coastal [[Australia]], particularly in [[New South Wales]].

A similar term, '''treechange''', describes the movement of urbanites to the [[countryside]].

==''SeaChange''==
{{main|SeaChange}}
In the television series ''SeaChange'', the main character Laura Gibson fulfils her escapist desire by leaving the city for a small seaside town after her career and family life in [[Melbourne]] falls apart. The series, which ran from 1998 to 2000, became one of the most popular programmes in Australia and focused on life outside the big city. The primary filming location for the series at [[Barwon Heads, Victoria|Barwon Heads]] on the [[Bellarine Peninsula]] was the first to experience the seachange effect, with fans of the series both visiting and moving to the community. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This experience was replicated in coastal towns across Australia. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Who is shifting==
People shifting to the coast have been characterised as:
*Free agent migrators
**Include retirees
**Majority are of working age, drawn to service the needs of retirees and tourists
**Sub categories include pre-retirees, alternative lifestylers and internet business operators
*Forced relocating migrants
**Principally people reliant on income support including unemployed, single parents and the disabled.&lt;ref name = Dryden&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bitre.gov.au/publications/90/Files/p_dryden.pdf| format = pdf (19 pages)| title = Aspects of the  ‘Sea Change’ pheonmenon in the Surf Coast Region of Victoria|last = Dryden|first = Peter| publisher = Australian Government: Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics |accessdate = 2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==
The rate of growth in rural coastal areas is 60% higher than the national average.&lt;ref name = SCAbt&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.seachangetaskforce.org.au/About.html |title = About the Seachange Taskforce|publisher = National Sea Change Taskforce | year = 2008| accessdate = 2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost six million people already reside in coastal areas outside the mainland capitals,&lt;ref name = SCAbt/&gt; and a further one million are expected by 2020. In addition to people seeking a better lifestyle, the seachange phenomenon is driven by retiring [[baby boomer]]s and people forced out of capital cities by high house prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seachangetaskforce.org.au/Publications/The%20Challenge.pdf The Challenge of Seachange Growth]&lt;/ref&gt; It typically involves either the purchase of a secondary (or holiday) home in, or a complete shift to, coastal areas. 

The seachange effect is having both positive and adverse effects on local communities. While it has led to increased prosperity in regional areas, the phenomenon has also caused an increased burden on local governments. 

In response to the influx of tourists and new residents to their jurisdictions, coastal councils from around Australia formed the '''National Sea Change Taskforce''' in 2004 to seek ways to ensure sustainable development in their communities. As at 2008 there are 68 member councils from around Australia collectively representing more than four million residents.&lt;ref name = SCHome&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.seachangetaskforce.org.au/Home.html |title = National Sea Change Taskforce |publisher = National Sea Change Taskforce | year = 2008| accessdate = 2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Van Pelt estate, home of a local acting troupe called the Footlighters; a mysterious dancing puppet haunts the grounds. From the moment Nancy, Bess and George arrive at the mansion, the dancing puppet mystery is further complicated by the Footlighters’ temperamental leading lady and a Shakespearean actor.

'''Theeyaattam''' also known as '''Theeyaattu''' (Tīyāttu) is a traditional dance form.
There were two types of Theeyaattam - '''Bhadrakali Theeyaattu''' and '''Ayyappan Theeyaattu'''. Bhadrakali Theeyattu is performed by '''[[Theeyaattunnis]]''' (''a Brahmin community in Kerala'') whereas Ayyappan Theeyaattu is performed by '''Tīyyādi Nambiars''' (''Ambalavasi'').

==Bhadrakali Theeyattu==
{{Hinduism}}
Bhadrakali Tiyyattu is a ritualistic dance usually performed in [[Bhadrakali]] temples, mostly in the [[Pathanamthitta]], [[Alappuzha]], [[Kottayam]] and [[Ernakulam]] districts of south-central Kerala. [[Pallippurathu Kavu]] at Kottayam (family temple of Kottarathil Sankunni) Thrikkariyoor Mahadeva Temple,Panachimangalath Bhadrakali temple(family temple of Panachimangalath Illam) near Kothamangalam,Vanarkavu at Madakkathanam, near Thodupuzha,Puthukulangara Devi Kshetram near Thiruvalla are some of the places where tiyyattu is performed during annual festivals. It is also performed as an offering at temples and houses.

The performance has many parts of which - preparation of the ritual art known as kalam (Kalamezhuthu), singing songs in praise of Bhadrakali and the performance of the dance are a few. Kalamezhuthu is done during the day using natural coloured powders on the floor. An elaborate picture of Bhadrakali is normally made. The singing of the songs take place after the Kalamezhuthu is finished in front of it and may last up to three hours. For the dance a male member dresses up as [[Bhadrakali]], a creation of Shiva. In the performance she is just back from killing Darika and is telling the events to Shiva who is symbolised by the lighted lamp. As she was affected by small pox and has pockmarks on her face she has her back to the lamp almost throughout the performance.

Shree Bhadra Kalasamajam, Kottayam made some efforts to revive and reform the art.As it is being as a ritualistic art form and has strict traditional rituals which are strictly followed even now,Theeyattu cannot be modified at one's will.

==Ayyappan Thiyyaattu==

Ayyappan Thiyyattu is a temple art performed by the Thiyyadi Nambiar community, a minuscule [[ambalavasi]] community living (basically) in three central Kerala districts of [[Thrissur]], [[Palakkad]] and [[Malappuram]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayyappanthiyyattu.com/Ayya.htm#top&lt;/ref&gt; The all-male art centres around the mythological story of the birth of Lord [[Ayyappa]] from the relationship of Lord [[Vishnu]] in his ephemeral impersonation as [[Mohini]] and Lord [[Shiva]].

The most common version of Thiyyattu involves four phases of presentation: a) Kalamezhuthu (sketching the kalam—picture—of Ayyappa using natural pigments), b) Kottum Pattum (rendition of invocatory songs of Ayyappa and a stylised narration of the story of his birth), c) Koothu [[gesture]]-laden dance enacting the build-up story to the delivery of the lord) and d) Velichchappaadu (the slow-paced to frenzied dance of the oracle who eventually erases the kalam—the image of the lord sketched on the sanctified floor). It takes roughly a couple of hours for the kalam (image) of the lord to be completed, after which the rest of the three rituals would consume nearly three hours altogether.

The picture of Ayyappa is sketched and embellished in five natural colours—white (rice powder), yellow (turmeric powder), green (ground semi-dry leaves of the 'vaaka' or manchadi' tree, red (a mix of turmeric powder and slaked lime) and black (powdered charred rice husk). The lord invariably holds his weapons like the sword and the bow-and-arrow, and, in more elaborate versions is sketched mounted on the tiger or the horse.

The songs—accompanied by the beats of 'para', a smaller version of the [[chenda]], and the cymbals called [[ilathalam]]—praising the lord bear a mix of quaint old [[Malayalam]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] with a streak of endemic tunes, some of which can be traced to classical [[raga]]s of the [[Sopanam]] style of Kerala music besides that belonging to the [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] idiom. The stylised rendition of the birth of Ayyappa, called Thottam, also sticks to the same mix of languages, but is devoid of music.

The Koothu is enacted with no make-up but a defined set of costumes. Facial emotions are nil, dance movements are minimal and hand gestures would look the less refined versions of [[Koodiyattam]] and [[Kathakali]]. The Koothu is usually performed to the accompaniment of chenda, ilathalam and 'para'.

The Velichchappadu (oracle), wielding a small sword, is bare-chested but for the garland and, canonically, with a flowy hair; the face either bearded or clean-shaven. Around the waist, he is draped in cloth pieces of white and red colours. The oracle begins with slow steps while circumambulating around the 'kalam', but the tempo gains with the circles he make—around 9 or 11 of them, overall. Then he leaps onto the image in a frenzy, but is calm when he later erases the image with both legs. The face of the lord alone is erased with the (right) hand. Out from the 'kalam', the oracle utters 'revelatory' sentences in (presumed) trance -- 'kalpana' as they are called. The devotees are distributed with the [[prasadam]] which is the mixed powder used in the 'kalam'.

The art is sometimes staged in bigger forms that last from dawn to late night when it is called Udayasthamaya Thiyyattu. In such cases, the Koothu would deal with twelve stories ahead of the birth of Ayyappa. Such performances usually feature the challenging 'Pantheeraayiram', which is when the oracle would take a (three- to four-hour-long) break from the circumambulations to break (dehusked and sufficiently polished) coconuts totalling 12,000 to the rhythmic beats of chenda-and-ilathalam concert that would gain speed towards the climax.

The Thiyyadi Nambiar families, despite their existence in central Kerala, enjoy the popularity of their art more in the upstate [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] belt. Some experts/historians trace this pattern to the community's possible southward flee from their original north Malabar homes during the controversial temple destruction spree of the 18th-century [[Mysore]] king [[Tippu Sultan]].Mulankunnathukavu Thiyyaadi Raman Nambiar,&lt;ref&gt;ayyappantheeyattu.com/mulankunnathukavu_thiyyadi.html&lt;/ref&gt; in his book "'''Ayyappan Theeyattu'''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/books/books...the...ayyappan.../article5267634.ece&lt;/ref&gt; gives a lively narration of the traditional art and acknowledges the support from [[V. R. Prabodhachandran Nayar]] in coming out with this invaluable narration of the age old [[Kerala]] art form.

'''''U.S. Special Forces: Team Factor''''' (also known as '''''Team Factor''''') is a [[first-person shooter]] developed by [[7FX]] in 2002.

The '''UK Music Hall of Fame''' was an awards ceremony to honour musicians, of any nationality, for their lifetime contributions to music in the United Kingdom. The [[hall of fame]] started in 2004 with the induction of five founder members and five more members selected by a public televote, two from each of the last five decades. In subsequent years, a panel of more than 60 journalists and music industry executives decided the people and groups to be inducted. The ceremony was last held in 2006, and has since been cancelled.

In addition, the public were asked to select one further act from each decade, from five lists of ten nominees. The five members chosen by the public in October 2004 were:
*[[Cliff Richard]] and [[The Shadows]]

[[Chris Blackwell]], the founder of [[Island Records]], was awarded honorary membership.

==2005 inductees==
The 2005 inductees were selected by a panel of 60 people from the music industry:
*[[Pink Floyd]] (inducted by [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]])
*[[Eurythmics]] (inducted by [[Bob Geldof]], performed)
*[[Aretha Franklin]]
*[[Jimi Hendrix]] (inducted by [[Mitch Mitchell]], and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] of [[Velvet Revolver]])

The late [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[John Peel]] was also made an honorary member (inducted by [[Damon Albarn]] of Blur).

The programme was televised in the UK. It was later shown on [[VH1]] in the United States, without the Joy Division/New Order segments. The full version was subsequently shown on [[VH1 Classic]].

==2006 inductees==
The 2006 inductees were:
*[[James Brown]] (inducted by [[Jazzie B]], performed "I Got You (I Feel Good)")
*[[Led Zeppelin]] (inducted by [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Wolfmother]] performed "[[Communication Breakdown]]" as tribute)
*[[Rod Stewart]] (inducted by [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]] who performed "[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]" / "[[Do Ya Think I'm Sexy]]")
*[[Brian Wilson]] (inducted by [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]], performed "[[God Only Knows]]" and "[[Good Vibrations]]")
*[[Bon Jovi]] (inducted by [[David A. Stewart]] and [[Kara DioGuardi]], performed "[[Livin' on a Prayer]]", "[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]" and "[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]")
*[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (inducted by [[Beyoncé]])
*[[Dusty Springfield]] (inducted by [[Joss Stone]] who performed "[[Son of a Preacher Man]]")

[[George Martin]] received an honorary membership (inducted by the then British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and future [[Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]]).  He then went on to conduct a special arrangement of [[The Beatles]] songs "[[Golden Slumbers]]" / "[[Carry That Weight]]" / "[[The End (The Beatles song)|The End]]"; with the help of [[Johnny Borrell]], [[Corinne Bailey Rae]], [[José González (singer)|José González]], [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] and the [[London Community Gospel Choir]]. The band were also joined by [[Dean Tidey]].

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]], during his induction, invited everyone over to see him live in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] but gave an [[Remorse|apology]] that he could not perform live at the venue.  [[Rod Stewart]] appeared live by satellite from [[Los Angeles]] in a [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] shirt and accidentally dropped his award, before advising [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]] to 'give up the fags'.

The event has particular significance as it turned out to be [[James Brown]]'s final televised recording, as he died on 25 December 2006.

The 2006 Induction Ceremony took place on 14 November 2006 at [[Alexandra Palace]], and it was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in the UK on 16 November, repeated on 18 November. It was shown on VH1 in the USA on 25 November.

==Cancellation==
There were no inductees in 2007. It was announced in September 2008 that Channel 4 had axed the ceremony, partly due to lack of funding, and also because a two-year gap since the last show was "too long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/19/uk.music.hall.of.fame.axed|title=Channel 4 axes UK Music Hall of Fame|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|date=19 September 2008|author=Sean Michaels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University Interscholastic League''' ('''UIL''') is an organization that creates rules for and administers almost all athletic, musical, and academic contests for public primary and secondary schools in the [[U.S. state|American state]] of [[Texas]]. It is the largest organization of its type in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=University Interscholastic League|authorlink1=University Interscholastic League|title=University Interscholastic League Self-Evaluation Report submitted to the Sunset Advisory Commission|url=https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/reports/UIL%20SER%202013%2084%20Leg.pdf|website=UIL SER 2013 84 Leg.pdf|publisher=Texas Sunset Commission|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities range from [[American football]] and [[cross-examination debate]] to [[mathematics]] and [[marching band]] competitions; however, the UIL does not administer [[Academic Decathlon]] competitions.

The UIL is under the governance of the Vice President for Diversity and Community Engagement at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. Although the [[Texas Education Agency]] governs the activities of schools and school districts in Texas, the UIL does not report to TEA, but is instead a separate entity.

==History==
The UIL was originally created by the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1910 as two different entities, the Debating League of Texas High Schools (to govern debating contests) and the Interscholastic Athletic Association (to govern athletic contests). The two entities merged in 1913 and adopted the UIL name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Emily|last2=Ogle|first2=Steven|last3=Roberson|first3=Dawn|last4=Jones|first4=Jennifer|last5=Levine|first5=Ken|authorlink1=Sunset Advisory Commission|title=Sunset Advisory Commission Staff Report with Final Results University Interscholastic League|url=https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/reports/Final%20Results%20UIL%20book.pdf|website=University Interscholastic League Sunset Staff Report with Final Results July 2015|publisher=Texas Sunset Commission|accessdate=12 March 2016|location=Austin, Texas|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, UIL only governed white schools in Texas. From 1940 to 1970, an era of [[racial segregation]] in Texas, the [[Prairie View Interscholastic League]] (PVIL), headquartered at [[Prairie View A&amp;M University]], served as a separate parallel organization for [[African-American]] public high schools in Texas.

In 1965, the UIL agreed to admit PVIL member schools for competition. Black schools began UIL competitions beginning in the 1967-68 school year. After the 1969–70 school year, the UIL fully absorbed all PVIL member schools, the majority of which would later be merged with their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/pvilarchives.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208091839/http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/pvilarchives.html |archive-date=2006-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the 2003–2004 academic year, two large all-male private schools, [[Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas|Dallas Jesuit]] and [[Strake Jesuit College Preparatory|Houston Strake Jesuit]], were granted UIL membership. This came after extensive court battles and negotiations from both the UIL's lawyers and the schools' joint lawyers. Previously, both schools were members of the now-defunct Texas Christian Interscholastic League (TCIL); after that league's demise and their inability to gain admittance into the [[Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools]] (TAPPS) or Southwest Preparatory Conference (SPC), they decided to further pursue their decade-long battle of gaining membership into the UIL. They are so far the only private schools to be granted UIL membership, as the new UIL rules established after the Jesuit schools' entry prohibited those schools who were eligible for memberships in other similar associations (such as TAPPS or the SPC) to apply. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The Texas Legislature rewrote titles 1 and 2 of the Texas Education Code and greatly restricted the functions to be performed by the Texas Education Agency and the UIL. The changes made Texas an equal access state. The law now requires the public schools to allow all students that reside within the school's boundary equal access to all activities. The Senate also made amendments that expressly regulate the UIL and invalidated certain UIL rules limiting student eligibility for competitions by providing that UIL rules would only apply to a student enrolled in the public school. The UIL no longer has the authority to determine the eligibility of Charter/Home/Private school students. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

All students must abide by the state No-Pass No-Play law. Only students that are enrolled in a public school must abide by UIL eligibility rules, even if the activity is not a UIL event.

In 1918, UIL excluded Private schools from membership after participation decreased significantly. Up to this time, private schools had competed in a separate Academy division from public schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uiltexas.org/policy/membership|title=UIL Membership Requirements|last=|first=|date=August 2013|website=UIL Official Website|access-date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, rules were changed to allow some private or parochial schools to participate under certain circumstances when no other league is available to them. Other than this, membership in UIL is currently restricted to public schools and open-enrollment charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uiltexas.org/policy/membership|title=Membership Requirements — University Interscholastic League (UIL)|last=League|first=University Interscholastic|website=www.uiltexas.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2010, the Third District Court of Appeals in Austin ruled that the UIL operates as a public organization and not a private organization. The ruling clarified that the UIL is legally considered a state agency and must comply with the prerequisites and duties that all other state agencies have. As a state agent the UIL must treat individuals equally and show the purpose/need as well as a rational basis for eligibility restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morales|first1=Dan|last2=Vega|first2=Jorge|last3=Shirley|first3=Sarah J.|last4=Garrison|first4=Susan L.|title=Morales Opinion No. DM-446|url=https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/opinions/opinions/48morales/op/1997/htm/dm0446.htm|website=Texas Attorney General|publisher=Office of the Attorney General State of Texas|accessdate=11 March 2016|date=25 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan.

==Organization==
The UIL governs only public schools and 2 private high schools. Activities for most Texas private schools are governed by separate bodies, the largest of which is TAPPS. However, private schools are allowed to join the UIL only if 1) they meet UIL's definition of a high school, 2) they are accredited by the Texas Private School Accreditation Commission, and 3) they are ineligible for membership in any league similar to UIL (such as TAPPS or the Southwest Preparatory Conference). Furthermore, private schools must compete at one classification higher than their enrollment would otherwise dictate.

Charter schools must participate at no lower than the classification of the smallest high school in the district where the charter school resides; for example, a charter school within the Dallas ISD must participate in at least Class AAAA, as DISD has high schools which participate at this level.

UIL schools are permitted to schedule contests with private schools and/or home school groups.

Schools are arranged by conference to ensure that schools compete on a regular basis with other schools in the geographic area of a similar size. The conferences are '''A''' (the smallest), '''AA''', '''AAA''', '''AAAA''', '''AAAAA''' and '''AAAAAA''' (the largest).  The corresponding alphanumeric designations ('''1A''', '''2A''', '''3A''', '''4A''', '''5A''', and '''6A''') are used in everyday conversation (as well as in this article), but officially UIL only uses the alphabetic designations. The general guideline is that the UIL desires between 220 and 245 schools in Conference AAAAAA, at least 200 schools in Conferences AA, AAA, AAAA, and AAAAA with the grades 9–12 enrollment ratio for those classes no greater than 2.0 between the largest and smallest school in each class.

In addition, for football participation, a school whose enrollment is at or below 104.5 students may choose to play either [[six-man football]] (which, as of the 2014 alignment, is Conference 1A) or 11-man football (at Conference 2A). Schools with enrollments over 104.5 are only eligible for 11-man football; however, some schools organize a six-man team and play an "outlaw" schedule (i.e., the school is not eligible for the postseason). Moreover, for some events (such as team tennis or swimming and diving), the UIL organizes all participating schools into Conference 6A and Conference 5A, with the latter encompassing all schools not meeting the Conference 6A enrollment requirements.

Within each conference, the UIL separates the schools in regions, and then further separates the regions into districts for various contests. The districts are numbered from 1 (in far west Texas) to 32 (in south Texas). There are always 32 districts in Conference 6A and Conference 5A, but the smaller conferences may have numbers skipped based on the number of schools in the conference. No more than 10 schools are permitted in a single district unless all schools and the UIL consent otherwise; the preference is for an even number of schools in each district (6, 8, 10) though in some cases travel issues may prevent such.

Previously, schools were permitted to request to be placed in a higher conference than their enrollment would otherwise dictate, usually to play at a higher level of competition. The "play up" rule was later eliminated for competition reasons, but has been retained for geographic reasons (where playing at the current level would create a travel hardship for the school), and where school districts with eight or more high schools could keep all or most of them in the same conference. However, the school must then participate at the higher conference in ''all'' UIL events in which it does participate.

Each type of contest has different regions and competitors, as there is no requirement that a school participate in all UIL events &amp;ndash; some small rural schools do not participate in football or choose six-man over 11-man, while some magnet schools do not field athletic teams but participate in academic events only.

Unlike the college ranks or other states, the regions and districts are not permanently set, but are redrawn biennially by the UIL behind closed doors in an attempt to keep schools of similar sizes within a certain distance of their geographic area when attending competitions, and to adjust for the changing enrollments of schools (moving schools with increased attendance up in conference and those with decreased attendance down) and new schools opening. The main redrawing of regions and districts takes place on February 1 of even-numbered years (and the final allocation, especially relating to [[high school football]], is the subject of much pre-announcement anticipation and speculation as to which schools move up or down and the final composition of the districts), but as new schools open or smaller schools close or disband programs, interim adjustments can be made.

The changing districts and regions have produced unusual results &amp;ndash; for example, the 2008-09 Conference 5A boys' basketball championship featured champion DeSoto from Region II defeating Cedar Hill from Region I, notwithstanding that the schools are in neighboring districts.

==Playoff formats==
===Football===
In Conference 6A, the top four teams from each district are eligible for the playoffs. The two eligible teams with the highest student enrollment for its district are seeded in the Division I playoff bracket, and the remaining two teams (with the lower enrollment) are seeded in the Division II playoff bracket. This method is supposed to prevent matchups between large and small schools within a classification, although in practice this is not always the case &amp;ndash; for example, in the 2006 playoffs, Southlake Carroll (the Conference 5A Division I champion) had a '''''lower''''' student enrollment than Cedar Hill (the Conference 5A Division II champion).

For all other 11-man conferences and for six-man football, the UIL divides schools into separate Division I (large) and Division II (small) districts at its bi-annual redistricting session (in these cases, there are a maximum of 16 districts statewide, as opposed to the 32 in the larger conferences); separate playoffs are held for each division with the top four teams (top two in six-man) from each district eligible.

===Other major team sports===
In Conferences 6A and 5A, the top four teams from each district are eligible. However, the UIL does not use a Division I/Division II alignment as in football; only one champion is crowned in each conference. A similar arrangement exists in Conferences 2A-4A, and for Conference 1A in all other team sports except basketball, only the top three teams are eligible.

For Conference 1A basketball, similar to the six-man football setup the UIL divides schools into separate Division I (large) and Division II (small) districts prior to the beginning of the season, and separate playoffs are held for each division with the top two teams from each district eligible. This arrangement exists because, in some small schools, basketball is the only team sport in which the school participates.

For baseball and softball, at all levels except the state tournament, playoff rounds are best 2-of-3 only if both coaches agree; if they do not then the coaches flip a coin to decide the format of the playoff (single game or two out of three series). At the state tournament both the semifinals and finals are single-game format.

===Academics and other sports===
Advancement in these activities is dependent on the individual event involved.

===Musical competition===
In musical competitions, schools are aligned into 33 regions (the regions themselves are set not by the UIL, but by the [[Texas Music Educators Association]]).&lt;ref name=regions&gt;[http://www.tmea.org/divisions-regions/regions/alignment Region Alignment], Region Alignment, TMEA Website, viewed 11 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools of all sizes are grouped into a region.

Advancement within musical competition is not based on direct competition against other schools. Instead, musicians are compared against an established [[rubric (academic)|rubric]] (this is comparable to [[conformation dog show]]s where dogs compete against the written standard for their breed, not against other dogs of differing breeds), and all schools or individuals who are judged "Division 1" (the highest level) advance to the next level, except for state competition.

For marching band, schools compete against other schools in the same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into nine areas (named A-I) for Conferences 5A and 6A, and five areas (A-E) for Conference 4A and down. All schools of all conferences compete in region competition annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Conferences 2A, 4A, and 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Conferences 3A and 5A can advance from region to area and state, in addition to schools in Conference 1A may advance from region to state (There are no Area contests for Conference 1A, only for 2A and up). In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, they need to get an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether it be a 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs to make it to the Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Band Parent's Guide to Competition|url=http://www.dentonisd.org/cms/lib/tx21000245/centricity/Domain/1055/parent_guide_to_competition.pdf|website=parent_guide_to_competition.pdf|publisher=dentonisd.org|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all other musical competitions (held in the spring semester), conference alignments are disregarded except for the rules regarding sight reading. Advancement in solo and small ensemble competition is from region to state, and at state the top two soloists and top ensemble are awarded medals. Individual performers may be given Outstanding Performer awards.  However, advancement is limited not only to Division 1 winners, but the winners must have performed "Class 1" (difficult level) performances at region, and the performance must have been from a selection on the UIL's "Prescribed Music List" and also performed from memory (except for certain instrumental pieces which are designated as exempt from such on the List). In sight reading, schools in different conferences read different pieces, and second groups (officially called "non-varsity" groups) read different pieces from other conferences than the varsity group.

Sight Reading and medium ensembles compete at region level only. Music theory is held at state only and is open to any and all students in grades 9–12 having the permission of the school principal and school music director; the student is not required to have advanced from region in another musical contest (or even participated for that matter). Wind ensembles can advance from region to state; however, the state event is not a competition but an educational event.

== Events ==

===Athletics===
Historically, football championship games have been held at neutral sites mutually agreed upon by both teams, but in 2006, 2007 and 2009, both CConference 5A championship games were played at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]]. Frequent sites for those games included the [[NRG Astrodome|
Astrodome]] in Houston, [[Texas Stadium]] in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]], [[Alamo Stadium]] in [[San Antonio]] and [[Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

In 2010, the UIL designated sites for all championship games: the 5A, 4A, and 3A championships were held at [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], while the 2A and 1A championships were held at Newsom Stadium in [[Mansfield, Texas|Mansfield]] and the six-man championships at [[Shotwell Stadium]] in [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]]. In 2011, Conferences 1A-5A played their state championships at AT&amp;T Stadium, while the six-man games were played at Abilene. In 2013, the six-man games moved to AT&amp;T Stadium as well. In 2015 the 11-man championships were played at NRG Stadium in Houston due to a conflict with a [[Dallas Cowboys]]-[[New York Jets]] game, while the six-man title games returned to Shotwell. All championship games are scheduled to return to AT&amp;T Stadium in 2016.

The state semifinal and championship games for all five classes in boys and girls basketball are held at the [[Frank Erwin Center]] on the campus of [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. In 2015 it was decided to move the Boys &amp; Girls state tournaments to the Alamodome in San Antonio,TX, due to ongoing price and venue disputes in Austin. The state track and field meet and swimming championships are also held on the UT Austin campus, the former at [[Mike A. Myers Stadium]] and the latter at the [[Lee and Joe Jamail Texas Swimming Center]].

The soccer semifinals and finals for 4A and 5A are held at Birkelbach Field in the Austin suburb of [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]], and the state baseball tournament is held at [[Dell Diamond]] in another Austin suburb, [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]]. The state softball tournament is held at [[Red and Charline McCombs Field]] on the UT Austin campus. The state cross country meet is held at Old Settlers Park in Round Rock. The state wrestling tournament is held at the DELCO Center in Austin. The Conference 5A state golf tournament is held at Jimmy Clay Golf Course, a municipal course in Austin.

From 2000–2011 the girls' volleyball tournament was held in Strahan Coliseum on the campus of [[Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]]. Since 2012, the tournament has been held at the [[Curtis Culwell Center]] in Garland.

===Academics===
Though UIL is best known as the governing body for public school athletic competition, it also hosts numerous academic competitions as well. Between athletics, music, and academics, UIL estimates that half of all public high school graduates have competed in at least one UIL-sanctioned event during their high school tenure.

The state level academic competitions are held on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin. The speech and debate finals are often held in the State Capitol Building.

For fine arts and journalism contests, the UIL has not adopted an "amateur rule.” Thus, students who have acted or performed professionally or who have written for a local newspaper may still compete in UIL-sanctioned contests provided they are otherwise eligible.

==Participation==
In the 2016-17 season, the University Interscholastic League featured 834,558 participants, with 59% boys and 41% girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/PDF/2016-17_Participation_Survey_Results.pdf 2016-17 High school athletics participation survey] - National Federation of State High School Associations&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilfredo''' is a fictional comedy character portrayed by the British comedian [[Matt Roper]].

The character is an obnoxious, deluded and uncouth [[satire]] of a [[romantic music|romantic singer]] characterized in a [[commedia dell'arte]] style. Wilfredo has acquired a [[cult status]],&lt;ref name="The New Current"&gt;[http://www.thenewcurrent.com/2011/05/11/brighton-fringe-interview-matt-roper-komedia/ Brighton Fringe Interview - Matt Roper, Komedia], The New Current, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; particularly among [[music festival]] audiences and on the [[Alternative comedy|alternative cabaret and comedy circuit]] in London.

==Character origins and appearance==

Physically, the character of Wilfredo is a [[grotesque]] [[caricature]] of [[Falstaff]]ian appearance: trousers pulled up to the top of a corpulent stomach, a tight flamenco shirt, a wild black mop wig and a set of prominent prosthetic teeth. Typically, the character will always hold a pint of beer on stage, even whilst dancing and singing. He smokes his way throughout songs, salivating over the audience and musicians while berating them with rich expletives. Critics have described the character as "a wonderful and vile creation",&lt;ref name="Broadway Baby"&gt;[http://www.broadwaybaby.com/edinburgh-fringe/10365-wilfredo-erecto Broadway Baby Editor Review - Edinburgh Festival Fringe], Broadway Baby, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; "strangely endearing",&lt;ref name="Chortle"&gt;[http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2011/w/19000/wilfredo%3A_erecto! Wilfredo: Erecto! Review - Edinburgh Festival Fringe], Chortle.com, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; "joyful and grin-inducing",&lt;ref name="STV"&gt;[http://entertainment.stv.tv/edinburgh-festivals/shows-were-lovin/266093-wilfredos-erectro-hits-unexpected-high-points/ STV - Shows We're Lovin' by Michael MacLennan], STV: Wilfredo's Erecto hits unexpected high points, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and "utterly charming and uplifting".&lt;ref name="Three Weeks"&gt;[http://www.threeweeks.co.uk/article/ed2011-comedy-review-wilfredo-erecto-matt-roper/ ED2011 Wilfredo: Erecto! Review - Three Weeks], Three Weeks, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The character began his life onstage performing cover versions of songs by [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Phil Spector]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and the [[Rolling Stones]]. In an interview with the student media, Roper stated: "My father was a trad comic so I grew up around a lot of the old school; people like [[Frankie Howerd]] and lots of [[music hall]] acts. I’d be taken to theatres and all these smoky clubs where there was always a mad speciality artist or a singer in a spangly outfit or a dinner suit onstage, crooning covers. Wilfredo comes from that world for sure." Elsewhere in the same interview, Roper said he hoped Wilfredo "offers escape".&lt;ref name="The New Current"/&gt;

Roper has constructed an entire life history and family background to Wilfredo and updates audiences through his performance. The character hails from [[Granada]] in Spain, the fourth son of a fourth son,&lt;ref name="New Current"/&gt; a gifted [[child prodigy]] who evolved into a national singing star. The character is always accompanied by a guitarist onstage, often by Katie Pollak in the role of Mana Maria,&lt;ref name="ComedyCV"/&gt; the younger sister of Wilfredo. The character of Maria wears identical teeth and hair, although [[WT:pop sock|pop socked]] and [[bespectacled]]. She is the polar opposite of Wilfredo: where Wilfredo is brash and loud, Maria in contrast is totally [[Muteness|mute]] and performed in a subtle style. On occasion (as at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival) Kris Howe may accompany – also in character – as Wilfredo's 'Uncle' Ignacio.&lt;ref name="STV"/&gt;
{{rquote|right|I’ve undressed women all over the world and they come in so many different shapes and sizes. And I’ve loved every one of them. I have never taken a wife but in many ways I married my career. I don’t understand the singer from Coldplay. When he goes on tour he takes his Hollywood wife with him. Who takes an olive to the olive grove?|Wilfredo interviewed, December 2011&lt;ref name="New Current"/&gt;}}

Wilfredo's life story is juxtaposed with real life historical events into which Wilfredo is fictionally placed: an appearance at the [[Benidorm International Song Festival|Benidorm International Song Contest Festival]] for example is claimed,&lt;ref name="New Current"&gt;[http://www.thenewcurrent.com/2011/12/08/14530/ Exclusive Interview - Christmas Wilfredo and Other Beautiful Creatures, London], ''The New Current'', retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; as is a friendship and a near collaboration with [[Serge Gainsbourg]].&lt;ref name="New Current"/&gt; Throughout his performances Wilfredo introduces songs from a fictional back catalogue of bestselling albums, with titles ranging from El Chico En El Toro (the Boy on the Bull) to Solo Para Las Damas (Only For The Ladies).&lt;ref name="Solo Para Las Damas"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GVYXfefksY Youtube.com - Wilfredo in performance at the Komedia for the Brighton Festival Fringe], YouTube: Wilfredo in performance at the Komedia for the Brighton Festival Fringe, retrieved 9 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The boorish and outlandish Wilfredo is [[delusional]], believing himself to be the apotheosis of masculinity and all that is attractive to women. This arrogance is counterbalanced by a charm which in turn endears him to audiences.&lt;ref name="Chortle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Three Weeks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WOS"/&gt; The origin of the name lies in Latin America, meaning 'to desire peace'.

==Early career==

Roper first performed the character in 2008 at a benefit in [[Totnes]], [[Devon]] before performing at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] weeks later.&lt;ref name="ComedyCV"&gt;[http://www.comedycv.co.uk/mattroper/index.html Comedycv - Matt Roper], Comedycv.com, retrieved 8 January 12&lt;/ref&gt; In August he performed at the Maker Sunshine Festival in Cornwall with a full band, before guesting with [[Barcelona]]-based [[gypsy jazz]] combo [[Gadjo (band)|Gadjo]]. The character made his London debut at [[Camden Town]]'s Lockstock Festival in November 2008, performing a cover of the Amy Winehouse song [[Rehab (Amy Winehouse song)|Rehab]].&lt;ref name="Rehab"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bHRspIB7pE Wilfredo sings Rehab at Lockstock Festival - Youtube.com], YouTube, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by the positive reception of these appearances, Roper began to perform Wilfredo sporadically until the summer of 2009 while writing and exploring the concept of the character more fully.  Another Glastonbury Festival appearance followed, as did performances at the [[Winchester Hat Fair]]. In September 2009 Wilfredo began to establish himself by way of guest performances on the London comedy circuit. In March 2010 Wilfredo was placed alongside [[the Penny Dreadfuls]] and [[Angelos Epithemiou]] in [[Pippa Evans]] ''Old Time New Time Music Hall'' at the [[Canal Cafe Theatre|Canal Café Theatre]],&lt;ref name="Londonisfunny"&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/event/166319/pippas-old-time-new-time-music-hall Time Out: Pippa's Old Time New Time Music Hall], Time Out London, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; performing parodies and original song.

Roper presented a sixty-minute show ''Wilfredo: A Man and His Music'' at the [[Etcetera Theatre]] in April 2010. Featuring the character Mana Maria on guitar, Wilfredo performed covers (Leonard Cohen's [[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]), parody ([[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were The Days]]) and original songs from a fictionalized back catalogue of albums. Various affairs with prominent women including [[Victoria Beckham]], American First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] and [[the Princess of Wales]] are claimed for the first time in The Child Is Not Mine, which becomes a flagship signature song. A journalist on the [[Camden New Journal]] described "initial terror" at the character, later adding "I left unscathed, having spent the evening roaring with laughter."&lt;ref name="CNJ"&gt;[http://www.camdenreview.com/reviews/theatre/2010/apr/theatre-review-wilfredo-etcetera-theatre Wilfredo at the Etcetera - Camden New Journal], Camden New Journal, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Roper then presented the show for the [[Brighton Festival Fringe]] at the [[Komedia]],&lt;ref name="Solo Para Las Damas"/&gt; before performing the character in [[Lecce]], Italy for the Factory K-NOS [[artist collective]].&lt;ref name="The New Current"/&gt;

In July 2010 Wilfredo became the surprise breakthrough act at the [[Port Eliot Festival]] in [[Cornwall]],&lt;ref name="Vimeo"&gt;[http://vimeo.com/20914228 Vimeo - Port Eliot Festival: Lucia Helenka films the 2010 festival and asks a host of performers including Stephen Jones, Jarvis Cocker, Anna Sui, Anita Pallenberg, Barbara Hulanicki, Wilfredo and more what makes Port Eliot so special for them], Vimeo: Port Eliot Festival, retrieved 9 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; performing two outdoor sets with Mana Maria before hosting the main stage, where he introduced [[Jarvis Cocker]] and [[Talvin Singh]] to the festival audience.  Increasingly satirizing the cult of celebrity, Wilfredo was also filmed chatting to [[Biba]] founder, the fashion designer [[Barbara Hulanicki]], giving the impression to onlookers that she was his own personal designer.&lt;ref name="prsd"&gt;[http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthdevon.co.uk/2010/09/09/comedy-double-bill-at-the-totnes-festival Matt Roper and Jackie Juno a double bill at the Totnes Festival], ''[[People's Republic of South Devon|PRSD]]'', retrieved 15 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Wilfredo once again hosted, appearing onstage with [[John Cooper Clarke]], [[Louis Eliot]] and [[Bellowhead]].&lt;ref name="Port Eliot Festival"&gt;[http://www.porteliotfestival.com/performers-2011/wilfredo-2/ Port Eliot Festival 2011 - Performers], Port Eliot Festival, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010 the character returned to Italy for an appearance at the Salento Summer Festival.&lt;ref name="Salento Festival"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGriWjVk3U Wilfredo in Italy - Youtube.com], YouTube, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

From 10 June – 7 July 2013 Wilfredo appeared at the Cape Town Comedy Festival at the [[Baxter Theatre]]. On 12 July the character performed at the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation comedy gala in the presence of [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tutu.org.za/laugh-your-head-off-with-archbishop-desmond-tutu-12-june-2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June Wilfredo appeared on the ''Expresso'' show, aired nationally on the South African [[SABC]] network.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1xJVGt80s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61inqgf0nF0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilfredo: Erecto!==
{{rquote|left|I found myself sucked delightfully into his weird and wonderful world, as he dexterously fondled the funny bones of the modest crowd: about a dozen people clustered around a handful of lantern-lit tables. It was an intimate evening in an intimate venue, one that whirled with sexual innuendos and original pop-tastic ballads. Whether you were laughing at his megalomaniacal afflictions, grimacing at his trademark mouthful of mammoth ivories (he was "born with the full set", if you ever wondered) or at his penchant for phlegmatic hacking – salivating and interspersing his satirical musings with mucus filled eruptions – it was difficult not to be seduced by this Spaniard's musical ruminations.|[[Erotic Review]], July 2011&lt;ref name="Erotic Review"&gt;[http://www.eroticreviewmagazine.com/content/wilfredo-erecto "Erotic Review - Wilfredo: Erecto!"], Erotic Review, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In March 2011 Wilfredo enjoyed a limited season at the [[Leicester Square Theatre]]&lt;ref name="Latinos in London"&gt;[http://latinosinlondon.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/stand-up-comedy-wilfredo-erecto-15-16-march/ Latinos in London - Wilfredo at Leicester Square Theatre], Latinos in London, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; where he began to preview new material for the forthcoming [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. The writer Joanna Lloyd described him as "the bastard love child of [[Les Patterson]] and [[Julio Iglesias]]."&lt;ref name="London Festival Fringe"&gt;[http://londonfestivalfringe.com/general/post/?p=7749 Wilfredo, Erecto! ★★★★★ - Leicester Square Theatre by Joanna Lloyd], London Festival Fringe, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The show – a retrospective journey of his life and times told for the first time entirely in original song – eventually became ''Wilfredo: Erecto!''. Further previews were later staged to small audiences at the Canal Cafe Theatre. In addition, on 16 June Roper presented the character to an audience at the [[Poetry Society]] in [[Covent Garden]],&lt;ref name="Poetry Society"&gt;[http://more.poetrysociety.org.uk/cafe/calendar.php?thismonth=6&amp;thisyear=2011 Poetry Society - An Evening with Shy Yeti and Other Animals], Poetrysociety.org.uk, retrieved 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; reciting a spoken-word version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye'.

''Wilfredo: Erecto!'' was performed nightly at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 4–28 August 2011 at the [[Underbelly (venue)|Underbelly]], drawing good houses and a positive commentary in the British press.

The film-maker Mat Snead has said of the film: "I think what I wanted to do was to try and take Wilfredo off stage and almost push the absurdity of it by showing him in a real world environment. Wilfredo really does exist on stage, so what I was trying to do was get him off stage and get him into some different environments and do some things that you can’t do on stage. I’ve seen a lot of those kinds of acts, but there are very few that can actually pull it off."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefilmreview.com/features/mat-snead-interview.html UK FIlm Review] UK Film Review: Mat Snead Interview – 27 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish magazine The Skinny noted the performance as "a cabaret performance much closer to the real thing than you might have believed possible on arrival. For all the Spanish crooner parody (which could so easily descend into dated, 2D 'funny foreigner' stuff) the joke is perhaps on us"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theskinny.co.uk/fringe/308790-matt_roper_wilfredo_deconstructed_heroes_the_hive The Skinny] The Skinny: Matt Roper: Wilfredo Deconstructed @ Heroes at the Hive | 22 Aug 2014&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Kate Copstick]] of the [[Scotsman (newspaper)|Scotsman]] newspaper hailed the character as "a master of seduction" and the music "timeless".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wow247.co.uk/blog/2014/08/12/matt-roper-wilfredo-deconstructed/ The Scotsman] 247 Blog: Matt Roper: Wilfredo Deconstructed | Kate Copstick review 12 Aug 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticism was later lost on [[BBC Radio 2]], who banned '''''Peace All Over The World (At Christmas Time)''''' – a festive single release by the character in a duet with the comedian Pippa Evans under the guise of Latino star Carmella – on the basis of "daytime listeners being offended".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/move-over-lena-dunham--broad-city-have-graduated-to-tv-9925701.html ES] London Evening Standard | Move Over Lena Dunham / Wilfredo and Carmella's BBC Blackout | Bruce Dessau | 15 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilfredo embarked on a Spring tour of the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in 2015, having opened at the [[Adelaide Fringe]] on March 1 and giving performances in [[Manila]], [[the Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].

On July 6, '''''Wilfredo Unchained: Live in California''''' was released worldwide as a download-only [[concert album]], originally recorded in [[Petaluma, California]] in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wilfredo-unchained-live-in/id1009472300] iTunes USA 'Wilfredo Unchained: Live in California'&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently Wilfredo makes regular weekend appearances at the [[The Slipper Room|Slipper Room]], a [[vaudeville]] and [[Variety show|variety]] theatre in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], New York City. According to a piece by the British comedy blogger John Fleming published in December 2015, Wilfredo will appear in a feature film entitled ''The Mel and Fanny Movie'', directed by James Habacker. Shooting is to begin in New York City early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Malice in the Palace''' was a [[professional wrestling]] event that was filmed on October 19, 2007 at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California]]. The event was filmed for broadcast and [[DVD]] release by Big Vision Entertainment.

The event was free to attendees of the weekend-long WrestleFanFest convention. The convention was also slated to host a [[Mixed Martial Arts]] event the following night, but it was canceled by the California State Athletic Commission due to the [[cage match|caged enclosure]] missing two required support beams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news.asp?n_id=9584|title=Breaking News: CSAC Cancels Cow Palace Card|accessdate=2007-10-20|author=Josh Gross|date=2007-10-20|publisher=[[Sherdog.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
