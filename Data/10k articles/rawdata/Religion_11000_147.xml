'''Alan Bermowitz''' (June 23, 1938 – July 16, 2016), known professionally as '''Alan Vega''', was an American vocalist and visual artist, primarily known for his work with the [[electronic music|electronic]] [[protopunk]] duo [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]].

== Life and career ==

Alan Bermowitz was raised in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn.  Until the announcement of the 70th birthday release of his recordings in 2008, Vega was widely thought to have been ten years younger; the 2005 book ''Suicide: No Compromise'' lists 1948 as his birth year and quotes a 1998 interview in which Vega talks about watching [[Elvis Presley]] on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (1956) as a "little kid".&lt;ref name="Suicide: No Compromise"/&gt; A 1983 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article refers to him as a 35-year-old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/668650772.html?dids=668650772:668650772&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+11%2C+1983&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=ALAN+VEGA%3A+MELLOWING+ON+AMERICA&amp;pqatl=google|title=ALAN VEGA: MELLOWING ON AMERICA|date=August 11, 1983|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other sources also list 1948 as his birthdate.&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;Buckley, Peter (2003) ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|978-1-84353-105-0}}, p. 1131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Dave (2000) ''Alternative Rock'', Miller Freeman Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-607-6}}, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt;  Two 2009 articles confirmed his 1938 birth date, one in ''[[Le Monde]]'' about the Lyon exhibit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.lemonde.fr/gop/archives_23/0,0-0,37-1085390,0.html|title=La crucifixion, la mort et l'extase selon Alan Vega|publisher="Le Monde"|date=June 5, 2009|accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in the magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://popnewsdaily.com/11775/the-feelies-dirty-three-with-nick-cave-revisit-classic-albums-at-all-tomorrow%E2%80%99s-parties.htm|title=The Feelies, Dirty Three With Nick Cave Revisit Classic Albums at All Tomorrow's Parties|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=September 12, 2009|accessdate=2010-05-09}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Vega also long claimed to be Catholic due to his mother's [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] ancestry. Although themes of [[Catholicism]] were important to his lyrics and visual art over the years, in a 2008 interview with ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' he admitted he lied about his own religious upbringing to "fuel the myth".&lt;ref name=TJC &gt;[http://www.thejc.com/node/6842 "Suicide: How the godfathers of punk kept the faith"], Paul Lester, ''The Jewish Chronicle'', October 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1960s, he attended [[Brooklyn College]] where he studied both physics and fine art under [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Kurt Seligmann]]&lt;ref name=copeland&gt;{{cite book |title=Alan Suicide Vega – Infinite Mercy?

Calling himself Alan Suicide, he graduated from painting to light sculptures,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"I started as a painter. The first time I did a light piece was when I was working on a very big purple painting. There was one light bulb in the room and as I walked around I noticed how the painting acquired different aspects. I wanted it to be one color so I said, "Fuck this, man!" I took the light out of the ceiling and really stuck it on the painting." Alan Vega, 1993 – 100,000 Watts of Fat City Anna Polerica.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were constructed of electronic debris. He gained a residency at the [[OK Harris Gallery]] in [[SoHo]] where he continued to exhibit until 1975.&lt;ref name=copeland /&gt; [[Barbara Gladstone]] continued to show his work well into the 1980s.

Seeing [[The Stooges]] perform at the [[New York State Pavilion]] in August 1969 was an epiphany for Vega.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"It showed me you didn't have to do static artworks, you could create situations, do something environmental. That's what got me moving more intensely in the direction of doing music. Compared with Iggy, whatever I was doing as an artist felt insignificant." Reynolds, Village Voice.January 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he met and befriended [[Martin Rev]]erby. Together, the two began experimenting with music and formed the band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] along with guitarist Paul Liebgott. The group played twice at MUSEUM before moving on to the OK Harris Gallery. Calling himself "Nasty Cut", he used the terms "Punk Music" and "Punk Music Mass" in flyers to describe their music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fromthearchives.org/av_mr/chronology.html |title=SuicideChronology |accessdate=2010-05-10 |publisher=From The Archives| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100614080703/http://www.fromthearchives.org/av_mr/chronology.html| archivedate= June 14, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he adopted from an article by [[Lester Bangs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.98bowery.com/punkyears/punk-art-catalogue-section-four.php |title=Punk Art Catalogue – Section IV: Suicide, Bad Boys, Tattoos |accessdate=2010-03-10 |last=Miller |first=Marc H. |date=April 20, 2009 |work=1978 Punk Art Exhibit |publisher=98Bowery.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100330100042/http://www.98bowery.com/punkyears/punk-art-catalogue-section-four.php| archivedate= March 30, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 the group dropped Paul Liebgott and added Mari Reverby on drums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fromthearchives.com/av_mr/chronology.html |title=Suicide Chronology |author= |date= |work= |publisher=FromTheArchives.org |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she didn't play in their live performances. With Bermowitz finally settling on Alan Suicide as a working name, they began to play music venues. Suicide went on to perform at the [[Mercer Arts Center]], [[Max's Kansas City]], [[CBGB]] and ultimately, achieve international recognition.

In 1980, Vega released his eponymous first solo record. It defined the frantic [[rockabilly]] style that he would use in his solo work for the next several years, with the song "Jukebox Babe" becoming a hit single in France. In 1985, he released the more commercially viable ''Just a Million Dreams,'' but was dropped from his record label after its release. The album originally was set to be produced by [[Ric Ocasek]] as a follow-up to the critically acclaimed ''[[Saturn Strip]]'' (1983), but production switched over to [[Chris Lord-Alge]] and Vega ran into several difficulties during the recording sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r59094|pure_url=yes}}|last=Valdivia|first=Victor W|title=Just a Million Dreams review|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album eschewed many of Vega's experimental traits in favor of power pop songs and he later lamented, "They took all my songs and turned them into God knows what."&lt;ref name="Suicide: No Compromise"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J2w35kE7O0AC&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=No%20Compromise%20alan%20Vega%201948&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Suicide: No Compromise |publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=2010-05-11|isbn=9780946719716 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vega teamed up with Martin Rev and Ric Ocasek again in the late eighties to produce and release the third Suicide album, ''A Way of Life'' (1988). Visual artist [[Stefan Roloff]] produced a music video for the song ''Dominic Christ'' which was released by [[Wax Trax! Records]] and Suicide went overseas to promote the album by performing the song "Surrender" in Paris which was aired on French television. Shortly thereafter, Vega met future wife and music partner Elizabeth Lamere while piecing together sound experiments that would evolve into his fifth solo album, ''Deuce Avenue'' (1990). ''Deuce Avenue'' marked his return to minimalist electronic music, similar to his work with Suicide, in which he combined drum machines and effects with free-form prose. Over the next decade he would release several more solo records as well as perform with Suicide.

In 2002, art dealer [[Jeffrey Deitch]] tracked him down after a couple of his young gallery employees "gushed" over a Suicide gig at the NYC [[Knitting Factory]].&lt;ref name="Brooklyn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klingman|first1=Jeff|title=Punk, 77: At Home With Alan Vega|url=http://www.bkmag.com/2015/12/03/punk-77-at-home-with-alan-vega/|publisher=[[Brooklyn (magazine)|Brooklyn]]|accessdate=30 March 2016|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vega constructed ''Collision Drive'', an exhibition of sculptures combining light with found objects and crucifixes.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;

Vega's tenth solo album, ''Station'', was released on [[Blast First]] Records in 2007 and was described by his colleagues as "his hardest, heaviest album for quite a while, all self-played and produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live|url=http://www.slimsmith.com/alanvega/|work=Alan Vega|publisher=Slim Smith|accessdate=December 21, 2013|date=December 2006|quote=The new live set is based around Alan's new album, "Station", his hardest, heaviest album for quite a while, all self-played and produced.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117062553/http://www.slimsmith.com/alanvega/|archivedate=January 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, British label [[Blast First|Blast First Petite]] released a limited edition Suicide 6-CD [[box set]] and monthly tribute series of 10" Vinyl EP's, to mark the occasion of Alan Vega's 70th birthday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mvremix.com/rock_blogs/2008/06/24/alan-vega-turns-60-years-old-suicide-box-set-and-single-series-set-for-release-major-artists-pay-tribute-to-suicidevega-in-year-long-monthly-series-of-limited-edition-of-10-vinyl-eps-and-dow/ |title=Alan Vega Turns 60- Years Old/Box Set |author=Paul Smith |year=2008 |work= |publisher=MV Remix Rock |accessdate=April 20, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians who contributed to the tribute series included [[The Horrors]], [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Primal Scream]], and [[Miss Kittin]].&lt;ref name="nmeprimalscream"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/primal-scream/42699| title=Primal Scream cover Suicide for new single | work = [[NME]]| publisher=[[Time Inc.]] | date = February 11, 2009| accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Lyon]], France, mounted ''Infinite Mercy'' – a major retrospective exhibit of Vega's art, curated by Mathieu Copeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mac-lyon.com/mac/sections/en/exhibitions/2009/alan_vega |title=Alan Vega, Infinite Mercy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |publisher=Musée d'art contemporain de Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the screening of two short documentary films: ''Alan Vega'' (2000) by Christian Eudeline, and ''Autour d’Alan Vega (extraits)'' (1998) by Hugues Peyret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac-lyon.com/mac/sections/fr/publics/rendez-vous/archives/2009/autour_de_lexpositi/ |title=Documentaires sur Alan Vega |accessdate=2010-04-26 |publisher=Musée d'art contemporain de Lyon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714011800/http://www.mac-lyon.com/mac/sections/fr/publics/rendez-vous/archives/2009/autour_de_lexpositi/ |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Vega suffered a [[stroke]]. That, and problems with his knees, led him to focus on less physically demanding art, such as painting, rather than music. He continued to live in downtown New York City.&lt;ref name="Brooklyn"/&gt;

In 2016, Vega made a small return to music by contributing vocals to the song "Tangerine" on French pop veteran singer [[Christophe (singer)|Christophe]]'s album ''Les Vestiges du chaos''.&lt;ref name="vestiges_booklet"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Les Vestiges du chaos |others=[[Christophe (singer)|Christophe]] |year= 2016 |type=album booklet |publisher=[[Universal Music Records|Universal Music Publishing France]] |id=478 221 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Alan Vega's final album "IT" was released posthumously on July 14 on [[Fader Label|Fader]]. The album was produced by Alan Vega, Liz Lamere, Perkin Barnes and [[Jared Artaud]] of New York City band [[The Vacant Lots]]. The album cover and inner sleeves featured Vega's original artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/74099-sucides-alan-vega-posthumous-album-it-announced-new-song-dtm-shared-listen/ |title=Suicide's Alan Vega Posthumous Album IT |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Pitchfork.com |accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two posthumous art shows "Dream Baby Dream" at [[Deitch Projects|Deitch Gallery]] and "Keep IT Alive" at [[Invisible-Exports]] exhibited Alan Vega's work in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/arts/design/alan-vega-ignored-the-art-world-it-wont-return-the-favor.html |title=Alan Vega Ignored The Art World It Won't Return The Favor |author= |date= |work= |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

On Vega's religious views, he was raised in the Jewish faith, but declared himself to be Catholic for many years due to his mother's upbringing. When asked about God he stated, "I distrust the name 'God' but, yes, I do believe in a higher power, God is in all of us," he says, before deciding: "There is an immense power. There has to be." He also shared the views of [[Spinoza]], the pantheist philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide: How the godfathers of punk kept the faith|url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/music/suicide-how-godfathers-punk-kept-faith|publisher=The Jewish Chronicle Online|author=Paul Lester|date=October 10, 2008|quote=Vega is similarly ambivalent. He alludes to the "miraculous" nature of his career with Suicide and fateful meeting with Rev, begging the question – does he believe in a higher power? "I distrust the name 'God' but, yes, I do believe in a higher power," he says. He adds that he shares the rationalist stance of Spinoza, the 17th-century Jewish philosopher and "pantheist theologian". "God is in all of us," he says, before deciding: "There is an immense power. There has to be."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Vega died in his sleep on July 16, 2016 at the age of 78.  His death was announced by musician and radio host [[Henry Rollins]], who shared an official statement from Vega's family on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |title=Alan Vega, Suicide Singer and Punk Icon, Dead at 78 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/alan-vega-suicide-singer-and-punk-icon-dead-at-78-w429537 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=17 July 2016 |issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfeiós''' ({{lang-el|Αλφειός}}, also romanized as '''Alpheus''', '''Alpheios''') is the longest river in the [[Peloponnese]], in [[Greece]]. The river is {{convert|110|km}} long,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/1515741/GreeceInFigures_2018Q1_EN.pdf/e90e9c60-ed92-40a7-a1e0-9a58d542d596 Greece in Figures January - March 2018], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; flowing through the regional units of [[Arcadia]] and [[Elis (regional unit)|Elis]]. Its source is near the village [[Valtetsi|Dorizas]], about halfway between [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] and [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopoli]] in the highlands of [[Arcadia]]. It flows southwest toward Megalopoli, where it has been diverted around open pit [[lignite]] mines. At [[Thoknia]] it receives its right tributary [[Elissonas (Alfeios)|Elissonas]], and continues north towards [[Karytaina]]. Below Karytaina the [[Lousios]] flows into the Alfeios, and the Alfeios continues northwest, passing north of [[Andritsaina]]. Near [[Tripotamia]] the rivers [[Ladon (river)|Ladon]] and [[Erymanthos (river)|Erymanthos]] flow into the Alfeios. The Alfeios then flows west along [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and empties into the [[Ionian Sea]] south of [[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]].

The ancient highway linking [[Patras]] and [[Kalamata]] ran along this river for most of the length east of Olympia.

In [[Greek mythology]], the [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] and [[Alpheus (deity)|Alpheus]] were two rivers re-routed by [[Heracles]] in his [[Labours of Hercules|fifth labour]] in order to clean the filth from the [[Augean Stables]] in a single day, a task which had been presumed to be impossible.  A poem by [[Roger Caillois]], called ''Le fleuve Alphée'' (the Alpheus River), is mainly about this river.

In the [[Aeneid]], [[Virgil]] describes the ''Alpheus'' as flowing under the sea to resurface at [[Ortygia]] on [[Sicily]], or "so runs the tale".&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'', Book III, 694–696&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Altarcard.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|A center altar card, containing the words of Consecration and other prayers]]
'''Altar cards''' are three cards placed on the [[altar]] during the [[Tridentine Mass]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Altar (in Liturgy) |volume=1 |first=Augustin Joseph |last=Schulte}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain certain prayers that the priest must say during the Mass, and their only purpose is as a memory aid, although they are usually very beautifully decorated.

==History==
Altar cards were not used before the sixteenth century, and even today they are not used when a [[bishop]] celebrates the Tridentine Mass, because he reads the entire Mass from the Pontifical Canon.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; When [[Pope Pius V|Pope St. Pius V]] restored the Missal, only the card at the middle of the altar was used, and it was called the "Tabella Secretarum".&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; The left card was added first, and then the right one was added for the sake of symmetry.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

==Content of the cards==
The altar card on the left contains the [[Last Gospel]] (John 1:1–14), which is said at the very end of the Mass. The card on the right contains the prayer for blessing the wine and water ("Deus qui humanæ substantiæ") and the ''Lavabo'' ("I shall wash", from the words of [[Psalm]] 26[25 in the Septuagint/Vulgate]:6–12).

The larger, centre card contains the ''[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]]'', the prayer ''Munda cor meum'' recited before reading the Gospel, the ''[[Nicene Creed|Credo]]'', the prayer for offering the [[Sacramental bread|Host]] (''Suscipe, Sancte Pater''), the [[Words of Institution|Words of Consecration]], and portions of the [[Canon of the Mass]]. Usually, the card's centre contains a picture of the [[Crucifixion]].

==Uses and regulations of altar cards==

The altar cards may only stand on the altar during Mass. The center one stands against the [[Church tabernacle|Tabernacle]], [[altar cross]] or other support, and the left and right ones stand against either the candlesticks or the [[Altar in the Catholic Church#Ledge|superstructural steps]] (each called a "gradine") of the altar. 

After Mass, they must either be removed or placed face downwards under the altar cover.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; The cards must be removed for the [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]].&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

An '''anchorite''' or '''anchoret''' (female: '''anchoress'''; adj. anchoritic; from {{lang-grc|ἀναχωρητής}}, ''anachōrētḗs'', "one who has retired from the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anchorite}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)naxwrhth/s|ἀναχωρητής|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb {{lang|grc|ἀναχωρέω}}, ''anachōréō'', signifying "to withdraw", "to retire"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)naxwre/w|ἀναχωρέω|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented, ascetic, or [[Eucharist]]-focused life. Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious [[hermit]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/beyond/factsheets/makhist/makhist3_prog3c.shtml BBB Radio 4: Making History – Anchorites]&lt;/ref&gt; unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting instead for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite, following which they would be considered dead to the world, a type of living [[saint]]. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature|last = LePan|first = Don|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of [[Christian monasticism]]. In the [[Catholic Church]] today, it is one of the "[[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|Other Forms of Consecrated Life]]" and governed by the same norms as the consecrated [[hermit|eremitic]] life.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM The Code of Canon Law 1983, canon 603]&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[12th century|12th]] to the [[16th century|16th]] centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male equivalents, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the [[13th century]]), dropping eventually to two to one (in the [[15th century]]). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title = Anchorites, Wombs And Tombs : Intersections Of Gender And Enclosure In The Middle Ages|last = Herbert McAvoy|first = Liz|publisher = University of Wales|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anchoritic life ==
The anchoritic life became widespread during the early and high [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|McAvoy|2010|p=96}} Examples of the dwellings of anchorites and anchoresses survive. A large number of these are in England. They tended to be a simple cell (also called '''anchorhold'''), built against one of the walls of the local village church.{{sfn|Licence|2013|p=87–9}} In [[Germanic languages|Germanic-speaking]] areas, from at least the [[10th century]], it was customary for the bishop to say [[The Office of the Dead]] as the anchorite entered his cell, to signify the anchorite's death to the world and rebirth to a spiritual life of solitary communion with God and the angels. Sometimes, if the anchorite were walled up inside the cell, the bishop would put his seal upon the wall to stamp it with his authority. Some anchorites, however, freely moved between their cell and the adjoining church.{{sfn|Licence|2013|p=123, 120}}

Most anchoritic strongholds were small, perhaps no more than {{convert|12|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} square, with three windows. Viewing the altar, hearing [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and receiving the [[Eucharist]] was possible through one small, shuttered window in the common wall facing the sanctuary, called a "[[hagioscope]]" or "squint". Anchorites would also provide spiritual advice and counsel to visitors through this window, as the anchorites gained a reputation for [[Wisdom#Religious perspectives|wisdom]].{{sfn|Licence|2013|p=158-72}} Another small window would allow access to those who saw to the anchorite's physical needs, such as food and other necessities. A third window, often facing the street, but covered with translucent cloth, would allow light into the cell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Anchorites were supposed to remain in their cell in all eventualities. Some were even burned in their cells, which they refused to leave even when pirates or other attackers were looting and burning their towns.{{sfn|Licence|2013|p=77-9}} They ate frugal meals, spending their days both in contemplative prayer and interceding on behalf of others. Anchorites' bodily waste was managed by means of a [[chamber pot]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anchoress (2008-06-02). On-line Q&amp;As. Retrieved in 2008-10 from http://theanchoressonline.com/2008/06/02/questions-comments-from-the-email/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being the physical location wherein the anchorite could embark on the journey towards union with God, the anchorhold also provided a spiritual and geographic focus for people from the wider society who came to ask for advice and spiritual guidance. Although set apart from the community at large by stone walls and specific spiritual precepts, the anchorite also lay at the very centre of that same community. The anchorhold has been called a communal 'womb' from which would emerge an idealized sense of a community's own reborn potential, both as Christians and as human subjects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An idea of their daily routine can be gleaned from an anchoritic Rule. The most widely known today is the early [[13th century]] text known as ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancrene Wisse]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another, less widely known, example is the rule known as ''De Institutione Inclusarum'' written in the [[12th century]], around 1160–62, by [[Aelred of Rievaulx]] for his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Mary Paul MacPherson in ''Treatises and the Pastoral Prayer'', Cistercian Fathers Series 2, (Kalamazoo, 1971). In English the work is variously titled ''The Eremitical Life'', ''The Rule of Life for a Recluse'' and ''The Training of Anchoresses''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the daily set devotions detailed in ''Ancrene Wisse'' would take some four hours, on top of which anchoresses would listen to services in the church, and engage in their own private prayers and devotional reading.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancrene Wisse'', trans Hugh White, (Penguin, 1993), p.viii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous anchorites ==
The earliest recorded anchorites lived in the [[3rd century]] CE. For example, [[Hilarion]] ([[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], 291–[[Cyprus]], 371) was known as the founder of anchoritic life in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], Vita Sancti Hilarionis in P. L., III, 29-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anchoritic life proved especially popular in England. Well-known anchorites include:{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
* [[Bede]] records that, prior to a conference in 602 with [[Augustine of Canterbury]], British churchmen consulted an anchorite about whether to abandon their [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Christian]] traditions for the Roman practices which Augustine was seeking to introduce.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
* Towards the end of the [[7th century]], [[Guthlac of Crowland]], related by blood to the [[Mercia|Kingdom of Mercia]], withdrew from the monastery at [[Repton]] to an island in the Lincolnshire Fens, where he lived for some 15–20 years.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancrene Wisse'', trans Hugh White, (Penguin, 1993), p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wulfric of Haselbury]] was enclosed as an anchorite in a cell built against the church in his village of Haselbury.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
* [[Christina Carpenter|Christine Carpenter]], who submitted a petition in 1329&lt;ref&gt;[http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/medieval/julian/petition.htm Petition to Become an Anchoress] University of Saint Thomas–Saint Paul, MN, http://courseweb.stthomas.edu, 2003, 2012-04-22&lt;/ref&gt; and was granted permission to become the Anchoress of [[Shere]] Church&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheredelight.com/history.html History of Shere], sheredelight.com, 2011, 2012-04-22&lt;/ref&gt; (aka. [[Grade I listed buildings in Surrey#Guildford|The Church of St. James]]), in the [[Borough of Guildford]], England. She received her food and drink from friends and family through a metal grating on the outside wall. In the interior of the church a [[quatrefoil]] shape was cut out of the wall through which she could receive the Eucharist and a [[hagioscope]] for her use for prayer and reflection. She left her cell, and in 1332 she applied again and was granted permission to be re-enclosed.&lt;ref name="Thomas2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wyndham Thomas|title=Robert Saxton: Caritas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtHDa15XkTcC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6601-1|pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Margaret Kirkby]] (possibly 1322&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"&gt;Jonathan Hughes, ‘Kirkby, Margaret (d. 1391x4)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved on 2011-05-06 from http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57764.&lt;/ref&gt; to 1391–4), an anchoress at [[Hampole]], Yorkshire for whom [[Richard Rolle]] wrote his [[vernacular]] guide ''The Form of Living''.&lt;ref&gt;Ancrene Wisse, trans Hugh White, (Penguin, 1993), p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Walter Hilton]] composed the first book of his ''Scale of Perfection'' for an unnamed enclosed woman.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, W., ''The Scale of Perfection'', tr. J. P. Clark &amp; R. Dorward ([[New York City]]: [[Paulist Fathers|Paulist Press]], 1991), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Julian of Norwich]], whose writings have left a lasting impression on Christian spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Revelations of Divine Love]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her cell, attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich]], was destroyed during an air raid during [[World War II]]. The church itself was gutted but the original walls remain, and it was rebuilt. On the site of the cell is a modern shrine to Julian.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, R., ''Julian's Cell: The Earthy Story of Julian of Norwich'' ([[Kelowna|Kelowna, B.C.]]: Northstone Publishing, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence supports the existence of a total of around 780 anchorites on 600 sites in England between 1100 and 1539 during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] ordered by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], which brought anchoritism in England to an end. Women were more numerous among the anchorites than men, especially in the [[13th century]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ancrene Wisse'', trans Hugh White, (Penguin, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

English anchorholds can still be seen at [[Chester-le-Street]] in [[County Durham]] and at [[Hartlip]] in [[Kent]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Early days ==

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan ===

Between 1883 and 1954 Laos was part of [[French Indochina]]. `Abdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion from 1892 to 1921, mentions French Indochina. `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The seventh of the tablets mentioned taking the Bahá'í Faith to [[Indochina]] and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Tablet 7) "The moment this divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of America and is propagated through the continents of [[Europe]], of [[Asia]], of [[Africa]] and of [[Australasia]], and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion..., if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], also to [[Japan]], [[Geography of Russia|Asiatic Russia]], [[Korea]], French Indochina, [[Siam]], [[Straits Settlements]], [[India]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Afghanistan]], most great results will be forthcoming."&lt;ref name="tab1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Beginnings ===

[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, claims the first Bahá'ís to arrive in Laos and Cambodia probably in 1955 (came by April, 1956, and after Laotian independence in 1954.)&lt;ref name="1st" /&gt; This was Dr. Heshmat Ta'eed, the first pioneer to Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Around the World - Laos | journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1978 | issue = 570 | page = 14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to join the Bahá'í Faith in Laos was Bui Van-an who was visiting from Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Correction | journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1978 | issue = 573 | page = 21 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1956 it is noted Bahá'ís from Laos tried to attend the regional conference in Djakarta, Indonesia but were denied visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Intercontinental Committees - Asia - First couth Asia Teaching Conference held in Djakarta | journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1956 | issue = 308 | page = 3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November seventeen Bahá'ís representing Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam met in Saigon, Vietnam for a regional conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Seventeen Bahá'ís representing… | journal = Bahá'í News |date=January 1957 | issue = 311 | page = 6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1958 the Bahá'ís of Vientiane celebrated [[World Religion Day]] with Buddhist Monks, a Sihk, a Hindu and government officials - and a Miss Banu Hassan is noted as another pioneer in Laos coming from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Four Faiths Join in Observance of World Reliqion Day in Laos | journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1958 | issue = 326 | page = 11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February the Bahá'ís in Vientiane hosted a regional conference with Bahá'ís from Vietnam and Thailand attending.&lt;ref name="BN330"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Confirmations of Spirit Recounted By Pioneer to Buddhist Thailand | journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1958 | issue = 330 | pages = 21–22 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1958 the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] is known to be first elected.&lt;ref name="BN353" /&gt; By August 1958 there is mention of a native conversion to the religion - a woman member of a black Thai ethnic minority.&lt;ref name="BN330" /&gt; In December 1958 Bahá'ís from Laos again attended an event in Saigon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = First Winter School in Saigon Attracts Baha'is of Five Nations | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1958 | issue = 325 | page = 18 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a very brief mention of a Bahá'í center in [[Vientiane]] circa 1958 where [[Thomas Anthony Dooley III]], aka Dr. Tom Dooley, picked up his Laotian translator, [[Ngoan van Hoang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = T.

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

In 1983 30 teachers of children's classes gathered for a seminar that included topics like the [[List of Bahá'ís#Central figures|Central Figures]] of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Baha'i administration]], [[Bahá'í teachings]] on loyalty to government and abstention from politics, and a viewing of Hand of the Cause [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]]'s trip turned into the movie ''The Green Light Expedition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The World; Laos| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1984 | issue = 636 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 scores of children regularly attend classes at [[Bahá'í school]]s held at the Ban Amon Bahá'í Center at the national center in Vientiane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The World; Laos| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1984 | issue = 637 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1984 other projects Bahá'ís undertook include an assembly purchasing two cows and a community garden with profits from sales going to national and local funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Social/economic development - Part II of our world-wide survey; (section on Laos)| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1986 | issue = 637 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, among the many refugees who came to the United States following the [[Vietnam War]], were 200 [[Hmong people|Hmong]] Bahá'ís from Laos who settled in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Portland Bahá'í History |work=Official Website of the Portland Metro Bahai Faith Communities |publisher=Portland Metro Bahai Faith Communities |year=2008 |url=http://portlandmetro.bahai.us/portland-bahai-history |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105154325/http://portlandmetro.bahai.us/portland-bahai-history |archivedate=2008-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í community of Portland set up an after-school tutoring project initially aiming at war-torn Liberia but lacking practical connection turned to serve the Hmong children in the area around 2000-2001 and has since become more organized into a project - the Roses After School Mentoring Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Venema |first=Sheri |title=Preserving presence The Hmong try to maintain their culture through the younger generation |newspaper=The Oregonian |pages= |date=2003-07-26 |url=http://www.bahaindex.com/en/news/1-general-news/2736-preserving-presence-the-hmong-try-to-maintain-their-culture-through-the-younger-generation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223011426/http://www.bahaindex.com/en/news/1-general-news/2736-preserving-presence-the-hmong-try-to-maintain-their-culture-through-the-younger-generation |archivedate=2010-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focus on internal development ===

[[File:Laos Baha'i gathering 2009.jpg|thumb|right|A Baha'i gathering in [[Vientiane]] in 2009.]]
In 1983 there were nineteen delegates for the national convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = National Conventions - Cause gains momentum on many fronts; Laos| journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1983 | issue = 631 |issn=0195-9212 | pages = 2–3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone again toured Laos including giving public talks as well as visiting refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The World - Thailand| journal = Bahá'í News |date=February 1989 | issue = 695 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the community in Laos has been frustrated. After experiencing quick growth in the early 1970s (see above), in the 1980s the community had reached approximately eight thousand adherents and four centers: two in [[Vientiane]], one in [[Vientiane Province]], in the northwest and one in [[Kaysone Phomvihane (District)|Kaysone Phomvihane]], Savannakhet Province mid-south with smaller numbers of Bahá'ís just north of Savannakhet in [[Khammouane Province]] and in the city of [[Pakxe]] in the far south&lt;ref name="gov2006" /&gt; and smaller populations in other provinces.&lt;ref name="gov2001" /&gt; The land on which the four Bahá'í centers were located was approved by the Lao government for use by the Bahá'ís. Additionally, the government has given official approval for Bahá'ís to use land where they already have a cemetery. The Bahá'ís were planning to construct new spiritual centers in Savannkhet's Dong Bang Village and in Lat Khouay Village near Vientiane. They have received both village and district level approval to use the land, but were awaiting the official land deeds from the District Land Offices. The Bahá'í spiritual assemblies in Vientiane and Kaysone Phomvihane cities practiced freely, but smaller communities in Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces have periodically faced restrictions by local authorities. From 2001&lt;ref name="gov2001" /&gt; some local officials in [[Luang Prabang]] in the north central area acted harshly toward Bahá'ís and Christians. Examples included forced renunciations that sometimes involved forced participation in animist traditions, including the drinking of animal blood. Other officials forced some believers to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes against their will. Efforts by local officials to force Bahá'ís to renounce their faith continued in some areas. In more isolated cases, provincial authorities instructed their officials to monitor and arrest Bahá'ís and other religions. In some cases in 2005 some Bahá'ís were threatened with arrest or expulsion from their villages in some provinces if they did not comply&lt;ref name="gov2005" /&gt;

The Vientiane Bahá'í assembly previously encountered difficulties establishing its ownership of the Bahá'í center in Vientiane; however, in 2005 authorities granted approval for use of the property by the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="gov2005" /&gt; Bahá'í local spiritual assemblies and the national spiritual assembly routinely held Bahá'í [[Nineteen Day Feast]]s and celebrated all [[Bahá'í calendar#Holy days|Bahá'í holy days]]. The National Spiritual Assembly based in Vientiane met regularly and has sent delegations to the [[Universal House of Justice]] in [[Haifa]], Israel. The Government prohibited foreigners from proselytizing, although it permitted foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with religious affiliations to work in the country. Foreigners caught distributing religious materials could be arrested or deported. Decree 92 specifically authorized proselytizing by local citizens, providing the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) (see [[Constitution of Laos]]) approves the activity. In practice the authorities interpreted proselytizing as an illegal activity that creates divisiveness in society.

Although Decree 92 authorized the printing of non-Buddhist religious texts and allowed religious materials to be imported from abroad, it also required permission for such activities from the LFNC. As early as 2005 there are reports the LFNC did not authorize Bahá'ís to print their own religious materials, although they had been seeking permission to do so for several years.&lt;ref name="gov2005" /&gt; Some believers bring religious materials into the country; however, these persons face possible arrest.

As of 2009 outreach is underway in [[Oudomsai]], [[Xiang Khouang]], [[Luang Prabang]], and [[Salavan Province|Salavan]] Provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. State Department | title = Laos - International Religious Freedom Report 2009 | publisher = The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affair | date = 2009-10-26 | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127276.htm | accessdate = 2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a 2000 estimate of more than 1,200 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Larkin | first = Barbara | authorlink = Barbara Larkin | title = International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State | publisher = DIANE Publishing | year = 2001 | location = Washington D.C., USA | page = 200 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OTx1qbA8OW8C&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200 | doi = | id =| isbn = 978-0-7567-1229-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 estimate of approximately eight thousand.&lt;ref name="gov2008" /&gt; In 2008 Bahá'ís estimated their population at 8,500 adherents.&lt;ref name="gov2008"&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. State Department | title = Laos - International Religious Freedom Report 2008 | publisher = The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affair | date = 2008-09-19 | url =https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108412.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 13,960 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05" /&gt;

'''Beglopopovtsy''' ({{lang-rus|Беглопоповцы|p=bʲɪɡləpɐˈpoft͡sɨ}}, "runaway [[priest]]s") was one of the denominations among the [[Popovtsy]], who belonged to the [[Old Believers]].

Since none of the bishops joined the Old Believers movement after the [[Raskol|schism of 1666-67]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], except bishop [[Paul of Kolomna]], who was executed, ordained priests of the old rite would have soon become extinct. Two responses appeared to this dilemma: the “priestist” Old Believers (поповцы ([[Popovtsy]])) and the non-priestist Old Believers (беспоповцы ([[Bespopovtsy]])).

The Beglopopovtsy movement formed in the late 17th century and included priests, who had "deserted" the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (hence, the name "beglopopovtsy", meaning "with deserted priests"). They settled in the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] region beyond the [[Volga River]] (along the [[Kerzhenets River|Kerzhenets]] and [[Belbash River]]s), around [[Starodub]], [[Chernigov]] (modern ''Chernihiv'', [[Ukraine]]), and on the [[Vetka Island]] (''see [[Vetkovskoye soglasie]]''). In the second half of the 18th century, the Beglopopovtsy formed a group at the [[Rogozhskoye cemetery]] in [[Moscow]]. 

At the beginning, all priestist Old Believers were beglopopovtsy. They represented the more moderate conservative opposition, who strove to continue religious and church life as it had existed before the reforms of Nikon. They recognized ordained priests from the new style Russian Orthodox church who joined the Old Believers and who had denounced the Nikonian reforms. In 1846 the priestist Old Believers convinced Amvrosii (Popovich, 1791-1863) deposed [[Greek Orthodox]] bishop (who had been removed under Turkish pressure) to become an Old Believer and to consecrate three Russian Old Believers priests as bishops. In 1859, the number of Old Believer bishops in Russia reached ten, and they established their own episcopate, the so-called [[Belokrinitskaya hierarchy]]. 

Not all priestist Old Believers recognized this new established hierarchy, which provoked a schism within the priestist Old Believers. For various reasons many could not accept this so-called [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]]. From this time priestist Old Believers became divided into two groups: those who accepted the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy and those who did not. These dissenters were called '''beglopopovtsy''' and obtained their own hierarchy only in the 1920s, the so-called [[Novozybkovskaya Hierarchy]] or [[Russian Old-Orthodox Church]]. From that moment the denomination '''beglopopovtsy''' no longer existed and the term became rarely used.

'''Bispanthi/Visa panth''' is one of the [[Digambara]] [[Jain]] sects that follows the leadership of the [[Bhattaraka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=People of India: Delhi |authorlink=Kumar Suresh Singh |last=Singh |first=Kumar Suresh |author2=Tapash Kumar Ghosh|author3=Surendra Nath |pages=258–259 |year=1996 |publisher=Anthropological Survey of India |isbn=978-81-7304-096-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society |last=Carrithers |first=Michael |author2=Caroline Humphrey |page=205 |year=1991 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-36505-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the other one being Terapanthi that opposed the Bhattarakas.

The modern differences between the two sects include use of flowers and fruits during worship, use of milk and other substances during anointing, and the worship of Shasan devatas like Goddess Padmavati. They are accepted by the Bispanthis, but rejected by the Terapanthis.
 
Some 20th century Bispanth acharyas are Prathamacharya Charitrya Chakarvarthi [[Shantisagar]] whose emergence was supported by the local Bhattarakas. Many monks belonging to his tradition such as Acharya [[Subalasagar]], Acharya [[Sanmathisagar]], Acharya Vidyananda, Acharya [[Vardhamansagar]], Acharya [[Vishudsagar]] are regarded to be Bispanthis. Acharya [[Vidyasagar (Jain monk)|Vidyasagar]], a disciple of [[Acharya Gyansagar]], is considered to be a Terapanthis, even though [[Acharya Gyansagar]] himself derived his tradition from Acharya Santisagar. However most Digambar monks do not use actually use either labels.  Aryika pramuk [[Gyanmati Mataji]] and her sangha regards itself to be representing Bispanth.

Traditionally, Jains have had two prime sects of [[Digambara]] and [[Svetambara]]. They were further subdivided into others on their thought schools. Where [[Digambar Terapanth]] professes 13 ways, the Bispanthis professed 20 ways to attain [[Moksha|liberation]]. (''Bis+panthi = Twenty+Follower of a way.'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=JJMxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA222|title=Bihar (Patna city) and Shahabad: Volume 1 of The History, Antiquities, Topography, and Statistics of Eastern India|first=|publisher=W.

The '''''Blood Bowl Sutra''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 血盆經; [[pinyin]]: Xuèpénjīng, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: Ketsubon Kyō) is an apocryphal Mahayana sutra of Chinese origin. The earliest version of this text was likely composed around the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th.

==Overview==
The Blood Bowl Sutra describes how [[Maudgalyayana|Maudgalyāyana]], disciple of the Buddha famous for his supernatural or magical powers, descended to hell to save his mother. He finds her in the  company of women who are tormented by the hell wardens and are forced to drink their own menstrual blood. They are punished like this because the blood produced by their bodies pollutes the ground and offends the earth gods, or ends up in rivers from which the water to make tea for holy men is drawn.

==Belief==
===China===
===Japan===
The belief that women descend to the underworld shortly after childbirth has been present in Japanese folklore for quite some time. Story 9 of Volume 3 in the [[Nihon Ryōiki]] tells of how a woman died in labor and went to hell.

Despite the [[Ōjōyōshū]] being one of the most important texts to describe hell, it bears no mention of the Blood Pool Hell. It is possible that the nature of hell as presented in the Blood Bowl Sutra was not introduced to Japanese religious thought until the [[Muromachi period]]. 
At [[Risshakuji|Yama-dera]] temple, there is a pool called the "Blood Pond." It is said that at one time, the Blood Bowl Sutra was used for dedicatory services to women who had died in childbirth. A similar ceremony was likely held at [[Gangō-ji]].
Until relatively recently, ceremonies surrounding the Blood Bowl Sutra were also held at [[Shōsen-ji]] temple. Believers would enclose a copy of the Blood Bowl Sutra in women's coffins in order to save them from being condemned to the [[Blood Pond Hell]]. A copy of the sutra discovered at [[Saidai-ji]] appears to have been used in a similar fashion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">The '''Bodongpa''' or Bodong tradition, is one of the smaller traditions of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] falling outside the classification of the four main schools.{{sfn|Sudbury|2008}}

==History==
Bodong E Monastery ({{bo|w=bo dong e dgon pa}}), located in Yutok ({{bo|w=g.yu thog}}), in modern Zhaxigang ({{bo|w=bkra shis sgang shang}}), [[Lhatse County]], was the main monastery of the Bodong tradition.&lt;ref name=TBRC_Bodong-E&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=G244| title=bo dong e dgon pa |website=TBRC|publisher=[[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center]]| accessdate =2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first established in 1049 by the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)]] teacher Mudra Chenpo ({{bo|w=bka 'dams pa dge bshes tra mu chen po}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=བོད་ཀྱི་དགོན་སྡེ་ཁག་གཅིག་གི་སྤྲོད་མདོར་བསྡུས།|author=blo bzang chos ʼbyor|page= | publisher=mi rigs dpe skrun khang|isbn=9787105081936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodong tradition itself goes back to Bodong Rinchen Tsemo, who received teachings from Drubthob Semo Chewa. Its most renowned figure, often regarded as its founder, was the Bodong Penchen [[Lénam Gyelchok]] ({{bo|w=las rnam rgyal phyogs}}, 1376-1451),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=phyogs las rnam rgyal|url=http://www.tbrc.org/?locale=en#!rid=P2627|website=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose seat was at this monastery.  Bodong Penchen authored over one hundred and thirty-five volumes and is known as the most prolific writer in Tibetan history. His most famous work is the ''Compendium of Suchness'' ({{bo|w=de nyid 'dus pa}})  comprising one hundred and thirty-three volumes having about 500 folios (1000 pages) in each. The extensive version contains one hundred and ten volumes; the medium version, twenty volumes; the condensed version, two volumes; and the extremely condensed version, one volume and this encyclopaedic work is considered the foundation of the tradition.

[[Je Tsongkhapa]] studied at Bodong E Monastery with the Lotsawa Namkha Zangpo ({{bo|w=lo tsā ba nam mkha' bzang po}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bo dong e dgon pa|url=http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=G244|website=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; who taught him the ''Mirror of Poetry'' ({{bo|w=snyan ngag me long}}).

A well-known [[tulku]] of this tradition is [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]], one of the few female incarnation lineages of Tibetan Buddhism.

'''Carlo Carretto''' (2 April 1910 - 4 October 1988) was an Italian religious author of the Catholic congregation of the Little Brothers of the Gospel.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Born in a peasant family from the [[Langhe]], Caretto was the third of six children, four of whom became religious. Early in his life, the family moved to a suburban neighborhood in [[Turin]], where there was a [[Salesian]] oratory which would have much influence on the formation of the whole Carretto family. The Salesian spirit would also be felt in the professional life that Carretto began at the age of eighteen as an elementary teacher in [[Gattinara]].

=== Social Activism ===

He entered the youth sector of the Catholic Action in Turin at the age of twenty-three by the invitation of its then president Luigi Gedda. After completing his studies, he graduated in Philosophy from Turin. From 1936 to 1952, his envolvement in Catholic Action grew until he became its National Youth President. In 1940, after winning a competition, he was sent to be the Educational Director in Bono, Sardinia. But his envolvement there was short due to conflicts with the [[Fascist]] regime and the influence his teachings exerted on young people beyond the bounds of the school. So he was sent to [[Isili]] and then back to Piedmont. There he was allowed to resume his work as a teaching director at [[Condove]], in [[Susa Valley]], about 30 kilometers from Turin. With the advent of the [[Italian Social Republic]], he received from Rome the task of reorganizing the structure of the Catholic Action of Northern Italy. From a business point of view, he was removed from the list of teaching directors and kept under surveillance for not having joined the regime.

At the end of the war in 1945, Caretto and Gedda jointly created the National Association of Catholic Masters in Rome. In 1946 he became the national president of the Italian Youth of Catholic Action (GIAC). In 1948, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the foundation of Catholic Action, he organized a large youth demonstration in Rome which became known as the famous gathering of the three hundred thousand "Green Basque". Shortly thereafter he founded the International Office of Catholic Youth, of which he became the vice president. In 1949, with his friend Enrico Dossi, he created a new agency within the GIAC dedicated to young people's tourism. In time it would become the Youth Tourism Center (CTG), of which he was the first national president.

In 1952 Carretto found himself in disagreement with an important part of the Catholic political world that desired an alliance with the [[Right-wing politics|political right]]. He had to resign from his position as president of GIAC. It was at this time that he decided to join the religious congregation of the Little Brothers of Jesus which had been founded by René Voillaume and inspired by Charles de Foucauld.

=== Religious Life ===

On December 8, 1954 he left for the novitiate of El Abiodh, near Oran, [[Algeria]]. For ten years he lived an eremitical life in the [[Sahara]] composed of prayer, silence and work, an experience he expressed in ''Letters from the Desert'', as in all the books he would later write. The same experience fed his whole life and his subsequent action. There he rediscovered his old friend Arturo Paoli, who also passed from the leadership of Catholic Action to religious life in the [[Sahara Desert]].

He returned to Italy in 1965 and settled in Spello, [[Umbria]], where Leonello Radi (a former president of GIAC) managed to have the fraternity of the Little Brothers of the Gospel entrust the former Franciscan convent of San Girolamo, near the cemetery. Brother Carlo was enthusiastic about the new arrangement. Leonello Radi said: "the main activity of Carlo Carretto was the eight hours of prayer a day, I carried it I do not know how many times with my red beetle, during the trip we talked and, above all, we prayed". Soon the spirit of initiative of Carretto and the prestige it enjoys opened the community to the reception of those who, believers or not, wished to spend a period of reflection and search for faith lived in prayer, in manual work and in the exchange of experiences. At the convent where the Fraternity was, many country houses scattered on Mount Subasio were added, transformed into hermitages named after various holy figures. For over twenty years, Coretto was the animator of this center flanked by its many collaborators, friends and benefactors, including the Roman engineer Renato Di Tillo who was very important for the activity of the group and a fraternal friend also of [[Mother Teresa|Saint Teresa of Calcutta]].

=== Later life ===

During these years he continued his activities as a writer. One notable book of that period was the ''Small Family Church'' which provoked controversy in the Catholic world over whether the ideas it expressed align with Christian morality. A man of the word and of the pen, he used these two means very effectively to communicate to others his "discoveries" and his experience of faith.

His books have been translated into many languages creating a group of readers in many countries around the world. Consequently, he was often invited  to bring his word to conferences and spiritual meetings. His deep interiority did not isolate him from the world and from his problems but instead pushed him to take an interest in the spirits of "prophecy" (i.e. preaching) and service.

Despite his retirement, he has always participated in the events of Italian society. In 1974, during the debate around the referendum on divorce, he joined the group of "Catholics for the No", opposed to the repeal of the law on divorce already in force.

However, the Italian Catholic Action remained his first love, never forgotten. In 1986, when internal conflicts with the National Presidency of ACI pushed Pope John Paul II to recall the association to a more visible commitment in the world, Carretto wrote a Letter to Peter in which he passionately defends the "religious choice" pursued by the ACI of the new Statute and its President Alberto Monticone.

Carlo Carretto died in his hermitage of Saint Jerome in Spello on the night of Tuesday 4 October 1988, the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, of whom he had been a biographer.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
The '''chaplain general''' is a senior chaplain in non-church organisations, such as the British and Canadian armies, and is responsible for the supervision of chaplains conducting religious services and ceremonies, representing the Christian faith in that organisation, and providing pastoral care and support within the organisation.

==History==
The post of Chaplain-General in the British Army dates from 1796.&lt;ref name=Roper1998&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roper |first1=Michael |title=The Records of the War Office and Related Departments, 1660-1964 |date=1998 |publisher=Public Record Office |location=Kew, Surrey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]], the chaplain-general [[John Taylor Smith]] was equivalent to a [[major general]] and under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State. [[Llewellyn Henry Gwynne]] was from July 1915 deputy chaplain-general of the army in France, with the relative rank of major-general. Both had been colonial bishops prior to appointment.

In the [[Second World War]], the head of chaplaincy in the [[British Army]] was an ([[Anglican]]) chaplain-general, who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Symons, Chaplain-General to the Forces, 1939-44&lt;/ref&gt; An Assistant Chaplain-General was a Chaplain 1st class (full [[Colonel]]) and a senior Chaplain was a Chaplain 2nd class ([[Lieutenant Colonel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brumwell, P. Middleton (1943) ''The Army Chaplain: the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; the duties of chaplains and morale''. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 the first [[Bishop to the Forces]] was appointed; the Bishop is a suffragan of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the full title of the Bishop to the Forces is "The Archbishop of Canterbury's Episcopal Representative to the Armed Forces". The Bishop to the Forces is not a [[military chaplain]].&lt;ref name=crockfords100th&gt;''[[Crockford's Clerical Directory]] 2008/2009 (100th ed.)'', London: Church House Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7151-1030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current holder of the office is [[Nigel Stock (bishop)|Nigel Stock]], [[Bishop at Lambeth]]. There is sometimes confusion between the (Anglican) "Bishop ''to'' the Forces" and the (Roman Catholic) [[Bishopric of the Forces|"Bishop ''of'' the Forces"]]: for this reason the latter is normally given his title in full, i.e. "The Roman Catholic Bishop of the Forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/Catholic-Church/The-Church-in-England-and-Wales/bishopric_of_the_forces |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723200543/http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/Catholic-Church/The-Church-in-England-and-Wales/bishopric_of_the_forces |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy }}. ''The Catholic Church in England and Wales: the Bishopric of the Forces''. Retrieved on 9 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three armed services has a chief chaplain (ranking as an archdeacon), for the navy the [[Chaplain of the Fleet]], for the army the Chaplain-General, and for the Royal Air Force the [[Chaplain-in-Chief]].&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Almanack''; 1972; 1988. London: J. Whitaker &amp; Sons; pp. 459; (1988) 464&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of Army Chaplaincy]] holds archive material and information relating to the history of the Chaplains General to the British Army both past and present.

==Outside Anglicanism==
[[Military Chaplain#Annual International Chiefs of Chaplains Conference|''Chaplain General'']] is also used as a term outside the Anglican Church, referring to the senior chaplain in a nation's military (sometimes called the ''Chief of Chaplains'', [[Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States|as in the United States military]]). Some nations, like [[South Africa]], [[Israel]], and [[Canada]], have one Chaplain General or Chief of Chaplains for the military as a whole; others, like the [[United States]], have one for each branch of the armed forces; while others have one for each major religion or faith group represented among its military personnel.

He studied politics and sociology at [[University College Dublin]], and subsequently attended the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]]. O'Dowd did not obtain a degree from UCD, telling the UCD student newspaper the ''College Tribune'': "I didn't finish my degree. The politics part of it was fine, but I was doing sociology as well and I could never bring myself to find an interest in it."&lt;ref name="collegetribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegetribune.ie/chris-o-dowd-talks-to-donie-o-sullivan|title= Standing out from the Crowd|author=Donie O'Sullivan|date=4 April 2012|publisher=[[College Tribune]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to ''[[The University Observer]]'', [[Ógra Fianna Fáil]] and was active in UCD Dramsoc and the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]].&lt;ref name="collegetribune"/&gt; O'Dowd was an avid member of [[Ógra Fianna Fáil]] and engaged in promotional canvassing for the party amongst UCD's student populace, it was during this time he coined the slogan 'Vote Young Fianna Fáil, for [[hurling]] in the halls'. The slogan was a huge success due to O'Dowd's improvisation with classmate Ronan Kirby's hurley. O'Dowd said in ''The College Tribune''&lt;ref name="collegetribune"/&gt; that he was personally thanked by [[Éamon de Valera]]'s ghost in a dream.

==Career==

He starred in the 2009 film ''[[The Boat That Rocked]]'', released in Canada and the U.S. as ''Pirate Radio''. The film was inspired by the story of offshore pirate broadcasters [[Radio Caroline]]. O'Dowd plays Simon, the station's breakfast DJ."The breakfast jock on Radio Caroline at the time was Tony Blackburn, so there's definitely an element of him in it,"&lt;ref name="suicidegirls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Chris+O'Dowd%3A+The+IT+Man+From+The+IT+Crowd|title=Chris O'Dowd: The IT Man From The IT Crowd|author=Nicole Powers|date=9 May 2009|publisher=[[SuicideGirls]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; says O'Dowd of his character. "And then I called in different Irish DJs that would have been contemporaries of Tony Blackburn at the time, a guy called [[Larry Gogan]] and a couple of other people."&lt;ref name="suicidegirls"/&gt;

O'Dowd starred opposite [[Sienna Miller]] in the film ''[[Hippie Hippie Shake]]'', which is about the groundbreaking '60s magazine, ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]''.

In April 2009 it was announced that O'Dowd had been cast in [[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|a remake]] of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' as General Edward. "It's shooting in [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] from the end of April", he said, shortly after his participation was announced. "I'm just going back to England to learn how to ride a horse... I'm a general in the army, so there's going to be a little bit of horse riding. I think it's going to be really fun though, we're all kind of learning together."&lt;ref name="suicidegirls"/&gt;

O'Dowd appeared in the 2010 film ''[[Dinner for Schmucks]]'', an American version of the French farce, ''[[Le Dîner de Cons (film)|Le Dîner de Cons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.sky.com/it-crowd-chris-odowd |title=Chris O'Dowd Interview |publisher=[[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218030646/http://tv.sky.com/it-crowd-chris-odowd |archivedate=18 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared on panel show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' (Season 21, episode 11), and starred in an [[ITV2]] comedy series entitled ''[[FM (2009 TV series)|FM]]''.

Despite being raised in a [[Roman Catholic]] family, O'Dowd has been a lifelong [[atheist]], and has developed an [[antitheist]] philosophy as he has aged.

'''Christian Schools International''' ('''CSI''') was established in 1920 and supports [[Christian school]] [[teacher]]s who want [[Bible]]-based [[textbooks]] for their classrooms, [[Principal (school)|principals]] and school administrators investigating [[Employee benefit|employee benefit plans]], Christian [[school board]] members seeking information about governance, and parents looking for a [[Christian]] school for their children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2740">In many denominations of the [[Christian Church]], a '''Church usher''' (not to be confused with church greeter) is responsible for seating guests and maintaining the order and security of services. The role of a church usher is typically a volunteer position, and in the past was often considered one of honor, particularly if a church committee selects an usher by nomination.

== History ==
The concept of an usher is not new. In the [[Old Testament]], there were positions addressed as "Doorkeepers" or "[[Gatekeeper]]s", and their roles were very similar.&lt;sup&gt;(2 Kings 22:4) (1 Chronicles 9:17-27) (Psalms 84:10)&lt;/sup&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Jesus' [[Twelve Disciples|disciples]] could be considered ushers, in the sense that they:
*Prepared the way for Jesus
*Kept order among those listening to Christ
*Served food to the audience
*Cleaned up after a service, such as the [[Feeding of the Five Thousand]].

== Organization ==
Churches often have a group of people that work as ushers led by a head usher. The ushers typically receive their instructions from the head usher. The head usher receives instructions directly from the pastor and is responsible for training and scheduling ushers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pastoralcareinc.com/resources/usher-s-greeter-s-manual/|title=Church usher manual|website=www.pastoralcareinc.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dress ===
Traditionally ushers wore three piece suits.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/july-web-only/church-ushers-vital-priestly-role.html|title=The Church Usher's Vital Priestly Role|work=ChristianityToday.com|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most contemporary churches, a more casual dress style has become acceptable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Duties ==
The church usher has various duties. Depending on the church's denomination, size, and preferences, ushers may perform some or all of the following:
* Seat guests
* Collect the [[tithe]]s and [[:wikt:offering|offering]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Distribute [[Eucharist|communion]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Keep order at the entrance of the sanctuary
* Distribute bulletins and service programs
* Provide security&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Administer emergency procedures&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Handle disturbances&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Clint Eastwood series}}
'''Clinton Eastwood Jr.''' (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and political figure. After achieving success in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] TV series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', he rose to international fame with his role as the [[Man with No Name]] in Italian filmmaker [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Dollars Trilogy|''Dollars'' Trilogy]] of [[spaghetti Western]]s during the 1960s, and as [[antihero]] cop [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in the five ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring [[cultural icon]] of [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="Fischer, Landy &amp; Smith"&gt;Fischer, Landy &amp; Smith, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitses, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work in the Western film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992) and the sports drama ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], as well as receiving nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Eastwood's greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'' (1978) and its sequel, the action comedy ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'' (1980), after adjustment for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clint Eastwood Movie Box Office Results |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=clinteastwood.htm |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular films include the Western ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), the psychological thriller ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'' (1971), the crime film ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), the Western ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), the prison film ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), the action film ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'' (1982), the suspense thriller ''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984), the Western ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), the war films ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968), ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' (1970), and ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' (1986), the action thriller ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' (1993), the romantic drama ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' (1995), and the drama ''[[Gran Torino]]'' (2008).

In addition to directing many of his own [[star vehicle]]s, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003) and the war film ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, the drama ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (2008), and the South African biographical political sports drama ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' (2009). The war drama biopic ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) set box-office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film.

Eastwood received considerable critical praise in [[France]] for several films, including some that were not well received in the United States.&lt;!--which ones?--&gt; Eastwood has been awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he became a recipient of the [[Commander]] of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], and in 2007 he was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] medal. In 2000, Eastwood was awarded the Italian [[Venice Film Festival]] [[Golden Lion]] for lifetime achievement.

Since 1967, Eastwood has run his own production company, [[Malpaso Productions]], which has produced all but four of his American films. Starting in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as mayor of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]], a non-partisan office.

==Early life==
{{main|Early life and work of Clint Eastwood}}
Eastwood was born on May 31, 1930, in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr. (1906–1970) and Ruth (Runner) Wood (1909–2006). Ruth later took the surname of her second husband, John Belden Wood (1913–2004), whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr.&lt;ref name="McGilligan231"&gt;McGilligan, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was nicknamed "Samson" by the hospital nurses because he weighed {{convert|11|lb|6|oz|kg}} at birth.&lt;ref name="At80"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eastwood-at-80-1986872.html|title=Eastwood at 80|last1=Amara|first1=Pavan|last2=Sundberg|first2=Charlotte|date=May 30, 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnYapQvw?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eastwood-at-80-1986872.html|archivedate=January 17, 2011|location=London|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 08"&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama|title=Gentle Man Clint|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 2, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnYkOYuP?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama|archivedate=January 17, 2011|location=London, UK|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt (born 1934).&lt;ref name="Eliot14"&gt;Eliot, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He is descended from [[Mayflower]] passenger [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]], and through this line is the 12th generation of his family born in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayflowerhistory.com/famous-descendants|title=Famous Descendants|work=MayflowerHistory.com|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zmi12"&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood attended [[Piedmont Middle School]],&lt;ref name="Cah123"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 123 (interviewer Tim Cahill)&lt;/ref&gt; where he was held back due to poor academic scores; records indicate he also had to attend summer school.&lt;ref name="McGilligan34"/&gt; From January 1945 until at least January 1946, he attended [[Piedmont High School (California)|Piedmont High School]], but was asked to leave for writing an obscene suggestion to a school official on the athletic field scoreboard, and for burying someone in [[effigy]] on the school lawn, on top of other school infractions.&lt;ref name="McGilligan36"&gt;McGilligan, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to [[Oakland Technical High School]] and was scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, although it is not clear if he ever did.&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; "Clint graduated from the airplane shop. I think that was his major," joked classmate Don Kincaid.&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed "I don't think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere."&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; "I think what happened is he just went off and started having a good time. I just don't think he finished high school," explained Fritz Manes,&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood, who remained associated with him until their falling out in the mid-1980s.

Eastwood held a number of jobs, including as a lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy.&lt;ref name="Eliot17"&gt;Eliot, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has said that he tried to enroll at [[Seattle University]] in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eastwood|first1=Clint|title=Eastwood: In His Own Words|url=http://www.clinteastwood.net/ownwords|website=ClinteastWood.net|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead was drafted into the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="Eliot1819"&gt;Eliot, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; "He always dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might be some sort of hero.

==Career==
===1950s: Early career struggles===
{{main|Clint Eastwood in the 1950s}}
According to the CBS press release for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] (known then as Universal-International) film company was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director.&lt;ref name="McGilligan52"&gt;McGilligan, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="McGilligan52" /&gt; While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman [[Irving Glassberg]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan52"/&gt; Glassberg arranged for an audition under [[Arthur Lubin]], who, although very impressed with Eastwood's appearance and stature, then 6'4" (193&amp;nbsp;cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything".&lt;ref name="McGilligan60"&gt;McGilligan, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week.&lt;ref name="McGilligan60" /&gt; After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'' but was rejected by [[Joseph Pevney]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan63"&gt;McGilligan, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]] in ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'' (1955), a sequel to the recently released ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.&lt;ref name="McGilligan64"&gt;McGilligan, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's ''[[Lady Godiva of Coventry]]'', won a role in February 1955, playing "Jonesy", a sailor in ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', where he played a squadron pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald &amp; Magers, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours' work into the film ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with ''Law Man'', also known as ''[[Star in the Dust]]''.&lt;ref name="McGilligan81"&gt;McGilligan, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2, 1955, on [[NBC]]'s ''Allen in Movieland'', which starred comedian [[Steve Allen]], actor [[Tony Curtis]] and swing musician [[Benny Goodman]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan86"&gt;McGilligan, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955.&lt;ref name="Eliot36"&gt;Eliot, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood played "Tom" in (1956) ''[[Star in the Dust ]]'' with Richard Boone. Eastwood joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in ''[[The First Traveling Saleslady]]'' (1956) and later hired him for ''[[Escapade in Japan]]'', without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling.&lt;ref name="McGilligan85"&gt;McGilligan, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the advice of [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]], his financial advisor, he changed talent agencies to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Reader's Digest'' series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a ''Highway Patrol'' episode.&lt;ref name="McGilligan85" /&gt; In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in ''[[The West Point Story (TV series)|West Point]]'' series and a suicidal gold prospector on ''[[Death Valley Days]]''.&lt;ref name="McGilligan87"&gt;McGilligan, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of ''[[Navy Log]]'' and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance on ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' opposite [[James Garner]] as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money.&lt;ref name="McGilligan87" /&gt; Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in the French picture ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'' and played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in ''[[Ambush at Cimarron Pass]]'', a film which Eastwood viewed disastrously and professes to be the lowest point of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1996), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGilligan93"&gt;McGilligan, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the breakthrough in his career he had long been searching for.&lt;ref name="McGilligan95"&gt;McGilligan, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eliot45"&gt;Eliot, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Eastwood to feel comfortable with the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miller, Kenneth|url=http://www.readersdigest.com.au/content/rd-face-to-face-clint-eastwood/|title=RD Face to Face: Clint Eastwood|publisher=Reader's Digest Australia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726195125/http://www.readersdigest.com.au/content/rd-face-to-face-clint-eastwood/|archivedate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1996), p.29&lt;/ref&gt; It took just three weeks for ''Rawhide'' to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an [[Emmy]], it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961.&lt;ref name="McGilligan110"&gt;McGilligan, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rawhide'' years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough.&lt;ref name="McGilligan110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McGilligan111"&gt;McGilligan, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1963 ''Rawhide'' was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script; it was canceled in the middle of the 1965–66 television season.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of ''Rawhide''{{'}}s cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
{{main|Clint Eastwood in the 1960s}}
[[File:Clint Eastwood-Rawhide publicity.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity photo for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', 1961]]
In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on ''Rawhide'', [[Eric Fleming]], rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called ''A Fistful of Dollars'', to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown [[Sergio Leone]].&lt;ref name="McG126"&gt;McGilligan, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Harrison (actor)|Richard Harrison]] suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his ''Rawhide'' image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven&amp;nbsp;weeks' work, with a bonus of a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] automobile upon completion.&lt;ref name="Eliot59"&gt;Eliot, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McG128"&gt;McGilligan, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood later spoke of the transition from a television western to ''A Fistful of Dollars'': "In ''Rawhide'' I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an anti-hero."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was instrumental in creating the [[Man with No Name]] character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the "mask" he was attempting to create for the loner character.&lt;ref name="McG131"&gt;McGilligan, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Fistful of Dollars'' proved a landmark in the development of [[spaghetti Western]]s, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous [[antihero]]. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; and he was re-hired to star in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]], the rights to ''For a Few Dollars More'' and the final film of the trilogy (''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'') were sold to [[United Artists]] for about $900,000.&lt;ref name="McG148"&gt;McGilligan, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1966, Eastwood met producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named ''[[Le Streghe]]'' ("The Witches") opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress [[Silvana Mangano]].&lt;ref name="McG150"&gt;McGilligan, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's nineteen-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please the critics, one writing that "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'."&lt;ref name="McG151"&gt;McGilligan, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later Eastwood began work on the third ''Dollars'' film, ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. [[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. "I know about these things," he said. "Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can."&lt;ref name="McG156"&gt;McGillagan, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word "Vaya!" resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.&lt;ref name="McG156" /&gt;

{{quote|I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement. It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time, keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past. It came about after the frustration of doing ''Rawhide'' for so long. I felt the less he said, the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience.|source=Eastwood, on playing the Man with No Name character&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|left|As the [[Man with No Name]] in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964)]]
The ''Dollars'' trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when ''A Fistful of Dollars'' opened on January 18, followed by ''For a Few Dollars More'' on May 10, and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' on December 29.&lt;ref name="McG157"&gt;McGilligan, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; All the films were commercially successful, particularly ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', which eventually earned $8&amp;nbsp;million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star.&lt;ref name="McG157" /&gt; All three films received bad reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect.&lt;ref name="McG158"&gt;McGilligan, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Crist]] described ''A Fistful of Dollars'' as "cheapjack,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crist|first=Judith|title=Plain Murder All the Way|work=[[New York World Journal Tribune]]|date=February 2, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Newsweek]]'' considered ''For a Few Dollars More'' as "excruciatingly dopey."&lt;ref name="McG158" /&gt; [[Renata Adler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was "...the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Renata|title=The Screen:Zane Grey Meets the Marquis de Sade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/25/archives/the-screen-zane-grey-meets-the-marquis-de-sade-the-good-the-bad-and.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 25, 1968|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=A Fistful of Dollars (1964)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/02/02/archives/screen-a-fistful-of-dollars-opens-western-film-cliches-all-used-in.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 2, 1967|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.&lt;ref name="McG158" /&gt;

Stardom brought more roles for Eastwood. He signed to star in the American revisionist western ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), featured alongside [[Inger Stevens]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Ed Begley]], [[Alan Hale, Jr.|Alan Hale]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[James MacArthur]],&lt;ref name="McG159"&gt;McGilligan, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; playing a man who takes up a Marshal's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead.&lt;ref name="McG160"&gt;McGilligan, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned Eastwood a fee of $400,000 and 25&amp;nbsp;percent of its net box-office takings.&lt;ref name="McG159" /&gt; Using money earned from the ''Dollars'' trilogy, accountant and Eastwood advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood's own production company, [[Malpaso Productions]], named after [[Malpaso Creek]] on Eastwood's property in [[Monterey County, California]]. As recently as a month prior to the film's release, 38-year-old Eastwood was still a relative unknown; in July 1968, syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners noted "The proverbial man in the street is still asking, "Who's Clint Eastwood?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Manners, Dorothy| date=July 14, 1968| title=Italy Made Eastwood A Hollywood Hero| url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/106343899| newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]] | location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]] | page=117 | issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard arranged for ''Hang 'Em High'' to be a joint production with United Artists;&lt;ref name="McG162"&gt;McGilligan, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; when it opened in August 1968, it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists' history. ''Hang 'Em High'' was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the ''[[New York Post]]'', who described it as, "a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement."&lt;ref name="Zmi12" /&gt;

Before the release of ''Hang 'Em High'', Eastwood had already begun working on ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'', about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal ([[Don Stroud]]) through the streets of New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1&amp;nbsp;million—more than double his previous salary.&lt;ref name="McG165"&gt;McGilligan, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennings Lang]] arranged for Eastwood to meet [[Don Siegel]], a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films.&lt;ref name="McG167"&gt;McGilligan, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized.&lt;ref name="McG169"&gt;McGilligan, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd and Robinson, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coogan's Bluff'' also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer [[Lalo Schifrin]], who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the ''Dirty Harry'' films.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Eastwood was paid $750,000 in 1968 for the war epic ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'',&lt;ref name="McG172"&gt;McGilligan, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; about a World War II squad parachuting into a [[Gestapo]] stronghold in the alpine mountains. [[Richard Burton]] played the squad's commander, with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as [[Two-Face]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.&lt;ref name="Eliot83"&gt;Eliot, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood then branched out to star in the only [[musical film|musical]] of his career, ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969). Eastwood and [[Lee Marvin]] play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife ([[Jean Seberg]]) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20&amp;nbsp;million, which was extremely expensive for the time.&lt;ref name="McG173"&gt;McGilligan, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not a critical or commercial success, although it was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paint Your Wagon (1969) |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37096/Paint-Your-Wagon/details |work=[[The New York Times]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vcZqgkCy?url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37096/Paint-Your-Wagon/details |archivedate=January 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
{{main|Clint Eastwood in the 1970s}}
In 1970, Eastwood starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in the western ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who gets mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood once again played a mysterious stranger—unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Although it received moderate reviews,&lt;ref name="McG182"&gt;McGilligan, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kauffman|first= Stanley|title=Stanley Kauffman on Films|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=August 1, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; the film is listed in ''The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000&amp;nbsp;Movies Ever Made''.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Maslin, and Nichols&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steal a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'', with [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Telly Savalas]]. ''Kelly's Heroes'' was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions.&lt;ref name="McG184"&gt;McGilligan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Filming commenced in July 1969 [[Filming location|on location]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and in London.&lt;ref name="McG183"&gt;McGilligan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized.&lt;ref name="McG184" /&gt; In the winter of 1969–70, Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film, ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'', a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by [[Geraldine Page]]) of a Southern girls' school.&lt;ref name="McG185"&gt;McGilligan, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by the French.&lt;ref name="McG190"&gt;McGilligan, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; However, it grossed less than $1&amp;nbsp;million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the "emasculated" role of Eastwood.&lt;ref name="McG189"&gt;McGilligan, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood's career reached a turning point in 1971.&lt;ref name="McG196"&gt;McGilligan, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'', a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director.&lt;ref name="McG192"&gt;McGilligan, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn ([[Jessica Walter]]), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – [[Erroll Garner]]'s "[[Misty (song)|Misty]]". When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker.&lt;ref name="McG193"&gt;McGilligan, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Filming commenced in [[Monterey]] in September 1970 and included footage of that year's [[Monterey Jazz Festival]].&lt;ref name="McG194"&gt;McGilligan, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as [[Jay Cocks]] in ''Time'' magazine, [[Andrew Sarris]] in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', and Archer Winsten in the ''New York Post'' all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance.&lt;ref name="McG195"&gt;McGilligan, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971), written by [[Harry Julian Fink|Harry and Rita Fink]], centers on a hard-edged New York City (later changed to San Francisco) [[Police inspector#Municipal police|police inspector]] named [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]] who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means.&lt;ref name="McG205"&gt;McGilligan, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dirty Harry'' has been described as being arguably Eastwood's most memorable character, and the film has been credited with inventing the "loose-cannon cop" genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mathijs and Mendik, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood's role as Dirty Harry established the "first true archetype" of the action film genre.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenfeld, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; His lines (quoted above) are regarded by firearms historians, such as Garry James and Richard Venola, as the force that catapulted the ownership of [[.44 Magnum]] revolvers to new heights in the United States; specifically the [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29]] carried by Harry Callahan.&lt;ref name="Communications2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Jerry|title=A Line to Remember|work=Orange Coast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=January 13, 2011|date=March 2003|page=23|issn=0279-0483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dirty Harry'' achieved huge success after its release in December 1971, earning $22&amp;nbsp;million in the United States and Canada alone.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; It was Siegel's highest-grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan.

During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks.&lt;ref name="McG219"&gt;McGilligan, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; ''Joe Kidd'' received a mixed reception, with [[Roger Greenspun]] of ''The New York Times'' writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.&lt;ref name="GreenNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenspun|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE6D71F31E73BBC4851DFB1668389669EDE|title=Joe Kidd (1972)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 20, 1972|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Eastwood directed his first western, ''[[High Plains Drifter]]'', in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in ''Pale Rider''. The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and [[allegory]], influenced by Leone.&lt;ref name="McG221"&gt;McGilligan, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was "as derivative as it was expressive," with [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' remarking that Eastwood had "...absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society."&lt;ref name="McG223"&gt;McGilligan, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wayne]], who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, "The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great."&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clint Eastwood-Holden-Breezy.jpg|thumb|left|Directing [[William Holden]] in ''Breezy'' (1973)]]
Eastwood next turned his attention towards ''[[Breezy]]'' (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met [[Sondra Locke]] for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and would become an important figure in his life.&lt;ref name="McG229"&gt;McGilligan, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kay Lenz]] got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. &lt;!-- by whom?? --&gt;The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and [[Frank Stanley (cinematographer)|Frank Stanley]], came in $1&amp;nbsp;million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="McG230"&gt;McGilligan, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Breezy'' was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.&lt;ref name="McGilligan231"/&gt;

Once filming of ''Breezy'' had finished, Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in ''[[Magnum Force]]'' (1973), a sequel to ''Dirty Harry'', about a group of rogue young officers (among them [[David Soul]], [[Robert Urich]] and [[Tim Matheson]]) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals.&lt;ref name="McG233"&gt;McGilligan, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1&amp;nbsp;million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success.&lt;ref name="Eliot153"&gt;Eliot, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McG236"&gt;McGilligan, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' critic [[Nora Sayre]] panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's [[Frank Rich]] called it "the same old stuff".&lt;ref name="McG236" /&gt;

In 1974, Eastwood teamed up with [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[George Kennedy]] in the buddy action caper ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'', a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="McG241"&gt;McGilligan, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.&lt;ref name="McG241" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McG240"&gt;McGilligan, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Film shoot for The Eiger Sanction in Zurich (10).jpg|thumb|right|At a film shoot for ''The Eiger Sanction'' (1975)]]
Eastwood's next film ''[[The Eiger Sanction (film)|The Eiger Sanction]]'' (1975) was based on [[Trevanian]]'s [[The Eiger Sanction|critically acclaimed spy novel]] of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for [[Paul Newman]], an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last "sanction" in return for a rare [[Pissarro]] painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the [[Eiger]] in Switzerland under perilous conditions. [[Mike Hoover]] taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at [[Yosemite]] in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in [[Grindelwald]], Switzerland on August 12, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McG244"&gt;McGilligan, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. Upon release in May 1975 ''The Eiger Sanction'' was marginally successful commercially, receiving $14.2&amp;nbsp;million at the box office, and was received with mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="McG253"&gt;McGilligan, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Gould Boyum of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' dismissed the film as "brutal fantasy".&lt;ref name="McG253" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with [[Warner Brothers]], through [[Frank Wells]], that has lasted to the present day.&lt;ref name="McG256"&gt;McGilligan, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), a western inspired by [[Asa Carter]]'s 1972&amp;nbsp;novel of the same name,&lt;ref name="McG257"&gt;McGilligan, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the [[American Civil War]] and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and [[Chief Dan George]] as an elderly [[Cherokee]] who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director [[Philip Kaufman]] was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood's command, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 from the [[Directors Guild of America]]—who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director.&lt;ref name="McG264"&gt;McGilligan, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The film was pre-screened at the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] Center for the Arts and Humanities in [[Idaho]] during a six-day conference entitled ''Western Movies: Myths and Images''. Invited to the screening were a number of esteemed film critics, including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as [[King Vidor]], [[William Wyler]], and [[Howard Hawks]]; and a number of academics.&lt;ref name="McG266"&gt;McGilligan, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release in the summer of 1976 ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' was widely acclaimed, with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood's role as an iconic one that related to America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War.&lt;ref name="McG266" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the ''Dollars'' westerns and praised the film's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19760101/REVIEWS/601010306/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Outlaw Josey Wales |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1976 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116002157/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19760101%2FREVIEWS%2F601010306%2F1023 |archivedate=January 16, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would later appear in ''Time''{{'s}} "Top 10 Films of the Year".&lt;ref name="McGilligan267"&gt;McGilligan, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood was then offered the role of [[Benjamin L. Willard]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola's]] ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="McG268"&gt;McGilligan, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitses, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; He also refused the part of a platoon leader in [[Ted Post]]'s [[Vietnam War]] film, ''[[Go Tell the Spartans]]''&lt;ref name="McG268" /&gt; and instead decided to make a third ''Dirty Harry'' film, ''[[The Enforcer (1976 film)|The Enforcer]]''. The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer ([[Tyne Daly]]) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. The film, culminating in a shootout on [[Alcatraz]] island, was considerably shorter than the previous ''Dirty Harry'' films at 95{{nbsp}}minutes,&lt;ref name="McG273"&gt;McGilligan, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; but was a major commercial success grossing $100&amp;nbsp;million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.&lt;ref name="McG278"&gt;McGilligan, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he directed and starred in ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'' opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]], [[Bill McKinney]], and [[Mara Corday]]. Eastwood portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the [[organized crime|mob]]. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it "...&amp;nbsp;classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19770101/REVIEWS/701010304/1023 |title=The Gauntlet |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1977 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612184015/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19770101%2FREVIEWS%2F701010304%2F1023 |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he starred in ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'' in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. He played Philo Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his brother (played by [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]) and an [[orangutan]] called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.&lt;ref name="McG302"&gt;McGilligan, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood starred in ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' in 1979, the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Lee Morris]] who, along with [[John Anglin (criminal)|John]] and [[Clarence Anglin]], escaped from the notorious [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] in 1962. The film was a major success; [[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised it as "crystalline cinema"&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Rich of ''Time'' described it as "cool, cinematic grace".&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
{{main|Clint Eastwood in the 1980s}}
In 1980, Eastwood directed and played the title role in ''[[Bronco Billy]]'' alongside Locke, [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Sam Bottoms]].&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has cited ''Bronco Billy'' as being one of the most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood's career,&lt;ref name="Maslin 1280"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |title=Any Which Way You Can (1980): Screen: Clint and Clyde |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E7DB1339F934A25751C1A966948260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 17, 1980 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vckh1zY1?url=https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fmovies.nytimes.com%2Fmovie%2Freview&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26resQ3D9E03E7DB1339F934A25751C1A966948260 |archivedate=January 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was liked by critics. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote that film was "...the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |title=Bronco Billy (1980): Eastwood Stars and Directs 'Bronco Billy' |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E5D61638F932A25755C0A966948260 |date=June 11, 1980 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vckcsP1W?url=https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fmovies.nytimes.com%2Fmovie%2Freview&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26resQ3D9C01E5D61638F932A25755C0A966948260 |archivedate=January 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Eastwood starred in ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', the sequel to ''Every Which Way But Loose''. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as "funnier and even better than its predecessor".&lt;ref name="Maslin 1280" /&gt; Released over the Christmas season of 1980, ''Any Which Way You Can'' was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1980|title=1980 Yearly Box Office Results at Boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eastwood1981.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Eastwood, 1981]]
In 1982, Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[Honkytonk Man]]'', based on the eponymous [[Clancy Carlile]]'s [[Great Depression|depression-era]] novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from [[tuberculosis]], but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son [[Kyle Eastwood|Kyle]]) to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he is supposed to record a song. Only ''Time'' gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the film received critical acclaim in France, where it was compared to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93{{nbsp}}percent on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/honkytonk_man|title=Honkytonk Man (1982)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the [[Cold War]]-themed ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]''. Based on a 1977 [[Firefox (novel)|novel with the same name]] written by [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]], the film was shot before but released after ''Honkeytonk Man''. Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in [[Vienna]] and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20&amp;nbsp;million, it was Eastwood's highest budget film to date.&lt;ref name="Schickel378"&gt;Schickel, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine likened Eastwood's performance to "[[Luke Skywalker]] trapped in Dirty Harry's Soul".&lt;ref name="Schickel378" /&gt;

Eastwood directed and starred in the fourth ''Dirty Harry'' film, ''[[Sudden Impact]]'', which was shot in the spring and summer of 1983 and is considered the darkest and most violent of the series.&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky and Pfeiffer, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Eastwood received 60&amp;nbsp;percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sudden Impact'' was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays an artist who, along with her sister, was gang-raped a decade before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister's now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line "[[Go ahead, make my day]]" (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop) has been cited as one of cinema's immortal lines. It was quoted by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in a speech to Congress, and used during the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |title=Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give A Damn |publisher=[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x1HnwHWc?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogin, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the second most commercially successful of the ''Dirty Harry'' films, after ''The Enforcer'', earning $70&amp;nbsp;million. It received very positive reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984) had Eastwood starring opposite [[Geneviève Bujold]] in a provocative thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in [[New Orleans]] to avoid confusion with the ''Dirty Harry'' films,&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for [[sadomasochism]].&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tightrope'' was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tightrope.htm |title=Tightrope (1984) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=October 23, 1984 |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy ''[[City Heat]]'' (1984) alongside [[Burt Reynolds]], a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the [[prohibition]] era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50&amp;nbsp;million domestically, but was overshadowed by [[Eddie Murphy]]'s ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the 1985 ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' episode ''Vanessa in the Garden'', which starred [[Harvey Keitel]] and Locke. This was his first collaboration with [[Steven Spielberg]], who later co-produced ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halbfinger |first=David M. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html |title=The Power of an Image Drives Film by Eastwood |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 21, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uuiqkSBy?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), a film based on the classic 1953&amp;nbsp;western ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1850.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a reference to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's 1973&amp;nbsp;western ''High Plains Drifter'' in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pale Rider'' became one of Eastwood's most successful films to date. It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' remarking, "This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist".&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Eastwood co-starred with [[Marsha Mason]] in the military drama ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'', about the 1983&amp;nbsp;United States [[invasion of Grenada]]. He portrays a [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] veteran of the [[Korean War]] and Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the [[United States Department of Defense]] who expressed contempt for the film.&lt;ref name="McG398"&gt;McGilligan, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $70&amp;nbsp;million domestically.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood starred in ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), the fifth and final film in the ''Dirty Harry'' series. It co-starred [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Liam Neeson]], and a young [[Jim Carrey]] who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called "Dead Pool". The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. ''The Dead Pool'' grossed nearly $38&amp;nbsp;million, relatively low receipts for a ''Dirty Harry'' film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.&lt;ref name="The Film journal"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAnsAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=May 1, 2011|date=July 1, 1988|publisher=Pubsun Corp.|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebert1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Roger Ebert's movie home companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTshz3206kYC|accessdate=May 1, 2011|year=1992|publisher=Andrews and McMeel|isbn=978-0-8362-6243-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed ''[[Bird (1988 film)|Bird]]'' (1988), a biopic starring [[Forest Whitaker]] as jazz musician [[Charlie Parker|Charlie "Bird" Parker]]. Alto saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and [[Spike Lee]], son of jazz bassist [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]] and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor.&lt;ref name="McG433"&gt;McGilligan, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood received two [[Golden Globes]] for the film, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for his lifelong contribution, and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director award]]. However, ''Bird'' was a commercial failure, earning just $11&amp;nbsp;million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' (1989). The film is about a [[bounty hunter]] and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman ([[Bernadette Peters]]) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink [[Cadillac]]. The film failed both critically and commercially,&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; earning barely more than ''Bird'' and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
{{main|Clint Eastwood in the 1990s}}
Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'' (1990), an adaptation of [[Peter Viertel]]'s ''[[roman à clef]]'', about [[John Huston]] and the making of the classic film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]''. Shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] in the summer of 1989,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="McG461"&gt;McGilligan, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1990, Eastwood directed and co-starred with [[Charlie Sheen]] in ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]'', a [[buddy cop]] action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991.&lt;ref name="McG467"&gt;McGilligan, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.&lt;ref name="McG467" /&gt;

In 1992, Eastwood revisited the western genre in his film ''[[Unforgiven]]'', a film in which he directed and starred as an aging ex-[[gunfighting|gunfighter]] long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as ''The Cut-Whore Killings'' and ''The William Munny Killings'' but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films.&lt;ref name="McG467" /&gt; ''Unforgiven'' was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as "the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford's 1956 ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.&lt;ref name="McG473"&gt;McGilligan, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for [[David Webb Peoples]]) and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Eastwood. In June&amp;nbsp;2008 ''Unforgiven'' was ranked as the fourth-best American western, behind ''Shane'', ''[[High Noon]]'', and ''The Searchers'', in the [[American Film Institute]]'s "[[AFI's 10 Top 10]]" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=American Film Institute|title=AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres|publisher=ComingSoon.net|date=June 17, 2008|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072|accessdate=January 17, 2011|authorlink=American Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Western |url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/western.html |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w8ldkIqa?url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/western.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clint Eastwood Cannes 1993.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Eastwood at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] thriller ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' (1993), directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and co-starring [[John Malkovich]] and [[Rene Russo]]. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save [[John F. Kennedy]]'s life.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; The film was among the top&amp;nbsp;10 box office performers in that year, earning $102&amp;nbsp;million in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1993, he directed and co-starred alongside [[Kevin Costner]] in ''[[A Perfect World]]''.

At the May{{nbsp}}[[1994 Cannes Film Festival]] Eastwood received France's [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] medal,&lt;ref name="McG491"&gt;McGilligan, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 27, 1995, he was awarded the [[Irving G.

Based on the novel by [[Robert James Waller]],&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; the film relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', who has an [[affair]] with a middle-aged Italian farm wife, Francesca (Streep). Despite the novel receiving unfavorable reviews and a subject deemed potentially unsuitable for film, ''The Bridges of Madison County'' was a commercial and critical success.&lt;ref name="McG503"&gt;McGilligan, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Ebert wrote, "Streep and Eastwood weave a spell, and it is based on that particular knowledge of love and self that comes with middle age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950602/REVIEWS/506020301/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Bridges of Madison County |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=June 2, 1995 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327232154/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19950602%2FREVIEWS%2F506020301%2F1023 |archivedate=March 27, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Picture and won a [[César Award]] in France for Best Foreign Film. Streep was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.

In 1997, Eastwood directed and starred in the political thriller ''[[Absolute Power (film)|Absolute Power]]'', alongside [[Gene Hackman]] (with whom he had appeared in ''Unforgiven''). Eastwood played the role of a veteran thief who witnesses the Secret Service cover-up of a murder.

Later in 1997, Eastwood directed ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (film)|Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]]'', based on the novel by [[John Berendt]] and starring [[John Cusack]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and [[Jude Law]]. The film met with a mixed critical response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971121/REVIEWS/711210303/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=November 21, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919040703/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19971121%2FREVIEWS%2F711210303%2F1023 |archivedate=September 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[True Crime (1999 film)|True Crime]]'' (1999). He plays Steve Everett, a journalist and recovering alcoholic, who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank Beechum (played by [[Isaiah Washington]]). ''True Crime'' received a mixed reception, with Janet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' writing, "his direction is galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic misunderstandings, and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime. Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction, though."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9807EFD61731F93AA25750C0A96F958260|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=True Crime|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 19, 1999|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a box office failure, earning less than half its $55&amp;nbsp;million budget and was Eastwood's worst-performing film of the 1990s aside from ''White Hunter Black Heart'', which had a limited release.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2000, Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[Space Cowboys]]'' alongside [[Tommy Lee Jones]], Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Eastwood played one of a group of veteran ex-test pilots sent into space to repair an old Soviet satellite. The original music score was composed by Eastwood and [[Lennie Niehaus]].

===Directing===
Beginning with the thriller ''Play Misty for Me'', Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[David Denby]] wrote that, unlike Eastwood,&lt;ref name="denby20100308"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all|title=Out of the West|work=The New Yorker|date=March 8, 2010|accessdate=September 1, 2012|author=Denby, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=John Ford appeared in just a few silent films; Howard Hawks never acted in movies. Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}

From the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biskind19697"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196–197 (interviewer Peter Biskind)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.&lt;ref name="Gentry65"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abb173"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascal235"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer [[Pascal Mérigeau]])&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,&lt;ref name="Intp678"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67–68 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt; considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.&lt;ref name="Intp678" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intp91"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not "so much that it insults their intelligence."&lt;ref name="Intp60"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, "Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic."&lt;ref name="Inc1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fayard|first=Judy|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|title=Who can stand 32,580 seconds of Clint Eastwood?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=March 8, 2011|date=July 23, 1971|page=46|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter note that Eastwood's films are "superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative"&lt;ref name="Intp45"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 45 (interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter)&lt;/ref&gt; while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing "unrushed and relaxed."&lt;ref name="Intp71"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 71 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his movies a [[Film noir|"noir-ish"]] feel.&lt;ref name="Biskind19697" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milan143"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 143 (interviewer Milan Pavolić)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have explored Eastwood's work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Anson Vaux, ''The Ethical Vision of Clint Eastwood'' (Wm.

Eastwood has been recognized with multiple awards and nominations for his work in film, television, and music. His widest reception has been in film work, for which he has received Academy Awards, [[Directors Guild of America Award]]s, Golden Globe Awards, and [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. Eastwood is one of only two people to have been twice nominated for Best Actor and Best Director for the same film (''Unforgiven'' and ''Million Dollar Baby'') the other being [[Warren Beatty]] (''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' and ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''). Along with Beatty, [[Robert Redford]], [[Richard Attenborough]], Kevin Costner, and [[Mel Gibson]], he is one of the few directors best known as an actor to win an Academy Award for directing. On February 27, 2005, he became one of only three living directors (along with [[Miloš Forman]] and Francis Ford Coppola) to have directed two Best Picture winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=French |first=Philip |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/25/clinteastwood.oscars |title=Interview: Clint Eastwood, 'I figured I'd retire gradually, just ride off into the sunset&amp;nbsp;...' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w8kkpugi?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/feb/25/clinteastwood.oscars |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |location=London |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 74, he was the oldest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Director to date.

This award honors his entire career and his major contribution to the 7th Art. In February 2010, Eastwood was recognized by President Barack Obama with an arts and humanities award. Obama described Eastwood's films as "essays in individuality, hard truths and the essence of what it means to be American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simmons |first=Christine |title=Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood get White House awards |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2010-02-25-white-house-awards_N.htm |date=February 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5voyzN8eE?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2010-02-25-white-house-awards_N.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2011 |work=USA Today |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{main|Personal life of Clint Eastwood}}
Eastwood has had numerous casual and serious relationships of varying length and intensity over his life. Between proposing to and marrying "Maggie" Johnson in 1953, he had an affair that allegedly resulted in a child who was given up for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munn |first=Michael |title=Clint Eastwood: Hollywood's Loner |publisher=Robson |year=1992 |location=London |isbn=978-0-86051-790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} He continued having affairs while married to Johnson, including a 14 year long relationship with actress and stunt woman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter.&lt;ref name="McG139"&gt;McGilligan, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent2"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-1259606.html The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] Young, Josh (May 4, 1997). ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson reportedly tolerated an open marriage with Eastwood. Eastwood and Johnson were divorced and he continued seeing many other women. In 1975, actress [[Sondra Locke]] began living with Eastwood. She took the relationship seriously and was extremely distraught when she discovered much later that Eastwood continued to have sexual relationships with other women.

===Leisure activities===

Despite smoking in some of his films, Eastwood is a lifelong non-smoker, has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthy eating and daily [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corliss|first= Richard|title=The Last Roundup|work=Time|date=August 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual beliefs===
In 1973, Eastwood told the late film critic [[Gene Siskel]], "No, I don't believe in God."&lt;ref&gt;Gene Siskel, "Clint: The Cynical King who Outdrew the Duke," ''Chicago Tribune'', January 7, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly four decades later while promoting his film, ''[[Hereafter]]'' (2010), Eastwood stated that "I was always respectful of people who were deeply religious because I always felt that if they gave themselves to it, then it had to be important to them. But if you can go through life without it, that's OK, too. It's whatever suits you. I do believe in self-help. I'm not a [[New Age]] person but I do believe in meditation, and for that reason I've always liked the [[Buddhist]] religion. When I've been to Japan I've been to Buddhist temples and meditated and I found that rewarding."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

As much as anything, Eastwood has found spirituality in nature (as suggested by his 1985 Western, ''Pale Rider''), stating that "I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were [[Protestant]], but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, 'I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that's something you like'. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

"Of course, it would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you're supposed to do the best you can by the gift you're given of life and that alone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showbizspy.com/article/228386/clint-eastwood-on-the-fence-about-god-director-clint-eastwood-discusses-his-religious-beliefs.html|title=SHOWBIZ SPY - OUR SPIES ARE EVERYWHERE!|website=SHOWBIZ SPY|access-date=June 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110180709/http://www.showbizspy.com/article/228386/clint-eastwood-on-the-fence-about-god-director-clint-eastwood-discusses-his-religious-beliefs.html|archive-date=November 10, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating habits. As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died unexpectedly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]  at the age of 64.&lt;ref name="McGilligan192"&gt;McGilligan, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The death, described by Fritz Manes as "the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on Eastwood's life; from then on he became more productive, working with a greater sense of urgency and with more speed and efficiency on set.&lt;ref name="McGilligan193"&gt;McGilligan, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Although Eastwood had always been a health and fitness enthusiast, he became more so after his father's death. He abstained from hard liquor, adopted a more rigorous health regime, and sought to stay fit.&lt;ref name="McGilligan193" /&gt; However, he still favored cold beer and opened a pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="McGilligan204"&gt;McGilligan, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood eventually sold the pub and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant, also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionranchcarmel.com/|title=Welcome to Mission Ranch|publisher=Missionranchcarmel.com|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical interests==
{{see also|Clint Eastwood discography}}
Eastwood is an [[audiophile]] and has had a strong passion for music all his life, particularly jazz and country and western music.&lt;ref name="McGilligan114"&gt;McGilligan, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; He dabbled in music early on, and in late 1959 he produced the album ''[[Cowboy Favorites]]'', which was released on the Cameo label.&lt;ref name="McGilligan114" /&gt; The album included some classics such as [[Bob Wills]]'s ''[[San Antonio Rose]]'' and [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]''. Despite his attempts to plug the album by going on a tour, it never reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan114" /&gt; In 1963, Cameo producer [[Kal Mann]] told him that "he would never make it big as a singer".&lt;ref name="McGilligan115"&gt;McGilligan, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, during the off season of filming ''Rawhide'', Eastwood and [[Paul Brinegar]]—sometimes joined by [[Sheb Wooley]]—toured rodeos, state fairs, and festivals. In 1962, their act, entitled ''Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs'', earned them as much as $15,000 a performance.&lt;ref name="McGilligan115" /&gt; Eastwood has his own [[Warner Bros.

This deal was unchanged when [[Warner Music Group]] was sold by Time Warner to private investors.&lt;ref name=krall/&gt;

Eastwood favors [[jazz]] (especially [[bebop]]), [[blues]], classic [[rhythm and blues]], classical, and country-and-western music; his favorite musicians include saxophonists [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Lester Young]], pianists [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Dave Brubeck]], and [[Fats Waller]], and [[Delta blues]]man [[Robert Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Tosches |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/12/eastwood200812 |title=Nick Tosches on Clint Eastwood |publisher=Vanity Fair |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a pianist and composer.&lt;ref name="McG114"&gt;McGilligan, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz has played an important role in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he never made it as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album ''Cowboy Favorites'', released on the Cameo label.&lt;ref name="McG114" /&gt;

Eastwood has his own [[Warner Bros. Records]]-distributed imprint Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers, which has released all of the scores of Eastwood's films from ''The Bridges of Madison County'' onward. Eastwood co-wrote "Why Should I Care" with [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]], which was recorded by [[Diana Krall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Krall, Eastwood Team For 'crime' |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=AllBusiness.com |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4607056-1.html |date=March 11, 1999 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uunYzwbK?url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4607056-1.html |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood composed the [[film score]]s of ''Mystic River'', ''Million Dollar Baby'', ''Flags of Our Fathers'', ''[[Grace Is Gone]]'', ''Changeling'', ''Hereafter'', ''J.

'''Darkestrah''' is a Kyrgyz [[pagan metal]] band, formed in 1999 in [[Bishkek]], Kyrgyzstan. Throughout their career the band has blended folklore music with metal elements. In its lyrics and in musical composition, the band uses national folk musical instruments, such as the [[komuz]] and [[kyl-kyak]], and references [[shamanism]] and [[Tengrism]]. The band also takes influence from genres such as [[progressive rock]] and [[post-rock]], generally constructing lengthy, rhythmically complex songs that often feature several discrete movements.

The word "Darkestrah" is a portmanteau of two words: "dark" and "orchestra"; however, in one interview, the band's drummer Asbath stated that there is still mystic and hidden meaning in the name of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kluseba.eklablog.com/interview-with-the-epic-blackened-folk-metal-band-darkestrah-from-kyrg-a103005285|title=Interview with the epic blackened folk metal band Darkestrah from Kyrgyzstan|work=Sebastian Kluth|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its formation in 1999, the band has released six studio albums, two [[Extended play|EPs]], one split album, and one live album.

==Biography==
Darkestrah, the [[Tengrism|Kyrgyz Pagan]] Metal group, was established in [[Bishkek]], and their first demo, ''The Black Pagan Act'' was recorded in December 1999. In 2000 December, their second demo, ''Through the Ashes of Shamanic Flames'' was released by the German label Curse of KvN Sadistic. In 2003 February, the band recorded their first full-length album, ''Sary Oy'', which appeared on the same label in January 2004. In this album, traditional folk songs with traditional Kyrgyz instruments were combined with metal. It is a [[concept album]] about a [[Kyrgyz culture|Kyrgyz legend]].

In March 2004, the EP ''The Way to Paganism'' was recorded; the German label [[No Colours Records]] released on 14 April 2005, along with the full-length album ''Embrace of Memory'' on 25 October. In 2007 they recorded a new album, ''Epos'', with a new studio called ''Kick the Flame Studio''. ''Epos'' is almost fully dedicated to [[Issyk-kul Lake]]. It is filled with [[Tengrism|Pagan]] motives, and it consists of a single track that runs for more than thirty-three minutes.

In 2007, Darkestrah cut its ties with No Colours and it signed a contract with American Paragon Records. In 2008 March, they released their new album, ''The Great Silk Road''. This earned them the attention of the French label [[Osmose Productions]], on which they released the EP ''Khagan'' in 2011 and their fifth full-length album, ''Manas'' (based on the Kyrgyz [[Epic of Manas]]), in 2013.

The band's releases up to this point were fairly unique in the largely male-dominated world of black metal for featuring female vocalist Kriegtalith, who utilised occasional clean vocals and an unconventional style reminiscent of [[Tuvan throat singing]] alongside the traditional shrieks of black metal. She left the band in 2014, however.

An "official live bootleg", ''Everything Becomes Fire'', was self-released in 2015; it was recorded in Germany in 2006. A split with the Saudi band [[Al-Namrood]] (Darkestrah's side being a re-recording of the track "Akyr Zaman", previous versions of which had appeared on ''Embrace of Memory'' and the multi-artist compilation ''Stimme aus der Tiefe #1''), on the Canadian label [[Shaythan Productions]], and Darkestrah's sixth full-length album ''Turan'', again on Osmose, were both released in 2016. Shaythan Productions has also released vinyl editions of some of Darkestrah's back catalogue (thus far, ''Epos'' and ''The Great Silk Road'').

'''E. E. Rehmus''', also alternatively given as Ed Rehmus, Edward Rehmus or '''Edward E. Rehmus''' (June 1929 – March 2004),&lt;ref name="Haskew2"&gt;''The Magic of Ed Rehmus'', "The Journeys of Edward Rehmus", page 2&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[occult]]ist, [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], [[Classics|classicist]], writer, editor, translator, illustrator, [[cartoonist]], and occasional [[Graphic designer|graphic artist]] primarily known for being the author of ''The Magician's Dictionary''.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and youth ===
Joseph Haskew, his long-term partner, wrote of Rehmus's early life and youth:
{{quote|Edward, an only child, was born midsummer's eve 1929 in Upper Michigan, of German ancestry. His father was a musician, a pianist, who played in the "Big Bands" and his mother was a housewife. They were "modern" for their time, spending time in restaurants and night clubs, and, aside from the usual love and nurturing, were unexceptional parents, so the child was left to his own devices, resulting in a lively imagination. Later, when they moved to Detroit, they lived in a mainly Jewish neighborhood, and Ed attributed to this experience a lifelong love of learning and solid study habits.&lt;br&gt;The family moved to southern California, in the late 1940's, where he found the ambience suffocating and so resolved to get away whenever the opportunity arose. When his mother died, he went to Tulane for a brief spell, then into the U.S. Army (for an even briefer spell), then to San Francisco. He went to the University of California at Berkeley off and on for many years, but always became bored and so never pursued a degree.&lt;ref name="Haskew2" /&gt;}}

=== Maturity ===
Haskew further adds:
{{quote|His life in San Francisco was in the company of the Bohemian intelligentsia of writers, artists, poets, philosophers, and metaphysicians, and in those days San Francisco was a hotbed of post-war intellectual ferment. Over the years he studied extensively in comparative religions, comparative languages, psychology, and Eastern philosophy, among other disciplines. Always he kept up his writing, his correspondence, his teaching, and his translations. Occasionally he would find a book that he felt had particular merit, that had no English language version in print and he would translate it, for free because he felt it needed a wider audience. This might take six months, or a couple of years, but no matter – "It's important."&lt;ref name="Haskew2" /&gt;}}

=== Involvement with High-IQ societies ===
As a [[polymath]] and [[philomath]], Rehmus was actively involved with the quest to understand and expand human [[intelligence]], himself being a member of several [[High IQ society|high-IQ]] support groups. Among these affiliations was his involvement with the San Francisco area [[Mensa International|Mensa]] society; he often contributed to that local society's publication, ''[[The Ecphorizer]]''. Rehmus was also a member of the [[Prometheus Society]], a [[High IQ society|high-IQ society]] with admission standards 600 times more [[wikt:stringent|stringent]] than Mensa's. His contributor notice from ''The Ecphorizer'' runs thus:
{{quote|Ed Rehmus was well-known within San Francisco Regional Mensa in the 70s through the 80s as the "weird" cover artist of the newsletter Intelligencer. He later created an irregular comic strip called "The Clonies." Ed also wrote the occasional story for the Intelligencer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecphorizer.com/EPS/site_contributors_popup.php?contributor=153 |title=Ecphorizer |publisher=Ecphorizer |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Author of ''The Magician's Dictionary'' ===
His public reputation rests mainly on his contribution to the study of the [[occult]] through his renowned book ''The Magician's Dictionary'', a vast pseudo-encyclopaedic work first published in 1990 that proposes a re-evaluation of some of the core building blocks of modern belief structures through definition and commentary on key words and phrases, from "[[Aaron]]" to "[[Zuvuya]]".

=== Other activities ===
Apart from founding and editing various magazines and journals (sometimes under pseudonyms), Rehmus was a regular contributor to numerous and diverse scholarly and amateur publications, providing articles, texts, artworks, and even erudite crossword puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Magic of Ed Rehmus'', "Forward", pages xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; While he remained an obscure figure to the public eye during his lifetime, the posthumous volume ''The Magic of Ed Rehmus'', compiled and edited by Fred Vaughan and published in 2006, sheds light on his personal life and many other previously inaccessible aspects of his thought, wide interests, and activities.

== Selected works&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;It is now known that Rehmus' academic, intellectual, and artistic production is much larger than accounted for in this article. Those interested in obtaining further information pertaining to his works are directed to Fred Vaughan's ''The Magic of Ed Rehmus'', and especially the "Forward" (pages xi–xii), which contains more than the list provided here, albeit lacking a formal bibliography.

'''Easter eggs''', also called '''Paschal eggs''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holycrossonline.org/our_parish/lenten_resource_center/articles/legend-of-paschal-eggs.pdf The Legend of Paschal Eggs (Holy Cross Antiochian Orthodox Church)]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[egg decorating|decorated]] [[egg]]s that are usually used as gifts on the occasion of [[Easter]]. As such, Easter eggs are common during the season of [[Eastertide]] (Easter season). The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in colored [[foil (metal)|foil]], hand-carved wooden eggs, or plastic eggs filled with [[confectionery]] such as [[chocolate]]. However, real eggs continue to be used in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an tradition. Although eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth,&lt;ref name="fertility"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=easter+egg+fertility|title= The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|author= David Leeming|quote=For many, Easter is synonymous with fertility symbols such as the Easter Rabbit, Easter Eggs, and the Easter lily.|year=2005|accessdate =10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Christianity]], for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the [[empty tomb]] of [[Jesus]], from which Jesus [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]].&lt;ref name=Meaning&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mzKVPZthGHUC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=easter+egg+Christian|title= Christianity|publisher= [[Nelson Thornes]]|author= Anne Jordan|quote=Easter eggs are used as a Christian symbol to represent the empty tomb. The outside of the egg looks dead but inside there is new life, which is going to break out. The Easter egg is a reminder that Jesus will rise from His tomb and bring new life.

Harbaugh|quote=Just so, on that first Easter morning, Jesus came to life and walked out of the tomb, and left it, as it were, an empty shell. Just so, too, when the Christian dies, the body is left in the grave, an empty shell, but the soul takes wings and flies away to be with God. Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a stone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter. (In days past some used to color the eggs red, so as to show the kind of death by which Christ died,-a ''bloody'' death.)|year=1878|accessdate =7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn-38NunUnAC&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=easter+egg+Christian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vZKAT_q5OeHw0gH56bSMCA&amp;ved=0CH0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=easter%20egg%20Christian&amp;f=false|title= Christian belief and practice|publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]]|author= Gordon Geddes, Jane Griffiths|quote=Red eggs are given to Orthodox Christians after the Easter Liturgy.

These avian materials previously possessed symbolic meaning and material value as early as the pre-dynastic period in Egypt, as well as amid the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete. The main early cultural associations of the eggs and feathers were with death/resurrection and kingship respectively, a symbolism that was passed on into early Christian and Muslim usage. Mercantile, religious and political links across the premodern Mediterranean meant that these items found parallel employment all around the Mediterranean littoral, and beyond it, in Arabia, South Asia and Africa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church adopted the custom, and regarded the eggs as the emblem of the resurrection, as is evinced by the benediction of Pope Paul V., about 1610, which reads thus: "Bless, O Lord! we beseech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants, eating it in thankfulness to thee on account of the resurrection of the Lord." Thus the custom has come down from ages lost in antiquity.)|year=1881|accessdate =7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Itihaas&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CRvzTM0kev4C&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=In+many+countries+the+name+of+the+Christian+feast+we+call+Easter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7ruAT-WLE6jo0QH6tdSLCA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20many%20countries%20the%20name%20of%20the%20Christian%20feast%20we%20call%20Easter&amp;f=false|title= Welcome to the Church Year: An Introduction to the Seasons of the Episcopal Church|author=Vicki K.

In parts of Europe, the eggs were dyed red and were then cracked together when people exchanged Easter greetings. Many congregations today continue to have Easter egg hunts for the children after services on Easter Day.|date= 1 Jul 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Christian Church]] officially adopted the custom, regarding the eggs as a symbol of the [[resurrection of Jesus]], with the [[Roman Ritual]], the first edition of which was published in 1610 but which has texts of much older date, containing among the Easter Blessings of Food, one for eggs, along with those for lamb, bread, and new produce. The blessing is for consumption as a food, rather than decorated.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref name="Itihaas" /&gt; {{quotation|Lord, let the grace of your blessing + come upon these eggs, that they be healthful food for your faithful who eat them in thanksgiving for the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you forever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/prayer/roman2.txt The Roman Ritual. Part XI, Blessings and other sacramentals]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociology professor Kenneth Thompson discusses the spread of the Easter egg throughout [[Christendom]], writing that "use of eggs at Easter seems to have come from Persia into the Greek Christian Churches of Mesopotamia, thence to Russia and Siberia through the medium of Orthodox Christianity. From the Greek Church the custom was adopted by either the Roman Catholics or the Protestants and then spread through Europe."&lt;ref name="Thompson2013"/&gt; Both Thompson, as well as British orientalist [[Thomas Hyde]] state that in addition to dying the eggs red, the early Christians of Mesopotamia also stained Easter eggs green and yellow.&lt;ref name="Ellis1877"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson2013"/&gt;

Influential 19th century [[folkloristics|folklorist]] and [[philology|philologist]] [[Jacob Grimm]] speculates, in the second volume of his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', that the [[folk custom]] of Easter eggs among the continental Germanic peoples may have stemmed from springtime festivities of a [[list of Germanic deities|Germanic goddess]] known in Old English as [[Ēostre]] (namesake of modern English ''Easter'') and possibly known in Old High German as *''Ostara'' (and thus namesake of Modern German ''Ostern'' 'Easter'):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The heathen Easter had much in common with May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages there seem to have lingered among the people ''Easter-games'' so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate : I allude especially to the custom of ''Easter eggs'', and to the ''Easter tale'' which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.&lt;ref Name=Grimm&gt;Grimm, Jacob (James Steven Stallybrass Trans.) (1883). ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology: Translated from the Fourth Edition with Notes and Appendix]]'' Vol. II. London: George Bell and Sons. pp780-781&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although one of the Christian traditions are to use dyed or painted chicken eggs, a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with [[candy]] such as [[jelly bean]]s. These eggs can be hidden for children to find on Easter morning, which may be left by the [[Easter Bunny]]. They may also be put in a [[basket]] filled with real or artificial straw to resemble a [[bird nest|bird's nest]].

[[File:Pasxalina abga.jpg|thumb|Red coloured Easter eggs]]

===Lenten tradition===
The Easter egg tradition may also have merged into the celebration of the end of the privations of [[Lent]] in the West.
Historically, it was traditional to use up all of the household's eggs before Lent began.
Eggs were originally forbidden during [[Lent]] as well as on other traditional [[fasting|fast]] days in [[Western Christianity]] (this tradition still continues among the [[Eastern Christian Churches]]).
Likewise, in [[Eastern Christianity]], meat, eggs, and [[dairy]] are all prohibited during the [[Great Lent|Lenten fast]].

This established the tradition of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] being celebrated on [[Shrove Tuesday]]. This day, the Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]] when Lent begins, is also known as [[Mardi Gras]], a French phrase which translates as "Fat Tuesday" to mark the last consumption of eggs and dairy before Lent begins.

In the Orthodox Church, [[Great Lent]] begins on [[Clean Monday]], rather than Wednesday, so the household's dairy products would be used up in the preceding week, called [[Cheesefare Week]].

During Lent, since chickens would not stop producing eggs during this time, a larger than usual store might be available at the end of the fast. This surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes.  Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.

One would have been forced to hard boil the [[boiled egg|eggs]] that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the [[Spain|Spanish]] dish [[hornazo]] (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.
In [[Hungary]], eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.

===Symbolism and related customs===
Some Christians symbolically link the cracking open of Easter eggs with the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12170383/When-is-Easter-2016-What-are-the-dates-for-Good-Friday-Easter-Sunday-and-Easter-Monday.html|title=When is Easter 2016? What are the dates for Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday|last=Allen|first=Emily|date=25 December 2016|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|language=English|accessdate=26 February 2016|quote=Eggs illustrate new life, just as Jesus began his new life on East Sunday after the miracle of his resurrection. When eggs are cracked open they are said to symbolise an empty tomb.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Orthodox churches, Easter eggs are [[blessing|blessed]] by the priest at the end of the [[Paschal Vigil]] (which is equivalent to [[Holy Saturday]]), and distributed to the faithful. The egg is seen by followers of [[Christianity]] as a symbol of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;&lt;ref name="Symbolism"/&gt;

Similarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Poland]], the so-called [[święconka]], i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.

During [[Paschaltide]], in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous [[paschal greeting]], "Christ has risen", to their beloved departed (see [[Radonitza]]).

In [[Greece]], women traditionally dye the eggs with onion skins and vinegar on Thursday (also the day of [[Communion rite|Communion]]). These ceremonial eggs are known as kokkina avga. They also bake [[tsoureki]] for the Easter Sunday feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominiquesvillas.co.uk/en/blog/index.cfm/kalo-paska-happy-easter|title=Kalo Paska - Happy Easter|first=Natalie|last=Wagstaff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Easter eggs are sometimes served along the centerline of tsoureki (braided loaf of bread).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/food/index.ssf/2014/04/todays_easterpassover_recipe_f_1.html|title=Today's Recipe from Our Files: Greek Easter bread, Tsoueki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Red and Butter, Martha Stewart magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]], it's a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during [[Sham el-Nessim]] holiday, which falls every year after the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[Easter]].

===Colouring===
[[File:Ostereier - Easter eggs.jpg|thumb|Colors for the Easter eggs]]
[[File:Urządzenie podgrzewające kolorowy wosk do malowania pisanek - detal.jpg|thumb|Heated wax paint used to decorate traditional Easter Eggs in the Czech Republic]]
The dying of Easter eggs in different colours is commonplace, with colour being achieved through boiling the egg in natural substances (such as, [[onion]] peel (brown colour), [[oak]] or [[alder]] bark or [[walnut]] nutshell (black), [[beet]] juice (pink) etc.), or using [[artificial colouring]]s.

A greater variety of colour was often provided by tying on the onion skin with different coloured woollen [[yarn]]. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English ''pasche''. They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping ([[egg tapping]]) competition.

In the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the [[blood of Christ]], with further symbolism being found in the hard shell of the egg symbolizing the sealed [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]] — the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead.

===Patterning===
When boiling them with onion skins leaves can be attached prior to dying to create leaf patterns. The leaves are attached to the eggs before they are dyed with a transparent cloth to wrap the eggs with like inexpensive muslin or nylon stockings, leaving patterns once the leaves are removed after the dyeing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/how-to-dye-easter-eggs-naturally-without-a-box-onion-skins-beets-cabbage.html|title=How to Dye Easter eggs naturally without a box onion skins beets cabbage|publisher=seriouseats.com|accessdate=&lt;!-- 2014 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natashaskitchen.com/2013/03/19/natural-easter-eggs-3-ways/|title=Natural Easter Eggs 3 Ways!/ with nylon stockings|publisher=natashaskitchen.com|accessdate=&lt;!-- 2014 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These eggs are part of [[Easter custom]] in many areas and often accompany other traditional [[Easter food]]s. [[Passover]] [[haminados]] are prepared with similar methods.

[[Pysanky]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pysanka|'''Culture – Pysanky''']], [http://www.ukrainiandirectory.org/index.htm Ukrainian International Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; are Ukrainian Easter eggs, decorated using a wax-resist ([[batik]]) method. The word comes from the verb ''pysaty'', "to write", as the designs are not painted on, but written with [[beeswax]]. 

Decorating eggs for Easter using wax resistant batik is a popular method in some other eastern European countries. 

=== Use of Easter eggs in decorations ===
In some [[Mediterranean]] countries, especially in [[Lebanon]], chicken eggs are boiled and decorated by dye and/or painting and used as decoration around the house. Then, on [[Easter Day]], young kids would duel with them saying 'Christ is resurrected, Indeed, He is', breaking and eating them. This also happens in [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], Macedonia, [[Romania]], Russia, Serbia and Ukraine. In Easter Sunday friends and family hit each other's egg with their own. The one whose egg does not break is believed to be in for good luck in the future.

In Germany, eggs decorate trees and bushes as [[Easter egg tree]]s, and in several areas public wells as [[Osterbrunnen]].

There used to be a custom in [[Ukraine]], during Easter celebrations to have ''[[krashanky]]'' on a table in a bowl with wheatgrass. The number of the ''krashanky'' equalled the number of departed family members.&lt;ref&gt;Yakovenko, Svitlana 2017, “The Magical Dyed Egg – Krashanka” in [http://sovabooks.com.au/the-book-about-ukrainian-easter/ '''''Traditional Velykden: Ukrainian Easter Recipes'''''], Sova Books, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

== Easter egg games ==
[[File:Easter Egg Hunt (5623253840).jpg|thumb|Eggs hidden for an [[Egg hunt|Easter egg hunt]]]]

===Egg hunts===
An [[egg hunt]] is a game in which [[decorated egg]]s, which may be hard-boiled chicken eggs, [[chocolate]] eggs, or artificial eggs containing [[candy|candies]], are hidden for children to find. The eggs often vary in size, and may be hidden both indoors and outdoors.&lt;ref name="puritan"&gt;{{cite book| author= A. Munsey Pu Frank a. Munsey Publishers| title= The Puritan April to September 1900| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yWRr8MnGI7EC&amp;pg=PA119| date= March 2005| publisher= Kessinger Publishing| isbn= 978-1-4191-7421-6| page= 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the hunt is over, prizes may be given for the largest number of eggs collected, or for the largest or the smallest egg.&lt;ref name=puritan/&gt;

The central European Slavic nations ([[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] etc.) have a tradition of gathering eggs by gaining them from the females in return of whipping them with a pony-tail shaped whip made out of fresh willow branches and splashing them with water, by the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]s called ''polivanja'', which is supposed to give them health and beauty.

[[Cascarón|Cascarones]], a Latin American tradition now shared by many US States with high Hispanic demographics, are emptied and dried chicken eggs stuffed with confetti and sealed with a piece of tissue paper. The eggs are hidden in a similar tradition to the American Easter egg hunt and when found the children (and adults) break them over each other's heads.

In order to enable children to take part in egg hunts despite visual impairment, eggs have been created that emit various clicks, beeps, noises, or music so that visually impaired children can easily hunt for Easter eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tillery |first= Carolyn |title= Annual Dallas Easter egg hunt for blind children scheduled for Thursday |work= [[The Dallas Morning News]]

===Egg rolling===
[[Egg rolling]] is also a traditional Easter egg game played with eggs at Easter. In the United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries children traditionally rolled eggs down hillsides at Easter.&lt;ref name="inventors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/estartinventions/a/easter_2.htm |title=Easter Eggs - Egg Rolling |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was taken to the [[New World]] by European settlers,&lt;ref name="inventors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyrdology.com/festivals/easter/egg-rolling.html|title= Easter Eggs: their origins, tradition and symbolism|publisher=Wyrdology.com|accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to this day each Easter with an [[Easter egg roll]] on the [[White House]] lawn. Different nations have different versions of the game.

===Egg tapping===
[[File:Eierkippen.jpg|thumb|left|Eggs after an egg tapping competition (red wins)]]
In the [[North of England]], during Eastertide, a traditional game is played where hard boiled ''pace eggs'' are distributed and each player hits the other player's egg with their own. This is known as "[[egg tapping]]", "egg dumping", or "egg jarping". The winner is the holder of the last intact egg. The annual egg jarping world championship is held every year over Easter in Peterlee Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottishcountrydanceoftheday.com/apr-easter|title=Scottish Country Dance of the Day {{!}} Butterscotch &amp; Thistles|website=Scottish Country Dance of the Day {{!}} Butterscotch &amp; Thistles|language=en|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

It is also practiced in Italy (where is called ''scuccetta''), Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Lebanon, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Russia, and other countries. In parts of Austria, Bavaria and German-speaking Switzerland it is called ''Ostereiertitschen'' or ''Eierpecken''. In parts of Europe it is also called ''epper'', presumably from the German name ''Opfer'', meaning "offering" and in Greece it is known as ''tsougrisma''. In South [[Louisiana]], this practice is called pocking eggs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pocking eggs or la toquette |url=http://creolecajun.blogspot.com/2008/03/pocking-eggs-or-la-toquette.html|publisher=Creolecajun.blogspot.com |accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=If Your Eggs Are Cracked, Please Step Down: Easter Egg Knocking in Marksville |url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/creole_art_egg_knocking.html |accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is slightly different. The [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creoles]] hold that the winner eats the eggs of the losers in each round.

In the Greek Orthodox tradition, red eggs are also cracked together when people exchange Easter greetings.

=== Egg dance ===
[[Egg dance]] is a traditional Easter game in which eggs are laid on the ground or floor and the goal is to dance among them without damaging any eggs&lt;ref name="newall"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KU9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA344|title=An egg at Easter: a folklore study|publisher=Routledge &amp; K.

=== Pace egg plays ===
The [[Pace Egg play]]s are traditional village plays, with a rebirth theme. The drama takes the form of a combat between the hero and villain, in which the hero is killed and brought back to life. The plays take place in England during Easter.[[File:Osterstrauss 08.jpg|thumb|In some countries like Sweden, Norway, Poland and Germany eggs are used as a table decoration hanging on a tree-branch]]

==Variants==

===Chocolate eggs===
In 1873 [[J.S. Fry &amp; Sons]] of England introduced the first chocolate Easter egg in Britain.

In Western cultures, the giving of chocolate eggs is now commonplace, with 80 million Easter eggs sold in the UK alone. Formerly, the containers Easter eggs were sold in contained large amounts of plastic, although in the United Kingdom this has gradually been replaced with recyclable paper and cardboard. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wasteconnect.co.uk/page.aspx?ID=36d6a9bc-a62a-4809-98cf-49dae76f2626|title=The End of Egg-cessive Easter Waste??

===[[Marzipan]] eggs===
In the Indian state of Goa, the Goan Catholic dish Marzipan is used to make easter eggs. In the Philippines, mazapán de pili (Spanish for "pili marzipan") is made from pili nuts.

&lt;gallery&gt;

===Artificial eggs===
The [[Faberge eggs|jewelled Easter eggs]] made by the Fabergé firm for the two last Russian [[Tsars]] are regarded as masterpieces of decorative arts. Most of these creations themselves contained hidden surprises such as clock-work birds, or miniature ships.

In Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and other [[Central Europe]]an countries' [[folklore|folk traditions]], and making artificial eggs out of [[porcelain]] for ladies is common.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, F.L.M., 1864, Seven Months' Residence in Russian Poland in 1868, London:Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}}

Easter eggs are frequently depicted in sculpture, including a 27-foot (9&amp;nbsp;m) sculpture of a pysanka standing in [[Vegreville]], [[Alberta]].

==Legends==
[[File:Vasnetsov Maria Magdalene.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Maria Magdalene]], 1899 by [[Viktor M. Vasnetsov]], depicted as one of the [[Myrrhbearers]].]]

===Christian traditions===
While the origin of Easter eggs can be explained in the symbolic terms described above, among followers of [[Eastern Christianity]] the [[legend]] says that [[Mary Magdalene]] was bringing cooked eggs to share with the other women at the tomb of Jesus, and the eggs in her basket miraculously turned bright red when she saw the risen Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melkite.org/Lent.htm |title=Traditions of Great Lent and Holy Week |publisher=Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Newton |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different, but not necessarily conflicting legend concerns Mary Magdalene's efforts to spread the [[Gospel]]. According to this tradition, after the [[Ascension of Jesus]], Mary went to the Emperor of Rome and greeted him with "Christ has risen," whereupon he pointed to an egg on his table and stated, "Christ has no more risen than that egg is red."

After making this statement it is said the egg immediately turned blood red.&lt;ref name=Mary&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kBGKYE26y50C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=egg+turned+red&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kSaCT5XDCKnZ0QHRgviUCA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=egg%20turned%20red&amp;f=false|title= Leap|publisher=[[Random House Digital, Inc.]]|author= Terry Tempest Williams|quote=After the Ascension, she travelled to Rome and was granted entrance to the court of Tiberius Caesar.

Dark red eggs are a tradition in Greece and represent the blood of [[Christ]] shed on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greekfood.about.com/od/greekcookingtips/ht/redeggs.htm Red eggs] About.com&lt;/ref&gt; The practice dates to the early Christian church in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref name="Itihaas"/&gt;
In Greece, superstitions of the past included the custom of placing the first-dyed red egg at the home's [[iconostasis]] (place where icons are displayed) to ward off evil. The heads and backs of small lambs were also marked with the red dye to protect them.

===Parallels in other faiths===

The egg is widely used as a symbol of the start of new life, just as new life emerges from an egg when the chick hatches out.&lt;ref name="fertility" /&gt;

Painted eggs are used at the Iranian spring holidays, the [[Nowruz]] that marks the first day of [[Spring (season)|spring]] or [[Equinox]], and the beginning of the year in the [[Persian calendar]]. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical [[Northward equinox]], which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. The painted eggs symbolize fertility and are displayed on the Nowruz table, called [[Haft-Seen]] together with various other symbolic objects. There are sometimes one egg for each member of the family. The ancient [[Zoroastrians]] painted eggs for Nowruz, their New Year celebration, which falls on the [[Spring equinox]]. The tradition continues among Persians of [[Islam]]ic, [[Zoroastrian]], and other faiths today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theotheriran.com/2016/03/26/photos-painted-eggs-across-tehran/|title=Photos: Painted eggs across Tehran|date=2016-03-26|work=The other Iran|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nowruz tradition has existed for at least 2,500 years. The sculptures on the walls of [[Persepolis]] show people carrying eggs for Nowruz to the king.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Neo-Pagan holiday of [[Wheel of the Year#Vernal Equinox (Ostara)|Ostara]] occurs at roughly the same time as Easter. While it is often claimed that the use of painted eggs is an ancient, pre-Christian component of the celebration of Ostara there are no historical accounts that the celebration of Ostara included this practice, apart from the [[Old High German lullaby]] which is believed by most to be a modern fabrication. Rather, the use of painted eggs has been adopted under the assumption that it might be a pre-Christian survival.

There are good grounds for the association between [[hare]]s (later termed [[Easter bunny|Easter bunnies]]) and [[bird egg]]s, through folklore confusion between hares' forms (where they raise their young) and [[plover]]s' nests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18190677 |publisher=BBC.com|title=H2g2 - The Easter Bunny|accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]], a hard-boiled egg is an element of the [[Passover Seder]], representing festival sacrifice. The children's game of hunting for the [[afikomen]] (a half-piece of matzo) has similarities to the Easter egg hunt tradition, by which the child who finds the hidden bread will be awarded a prize. In other homes, the children hide the afikoman and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize for revealing its location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19983">'''Glory''' (from the Latin ''gloria'', "fame, renown") is used to describe the manifestation of [[God in Christianity|God's]] presence as perceived by humans according to the [[Abrahamic religions]].

Divine glory is an important [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] throughout [[Christian theology]], where [[God]] is regarded as the ''most glorious'' being in existence, and it is considered that human beings are created in the [[Image of God]] and can share or participate, imperfectly, in divine glory as image-bearers. Thus Christians are instructed to "let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|5:16|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Glory" is one of the most common praise words in scripture. In the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], the concept of glory is expressed with several [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words, including ''[[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]]'' (הוד) and ''[[K-V-D|kavod]]''.  Later, these original Hebrew Bible concepts for glory were translated in the [[New Testament|Christian Testament]] as the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''doxa'' (δόξα). The Hebrew word ''kavod'' (K-V-D) has meant "importance", "weight", "deference", or "heaviness", but primarily ''kavod'' means "glory", "respect", "honor", and "majesty". In translating the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Greek word used is ''δόξα'', a word also appearing extensively in the [[New Testament]] which was originally written in Greek. ''Doxa'' means "judgment, opinion", and by extension, "good reputation, honor". [[St. Augustine]] later rendered it as ''clara notitia cum laude'', "brilliant celebrity with praise".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5201 The Catholic Encyclopedia, "Glory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==
{{further|Doxa|K-B-D}}

===Hebrew Bible (Judaism)===
In {{bibleref2|Exodus|33:19}}, [[Moses]] is told that no human being can see the glory ({{Lang-he|כָּבוֹד}} ''kavod'') of [[Yahweh]] and survive:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the Lord said to Moses, “This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The Lord.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy." But, he said, “you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.”  And the Lord said, “Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|33:17-23|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The prophet [[Ezekiel]] writes in his vision: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.

Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Ezekiel|1:27-28|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===New Testament===
In the New Testament, the corresponding word is the {{lang-gr|δοξα}}, ''doxa'', sometimes also translated "brightness". For example, at the nativity of [[Christ]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the countryside close by there were shepherds out in the fields keeping guard over their sheep during the watches of the night. An angel of the Lord stood over them and the glory of the Lord shone round them. They were terrified, but the angel said, 'Do not be afraid. Look, I bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by the whole people.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|2:8-10|NJB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the event known as the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]], [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] appeared in glory with Jesus, and the disciples who witnessed this revelation, Peter, James and John, 'saw his glory'.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 9:29-32 NKJV&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[gospel of John]], Jesus says that His destiny begins to be fulfilled when [[Judas Iscariot]] sets out to betray Him:
:''Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him'' ({{bibleverse||John|13:31|NKJV}}.

Jesus subsequently addresses a long prayer to [[God the Father|His Father]] in which he says:
:''I have glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. Now, Father, glorify me with that glory I had with you before ever the world existed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|17:4-5|NJB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Catholicism==

Catholic doctrine asserts that the world was created as an act of God's free will for his own glory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06585a.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia - Glory]&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholic doctrine teaches, however, that God does not seek to be glorified for his own sake, but for the sake of mankind that they may know Him.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3132.htm#1 ST]'', II-II, Q. 132, art. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Anglicanism==

The theologian [[C. S. Lewis]], in his essay [[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses|The Weight of Glory]], writes "Glory suggests two ideas to me, of which one seems wicked and the other ridiculous. Either glory means to me fame, or it means luminosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==In Orthodox Christianity&lt;!-- [[Glorified body]] redirects here--&gt;==

'''Glorification''' (also referred to as [[Canonization#Eastern Orthodox Practice&amp;mdash;Glorification|canonization]]) is the term used in the [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christian Church]] for the official recognition of a person as a [[saint]] of the Church.  The Orthodox Christian term ''[[Theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|theosis]]'' is roughly equivalent to the Protestant concept of glorification.

It is in this sense that the resurrected bodies of the righteous will be "glorified" at the [[Second Coming]]. As the soul was illuminated through ''theosis'' so the restored body will be illuminated by the grace of God when it is "changed" at the Parousia ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:51|KJV}}). This glorified body will be like the resurrected body of Jesus ({{bibleverse||John|20:19-20|KJV}}); similar in appearance to the body during life, but of a more refined and spiritualized nature ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:39|KJV}}).

==In Protestantism==
{{main|Glorification}}

In his dissertation "Concerning the End for which God Created the World", [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] concludes, "[I]t appears that all that is ever spoken of in the Scripture as an ultimate end of God's works is included in that one phrase, `the glory of God'."

There are two events that occur during glorification, these are "the receiving of perfection by the elect before entering into the kingdom of heaven," and  "the receiving of the resurrection bodies by the elect"

'''Glorification''' is the third stage of Christian development.  The first being [[Justification (theology)|justification]], then [[sanctification]], and finally '''glorification'''. (Rom. 8:28-30) Glorification is the full realization of [[salvation]].

===Receiving of Perfection===
Glorification is the [[Protestant]] alternative to [[purgatory]], as it is "the means by which the elect receive perfection before entering into the kingdom of Heaven." Purgatory deals with the means by which the elect become perfect, and takes place after physical death; glorification deals with the elect becoming perfect, and is an ongoing process which takes place during life. The majority of Protestant denominations believe in this form of glorification, although some have alternative names.

===Receiving of the Resurrection Bodies===

After the [[final judgement]], in some doctrines all the righteous dead will arise and their bodies will be perfected and become a glorified body, under which form they can enter [[Heaven]].

==In the Baha'i Faith==
The [[Baha'i Faith]] claims that [[Baha'u'llah]], whose name translates to the Glory of God, is the Messenger of God promised to Man by all the older Abrahamic religions, like Christianity, Judaism and Islam. In Bahá'í belief the Greatest Name is Bahá’ (بهاء), translated as "glory" or "splendour."

==In Islam==
In [[Islam|Islamic]] belief, God has [[Names of God in Islam|99 names]], and in some Islamic traditions it is believed that there is a special hidden 100th name which is the greatest. 

To glorify God in Islam is one of the four eternal good deeds. Glorifying God ([[Tasbih]] , Arabic: تسبيح) is mentioned in many verses in the [[Quran]]. For example "The seven heavens and the earth and all beings therein glorify God. There is not a single thing that does not glorify God with praise, but you do not understand their glorification. God is truly clement and forgiving" [Quran 17:44]. The prophet [[Muhammad]] said the eternal good deeds (Arabic: الباقيات الصالحات) are to glorify God ([[Tasbih]] , Arabic: تسبيح) , to praise God ([[Hamed]] , Arabic: حمد), to unify God ([[Tawhid]], Arabic: توحيد) and to elevate God ([[Takbir]] , Arabic: تكبير)&lt;ref&gt;الراوي : أبو هريرة | المحدث : الألباني | المصدر : صحيح الجامع. الصفحة أو الرقم: 3214 | خلاصة حكم المحدث : صحيح. التخريج : أخرجه النسائي في ((السنن الكبرى)) (10684)، والعقيلي في ((الضعفاء الكبير)) (3/17)، والطبراني في ((المعجم الأوسط)) (4027) باختلاف يسير.&lt;/ref&gt;. These are eternal good deeds due to their devotional and spiritual meanings as the Muslims understand them. For example, you glorify God because God is impeccable and you are in God's wonderful kingdom; you praise God because God is sustaining, ruling and loving you and everyone; you unify God because only God exists and nothing exists beside God; you elevate God so that nothing would remain or be elevated in your heart beside God. The prophet [[Muhammad]] said "To glorify God, to praise God, to unify God and to elevate God is more pleasing to my heart than everything under the sun.&lt;ref&gt; لَأَنْ أقُولَ سُبحانَ اللهِ ، و الحمدُ للهِ ، و لا إلهَ إلا اللهُ و اللهُ أكبرُ ، أحَبُّ إليَّ مِمَّا طَلَعَتْ عليه الشَّمسُ. الراوي : أبو هريرة | المحدث : الألباني | المصدر : صحيح الجامع. الصفحة أو الرقم: 5037 | خلاصة حكم المحدث : صحيح | انظر شرح الحديث رقم 20507&lt;/ref&gt;" The [[Quran]] says "wealth and children are the gloss of the worldly life, while the eternal good deeds are better" [18:46]. It is a common act of devotion for Muslims to glorify God (33 times), praise God (33 times) and elevate God (33/34 times) after each of the five daily regular prayers following the [[hadith]] saying of the prophet [[Muhammad]]&lt;ref&gt;عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن فقراء المهاجرين أتوا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقالوا‏:‏ ‏"‏ذهب أهل الدثور بالدرجات العلى، والنعيم المقيم‏:‏ يصلون كما نصلي، ويصومون كما نصوم، ولهم فضل من أموال‏:‏ يحجون، ويعتمرون، ويجاهدون، ويتصدقون‏.‏ فقال‏:‏ ‏"‏ألا أعلمكم شيئًا تدركون به من سبقكم، وتسبقون به من بعدكم، ولا يكون أحد أفضل منكم إلا من صنع مثل ما صنعتم‏؟‏ قالوا‏:‏ بلى يا رسول الله، قال‏:‏ ‏"‏تسبحون، وتحمدون، وتكبرون، خلف كل صلاة ثلاثًا وثلاثين قال أبو صالح الراوي عن أبي هريرة، لما سئل عن كيفية ذكرهن، قال‏:‏ يقول‏:‏ سبحان الله، والحمد لله، والله أكبر، حتى يكون منهن كلهن ثلاثًا وثلاثين‏.‏ ‏(‏‏(‏متفق عليه‏)‏‏)‏‏.‏ &lt;/ref&gt;.

Glorification in Islam has many layers of meanings that varies according to one's spiritual state and circumstances. Yet all these meanings generally imply viewing God as impeccable and the feeling of wonderment for being in such glorious existence. Among these meanings for example are:
# To glorify God is to have wonderment and integration with the universe, as a child is experiencing a universe that is singing with the child: "We did indeed bestow on David favor from Us: ''O mountains, and birds, sing the glory of God along with him.'' and we softened iron for him" [Quran 34:10].  
# To glorify God is to have the heart that stands in wonderment seeing that for God everything is possible through means or without means: "Glory to Him who journeyed His devotee by night, from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, whose precincts We blessed, so We might show him some of Our wonders. For He is the all-hearing, the all-seeing" [Quran 17:1].
# To glorify God is to view God as impeccable; that is to cleanse bad thoughts that you have about God: "Then the whale swallowed him, and he was blameworthy. If not for the fact that he was one who glorified God, he would have remained inside its guts until the day they are resurrected" [Quran 37:142-144]. 
# To glorify God is to free one's mind from constrained conceptions that you have about God without knowledge: "Yet they considered sprites partners to God, though God created them; and they falsely attribute sons and daughters to God, without knowledge. Glory be to God, exalted beyond what they describe" [Quran 6:100].
These are just few meanings, yet the glorification of God ([[Tasbih]]) is mentioned in more than 90 verses in the [[Quran]] and in many [[hadith]] sayings of the prophet [[Muhammad]].

==Human glory==
{{Main|Vanity}}
In comparison to the desire for glory from God, stands the desire for glory from man. [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', cautions that an inordinate desire of glory, or praise, from man is a sin. He lists [[Vanity|vainglory]] as a [[capital vice]] and, in some cases, as a [[mortal sin]], cf. quotation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3132.htm#1 ST]'', II-II, Q. 132, art. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not to be confused with the desire for what Aquinas calls ''honours'', which Aquinas considered a good, and embraces a moderate and reasoned pursuance of.

{{quote|As stated above (24, 12; 110, 4; 112, 2), a sin is mortal through being contrary to [[charity (virtue)|charity]]. Now the sin of vainglory, considered in itself, does not seem to be contrary to charity as regards the love of one's neighbor: yet as regards the love of God it may be contrary to charity in two ways. On one way, by reason of the matter about which one glories: for instance when one glories in something false that is opposed to the reverence we owe God, according to Ezekiel 28:2, "Thy heart is lifted up, and Thou hast said: I am God," and 1 Corinthians 4:7, "What hast thou that thou hast not received? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?" Or again when a man prefers to God the temporal good in which he glories: for this is forbidden (Jeremiah 9:23-24): "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man glory in his strength, and let not the rich man glory in his riches. But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me." Or again when a man prefers the testimony of man to God's; thus it is written in reproval of certain people (John 12:43): "For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God."

In another way vainglory may be contrary to charity, on the part of the one who glories, in that he refers his intention to glory as his last end: so that he directs even virtuous deeds thereto, and, in order to obtain it, forbears not from doing even that which is against God. On this way it is a mortal sin. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 14) that "this vice," namely the love of human praise, "is so hostile to a godly faith, if the heart desires glory more than it fears or loves God, that our Lord said (John 5:44): How can you believe, who receive glory one from another, and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?"

If, however, the love of human glory, though it be vain, be not inconsistent with charity, neither as regards the matter gloried in, nor as to the intention of him that seeks glory, it is not a mortal but a venial sin.}}

According to the [[Book of Revelation]] 20.11-15, the dead in Christ will receive a perfect glorified body at the first resurrection; those saints alive will be transformed into a glorified perfect body. The second resurrection is for the white throne judgement. Those not resurrected in the first resurrection will be resurrected for judgement to include those born during the thousand-year kingdom. Those whose names do not appear in the book of life will be thrown in the lake of fire.

==In art==
[[Image:St-john-patmos.jpg|thumb|right|220px|"Saint John on Patmos"  by [[Hans Baldung Grien]], 1511 ]]  The manifestation of glory (upon a [[saint]] for example) is often depicted in [[iconography]] using the religious symbol of a halo. Other common symbols of glory include white robes, [[Crown of Immortality|crowns]], jewels, [[gold]], and stars.  The [[Coronation of the Virgin]] is one of the most common depictions of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] in glory.

There are a number of specialised senses of "glory" in art, which all derive from French usages of "gloire". "Glory" was the medieval English word for a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] or [[aureole]], and continues to be used sometimes in this sense, mostly for the full-body version. The subject of [[Christ in Majesty]] is also known as "Christ in Glory", and in general any depiction of a sacred person in heaven (e.g. in the clouds, surrounded by angels) can be called a "glory", although this sense is obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;In the first edition of the [[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]] (late 19th century), entry no. 9b for "glory" ("A representation of the heavens opening and revealing celestial beings") was annotated "? Obs."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gate-nikko-japan.jpg|thumb|250px|Nikkō Tōshō-gū enshrines [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] under the posthumous name of Tōshō Daigongen]]
{{main|Honji suijaku}}
A {{nihongo||権現|'''''gongen'''''}}, literally "incarnation", was believed to be the manifestation of a [[Buddhahood|buddha]] in the form of an indigenous [[kami]], an entity who had come to guide the people to [[salvation]], during the era of [[shinbutsu-shūgō]] in premodern Japan.&lt;ref name="SoS"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/bts/bts_g.html#gongen ''Gongen''] accessed on October 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TY87"&gt;Tamura (2000:87)&lt;/ref&gt; The words {{nihongo||権化|gonge}} and {{nihongo||化現|kegen}} are [[synonym]]s for gongen.&lt;ref name="sos3"/&gt; {{nihongo||権現信仰|Gongen shinkō}} is the term for belief in the existence of gongen.&lt;ref name="sos3"/&gt;

The gongen concept is the cornerstone of the [[honji suijaku]] theory, according to which Buddhist deities choose to appear to the Japanese as native kami in order to save them, which is based on the [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] notion of [[upaya]], "expedient means".

== History ==
[[File:NikkoToriiTablet5127.jpg|left|thumb|Tablet on [[torii]] at [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]] reads "Tōshō Daigongen" (calligraphy by [[Emperor Go-Mizunoo]])]]It is sometimes assumed that the word ''gongen'' derives from [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]'s posthumous name (Tōshō Daigongen). However, the term was created and started being used in the middle of the [[Heian period]] in an effort to harmonize Buddhism and [[ethnic religion|indigenous religious practice]] in what is called shinbutsu-shūgō or "[[syncretism]] of kami and buddhas".&lt;ref name="TY87"&gt;Tamura (2000:87)&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the assumption that Japanese ''kami'' and buddhas were essentially the same evolved into a theory called {{nihongo|''honji suijaku''|本地垂迹}}, which held that native kami were manifestations or avatars of buddhas, [[bodhisattva]]s and other Buddhist deities.&lt;ref name="TY87"/&gt; The theory gradually spread around the country and the concept of gongen, a dual entity composed of a buddha and a kami, evolved.

Under the influence of [[Tendai|Tendai Buddhism]] and [[Shugendō]], the gongen concept was adapted to religious beliefs tied to [[Mount Iwaki]], a volcano, so that female kami Kuniyasutamahime became associated with [[Avalokiteśvara]] ''ekadaśamukha'' (Jūichimen Kannon Bosatsu, "Eleven-Faced [[Guanyin]]"), [[Ōkuninushi]] with [[Bhaisajyaguru]] (Yakushi Nyōrai) and [[Kuninotokotachi]] with [[Amitābha]] (Amida Nyōrai).&lt;ref&gt;Breen, Teeuwen (2000:194)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21385">The '''Indian Placement Program''', or '''Indian Student Placement Program''' (ISPP), also called the '''Lamanite Placement Program,'''&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;[http://fox13now.com/2016/11/16/judge-rejects-lds-churchs-request-for-a-restraining-order-in-sex-abuse-lawsuits/ Ben Winslow, "LDS Church loses request for a restraining order in sex abuse lawsuits"], Fox13 News (Salt Lake City), 16 November 2016; accessed 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; was operated by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) in the United States, officially operating from 1954 and virtually closed by 1996. It had its peak during the 1960s and 1970s. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students who were baptized members of the LDS Church were placed in foster homes of LDS members during the school year. They attended majority-white public schools, rather than the Indian boarding schools or local schools on the reservations.

The program was developed according to LDS theology, whereby conversion and assimilation to Mormonism could help Native Americans, who had been classified as [[Lamanites]] in terms of theology in the Book of Mormon. An estimated 50,000 Native American children went through the program.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/why-some-native-americans-are-suing-the-mormon-church/504944/ Lilly Fowler, "Why Several Native Americans Are Suing the Mormon Church"], ''The Atlantic,'' 23 October 2016; accessed 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plaintiffX"/&gt; The foster placement was intended to help develop leadership among Native Americans and assimilate them into majority-American culture. The cost of care was borne by the foster parents, and financially stable families were selected by the church. Most of these placements took place in the [[Navajo Nation]], with a peak participation of 5,000 students in 1972. The program decreased in size after the 1970s, due to criticism, changing mores among Native Americans, and restriction of the program to high school students as schools improved on reservations. Many of the students and families praised the program; others criticized it and the LDS Church for weakening the Native Americans' ties to their own cultures.

In the spring of 2015, four plaintiffs (now referred to as the "Doe Defendants") filed suit in the Window Rock District of the [[Navajo Nation]] Tribal Court, alleging they had been sexually abused for years while in the foster program, roughly from the years 1965 to 1983, and the Mormon Church did not adequately protect them.&lt;ref name="judgerules"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/11/18/navajo-nation-has-jurisdiction-mormon-sex-abuse-case-judge-rules-166503 Suzette Brewer, "Navajo Nation Has Jurisdiction in Mormon Sex Abuse Case, Judge Rules"], ''Indian Country Today,'' 18 November 2016; accessed 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The church filed suit in federal district court in Salt Lake City, alleging that the Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction and seeking an injunction "to stay the proceedings from moving forward under tribal jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="judgerules"/&gt; Federal district court judge Robert Shelby denied the church's motion to dismiss and also ruled that it first had to "exhaust all remedies" in Tribal Court. This is considered a major victory for tribal jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="judgerules"/&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
{{see also|Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners}}
During the earliest days of the LDS Church in Utah, Mormons often raised Native American children in their homes. Leader [[Brigham Young]] advocated buying children [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|held by Native Americans and Mexican traders as slaves]] (a legal practice in the [[Utah Territory]] prior to the [[American Civil War]]), freeing them from slavery, and encouraged Latter-day Saints to educate and acculturate the children as if they were their own.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{citation |last= Jones |first= Sondra |year= 2000 |title= The Trial of Don Pedro León Luján: The Attack against Indian Slavery and Mexican Traders in Utah |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[University of Utah Press]] |isbn= 0874806151 |oclc= 42022311 |lccn= 99041534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDS theology suggests that the Native Americans have a special status. It held that Native Americans had two distinct phenotypes: "[[Nephites]], light-skinned, "righteous and civilized people;" and [[Lamanites]], "idle, savage and bloodthirsty," for which they were "cursed by God" with dark skin."&lt;ref name="plaintiffX"/&gt; Although this is a prevailing view, there are alternative perspectives about whether the distinction referred to in the Book of Mormon actually referred to skin color. These differing views are more complex than popular and simplistic characterizations portray. For more, see Brant A. Gardner, "What Does the Book of Mormon Mean by 'Skin of Blackness?'"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fairmormon.org/archive/publications/what-does-the-book-of-mormon-mean-by-skin-of-blackness&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Student Placement Program (ISPP) of the late 20th century developed from an informal placement in 1947 in [[Richfield, Utah]] by the LDS Church. A 16-year old [[Navajo]] teenager, Helen John, asked permission to stay in the city to go to school. As a result, Golden Buchanan and Miles Jensen organized an informal placement program under the direction of [[Spencer W. Kimball]], who was the chairman of the church's Committee on Indian Relationships. With her parent's permission, Helen was allowed to stay with the Buchanan family, whom she knew in Richfield. This arrangement was not an official program, but it was the basis for the Indian Placement Program that would later be established. The Buchanans agreed to take in other children as well,&lt;ref name="rise and decline" /&gt; and that year three students were placed into the unofficial program. These arrangements continued, and by 1954 there were some 68 Native American students (mostly from the Navajo Nation) placed into foster homes in four different western states.&lt;ref name="ludlow" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ISPP worked to instill Western notions of industry through the imposition of an ethno-religious identity. The Lamanite identity defined Indians as culturally and spiritually apostate Israelites destined for latter-day restoration through an internalized Protestant work ethic. Although some rejected this theological identity others found it a point of strength and empowerment as they attended schools and participated in specific ISPP efforts to develop Western leadership patterns among Native American participants.&lt;ref name="abstract"&gt;Matthew Garrett, [http://gradworks.umi.com/34/10/3410632.html ''Mormons, Indians and Lamanites: The Indian Student Placement Program, 1947-2000].'' Ph.D. dissertation, Arizona State University, 2010; accessed 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ISPP was defined as an "educational opportunity," as opposed to foster care. Its objective was the "assimilation and "whitening" of Indian children as a divine imperative outlined in the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref name="plaintiffX"&gt;[https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/10/19/i-am-x-mormon-church-faces-growing-sex-abuse-scandal-pt-1-166143?page=0%2C1 Suzette Brewer, "‘I am X’: Mormon Church Faces Growing Sex Abuse Scandal, Pt. 1"], ''Indian Country Today,'' 19 October 2016; accessed 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The church members believed that, "by educating and assimilating Indian children into Mormon culture and religion they could be "lightened," thereby breaking their Lamanite (or dark-skinned) "curse" and restoring the prophecy of their redemption."&lt;ref name="plaintiffX"/&gt; In 2013, the Mormon Church officially renounced this doctrine.&lt;ref name="plaintiffX"/&gt;

===Organization of the Indian Placement Program===

The success of these students led to the church establishing a formal placement program in July 1954, under the Church Social Services,&lt;ref name="ludlow" /&gt; which was part of the [[Relief Society]]. Under this program, a social worker was assigned to each Native American foster child. A reception center was built in Richfield to accommodate the large numbers of participants. Buses and other transportation were arranged to bring children to the center where they would be fed, receive medical examinations, and be introduced to their foster families.&lt;ref name="rise and decline" /&gt; Students participated from the Navajo Nation and other tribes in the Southwest, as well as some from other parts of the United States.

When the program became institutionalized, there were some complaints that LDS [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] were assigned to recruit new participants. In 1956, the Bureau of Indian Affairs received complaints that the placement program was being used to increase the church's proselytizing efforts. The governments of Utah and Arizona in March 1957 met with church representatives to address the issue. As a result, caseworkers rather than missionaries were given the responsibility of making the final decision for acceptance of students into the Indian Placement Program.&lt;ref name="rise and decline" /&gt;

In order for children to participate in the program, their parents had to request their placement. Foster parents were recommended by local bishops and were expected to provide free room, board, and clothing for the Native American children. These children had to be at least eight years old, baptized as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and be in good standing in the church and in good health.&lt;ref name="ludlow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ludlow|first1=Daniel H.|title=Encyclopedia of Mormonism|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|pages=679–680|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/EoM/id/4391/show/3793|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1960, Kimball discussed the program at the [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]]. He said that Natives who participated in the program were gradually turning lighter, becoming 'white and delightsome.'&lt;ref name="abuse"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/04/05/navajo-siblings-claim-horrific-sexual-abuse-sue-mormons-164024 Alysa Landry, "Navajo Siblings Claim ‘Horrific’ Sexual Abuse; Sue Mormons"], ''Indian Country Today,'' 5 April 2016; accessed 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; "The day of the Lamanites is nigh," Kimball said, claiming that Navajo placement students were "as light as Anglos" and, in one case, several shades lighter than parents "on the same reservation, in the same [[hogan]], subject to the same sun and wind and weather."&lt;ref name="abuse"/&gt; It should be noted that the Church has moved away from other race-based qualifications that, while practiced, were never accepted as doctrine and have been repudiated by the church. See, e.g. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, "Race and the Priesthood."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, racial references in scripture headings, not considered doctrine, have been removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=50882900&amp;itype=CMSID&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development====
Some families had their children baptized in the church in order to gain the opportunity to go to school off the reservation. To avoid this, in the 1950s and 1960s, the church added new requirements for acceptance of children into the program. In 1969, the Unified Social Services was established in the church; this became the administrative body to run the Indian Placement Program. In 1973 it was renamed and organized as LDS Social Services.&lt;ref name="rise and decline" /&gt;

By 1972, nearly 5,000 Native Americans were living in foster homes through this program. Some students went on to study at [[Brigham Young University]], earning college degrees. In 1971 they created a performance group of singers and dancers called "The Lamanite Generation." Among their pieces was "Go My Son," a song referring to the "ladder of education."&lt;ref name="landry"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/01/07/assimilation-tool-or-blessing-inside-mormon-indian-student-placement-program-162959 Alysa Landry, "Assimilation Tool or Blessing? Inside the Mormon Indian Student Placement Program"], ''Indian Country Today,'' 7 January 2016; accessed 8 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 local priesthood leaders were given the responsibility for recruiting and screening new students. Due to strong criticism and rising Native American activism, the program had nearly been discontinued in 1977. The US government commissioned a study under the Interstate Compact Secretariat, which oversaw educational efforts. It heard much praise from Native American families for the program.&lt;ref name="rise and decline" /&gt; After assessing the program results and hearing testimonial from participants and foster families, the church decided to continue it.&lt;ref name="ludlow"/&gt;

After 1972, the number of students that participated in the program decreased. By the late 1970s, the number of participants in the Indian Placement Program was around 2,500. In response to the improvement of local schools developed on the reservations in preference to boarding schools, in the 1980s the Indian Placement Program limited participants to high-school students; the number of students dropped to 500 in 1990.  In 1996 there were virtually no more participants, although the last graduated in 2000.&lt;ref name="rise and decline" /&gt;

In the 1970s, the Indian Placement Program was directed to emphasize creating stronger bonds and increased communication between the natural families and the selected foster families. The goal of the program was to "introduce Native Americans to mainstream values and social roles without demanding the abandonment of the old for the new."&lt;ref name="ludlow" /&gt; According to the Maxwell Institute of BYU, it attempted to help Native Americans receive more formal education and training, while helping them maintain their identity.&lt;ref name="rise and decline"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Rise and Decline of the LDS Indian Student Placement Program, 1947-1996|url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=13&amp;chapid=91|work=Mormons, Scripture, and the Ancient World: Studies in Honor of John L. Sorenson|last=Allen|first1=James B.|location=Provo|publisher=Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies|date=1998|pages=85–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

Multiple studies have been conducted of the program. As recorded, about one-third of the participants stayed in the program until graduation from high school. 40 percent of students decided to drop out of the program, and 15 percent of students left the program because of their parents' wishes or needs. Students who did drop out were still more likely to finish high school than were Native American peers who had not participated in the program. Students in the Indian Placement Program had an 82 percent graduation rate. Studies found that the "longer students remained in the program, the more likely they were to be employed and to earn high incomes" and also to marry.&lt;ref name="rise and decline" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Beginning in the 1970s, however, the Indian Placement Program was increasingly criticized. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program.  The commission found that the program was largely positive, and enjoyed emphatic support both from Native American parents and white foster parents.&lt;ref name="Making lamanites"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|first1=Matthew|title=Making Lamanites: Mormons, Native Americans, and the Indian Student Placement Program, 1947-2000|isbn=9781607814948|publisher=University of Utah Press|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194–195}} Critics "view intervention as an intrusion on the right to be fully Native American, a weakening of cultural pluralism, and a cause of psychological damage."&lt;ref name="ludlow" /&gt; Most of the students came from the [[Navajo Nation]].

===Sexual abuse litigation===

On March 22, 2016, two members of the Navajo Nation, (plaintiffs "RJ" and "MM") filed a complaint in [[Navajo Nation]] District Court (a [[tribal court]]) against LDS Family Services and against the Corporation of the President, alleging sexual abuse during their foster placement in the IPP from 1976 to 1983.&lt;ref name="FOX news"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/03/24/lds-church-named-in-lawsuit-alleging-sexual-abuse-of-navajo-children-in-foster-program/|last1=Green| first1=Mark|last2=Steinbrecher|first2=Lauren|title=LDS Church named in lawsuit alleging sexual abuse of Navajo children in foster program|date=24 Mar 2016|work= Fox 13 News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navajo court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noakerlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Complaint-for-Personal-Injury-RJ-MM-v-LDS-.pdf|title=Navajo Nation District Court Complaint for Personal Injury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their complaint was amended April 21.&lt;ref name="amend complaint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/doc03-1-navajo-amended-complaint.pdf|title=Navajo Nation District Court First Amended Complaint for Personal Injury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, 2016 a third Navajo plaintiff ("BN") filed a lawsuit alleging abuse from 1965 to 1972.&lt;ref name="havasunews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.havasunews.com/nation/navajo-woman-sues-mormon-church-alleging-abuse/article_1928133e-27b3-11e6-a5a1-e7a4303c05db.html|last1=Fonseca|first1=Felicia|title=Navajo woman sues Mormon Church alleging abuse|date=31 May 2016|work=Havasu News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, a fourth plaintiff ("LK") sued in Navajo Nation District Court.&lt;ref name="SLT utah man sues"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/3977794-155/utah-man-is-fourth-navajo-to?fullpage=1|last1=Dobner|first1=Jennifer|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|title=Utah man is fourth Navajo to sue Mormon church, alleges sexual abuse in foster program|date=7 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on May 31, attorneys for the LDS Church petitioned for declaratory judgement in the [[United States District Court for the District of Utah]] (''not'' the tribal court), seeking both a declaration that the tribal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Church, and an order enjoining the lawsuit from proceeding in tribal court. Because the Church's suit was filed against the Navajo plaintiffs in the District Court, the Church becomes the plaintiff in the federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="us district court"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/doc02ldsfamilyservices.pdf|title=Complaint for Declaratory Judgment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 3, LDS Church attorneys expanded their motion to Judge [[Robert Shelby]] in District Court to include plaintiff BN, and amended their response to seek a federal order restraining the tribal court from proceeding.&lt;ref name="fox 13 restraining order"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/06/03/lds-church-seeks-restraining-order-in-navajo-sex-abuse-lawsuits/|title=LDS Church seeks restraining order in Navajo sex abuse lawsuits|last1=Winslow|first1=Ben|work=Fox 13 News|date=3 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Federal district court judge Robert Shelby denied the church's motion to dismiss and ruled that it first had to "exhaust all remedies" in Tribal Court. Shelby wrote that 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;it was necessary to allow the Navajo Nation courts to develop the factual record, because "the existing record is significantly incomplete concerning the nature and scope of the agreements [between the Mormon Church and the defendants], and any nexus between those agreements and the alleged conduct" alleged in the Doe Defendants' complaints.&lt;ref name="judgerules"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By ordering the Mormon Church to first exhaust its legal remedies in tribal court, Shelby said that the Navajo Nation judicial system would then be able to assess the facts of the case and whether jurisdiction was on the table. Further, it would allow the Navajo courts time to analyze the complex legal and factual issues at hand—thus advancing Congress's explicit policy in promoting tribal self-governance and the development of tribal court jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="judgerules"/&gt; 

This ruling is considered a major victory for tribal jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="judgerules"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Jainism}}
[[Bundelkhand]], in the heart of India, has been an ancient centre of [[Jainism]]. It is mostly in modern [[Madhya Pradesh]], but part of it is in [[Uttar Pradesh]].

Bundelkhand was known as Dasharna or Jaijakabhukti in ancient times. The [[Betwa]] ([[Vetravati]]) and [[Dhasan River|Dhasan]] ([[Dasharna]]) rivers flow through it.

It is one of the few regions in India where Jainism has a strong presence and influence. There are many ancient [[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]s in Bundelkhand. Many of the modern scholars of Jainism are from this region.

==Prominent tirthas==
Many of the famous Jain [[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]s, [[Vidisha]], [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh|Deogarh]], [[Lalitpur District, India|Lalitpur]], [[Karguanji]] ([[Jhansi]]), [[Chanderi]], [[Kundalpur]], [[Khajuraho]], [[Aharji Jain Teerth|Aharji]], [[Paporaji]], Drongir (chhatarpur), [[Sonagir]], [[Nainagiri]], [[Badagaon]], [[Pateriaji]] etc. are in this region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amarujala.com/uttar-pradesh/lalitpur/Lalitpur-43329-25  तीर्थ आस्था व श्रद्धा के केन्द्र, Amar Ujala 10 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain communities==
Bundelkhand is home to several Jain communities:
* [[Parwar (Jain)|Parwar]]
* [[Golapurva]]
* [[Golalare]]
* [[Taranpanthi]] (including Samiya, Charanagare and Ayodhyavasi)
* [[Kathanere]]

The [[Sarawagi|Khandelwals]] are originally from Rajasthan, but they have been present in Bundelkhand since ancient times.

Navalsah Chanderia in 1768 in his Vardhamana Purana mentioned 11 communities that were partly Jain. These include
* [[Gahoi|Grihapati]]
* [[Nema community|Nema]]
* [[Asati]]
A few among them are still jain and follow the [[Taranpanthi]] sect.

{{Jainism}}
Adherents of [[Jainism]] first settled in Canada in small numbers in the late 19th century. The number of Jains in Canada later increased, leading to the establishment of Jain temples in Canada. The type of Jainism in Canada later exhibited several differences from Jainism in India.

==History==
The number of Jains in Canada greatly increased in the 1970s due to the liberalization of Canada's immigration laws. This has allowed for a community of Jain immigrants to become established in Canada, where they have formed a unique spiritual and cultural identity.&lt;ref name=Lambek/&gt; Most Canadian Jains now live in [[Ontario]], particularly [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=Lambek/&gt;

==First temple==
The first Jain society in the Toronto area was formed in 1974. At that time, there were approximately 150 Jain families in the region. A Jain religious center was first officially established in [[Toronto]] in 1988 when the Jain society purchased a Church building and converted it into a temple.&lt;ref name=mcateer&gt;{{cite news|last=McAteer|first=Michael|title=Non-violence to any living thing|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/470503511.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+22%2C+1989&amp;author=Michael+McAteer+Toronto+Star&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=JAINISM+Non-violence+to+any+living+thing&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=April 22, 1989|page=M.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple served both the [[Svetambara]] and [[Digambar]] communities, whose theology and religious practice differs in some aspects.&lt;ref name=Lambek/&gt;

A new temple is in construction in Scarborough, which, once completed in 2016, it will be the largest Jain temple in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Toronto’s Jains build a ‘landmark’ temple  | author= Ajit Jain| publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]]| date = February 1, 2013| url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/torontos-jains-build-a-landmark-temple/article8129948/ | accessdate = March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2018|1|4}}

==Themes in Canadian Jainism==
Canadian Jainism differs from Jainism in India in part due to the lack of Jain ascetics. In India, ascetics often promote sect loyalty and religious orthodoxy. This difference has promoted a more non-sectarian Jain identity which allows for diversity of beliefs. Some Jains have argued that this leads to a less authentic version of Jainism. Others have applauded the way that Canadian Jainism promotes a more casteless modern interpretation of the religion.&lt;ref name=Lambek/&gt; In the [[Gujarati people|Gujarati community]] Jains have become integrated with [[Hinduism in Canada|Hindus]], and have often served together on community projects.&lt;ref name=Magocsi&gt;Magocsi 1999, p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many Canadian Jains actively promote [[vegetarianism]], [[meditation]], and [[interfaith dialog]].&lt;ref name=Lambek&gt;Lambek 2002, p. 557&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Justice and Equality Movement''' ([[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''JEM'''; {{lang-ar|حركة العدل والمساواة}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ḥarakat al-ʿAdl wal-musāwāh&amp;#x202f;}}'') is a Sudanese opposition group founded by [[Khalil Ibrahim]],&lt;ref name="WhoAre"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7039360.stm BBC Staff (24 February 2009) "Who are Sudan's Darfur rebels?" ''BBC News'']&lt;/ref&gt; the group has been led since January 2012 by his brother [[Gibril Ibrahim]], as Khalil was killed in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"Darfur's strongest rebel group elects new chief" ''Reuters'', 26 January 2012 https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/26/ozatp-sudan-darfurr-idAFJOE80P05T20120126&lt;/ref&gt; JEM's political agenda includes issues such as: radical and comprehensive constitutional reform to grant Sudan's regions a greater share of power in ruling the country (one point of this is a rotating presidency), the replacement of social injustice and political tyranny with justice and equality, and basic services for every Sudanese.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Sudan, General Non-state conflict Information, JEM, Actor Description, viewed 25 July 2013, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=145&amp;regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and organization==
The beginnings of the Justice and Equality Movement trace to the writers of the ''[[The Black Book: Imbalance of Power and Wealth in the Sudan|Black Book]]'', a manuscript published in 2000 that details the [[structural inequality]] in the country; the JEM founder, Khalil Ibrahim, was one of the authors.&lt;ref name="WhoAre"/&gt; JEM advocates replacing the dictatorship of [[Omar al-Bashir]] and the ruling [[National Congress (Sudan)|Congress Party]] with a civil, democratic state that respects the rights of Sudan's various ethnic groups, women, and youth. The JEM further committed itself to these principles when it signed the [[New Dawn Charter]] in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Sudan Tribune, New Dawn agreement is strategic breakthrough for Sudan, JEM, 15 January 2013 http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article45202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article45182 The New Dawn Charter represents a crucial moment for Sudan], ''Sudan Tribune'', 10 January 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

JEM claim to possesses forces numbering around 35,000 and an ethnically diverse membership.&lt;ref name="WhoAreJem"/&gt; According to critics it is not the "rainbow of tribes" it claims to be, as most Jem members, including its leader, are from the Zaghawa tribe.&lt;ref name="WhoAreJem"/&gt;   JEM is part of the [[Sudan Revolutionary Front]] (SRF), an alliance of groups opposed to the government in Khartoum that include the Sudan Liberation Movement(Abdul Wahed), [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army|the Sudan Liberation Movement (Minnawi)]], and [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army|the Sudan Liberation Movement - North]].

==History of attacks==
In October 2007, the JEM attacked the Defra oilfield in the [[Kordofan]] region of Sudan. The [[Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company]], a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]]-led consortium, controls the field. The next month, a group of 135 Chinese engineers arrived in Darfur to work on the Defra field. Ibrahim told reporters, "We oppose them coming because the Chinese are not interested in human rights. [They are] just interested in Sudan's resources." The JEM claims that the revenue from oil sold to China funds the Sudanese government and the [[Janjaweed|Janjaweed militia]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news| title= Darfur rebels spurn Chinese force | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7111206.stm | date=2007-11-24| accessdate=2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of December 11, 2007, Khalil Ibrahim claimed that JEM forces fought and defeated Sudanese government troops guarding a Chinese-run oilfield in the [[Kordofan]] region. [[Khartoum]] officials, however, denied that any oil fields had come under attack.  Ibrahim said that the attack was part of a JEM campaign to rid Sudan of Chinese-run oilfields and stated that "[The JEM] want all Chinese companies to leave. They have been warned many times. They should not be there."&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sudan rebels 'attack oilfield' |publisher=Al Jazeera English |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/7BD4ADA2-8B0F-4D4B-B673-A836027DA78B.htm |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212233515/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/7BD4ADA2-8B0F-4D4B-B673-A836027DA78B.htm |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, JEM engaged in its most famous operation against the Sudanese government when it [[2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum|attacked the Sudanese capital of Khartoum]]. JEM's advance recorded many impressive gains which included temporarily controlling the city of [[Omdurman]], the airport at the Wadi Sayedna military base, {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Khartoum, and three bridges leading into the capital.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield"&gt;Steve Bloomfield, The Independent, Darfur rebels poised to take Khartoum, 11 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The operation ended with heavy battles in the western part of the Sudanese capital that included the government's use of army helicopters to repel the JEM advance.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield" /&gt;  Following this battle, [[Eltahir Elfaki]], the General Secretary of JEM's legislative council, vowed that the war would henceforth be fought across the country, saying that "We haven't changed our tactics. From the beginning, Jem is a national movement and it has a national agenda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/51DF8D2C-009B-4262-BCC2-C59F07219ABB.htm "Sudan 'repulses' rebel attack"], Al Jazeera, May 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Khalil Ibrahim declared that "This is just the start of a process and the end is the termination of this regime".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A0C807C2-F75E-4E95-8BFD-F1BFE716CD77.htm "Sudan leader 'terrified' by arrest"], Al Jazeera, May 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, JEM and its allies in the [[Sudan Revolutionary Front]] engaged in many successful attacks against Sudanese government forces.  In a raid coordinated between all the parties of the SRF that included the use of 20 vehicles, the opposition forces briefly held the strategic city of Um Rawaba in [[North Kordofan]], located {{convert|300|mi|km}} south of Khartoum.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, Sudan rebels attack city, push closer to capital, 27 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the offensive, JEM and the SRF also gained control of Abu Korshola, a strategic town of 40,000 in  [[South Kordofan]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, Sudan's army seizes back town from rebels in oil state, 27 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In its bid to retake control, the Sudanese Armed Forces engaged in indiscriminate air raid campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Enough Project, Civilians Caught in the Crossfire: The Bombing of Abu Kershola and Ad Dandour, 10 June 2013, [http://enoughproject.org/reports/civilians-caught-crossfire-bombing-abu-kershola-and-ad-dandour]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 27, the opposition forces withdrew in order to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered to the area's residents.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, Sudan's army seizes back town from rebels in oil state, 27 May 2013 [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/27/us-sudan-fighting-idUSBRE94Q0G320130527]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, opposition forces continue to engage in offensive operations, leading to dozens of casualties for Sudanese forces around Abu Korshola.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Dabanga, ‘SRF kill 14 Sudan government troops in blitz on Abu Karshola, South Kordofan’: Rebels, 9 June 2013, {{cite web |url=http://www.radiodabanga.org/node/51227 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215223854/https://www.radiodabanga.org/node/51227 |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radio Dabanga, Sudan rebel attack on Abu Karshola ‘kills 30 SAF, downs chopper’, 31 May 2013 {{cite web |url=http://www.radiodabanga.org/node/50550 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215223317/https://www.radiodabanga.org/node/50550 |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kalachuris of Kalyani''' were a 12th-century Indian dynasty, who ruled over parts of present-day northern [[Karnataka]] and [[Maharashtra]]. This dynasty rose to power in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region between 1156 and 1181 CE (25 years).

The rulers of the dynasty traced their origins to one Krishna, who is said to have conquered [[Kalinjar]] and [[Dahala]] in present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]] (see [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]]). Bijjala, a viceroy of the dynasty, is said to have established the authority over [[Karnataka]] after wresting power from the [[Chalukya]] king Taila III. Bijjala was succeeded by his sons Someshvara and Sangama but after 1181 CE, the Chalukyas gradually retrieved the territory. Their rule was short and turbulent and yet very important from a socio-religious point of view; a new sect known as the [[Lingayat]] or [[Virashaiva]] sect was founded during these times in a time extent of 25 years.&lt;ref name="Students' Britannica India"&gt;Students' Britannica India By Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani.&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique and purely native form of [[Kannada]] literature-poetry called the ''Vachanas'' was also born during this time. The writers of ''[[Vachanas]]'' were called ''Vachanakaras'' (poets). Many other important works like Virupaksha Pandita's ''Chennabasavapurana'', Dharani Pandita's ''Bijjalarayacharite'' and Chandrasagara Varni's ''Bijjalarayapurana'' were also written.

==Origin==

The Kalachuris of Kalyani overthrew the [[Kalyani Chalukyas]] in the early part of the ''12th century'', and had a relatively short but stormy rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/chalukya/kalyani.htm
|title=Chalukyas of Kalyana (973- 1198 CE)
|publisher=
|accessdate=2009-03-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Kalachuri" is shared by multiple earlier dynasties, two of which ruled in central India. Some historians such as Dr. P.B. Desai believe that the southern Kalachuris of Kalyani are descendants of these central Indian dynasties. In the 6th century, before the rise of the [[Chalukyas of Badami|Badami Chalukyas]], the [[Kalachuri dynasty|Kalachuris of Mahishmati]] had carved out an extensive empire covering areas of Gujarat, [[Malwa]], [[Konkan]] and parts of Maharashtra. However, after their crippling defeat at the hands of Chalukya [[Mangalesha]], they remained in obscurity for a prolonged period of time. Subsequently, the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]] and their branches rose to power in central India.

A 1174 CE record says the Kalyani Kalachuri dynasty was founded by one Soma who grew beard and moustache to save himself from the wrath of Parashurama, and thereafter the family came to be known as "Kalachuris", Kalli meaning a long moustache and churi meaning a sharp knife. They migrated to the south and made Magaliveda or Mangalavedhe (Mangalavada) their capital. They titled themselves Kalanjara-puravaradhisvara ("Lord of [[Kalanjara]]"), which indicates their central Indian origin. Their emblem was Suvarna Vrishabha or the golden bull. They must have started as modest feudatories of the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani]]. They were also referred to as Katachuris (shape of a sharp knife) and ''[[Haihayas|Haihaya]]'' (or ''Heheya'').

The later records of the dynasty claim that they descended from [[Brahma]], the Creator of the universe.

== As feudatories of Chalukyas ==

The early Kalachuris of the south were Jains and encouraged Jainism in their kingdom. The first notable chief of the Kalachuri family of [[Karnataka]] was Uchita. While there were several kings who followed him ruling as feudatories of the [[Kalyani Chalukyas]], it was Jogama who became an influential vassal of [[Vikramaditya VI]], being related to the great [[Western Chalukyas|Chalukya]] king by matrimony.

==Decline Of Kalachuris==

The Southern Kaluchuri kingdom went into decline after the assassination of Bijjalla.  The rulers who followed were weak and incompetent, with the exception of Sovideva, who managed to maintain control over the kingdom. Western Chalukyas ended the Kalachuri Dynasty. Many Kalachuri families migrated to Kanara districts of Karnataka. The Kalachuris are the principal characters in the Andhra epic ''The battle of [[Palnadu]]''.

The '''Lee style''' of [[t'ai chi ch'uan]] (李氏太極拳) is closely related to a range of disciplines of [[Taoist]] Arts taught within the Lee style including [[Qigong]], [[Tao Yin]], [[Ch'ang Ming]], [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], [[Taoist alchemy]], [[Feng Shou]] [[Kung Fu]], and weapons practice. According to practitioners, it was first brought to the West in the 1930s by [[Chan Kam Lee]] and was subsequently popularized by [[Chee Soo]] who was the President of the International Taoist Society from 1958 until his death in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139-140 (published by [[HarperCollins]] 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Lee style of t'ai chi ch'uan comprises two forms known as 'the dance' or Tiào wǔ 跳舞, and 'the form'. Other exercises include I Fu Shou or 'sticky hands', Whirling Hands, Whirling Arms, and various [[qi]] and Li development exercises.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Lee style t'ai chi is related to Martial Arts training, and there are five distinct areas of development that comprise the whole Art:&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 chapter 2 - The principles of the Supreme Ultimate&lt;/ref&gt;
#Physical 
#Mental 
#Breathing 
#Sheng Qi 生气 (Internal energy) 
#Ching Sheng Li 精生力 (External energy).

== History ==
According to [[Chee Soo]] the Lee style is the only true Taoist art and the oldest form of T'ai Chi Ch'uan in existence.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Aquarian Press 1984 {{ISBN|9780850303872}} pages 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from an original set of eight movements created by Ho-Hsieh Lee from [[Beijing]] at the beginning of the [[Western Zhou dynasty]] around 1000 BC. His family moved to a fishing village called [[Weihai]]wei on the East coast of China in [[Shandong Province]] and settled there and practised a range of Taoist Arts. The techniques were passed on from one generation to the next and kept within the family until the last in their line, [[Chan Kam Lee]], fled the war torn China of the 1930s and emigrated to London to establish a business in the jewel trade. Here he met and adopted a young orphan named Chee Soo, and he passed the techniques on to him as he had no children of his own.

In 1977 Chee Soo was interviewed by [[Brian Hayes (broadcaster)|Brian Hayes]] on [[LBC]] radio and talked about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan, and meeting his teacher [[Chan Kam Lee]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Chee Soo'': It's rather curious, by a very strange coincidence, probably another Chinese fairy tale really. When I left Doctor Barnardo homes at fourteen years of age I became a page boy in Earl's Court in a nursing home, and I used to go over to Hyde Park and have a kick around on my day off on Sundays, and I happened to be playing with my ball when my ball actually hit the back of the head of a gentleman sitting on a park bench.

''Interviewer'': Who was doing these gentle movements.

''Chee Soo'': No he was sitting there, just sitting there very quietly, and I went over to retrieve my ball, and I came up to the front of him to apologise, and I saw he was Chinese, and we got talking and he was an importer/exporter, very much alone he had no family, and I was of course actually an orphan and having no family of my own, and the friendship gradually grew and grew, and till eventually in actual fact after many meetings he invited me to his club in Holborn, Red Lion Square, which he had a little club meeting three or four times a week, and from then on I practised under him almost continuously.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a British [[Movietone News]] documentary filmed on 21 May 1970 at Guildford in Surrey - UK, Chee Soo had over 2000 students studying [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] in Britain as part of the British Wu Shu Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 |title=Chinese Martial Arts |publisher=www.movietone.com |id=Story number: 95962 |date=21 May 1970 |accessdate=23 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101121/http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 a book about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan written by Chee Soo was published entitled "The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan" which describes the history and philosophy of the style in detail including descriptions of each aspect of the Art with photographs and descriptions of the Lee style T'ai Chi form. Chee Soo  wrote several books about the various aspects of the Lee style Taoist Arts published by [[HarperCollins]] which became best-sellers and were subsequently licensed by [[HarperCollins]] to other major international publishers and translated into various languages including French (distributed in Canada, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal), German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Polish, and Indonesian.

According to an interview with Marilyn Soo - Chee Soo's widow and the President of the International Taoist Society - Chee Soo moved to Coventry in the 1980s and trained a group of teachers to continue his work teaching the Lee style Taoist Arts.&lt;ref&gt;The Tao of My Thoughts, Seahorse Books p127-150,&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his death in August 1994 there are now several schools teaching the Lee style T'ai Chi based in the British Isles each of which emphasise different aspects of the Lee style Taoist Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leefamilystyle.com |title=Taoist Arts Website |website=Leefamilystyle.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leefamilyinternalarts.com |title=Lee Family Internal Arts Association |website=Leefamilyinternalarts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taoistarts.org.uk |title=Harmony Arts Association |website=taoistarts.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emblem of the Lee family is the Seahorse which represents Yin within Yang as it is the only creature where the male incubates and gives birth to the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;The Taoist Art of Feng Shou by Chee Soo, Aquarian press (Thorsons/[[HarperCollins]]) 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qigong==
Chee Soo's T'ai Chi classes invariably included [[Qigong]] or energy cultivation, and [[Tao Yin]] or breathing exercises.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan'' by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 28&lt;/ref&gt; The Lee style qigong exercises are called K'ai Men (开门) or 'Open Door'. Chee Soo wrote a book published by [[HarperCollins]] in 1983 under the title "Chinese Yoga" (later re-titled "Taoist Yoga"), which was devoted entirely to this aspect of the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;The Taoist Art of K'ai Men by Chee Soo Seahorse Books 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This book contains details of [[Taoist alchemy]] energy cultivation methods involving deep breathing into the [[dantian]] or "Golden Stove" or "Lower Cauldron" in order to stimulate the flow of [[Qi|Chi]] or internal energy, circulating it through various energy centres located along the meridians and vessels which are usually associated with [[acupuncture]] and known as the [[Microcosmic orbit]]. Various types of breathing exercises are described and categorized in terms of Yin and Yang breathing &lt;ref&gt;The Taoist Art of Kai Men by Chee Soo Chapter 5 - Breath is Life (Seahorse Books 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and recommendations are given in terms of regulating the body in accordance with the peak of energy flowing through each organ and its corresponding line of meridian depending on the time of day and season of the year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Taoist Art of Kai Men'' by Chee Soo Chapter 6 - Hints for Good Practice (Seahorse Books 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various recommendations for constant good health regarding the [[Chang Ming]] diet or [[Chinese food therapy]] based on the underlying principles of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Taoist Art of Kai Men'' by Chee Soo Chapter 4 - The Importance of Good Health (Seahorse Books 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
An important aspect of this style of qigong is that it not only deals with [[qi]] or internal energy but also teaches the practitioner to supplement their personal store of ch'i with energy drawn from the energy field of the Universe itself which Chee Soo called external energy or 'Ching Sheng Li' (jīng shēng lì 精生力).&lt;ref&gt;''The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan'' by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
The Lee style includes a number of ''[[List of t'ai chi ch'uan forms|forms]]'' comprising set sequences of movements.  These movements are based upon fourteen basic stances which are named after animal movements. These stances are also grouped into sequences with names like "Drive the Tiger Away" and "The Fair Lady Weaving". The movements can be performed at various speeds and may be timed with breathing. There are two forms known as the T'ai Chi Dance or which Chee Soo referred to as Tiàowǔ 跳舞 and he said was about 400 years old,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan'' by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 59&lt;/ref&gt; and the T'ai Chi form itself known as 'The Form'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan'' by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 67&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the Chinese ideogram [[wikt:舞|Wu 舞]] suggests that the Lee style T'ai Chi dance may have its origins in [[Wu (shaman)#Etymologies|Wu shamanism]]. The dance is 185 stances or steps long whereas the form is 140 stances split into 42 sequences.

==Sticky Hands==
The Lee style also includes various interactive exercises, the most important of which is called I Fu Shou or 'sticky hands'; similar to the [[pushing hands]] exercises that are seen in other T'ai Chi styles. Two people stand opposite each other making contact on the back of the wrist and move in circles gently testing each other's balance. The emphasis is on sensitivity and yielding to force.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I Fu Shou is an exercise in which two people participate. Each person tries to upset the balance of the other whilst maintaining their own stability. Contact is through the arms and hands throughout the exercise. No matter what stance is adopted, there may always be a weakness in the balance of the body whether one moves left or right, backward or forward, upward or downward, and it is by taking advantage of these six directional weaknesses that the participants in I Fu Shou try to ‘uproot’ each other - to cause the other to lose their footing. The most difficult way to do this is to lift the other off the ground, but even this may be achieved provided that one has practiced diligently and developed a faultless technique.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 43&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A full description is available to read online on Chee Soo's publisher's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orb.uk.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Sticky_Hands Sticky hands section on Chee Soo's publisher's Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-defence==
Whirling Arms and Whirling Hands are the two exercises in the Lee style of T'ai Chi Ch'uan which are used to teach basic principles of self-defence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Like I fou shou, Whirling Arms (Lun Pei) and Whirling Hands (Lun Shou) encourage the development of quick mental and physical reactions and a high level of sensitivity. Both are characterized, as their names suggest, by circular movements of the arms and hands.&lt;br /&gt;
The two arts include techniques to ward off, parry and deflect thrusts which may be made towards your body, and with constant practise you can develop the ability to recognize your partner's intentions before they are carried out. You will learn how to feel and exploit the weaknesses in their movements and postures, and in so doing you will come to understand your own weaknesses and develop greater concentration and awareness. You will build the foundations for a stronger balance, learn how to synchronize your body movements, and become much more sensitive and perceptive. In addition to all these, the control and utilization of your Ch'i energy plays a very big part in your practise.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Weapons ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chee-sword.jpg|thumb|Chee Soo performing Lee style Tai Chi Chien form]] --&gt;
'''[[Taijijian|T’ai Chi Sword]]''' &lt;br /&gt;
According to Master Chee Soo in his book about the Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
T'ai Chi sword makes full use of the combined techniques of Whirling Hands and Whirling Arms, but these are made more difficult by the weight and length of the sword. Greater mental concentration is required to retain complete control of the arms, wrists and hands, while maintaining perfect balance, especially in a few sequences where the body makes a complete whirl to demonstrate the 'order of the universe'....the 'Sword' form, which comprises 216 movements, has no straight lines&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Art of T'ai Ch'i Ch'uan page 55&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[Gun (staff)|T'ai Chi stick]]''' &lt;br /&gt;
Lee style T'ai Chi stick comprises a form of 270 movements.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan by Chee Soo, Seahorse Books 2003 page 63&lt;/ref&gt; The T'ai Chi stick is a staff approximately six feet long.

{{Hinduism}}

Lahore, a [[Pakistan]]i city which lies 22&amp;nbsp;km (14 miles) from the border with [[India]], has a rich cosmopolitan history. It was the principal city of the vast plain of [[Punjab|undivided Punjab]] for many centuries, and was also the capital of the [[Sikh empire]] of [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] until the mid-1850s. It is today the capital of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], the largest province of Pakistan.

Before the [[partition of India]] in 1947, [[Lahore]] was a cosmopolitan city with [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]] and [[Jain]] residents. In 1941, 64.5% of the population of Lahore was Muslim and about 36% was Hindu or Sikh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacw.net/partition/june2004IshtiaqAhmed.pdf |title=Forced Migration and Ethnic Cleansing in Lahore in 1947, Ishtiaq Ahmed, 2004 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the city contained numerous, almost countless temples, gurudwaras and other non-Muslim centers of worship. In the seven decades thereafter, nearly all non-Muslim places of worship have been demolished or usurped, and it is an astonishing, unbelievable fact that there are, as of 2017, no more than two functional Hindu temples in the city. This is in striking contrast to any small or large city in India, across the same border of partition; every single mosque in [[Amritsar]] or [[Delhi]] has been maintained and new ones have been built regularly for the benefit of the thriving and ever-increasing population of Indian Muslims.

''Evening'') is a national&lt;ref name=kershner&gt;{{cite news|last=Kershner|first=Isabel|title=Political and Market Forces Hobble Israel's Pack of Ink-Stained Watchdogs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/world/middleeast/concentration-and-politics-hobble-israels-newspapers.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 October 2012|authorlink=Isabel Kershner}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Israel]]. It is second in sales after ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' and third in readership after ''[[Israel HaYom]]'' and ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.co.il/media/news/article/433249 TGI: הסקר של נתניהו וישראל היום VS ידיעות, הארץ נפל]&lt;/ref&gt; 

From Sunday to Thursday the newspaper is printed under the ''Ma'ariv Hashavu'a'' ({{Hebrew|מעריב השבוע}}) brand, while the weekend edition that is out on Friday is printed under the ''Ma'ariv SofHashavu'a'' ({{Hebrew|מעריב סופהשבוע}}) brand.

Since May 2014, ''Maariv''{{'}}s co-editors in chief are Doron Cohen and Golan Bar-Yosef. Apart from the daily newspaper and its supplements, ''Maariv'' has a chain of local newspapers with a national scale distribution and magazines division.

==History==
''Maariv'' was founded in 1948 by former ''Yediot Aharonot'' journalists led by Dr. [[Ezriel Carlebach]], who became Maariv's first editor-in-chief. It was the most widely read newspaper in Israel in its first twenty years.&lt;ref name=kershner /&gt;

For many years, the Nimrodi family held a controlling stake in ''Maariv'', and [[Yaakov Nimrodi]] served as its chairman. In March 2010, Zaki Rakib bought a 50% share from [[Israel Land Development Company]] and [[Ofer Nimrodi]], bringing new energy and a much needed cash infusion to the newspaper, which had been losing millions of [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] a year since 2004. Rakib became the new chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ofer Nimrodi sells half of Ma'ariv|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000542962&amp;fid=942 |publisher= Globes|accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, it was announced in March 2011 that [[Nochi Dankner]] was to take control of ''Maariv'' through his Discount Investment. On 25 March, Discount transferred 20 million NIS to the struggling firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dankner to take control of Ma'ariv|url=http://english.themarker.com/dankner-gives-maariv-cash-will-appoint-observer-to-paper-s-board-1.352002|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=28 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401102247/http://english.themarker.com/dankner-gives-maariv-cash-will-appoint-observer-to-paper-s-board-1.352002|archivedate=1 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September, ''Maariv''{{'}}s chairman Dani Yakobi issued a statement saying that he would sell the newspaper's printing equipment to be able to pay September salaries. On 7 September, Globes announced that Dankner had reached an agreement with Shlomo Ben-Zvi, publisher of ''[[Makor Rishon]]'', to buy out the newspaper. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=he:נוחי דנקנר מוכר את "מעריב" לשלמה בן-צבי ב-85 מיליון שקל |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Dankner sells "Ma'ariv" to Shlomo Ben-Zvi for 85 million shekels |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000783341 |work=Globes |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the deal faltered, and Dankner turned to the court on 23 September for a stay of proceedings' process. The court appointed a trustee, Shlomo Nass, who ran the newspaper and searched for a buyer. During the following weeks the workers waged a campaign against IDB and Dankner, demanding he honor his obligations to them and pay their salaries, pensions and severance packages in full.
[[File:Maariv Workers Protest.jpg|thumbnail|''Maariv'' workers marching towards the IDB offices in Tel Aviv, September 2012]]

In early November the trustee sold the newspaper to Ben Zvi without the debts or the workers. Ben Zvi kept a fraction of the journalists and commenced a partial convergence process between ''Maariv'' and ''Makor Rishon'' under his company, Makor Rishon Hatzofe Hameuchad.

As of January 2013, the company Maariv Modiin Ltd. no longer operates ''Maariv'', and until its scheduled closure it will be operated by the court appointed trustee.

In March 2014, after a long struggle to stabilize the company, Ben Zvi turned to the municipal Jerusalem court for a stay of proceedings' process. ''Maariv'' closed most of its departments and published only a thin version, until the court appointed trustee could find a new owner. In May 2014 the brand was purchased by Eli Azur, who has holdings in a number of media outlets in Israel, including ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''Sport1'', ''[[Israel Post]]'' and 103FM radio station. A few days after the deal was approved, Azur relaunched the daily newspaper as ''Maariv-Hashavua'', and a weekend edition called ''Maariv-Sofhashavua'', which is an amalgamation of ''Maariv'' and the group's weekend magazine ''Sofhashavua''.

==Political orientation==
''Maariv'' is associated with Israel's political center and has been critical of [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s center-right government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffay|first=Nathan|title=Israeli Media Woes Could Boost Bibi|url=http://forward.com/articles/163161/israeli-media-woes-could-boost-bibi/|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moshe Arens]], in a ''Haaretz'' opinion piece penned in 2012, wrote that the owner of ''Maariv'' had resolved a few years earlier to steer the newspaper leftward, "forsaking the right-wing readership that was loyal to it for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arens|first=Moshe|script-title=he:עיתון זה עסק|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/1.1840197|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=12 October 2012|authorlink=Moshe Arens|language=Hebrew|trans-title=A newspaper is a business|quote=זה נכון לגבי 'ידיעות אחרונות' ו'הארץ', ובאחרונה גם לגבי 'מעריב', שבעליו החליט לפני שנים אחדות שהעיתון יפנה שמאלה, ובכך נטש את לקוחותיו הימנים, שהיו נאמנים לו שנים. (It's true for ''Yedioth Ahronoth'' and ''Haaretz'', and more recently for ''Maariv'', whose owners decided several years ago that the paper will turn leftward, forsaking the right-wing readership that was loyal to it for years.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circulation==
In a TGI survey for the first half of 2012, ''Maariv''{{'}}s market share was 11.9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000768703|title=TGI survey: Maariv's exposure grows for the first time in years|date= 25 July 2012|work=Globes |accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2013 ''Maariv'' owned a printing house, which was sold to the newspaper [[Yisrael Hayom]] to cover the newspaper's big debts. Since then ''Maariv'' has outsourced the printing operations to other printing houses.

'''Neeli Bar''' is a geographical region in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It is between the rivers [[Ravi River|Ravi]] and [[Satluj]]. "Bar" is the name given to areas in Punjab which were thick forests before the arrival of the modern canal irrigation system. Its soil is very fertile, as this plain is formed by the mud that has been collected by rivers flowing from the [[Himalayas]]. This region consists of the districts [[Sahiwal]], [[Okara District|Okara]] and [[Pakpattan]] . This region is famous for cow /buffalo breed, the [[Neeli Ravi Breed]].

==In History==
This area was the hub of famous [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|war of Independence of 1857]], which was led in this area by [[Shahid|Shaheed]] [[Rae Ahmed Nawaz Khan Kharal]].

==Language and culture==
The native language spoken in area is [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], which is a common language of the Bar area, with various dialects. [[Urdu]] is also spoken. The [[Bari Culture]] is the native and dominant culture of region.

==Cultural changes==
While after introducing the canal system during the [[British Raj]], millions of acres of land were granted to retired soldiers of the people mostly belonged to various districts of [[Eastern Punjab]]. This immigration had different impacts on the culture of this area.

'''Orphism''' (more rarely '''Orphicism'''; {{lang-grc|Ὀρφικά}}) is the name given to a set of religious beliefs and practices&lt;ref&gt;''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Culture'' by Marilyn B. Skinner, 2005, page 135, "[...] of life, there was no coherent religious movement properly termed 'Orphism' (Dodds 1957: 147–9; West 1983: 2–3). Even if there were, [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; originating in the ancient Greek and [[Hellenistic]] world,&lt;ref&gt;''Three Faces of God'' by David L. Miller, 2005, Back Matter: "[...] assumed that this was a Christian trinitarian influence on late Hellenistic Orphism, but it may be that the Old Neoplatonists were closer [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from the [[Thracians]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WGUz01yBumEC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=orphism+thracian&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=BC4GTcuGD4j0sgak2Nj7CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=orphism%20thracian&amp;f=false History of Humanity: From the seventh century B.C.E. to the seventh century C.E. Routledge reference, Siegfried J. de Laet, UNESCO, 1996], {{ISBN|92-3-102812-X}}, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; associated with literature ascribed to the mythical poet [[Orpheus]], who descended into the [[Greek underworld]] and returned. Orphics also revered [[Persephone]] (who annually descended into the Underworld for a season and then returned) and [[Dionysus]] or Bacchus (who also descended into the Underworld and returned). Orpheus was said to have invented the [[Dionysian Mysteries|Mysteries of Dionysus]].&lt;ref name="Apollodorus1.3.2"&gt;Apollodorus ([[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo Apollodorus]]), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.3.2 ''Library and Epitome'', 1.3.2]. "Orpheus also invented the [[Dionysian Mysteries|mysteries of Dionysus]], and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria."&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry containing distinctly Orphic beliefs has been traced back to the 6th century BC&lt;ref&gt;Backgrounds of Early Christianity by Everett Ferguson, 2003, page 162, "Orphism began in the sixth century BCE"&lt;/ref&gt; or at least 5th century BC, and graffiti of the 5th century BC apparently refers to "Orphics".&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''The Greeks &amp; Their Gods'' (Beacon, 1954), p. 322; [[Geoffrey Kirk|Kirk]], Raven, &amp; Schofield, ''The Presocratic Philosophers'' (Cambridge, 1983, 2nd edition), pp. 21, 30–31, 33; Parker, "Early Orphism", pp. 485, 497&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical sources, such as Plato, refer to "Orpheus-initiators" ({{lang|grc|Ὀρφεοτελεσταί}}), and associated rites, although how far "Orphic" literature in general related to these rites is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, "Early Orphism", pp. 484, 487.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinian mysteries]], initiation into '''Orphic mysteries'''&lt;!--boldfaced per WP:R#PLA--&gt; promised advantages in the afterlife.

== Mythology ==
{{See also|Orphic poems and rites}}
The Orphic theogonies are genealogical works similar to the [[Theogony]] of [[Hesiod]], but the details are different. The theogonies are symbolically similar to Near Eastern models. The main story has it that [[Dionysus]] (in his incarnation as [[Zagreus]]) is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Persephone]]; Zeus gives his inheritance of the throne to the child, as Zeus is to leave due to Hera's anger over a child being born by another mother; the Titans are enraged over the proclamation of attendance and, at Hera's instigation, decide to murder the child. Dionysus is then tricked with a mirror and children's toys by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s, who murder and consume him. Athena saves the heart and tells Zeus of the crime, who in turn hurls a thunderbolt on the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]. The resulting soot, from which sinful mankind is born, contains the bodies of the Titans and Dionysus. The soul of man (the Dionysus part) is therefore divine, but the body (the Titan part) holds the soul in bondage. Thus, it was declared that the soul returns to a host ten times, bound to the [[metempsychosis|wheel of rebirth]].

There are two Orphic stories of the rebirth of [[Dionysus]]: in one it is the heart of Dionysus that is implanted into the thigh of [[Zeus]]; in the other Zeus has impregnated the mortal woman [[Semele]], resulting in Dionysus's literal rebirth. Many of these details differ from accounts in the classical authors. [[Firmicus Maternus]], a Christian author, gives a different account with the book ''On the Error of Profane Religions''. He says that Jupiter ([[Zeus]]) originally was a (mortal) king of [[Crete]]—a concept of [[Euhemerus]]—and Dionysos was his son. Dionysos was murdered, and then cannibalized. Only his heart was salvaged by [[Athena]]. A statue of [[gypsum]] (the same substance the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] used to disguise themselves) was then made to look like Dionysos, and the heart placed within.&lt;ref&gt;[[Firmicus Maternus]], ''De errore profanarum religionum'' 6.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orphic theogonies include:
* The "Protogonos Theogony", lost, composed {{circa|500&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, which is known through the commentary in the [[Derveni papyrus]] and references in classical authors ([[Empedocles]] and [[Pindar]]).
* The "Eudemian Theogony", lost, composed in the 5th century BC. It is the product of a syncretic [[Dionysus|Bacchic]]-[[Kouretes|Kouretic]] cult.
* The "Rhapsodic Theogony", lost, composed in the [[Hellenistic]] age, incorporating earlier works. It is known through summaries in later [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonist]] authors.
* ''Orphic Hymns''. 87 [[Dactylic hexameter|hexametric]] poems of a shorter length composed in the late [[Hellenistic]] or early [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] age.

{{See also|Totenpass}}
Surviving written fragments show a number of beliefs about the afterlife similar to those in the "Orphic" mythology about [[Dionysus]]' death and resurrection. Bone tablets found in [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]] (5th century BC) carry short and enigmatic inscriptions like: "Life. Death. Life. Truth. Dio(nysus). Orphics." The function of these bone tablets is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=160|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=NCfoBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160|title=Doctrine and Doxography|isbn=9783110331370|author1=Sider|first1=David|last2=Obbink|first2=Dirk|date=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold-leaf tablets found in graves from [[Thurii]], [[Vibo Valentia|Hipponium]], [[Thessaly]] and [[Crete]] (4th century BC and after) give [[Totenpass|instructions to the dead]]. Although these thin tablets are often highly fragmentary, collectively they present a shared scenario of the passage into the afterlife. When the deceased arrives in the underworld, he is expected to confront obstacles. He must take care not to drink of [[Lethe]] ("Forgetfulness"), but of the pool of [[Mnemosyne]] ("Memory"). He is provided with formulaic expressions with which to present himself to the guardians of the afterlife.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a son of Earth and starry sky. I am parched with thirst and am dying; but quickly grant me cold water from the Lake of Memory to drink.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous tablets contain this essential formula with minor variations; for the Greek texts and translations, see Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets'' (Routlege, 2007), pp. 4–5 (Hipponion, 400 BC), 6–7 (Petelia, 4th century BC), pp. 16–17 (Entella, possibly 3rd century BC), pp. 20–25 (five tablets from Eleutherna, Crete, 2nd or 1st century BC), pp. 26–27 (Mylopotamos, 2nd century BC), pp. 28–29 (Rethymnon, 2nd or 1st century BC), pp. 34–35 (Pharsalos, Thessaly, 350–300 BC), and pp. 40–41 (Thessaly, mid-4th century BC) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_TmiaW0uvAgC&amp;dq=intitle%3ARitual+intitle%3ATexts+intitle%3Afor+intitle%3Athe+intitle%3AAfterlife&amp;q=%22I+am+parched%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22I%20am%20parched%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other gold leaves offer instructions for addressing the rulers of the underworld:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now you have died and now you have come into being, O thrice happy one, on this same day. Tell [[Persephone]] that the Bacchic One himself released you.&lt;ref&gt;Tablet from Pelinna, late 4th century BC, in Graf and Johnston, ''Ritual Texts for the Afterlife'', pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Pythagoreanism ==
Orphic views and practices have parallels to elements of [[Pythagoreanism]]. There is, however, too little evidence to determine the extent to which one movement may have influenced the other.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, "Early Orphism", p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifteenth century, the Neoplatonic Greek scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]] (who found the poem [[Argonautica Orphica]] ) considered a Pythagorean Orpheus.&lt;ref&gt;Attilio Russo (2004), ''Costantino Lascaris tra fama e oblio nel Cinquecento messinese'', in "Archivio Storico Messinese", pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;
The book ''The works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The works of Aristotle|year=1908|authors=Aristotle; Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877; Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russel|page=37|publisher=George Allen and Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "[[Enthusiasm#Historical_usage|enthusiasm]]," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

==Platonism==
[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) pointed out about Socrates
:He is not an orthodox Orphic; it is only the fundamental doctrines that he accepts, not the superstitions and ceremonies of purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|page=111|title=History of Western Philosophy|author=Bertrand Russel|year=1947|publisher=George Allen and Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peculiarities ==
The main elements of Orphism differed from popular [[ancient Greek religion]] in three ways: by characterizing human souls as divine and immortal but doomed to live (for a period) in a "grievous circle" of successive bodily lives through [[metempsychosis]], or the [[transmigration of souls]]; by prescribing an [[ascetic]] way of life which, together with secret initiation rites, was supposed to guarantee not only eventual release from the "grievous circle" but also communion with god(s); and by being founded upon sacred writings about the origin of gods and human beings.

== Evidence ==
Distinctively Orphic views and practices are attested as early as [[Herodotus]], [[Euripides]], and [[Plato]]. The recently published [[Derveni papyrus]] allows Orphic mythology to be dated to the end of the 5th century BC,&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web | title=The Derveni Papyrus: An Interdisciplinary Research Project | work=Harvard University, Center for Hellenic Studies | url=http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5418}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is probably even older.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Kirk|Kirk]], Raven, &amp; Schofield, ''The Presocratic Philosophers'' (Cambridge, 1983, 2nd edition), pp.{{nbsp}}30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Other inscriptions found in various parts of the Greek world testify to the early existence of a movement with the same core beliefs that were later associated with the name of Orphism.

'''Paporaji''', also called '''Pampapur''', a temple site in [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]], 5&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Tikamgarh]]. The site is a center for the [[Jainism|Jain religion]]. This is an atishaya kshetra ("miraculous holy place"), with 108 shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Papaura Darshan, Pt. Vimal Kumar Shastri, Shri Digambar jain Atishya Kshetra Papaura ji, Tikamgarh, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jain Tirth Yatra Darshak, Br. Gevilalji, Pub. Mulchand Kishandas Kapadia, II ed, 2015, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Poporaji is more than eight hundred years old. The site has two basements; one of them has three idols. The idol of Bhagwan Adinath is made of shining black stone and is two feet and eight inches in height. Idols inside are also in same color and stone. Two of the three Adinath idols were installed in V.S. 1202 (AD 1145) according to the inscriptions on them and are oldest at this [[Kshetra]].&lt;ref&gt;Papaura Darshan, Pt. Vimal Kumar Shastri, Shri Digambar jain Atishya Kshetra Papaura ji, Tikamgarh, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1783, the ruler of Orchha Vikramajit (1776–1817) shifted his capital from [[Orchha]] to Tehri and renamed it [[Tikamgarh]], which is in the vicinity of Papora.  An inscription of Vikrama 1840 (AD 1784) suggests that the site then had emerged as a tirtha. Motilal Varni (an associate of [[Ganesh Varni]]),  had established a religious school&lt;ref&gt;Meri Jivan Gatha, Ganeshprasad Varni, 1949, Shri Ganeshprasad Varni Jain Granthmala, Varanasi, p. 360, 546&lt;/ref&gt; which has produced several distinguished scholars like Darbari Lal Kothia.&lt;ref&gt;Papaura Darshan, Pt. Vimal Kumar Shastri, Shri Digambar jain Atishya Kshetra Papaura ji, Tikamgarh, 2014, p. IX&lt;/ref&gt; He had donated his own collection of handwritten manuscripts to the school.

==Architecture==

The oldest temples mainly from 18th and 19th century, are in the part termed Prachina Samucchaya, which includes two underground chambers ([[bhoyras]]) from the 12th century. In 1860 AD, a unique cluster of 24 temples was constructed. At the same time the chariot-shaped temple that serves as the grand entrance gate was constructed. A number of temples were constructed in 1965. Many temples have notable old and modern wall paintings. Temple construction has gradually continues, with a circular Bahubali temple being among the recent ones.

Prayers and worship take place in the temple basement and in Chandraprabhu Mandir, with an idol dated samvat 1524 that is regarded to be helpful in materializing the desires of pilgrims. The temple of Lord Parshvanath contains a unique image of Padmavati devi.  

In addition to the 108 temples, there exists a school and a library founded by Motilal Varni, an Udasina Ashrama and a hostel for the students.  Four dharmashalas, a rest house and a dining hall is also in the tirth kshetra compound.

Atishaya – (i) Here exists an ancient little pond. It is said that when pilgrims dropped a paper listing of required utensils in this pond, the utensils were received from the pond and used by the pilgrims. After use and cleaning, these utensils were returned to the pond and utensils thus disappeared back into the water. This miracle is not seen nowadays because one person did not return the utensils received from the pond.&lt;ref&gt;Bharat Ke Digambar Jain Tirth, Pt. 3, Balbhadra Jain, Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain Tirthkshetra Committee, Bharatiya Janapitha, 1976, p. 105-116&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a well known as ‘Patrakhan Well’. It is said that an old woman organized a party on the completion of a big temple (Temple No.-1) in samvat 1872.  Suddenly the water of the well was finished and lack of water for guests was felt. Then that old women entered the well and reached the bottom. Then as she started her heartfelt prayers, water began flowing in the well and as the old woman was lifted from the well, the level of water also increased simultaneously. Thus the honor of that old sacred woman was kept. This well still exists near the mess of school here.

==Administration==
The administration and day-to-day activities of Paporaji are controlled by the Shri Digamber Jain Atishay Kshetra Paporaji Prabhandhkarini Committee. The committee is renewed every five years by general election.

===Live performances===
In 1995, Scheer became a member of New York City's longest running Off-Broadway comedy show, ''[[Chicago City Limits]]''. As a member of their touring company, Scheer extensively traveled throughout the United States as well as overseas.

In 1998, he joined the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York City where he performed Sketch and Improvisation with [[Respecto Montalban]], winners of the 2003 ECNY Award for "Best Improv Show". The group included [[Rob Riggle]], [[Rob Huebel]], [[Jack McBrayer]] and [[Dannah Feinglass]]. They performed their brand of long-form improvisation to sold out crowds every Saturday night for over five years and collaborated with [[Adam McKay]] on a political sketch comedy show called ''George Bush is a Motherfucker''.

In 2002, Scheer created and starred in ''Automatic Vaudeville'' at the [[Ars Nova (theater)|Ars Nova]] theater, which ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called "one of the top five shows in the country".

Scheer moved to Los Angeles in 2006 and is a regular performer at Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles (UCBTLA). He performs an improvised show based on audience members' Facebook profiles called ''FACEBOOK''. The show was named the "Best Improv Show" by ''[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]'' magazine and has been profiled on ''[[Good Morning America]]''. Cast members include McBrayer, Riggle, and Huebel.

Scheer co-hosts ''Crash Test'' with ''Human Giant'' alumnus Huebel. ''Los Angeles'' called the show "Extremely funny ... Several thumbs up" and MetroMix said, "Sketch comedy doesn't get much funnier." He also occasionally performs in a two-person improv show, ''Scheer/McBrayer'' with McBrayer.

In 2010, Scheer organized a charity event with [[Ben Stiller]] called ''A Night of 140 Tweets'' in which he got 140 comedians and actors to appear on stage at the UCB Theater in Los Angeles, each of them reading a single tweet. The performers included Stiller, [[Will Ferrell]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Aziz Ansari]], the cast of ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', [[Dane Cook]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[John Cho]], [[Mindy Kaling]], and [[Sasha Grey]]. The event, released as a charity DVD and online download, raised over $500,000 dollars for [[Haiti]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2017, he appeared on ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and lost to his wife, June.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Personal life==
Scheer lives in [[Los Angeles]] and is married to actress-writer [[June Diane Raphael]]. They first met in January 2004, after the artistic director of Manhattan's [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] brought Scheer in to offer tips to Raphael and her comedy partner [[Casey Wilson]] on making improvements to their UCB two-woman sketch show, and started dating shortly afterwards. They moved from New York to Los Angeles in 2005. In October 2009, Scheer and Raphael married at the [[Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History]]. Scheer's best man was a [[Jack Nicholson]] impersonator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Westhoff |first=Ben |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2013/02/paul_scheer_june_diane_raphael_how_did_this_get_made_podcast_couples_2013.php |title=Paul Scheer and June Diane Raphael: Comedians Who Bond Over Terrible Hollywood Movies|publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons, Gus, born in April 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webber |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/june-diane-raphael-and-paul-scheer-welcome-first-child-baby-boy--2014145 |title=June Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer Welcome First Child, Baby Boy|publisher=US Weekly |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sam, born in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/212021_june_diane_raphael_on_dressing_her_baby_bump_for_grace_and_frankie_season_3_and_mastering_motherhood/ |title=June Diane Raphael on Dressing Her Baby Bump for Grace and Frankie Season 3, Mastering Motherhood |website=Etonline.com |date=2017-03-03 |accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''provincial superior''' is a major superior of a [[religious institute]] acting under the institute's [[Superior General]] and exercising a general supervision over all the members of that institute in a territorial division of the order called a ''[[Ecclesiastical province#Religious institutes|province]]''—similar to but not to be confused with an [[ecclesiastical province]] made up of [[particular church]]es or [[diocese]]s under the supervision of a [[Metropolitan Bishop]]. The division of a religious institute into provinces is generally along geographical lines, and may consist of one or more countries, or of only a part of a country. There may be, however, one or more houses of one province situated within the physical [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of another since the [[jurisdiction]] over the individual [[religious order|religious]] is personal rather than territorial. The title of the office is often abbreviated to '''Provincial'''.

Among the [[friar]]s and [[Third Order]] [[nun|Religious Sisters]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]], [[Carmelite]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] orders, the title {{nowrap|"'''[[Prior]] Provincial'''"}} or '''[[Prioress]] Provincial''' is generally used. The [[Friars Minor]], in contrast, use the title {{nowrap|"'''Minister Provincial'''",}} in line with their emphasis on living as brothers to one another.

==History==
The old [[Catholic religious order|orders]] had no provincial superiors; even when the [[monastery|monasteries]] were united to form congregations, the [[arch-abbot]] of each [[congregation (catholic)|congregation]] was in the position of a superior general whose powers were limited to particular cases, almost like the powers of a metropolitan archbishop over the [[diocese]]s of his [[suffragan]]s. Provincial superiors are found in the institutes of more recent formation, which began with the [[mendicant order]]s. The [[Holy See]] hesitated for a long time before allowing the division of congregations with simple [[vow]]s, especially congregations of women, into different provinces as a regular institution, and some congregations have no such division. 

The Provincial Superior is ordinarily [[election|elected]] by the [[chapter (religion)|Provincial Chapter]], subject to confirmation by the Superior General or the [[chapter (religion)|General Chapter]], depending on the regulations of the particular groups (in the [[Society of Jesus]] he is directly appointed by the Father General). The "Regulations" (Normae) of 18 June 1901, vest the appointment of the provincial in the general council. The provincial superior is never elected for life, but ordinarily for three or six years. In religious orders with [[clergy|clerics]], he is a regular [[prelate]], and has the rank of ordinary with quasi-episcopal jurisdiction. In [[religious institute]]s whether of men or of women, he or she appoints the regular [[confessor]]s, calls together the Provincial Chapter, presides over its deliberations, and takes care that the orders of the General Chapter and the Superior General are properly carried out. He or she is an ''ex officio'' member of the chapter. His or her principal duty is to make regular [[Canonical visitation|visitation]]s of the houses of the province in the name of the General and to report to the latter on all the religious and the property of the order; authority over the various houses and local superiors differs in different orders. He or she has, in many cases, the right of appointment to the less important offices. For institutes of men, at the end of his
term of office, the provincial is bound, according to the Constitution "Nuper" of [[Innocent XII]] (23 December 1697), to prove that he has complied with all the precepts of that decree concerning [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es; if he fails to do so, he loses his right to be elected and to vote in the general chapter.

==Politics==
A unique case was eastern Paraguay, where the Spanish colonial authorities allowed the Jesuit missionaries to establish both the Catholic faith and a unique, humane regime for the local [[Guarani people|Guarani]] Indian tribes, making their provincial superior the [[governor]] of the first autonomous Indian reserve, known as the (Jesuit) Misiones or [[Jesuit reduction|Reducciones]], till 1667, ten years after a Guarani rebellion against increased abuse by the regular colonial authorities: the territory lost its status and was divided up between Spain (then under the [[viceroyalty of la Plata]], previously part of Upper Peru) and Portugal (Brazil)

[[File:Rose_Cross.png|thumb|Rose Cross]]
The '''Rose Cross''' (also called '''''Rose Croix''''' and '''Rosy Cross''') is a symbol largely associated with the semi-mythical [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], [[Qabbala|Qabbalist]] and [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and founder of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;[[German language]] original: 'Die Bruderschaft des Ordens der Rosenkreuzer', [[Fama Fraternitatis]], 1614 [manuscripts in circulation since ca. 1610]; 'Bruderschaft Rosenkreuz', [[Confessio Fraternitatis]], 1615&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel]], ''[http://rosicrucianzine.tripod.com/christian_rosenkreuz.htm Christian Rosenkreuz and the Order of Rosicrucians]'', 1909 [1908&amp;ndash;1919]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rose Cross is said to be a [[cross]] with a red, golden or [[white]] [[rose]] at its centre&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Pike]] (1872). ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]], [http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/morals_and_dogma/knight_kadosh.htm XXX: Knight Kadosh]''. p.&amp;nbsp;822.&lt;br&gt;"Commentaries and studies have been multiplied upon the ''Divine Comedy'', the work of DANTE, and yet no one, so far as we know, has pointed out its especial character. (...) His Hell is but a negative Purgatory. His Heaven is composed of a series of Kabalistic circles, divided by a cross, like the Pantacle of Ezekiel. In the centre of this cross blooms a rose, and we see the symbol of the Adepts of the Rose-Croix for the first time publicly expounded and almost categorically explained."
:[[Dante Alighieri]], ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', [[wikisource:en:The Divine Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XXXI|Paradiso, Canto XXXI]], ''circa'' 1308&amp;ndash;1321:&lt;br&gt;"In fashion then as of a snow-white rose&lt;br&gt;Displayed itself to me the saintly host,&lt;br&gt;Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,"&lt;/ref&gt; and symbolizes the teachings of a [[western esotericism|western esoteric tradition]] formed within the [[Christian]] tenets, albeit ''a Christianity not yet conspicuously in evidence'':&lt;ref&gt;*Weber, Charles.

[[File:Fludd_summum_bonum.jpg|370px|thumb|'''The Rose and the Cross''': ''The Rose Gives The Bees Honey''.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, Joscelyn. ''Robert Fludd - Hermetic Philosopher of Two Worlds''. Shambala, Boulder, 1979: 10 [w/illustration.]: "This explicitly Rosicrucian symbol was first used at the head of [[Joachim Frizius]]’s ''Summum Bonum'', then adopted for [[Robert Fludd|(Robert) Fludd]]’s ''Clavis''. A rose with seven petals each alludes, in all probability, to secret doctrines of septenary emanation such as were later to be publicized in the theosophical works of [[H. P. Blavatsky]]. The Rose surmounts the thorny cross, the whole resembling the sign of Venus in which the solar circle triumphs over the cross of matter. We may interpret the motto as saying that "spiritual knowledge gives solace to souls," of whom bees are a venerable symbol. (...)"&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:The Rose Cross.jpg|thumb|'''The Winged Self''' symbol of the Rose Cross. Painting based on an original, unedited version of the ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]]]]

==Symbolism==
Several different meanings have been attributed to the Rose Cross, depending on the source. Some groups, such as the [[Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]], from a non-sectarian or non-religious view, suggest that the rosy cross predates [[Christianity]], where "the cross represents the human body and the rose represents the individual's unfolding consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[AMORC]]. ''[http://www.rosicrucian.org/about/mastery/mastery08history.html Our Traditional and Chronological History].''&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the rose represents silence while the cross signifies "salvation, to which the Society of the Rose-Cross devoted itself by teaching mankind the love of God and the beauty of brotherhood, with all that they implied." &lt;ref&gt;Baxter, James. ''[http://svmmvmbonvm.org/crc/bacon.htm Sir Francis Bacon and The Rosy Cross]''&lt;/ref&gt; Others saw the Rosy Cross as a symbol of the human process of reproduction elevated to the spiritual: "The fundamental symbols of the Rosicrucians were the rose and the cross; the rose female and the cross male, both universal phallic [...] As generation is the key to material existence, it is natural that the Rosicrucians should adopt as its characteristic symbols those exemplifying the reproductive processes. As regeneration is the key to spiritual existence, they therefore founded their symbolism upon the rose and the cross, which typify the redemption of man through the union of his lower temporal nature with his higher eternal nature." &lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1928, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is further a symbol of the [[Philosopher's Stone]], the ultimate product of the alchemist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]].  [http://www.rosicrucian.com/frc/frceng01.htm ''Freemasonry and Catholicism''] (Part VII). {{ISBN|0-911274-04-9}}. [https://archive.org/details/freemasonryandca017137mbp www2]. [https://archive.org/details/freemasonaryandc001552mbp www3].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rosicrucianism==

[[The Rosicrucian Fellowship]] and kindred groups of rosicrucianists, promulgating an [[Esoteric Christian]] viewpoint, hold that the Rosicrucian Brotherhood was founded in the early 14th century, or between the 13th and 14th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner, Rudolf]] (founder of [[Anthroposophy]]). [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLjh70BLqLUC ''Christian Rosenkreutz&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The Mystery, Teaching and Mission of a Master''].&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[Invisible College]] of mystic sages, by a highly evolved entity having the symbolic name of [[Christian Rosenkreuz]] in order "to prepare a new phase of the Christian religion to be used during the [[Age of Aquarius|coming age]] now at hand, for as the world and man evolve so also must religion change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen010.htm The Rosicrucian Interpretation of Christianity] by The [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paracelsus]], who was called the "Luther of Medicine",&lt;ref&gt;Debus, Allen G. (1993). ''[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/pdf/paracelsus.pdf ''Paracelsus and the Medical Revolution of the Renaissance&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; A 500th Anniversary Celebration''].  [[National Library of Medicine]].  p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; describes these mystics sages as "persons who have been exalted (verzueckt) to God, and who have remained in that state of exaltation, and have not died (...) nobody knew what became of them, and yet they remained on the earth".&lt;ref&gt;cited by [[Franz Hartmann]] in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBB4EmRiyqQC Life &amp; Prophecies of Paracelsus (1493&amp;ndash;1541)]'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Rosicrucian groups and some researchers &lt;ref&gt;[[Frances Yates|Yates, Frances A.]] (1972), ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment'', London&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that there is much evidence that the Rosicrucian Order not only has made herself known in the early 17th century through the [[Rosicrucian Manifestos]], but has been active since the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] period, not only as an [[Hermetism|hermetic]] Order, but also through forerunners&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[genius]]es of the [[western world]], sometimes also known to be [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in the literary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen041.htm "Shakespeare&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The Lay Bible"].  [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Manly Palmer Hall|Hall, Manly Palmer]] (1928). ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages: [http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/secret_teachings_of_all_ages/bacon_shakspere_and_the_roscrucians.htm Bacon, Shakespeare, and the Rosicrucians]'', pp. 165&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt; cultural, ethical, political, religious and scientific fields.

In the late 18th century, [[Karl von Eckartshausen]], a German [[Christian mystic]], describes the true Adepts of the Rose Cross in the following terms: "These sages, whose number is small, are children of light, and are opposed to darkness. They dislike mystification and secrecy; they are open and frank, have nothing to do with secret societies and with external ceremonies. They possess a spiritual temple, in which God is presiding".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl von Eckartshausen|von Eckartshausen, Karl]] (1790).  ''Aufschlüsse über Magie''. [Explanations Concerning Magic.] München [Munich], 1790; cited by [[Franz Hartmann]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=zBB4EmRiyqQC ''Life &amp; Prophecies of Paracelsus (1493&amp;ndash;1541)''], p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the early 20th century, [[Max Heindel]], a Rosicrucian [[Initiation#Religious and other spiritual initiations|Initiate]], emphasizes that the roots of the Brothers of the Rose Cross, immersed in the [[western mystery tradition]], are almost impossible to be traced as "theirs is a work which aims to encourage the [[spiritual evolution|evolution]] of humanity, they have labored far back into antiquity--under one guise or another".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/magen103.htm The Brothers of the Rose Cross]'' by The Rosicrucian Fellowship&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freemasonry and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn==
Connections between Free Masonry and Rose Cross exist from times preceding the formation of actual Grand Lodge (Landmarks of Andersen in 1717), as it is proved by the poem Threnodie of Henry Adamson (1638) "We are brethren of the Rosie Crossie, We have the Mason Word and second sight" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pamela2051.tripod.com/rosicrucianism.htm|title=Freemasons -  Rosicrucians|website=pamela2051.tripod.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas De Quincey]] in his work titled; ''Rosicrucians and Freemasonry'', suggest that Freemasonry was possibly an outgrowth of [[Rosicrucianism]].

More recently, the Rosy Cross is also a symbol found in some [[Rosicrucian#Modern groups|Masonic Christian]] bodies&lt;ref&gt;See image: [[:Image:Bijou fm 18eme.jpg|The "18° Knight of the Rose Croix" degree of the Scottish Rite]].&lt;/ref&gt; and employed by individuals and groups formed during the last centuries for the study of Rosicrucianism and allied subjects,&lt;ref&gt;See image:  [[:Image:Rosy Cross of the Golden Dawn.png|Rosy Cross lamen of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;/ref&gt; but derived from the adoption of a red rose.

===Freemasonry===
{{main article|Freemasonry}}
Within the Southern Jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Rite]] [[Masonic appendant bodies|concordant body]] of [[Freemasonry]], the Eighteenth Degree is specifically concerned with the rose cross and confers the title of "Knight Rose Croix". Of one version of the degree, [[Albert Pike]] wrote in 1871,

{{quote|The Degree of Rose Cross teaches three things;—the unity, immutability and goodness of God; the immortality of the Soul; and the ultimate defeat and extinction of evil and wrong and sorrow, by a Redeemer or Messiah, yet to come, if he has not already appeared.&lt;ref name="pike"&gt;Pike (1871), pp. 290&amp;ndash;291.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He goes on to give an explanation of what he believes to be the symbolism of the Rose Cross in that degree:

{{quote|But [the cross's] peculiar meaning in this Degree, is that given to it by the Ancient Egyptians. ''[[Thoth]]'' or ''[[Ptah|Phtha]]'' is represented on the oldest monuments carrying in his hand the ''Crux Ansata'', or ''Ankh'', (a Tau cross, with a ring or circle over it). [...] It was the hieroglyphic for ''life'', and with a triangle prefixed meant ''life-giving''. To us therefore it is the symbol of ''Life''—of that life that emanated from the Deity, and of that Eternal Life for which we all hope; through our faith in God's infinite goodness.

The ROSE, was anciently sacred to [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] and the Sun. It is a symbol of ''Dawn,'' of the resurrection of Light and the renewal of life, and therefore of the dawn of the first day, and more particularly of the resurrection: and the Cross and Rose together are therefore hieroglyphically to be read, ''the Dawn of Eternal Life'' which all Nations have hoped for by the advent of a Redeemer.&lt;ref name="pike" /&gt;}}

===Golden Dawn===

[[Image:Rose Cross Lamen.svg|thumb|The Rosy Cross Lamen as worn by Adepts in the Rosae Rubae et Aureae Crucis, the inner order of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].]]
The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn made use of the rosy cross as well, including 'The Ritual of the Rose Cross," designed for spiritual protection and as preparation for meditation. Based on the [[Rosicrucian]] symbolism of the Red Rose and the Cross of Gold, it is also a key symbol of the Golden Dawn's Second Order. According to Regardie, the Golden Dawn rosy cross contains attributes for the Elements, Planets, [[Zodiac]], [[Hebrew alphabet]], alchemical principles, the [[hexagram]] and [[pentagram]], the Sephiroth of the [[Tree of Life]], and the formula of INRI. On the back side of the rosy cross is inscribed the motto of the Zelator Adeptus Minor at the bottom, "The master Jesus Christ, God and Man" between four Maltese crosses, and in the center, written in Latin, "Blessed be the Lord our God who hath given us the Symbol Signum."

Regardie says of the rosy cross in ''The Golden Dawn'':

{{quote|The Rose-Cross is a Lamen or badge synthesizing a vast concourse of ideas, representing in a single emblem the Great Work itself—the harmonious reconciliation in one symbol of diverse and apparently contradictory concepts, the reconciliation of divinity and manhood. It is a highly important symbol to be worn over the heart during every important operation. It is a glyph, in one sense, of the higher Genius to whose knowledge and conversation the student is eternally aspiring. In the Rituals it is described as the Key of Sigils and Rituals.}}

====Symbolism of the Golden Dawn Rosy Cross====
This lamen is a complete synthesis of the masculine, positive, or rainbow scale of color attributions, which is also called the Scale of the King. The four arms of the cross belong to the four elements and are colored accordingly. The white portion belongs to the Holy Spirit and the planets.

The petals of the rose refer to the twenty-two paths on the Tree of Life and the Twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It is the cross in Tiphareth, the receptacle and the center of the forces of the [[Sephiroth (Kabbalah)|Sephiroth]] and the paths. The extreme center of the rose is white, the reflected spiritual brightness of [[Kether]], bearing upon it the Red Rose of Five Petals and the Golden Cross of Six Squares; four green rays issue from around the angles of the cross. Upon the white portion of the lamen, below the rose, is placed the hexagram, with the planets.

Around the pentagrams, which are placed one upon each elemental colored arm, are drawn the symbols of the spirit and the four elements. Upon each of the floriated  (the arms) of the cross are arranged the three alchemical principles of sulfur, salt, and mercury. The white rays issuing from behind the rose at the inner angles between the arms of the cross are the rays of the divine light issuing and coruscating from the reflected light of Kether in its center; and the letters and symbols on them refer to the analysis of the Key Word - [[I.N.R.I.]]

==Aleister Crowley and Ordo Templi Orientis==
[[File:OKRC.gif|thumb|right|[[Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Cross]] version of Rosy Cross -- the Hebrew [[Tetragrammaton]] divine name on the arms of the cross, and the [[Yahshuah|Pentagrammaton]] in the inner pentagram.]]
{{main article|Thelema|Thelemic mysticism}}
The symbol of the rosy cross played a substantial role within the system of [[Thelema]] as developed by [[Aleister Crowley]]. In a cosmological context, the rose is [[Nuit]], the infinitely expanded goddess of the night sky, and the cross is [[Hadit]], the ultimately contracted atomic point. For Crowley, it was the job of the adept to identify with the appropriate symbol so to experience the mystical conjunction of opposites, which leads to attainment. In this sense, the rose cross is a grand symbol of the [[Great Work]]:

{{quote|The [[Tau]] and the circle together make one form of the Rosy Cross, the uniting of subject and object which is the Great Work, and which is symbolized sometimes as this cross and circle, sometimes as the [[Lingam]]-[[Yoni]], sometimes as the [[Ankh]] or Crux Ansata, sometimes by the Spire and Nave of a church or temple, and sometimes as a marriage feast, mystic marriage, spiritual marriage, "chymical nuptials," and in a hundred other ways. Whatever the form chosen, it is the symbol of the Great Work.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Magick, Book 4''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Crowley also makes clear that this process is reflected in the sexual act as well:

{{quote|So we need not be surprised if the Unity of Subject and Object in Consciousness which is [[samādhi]], the uniting of the Bride and the Lamb which is Heaven, the uniting of the Magus and the god which is Evocation, the uniting of the Man and his [[Holy Guardian Angel]] which is the seal upon the work of the Adeptus Minor, is symbolized by the geometrical unity of the circle and the square, the arithmetical unity of the 5 and the 6, and (for more universality of comprehension) the uniting of the Lingam and the Yoni, the Cross and the Rose.  For as in earth-life the sexual ecstasy is the loss of self in the Beloved, the creation of a third consciousness transcending its parents, which is again reflected into matter as a child; so, immeasurably higher, upon the Plane of Spirit, Subject and Object join to disappear, leaving a transcendent unity.  This third is ecstasy and death; as below, so above.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''The Equinox'' I(4), "The Big Stick"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rosy cross is further symbolic of the grade of Adeptus Minor in the [[A∴A∴]], the [[Qabalah|Qabalistic]] sphere of [[Tiphareth]] on the [[Tree of Life]], the magical formula [[INRI]], and the concepts of Light (LVX) and Life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_lege.html De Lege Libellum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordo Templi Orientis===
{{main article|Ordo Templi Orientis}}
The rose cross also has a place in the system of Ordo Templi Orientis. It is associated with the Fifth Degree, the title of which is "Sovereign Prince Rose-Croix, and Knight of the Pelican and Eagle." Of it, Crowley writes in "An Intimation with Reference to the Constitution of the Order":

{{quote|The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that concerns the Social welfare of the Order. This grade is symbolically that of beauty and harmony; it is the natural stopping-place of the majority of men and women; for to proceed farther, as will appear, involves renunciation of the sternest kind. Here then is all joy, peace, well-being on all planes; the Sovereign Prince Rose Croix is attached equally to the higher and the lower, and forms a natural link between them. Yet let him look to it that his eyes are set on high!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Fellowship of the Rosy Cross==
The Fellowship of the Rosy Cross was a [[Christian]] [[mystical]] organization established by [[A. E. Waite|Arthur Edward Waite]] in England in 1915. It developed out of the breakdown of [[Isis-Urania Temple#Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn|Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn]]. It was based on Waite's complicated ideas and its rites reflected his interest in the history of the [[Rosicrucian Order]], [[Freemasonry]], and Christian mystical teachings through the ages. Most of its members were Freemasons or theosophists. One of its most noted members was the novelist [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]] who was a member from 1917 to at least 1928 and possibly later. There were plans to establish a branch in the United States but they appear never to have been fulfilled. The order ended with Waite's death in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Robert A. (1983). ''The Golden Dawn: Twilight of the Magicians''. [[Aquarian Press]]. pp. 76–77. {{ISBN|0-85030-278-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Edward Waite wrote also a book entitled ''[[The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross]]'', which presents the brotherhood as a Christian order dating from the Middle Ages.

==Modern forms==

{{main article|Rosicrucian Fellowship|Lectorium Rosicrucianum|Esoteric Christianity|Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis}}
One modern form of the ''Rosie Cross'' is found in a [[Rosicrucian#Modern groups|Rosicrucian Christian]] symbol that places a crown of [[red]] roses ennobling a [[white]] rose at the centre of the cross; radiating behind is the golden five-pointed star, an allusion also to 'the Five Points of Fellowship'.&lt;ref&gt;See image [[:Image:Rosicrucian fellowship-emblem2.jpg|The Rosicrucian Fellowship (emblem)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is the symbol of [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|the fraternity]] that has prepared a [[Mount Ecclesia|great lodge]] for the [[Brethren of Purity|Brethren]] to be gathered.&lt;ref&gt;See image:  [[:Image:MountEcclesia 002entr.jpg|The Ecclesia (portico)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version used by the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] suggests that "together, the rose and cross represent the experiences and challenges of a thoughtful life well-lived."&lt;ref&gt;AMORC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11663">'''Shinto weddings''', {{Nihongo3|"Marriage before the kami"|神前結婚|Shinzen kekkon|}}, began in Japan during the early 20th century, popularized after the marriage of Crown Prince Yoshihito and his bride, Princess Kujo Sadako. The ceremony relies heavily on Shinto themes of purification, and involves ceremonial sake drinking of three cups three times, the ''nan-nan-san-ku-do''. Shinto weddings are in decline. Fewer Japanese people get married, and those who do often choose Western-style chapel ceremonies.

==The ceremony==
[[File:Wedding of shinto Minatogawa-jinja 湊川神社 5050526a.jpg|thumb|A Shinto wedding ceremony.]]
A [[Shinto]] wedding ceremony is typically a small affair, limited to family, while a reception is open to a larger group of friends.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;

''Shinzen kekkon'', literally "wedding before the [[kami]]," is a Shinto purification ritual&lt;ref name=Picken&gt;{{cite book|last1=Picken|first1=Stuart D.B.|title=Essentials of Shinto : an analytical guide to principal teachings|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.]|isbn=9780313264313}}&lt;/ref&gt; that incorporates the exchange of [[sake]] between the couple before they are married.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; The ceremony typically takes 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="De Mente"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Mente|first1=Boyé Lafayette|title=Etiquette guide to Japan know the rules that make the difference|date=2009|publisher=Tuttle Pub.|location=North Clarendon, Vt.|isbn=9781462902460|edition=Updated and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food items, including salt, water, rice, sake, fruit, and vegetables, are left at a ceremonial wedding altar, which also holds the wedding rings.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hendry&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendry|first1=Joy|title=Marriage in Changing Japan: Community &amp; Society|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136898006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Kannushi|Shinto priest]] stands to the right of the altar, while a shrine maiden, ''[[Miko]]'', stands to the left. The couple will often stand in the center of the room, while closest family members stand behind tables containing sake and small fruits.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

The priest will purify the shrine and call the attention of benevolent spirits, or ''kami''.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; Then, the priest announces the beginning of the ''san-san-ku-do'' ceremony,&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; or "three-three-nine-times," reflecting three oaths taken three times,&lt;ref name=Lebra /&gt; represented by three cups, poured three times, and swallowed in three sips.&lt;ref name="De Mente" /&gt; This often includes three pourings from three cups of increasing sizes.&lt;ref name="De Mente" /&gt; The first, smallest cup, is first poured to the groom, who drinks from it before offering it to the bride.&lt;ref name=Lebra&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lebra|first1=Takie Sugiyama|title=Japanese women : constraint and fulfillment|date=1985|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu, HI|isbn=9780824810252|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second pouring goes first to the bride, then to the groom. The final pouring goes from the groom first, then the bride (essentially repeating the first pour).&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

The sake aspect of the ceremony is said to be the core of a Shinto wedding.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; The ritual may have originated at samurai weddings, though the symbolism of the action and numbers has no clear origin.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; Some see the ritual as representative of sharing joys and sorrows as a married couple,&lt;ref name=Tamura&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tamura|first1=Naomi|title=The Japanese Bride|date=2010|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=9781144993410|url=https://archive.org/details/japanesebrideil00tamugoog|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; others suggest that ''san-san'' is a homonym for "birth after birth," suggesting fertility symbolism.&lt;ref name=Bownas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bownas|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Brown|first2=Pauline|title=Japanese rainmaking and other folk practices.|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0415866699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others suggest it represents man, woman, and child, or heaven, earth and man.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

The couple approaches the altar, where the groom reads his vows while the bride listens.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;  Reflecting a history of [[Arranged marriages in Japan|arranged marriage]] in Japan, a ''nakodo'', or "matchmaker," will be thanked in the vows.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name="De Mente" /&gt; If no matchmaker exists, a friend or family member will be appointed to fill the role,&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; serving a role similar to the "best man" or "bridesmaid."&lt;ref name="De Mente" /&gt; Then, the families join in with the drinking of sake and a traditional cheer of "kampai."&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

In the final portion of the ceremony, the priest offers [[Cleyera japonica|Japanese evergreen]] to the altar, said to reflect gratitude to the spirits who blessed the union.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; The bride and groom follow with their own offering, then a representative from each family (often the fathers of the bride and groom).&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt; The rings are then presented.&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;

Within wedding prayers, the gods [[Izanagi and Izanami]] are often invoked.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; These married gods were part of the Japanese lore of the "first wedding," and are called upon to reflect a harmonious balance within the marriage.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; Other aspects of the Shinto wedding prayer include calling for the couple to work to maintain a respectful home, and for the couple to have children.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masahiko&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masahiko|first1=Asoya|title=Shinto no kekkonkan ("Wedding Parties in Shinto")|journal=Heiwa to Shuukyou|date=2006|volume=25|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costume ===
[[File:Bride at meiji shrine.jpg|thumb|A bride at a Shinto wedding shows her wig and tsuno-kakushi headdress.]]
Shinto brides and grooms typically wear a [[kimono]]. The bride wears a traditional kimono, oftentimes combined with a wig.&lt;ref name="Ambros" /&gt; There is also a paper hat, a [[Tsunokakushi|tsuno-kakushi]], or "horn hider," meant to conceal the "horns" of jealous demons.&lt;ref name="De Mente" /&gt; Typical colors for this kimono include red and white, colors of Shinto purity.&lt;ref name="Hendry" /&gt;

==Origins and early history==
The Shinto wedding is a modern invention. The first mention of a wedding in a Shinto manual was in 1872; weddings are not reported until the 1880s.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; These weddings were limited to the families of Shinto priests.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; Earlier Shinto weddings were a family gathering without religious significance, aside from the occasional appearance of female dancers, ''katsurame'', said to protect the bride from demons.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;

Scholars suggest that the adoption of religious wedding ceremonies was driven by the decline of state-sponsored Shinto shrines during the 1880s.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; A rash of new ceremonies emerged in this period, including visits for newborns and on certain birthdays.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardacre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardacre|first1=Helen|title=Shintō and the state, 1868–1988|date=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691020525|edition=1st paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The wedding of Prince Yoshihito===
[[Emperor Taishō|Prince Yoshihito]] married [[Empress Teimei|Kujo Sadako]] in a Shinto ceremony at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] in 1900, one of the first ceremonies of its kind.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; The [[Emperor Taishō|wedding]] reflected a change in [[Meiji period|Meiji-era]] thinking about marriage, which had recently legally allowed for marriage to be a balanced partnership between husband and wife.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hendry /&gt;
[[File:Torajirō Kasai, Wedding of Crown Prince Yoshihito and Princess Kujō Sadako, 1900.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the first contemporary Shinto wedding ceremony, the 1900 marriage of Crown Prince Yoshihito and Princess Kujo Sadako.]]
The next Shinto wedding ceremony was performed at Tokyo's Hibiya Daijingu shrine in 1901.&lt;ref name="Ambros"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Ambros|first1 = Barbara|title = Women in Japanese Religions|date = 2015|publisher = New York University Press|location = New York|isbn = 9781479884063|pages = 127–128|edition = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, shrines such as Ueno Shimotani and [[Tokyo]]'s Izumo Grand Shrine hosted wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; These ceremonies, concentrated in Tokyo, were still limited to elites.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishii"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ishii|first1=Kenji|title=Shinzenkekkonshiki ni miru "ie" no henbou to kojin no shoushutsu|journal=Meiji shoutoku kinen gakkai kiyou|date=2006|volume=43|pages=95–98|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, wedding ceremonies were performed in more cities, starting in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], and began to attract the donation of larger dowries.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ishii /&gt;

==Post-war weddings==
After being stripped of its status as a [[State Shinto|state religion]] in 1945, there came a rapid rise in the democratization of Shinto wedding ceremonies, and, in turn, the number of people choosing them.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; This also reflected a mass movement of families into cities and smaller homes, which made it more difficult to host domestic ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;

This period also saw the rise of the commercial wedding industry, which grew out of collaboratives that lent large venues for wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;

==Contemporary Japanese weddings==

Japanese Shinto weddings are overseen by priests, but often take place in hotels or in special venues designed to accommodate weddings.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt; As Japan's marriage rate declines, fewer Shinto weddings are being performed; the number has dropped from 90% of ceremonies to 50% since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein-Gidoni|first1=Ofra|title=Hybridity and distinctions in Japanese contemporary commercial weddings|journal=Social Science Japan Journal|date=1 April 2001|volume=4|issue=1|pages=21–38|doi=10.1093/ssjj/4.1.21|postscript=via Oxford University Press {{ODNBsub}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese weddings more often reflect a Christian wedding ceremony, regardless of the personal faith of the married couple.&lt;ref name=Ambros /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisch|first1=Michael|title=The Rise of the Wedding Chapel in Japan: Simulation and Performance|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=2001|volume=28|issue=1–2|pages=58, 64–65, 70–75|jstor=30233676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, two gay men were married in a Shinto ceremony at Kanamara Shrine in Kawasaki, but gay weddings have not been widespread in Shinto shrines, and the position of the Association of Shinto Shrines on gay weddings is vague.&lt;ref name=Fish&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fish|first1=Isaac Stone|title=Does Japan’s Conservative Shinto Religion Support Gay Marriage?|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/29/what-does-japan-shinto-think-of-gay-marriage/|website=Foreign Policy|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=29 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221051943/http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/29/what-does-japan-shinto-think-of-gay-marriage/|archivedate=28 December 2015|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ship of Fools''' is a UK-based Christian satirical website. It was first launched as a magazine in 1977. The magazine folded in 1983 and was resurrected as an internet magazine website and [[bulletin board system]] community [[internet forum|forum]] in 1998. Subtitled "the magazine of Christian unrest", Ship of Fools pokes fun and asks critical questions about the Christian faith. The site is part magazine and part web community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/503690.stm "The internet according to the Church of England"] [[BBC]] 3 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Ship of Fools was founded and is edited by Simon Jenkins (editor) and Stephen Goddard (co-editor). Jenkins is an author, designer and [[cartoonist]] from London (not to be confused with [[Simon Jenkins]], who has written a more traditional guide to ''England's Thousand Best Churches''), while Goddard is a journalist and [[public relations]] consultant; both have formal [[theological]] education. They also perform a show, ''Ship of Fools Live'', in churches, universities and elsewhere, with excerpts from the site's magazine content. The show toured in the United States in February 2004.

The website presents itself as [[ecumenical]]/pan-Christian, although the prevailing ethos is English-speaking [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity. The diversity of the users range from complete atheists to evangelical and liberal Christians.

Some notable features of Ship of Fools website are:
* "The Mystery Worshipper"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4477845.stm "Mystery reviewers visit churches"] [[BBC]] 24 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; – reports on churches made by users of the site: the intention is that churches find out how they appear to outsiders.
* "Gadgets for God" – kitsch Christian-based products on the internet.
* "Features &amp; Projects" – irregular columns and a range of projects including "R Father" (2001 competition for rewriting the Lord's prayer as a text message&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2814235.stm "Is txt mightier than the word?"], [[BBC]] 4 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;) and "St Pixels" (see below).
* Discussion boards – debate and discussion amongst registered members ("shipmates").

Activities sometimes leave the site to take place in the real world. There are frequent "Shipmeets" where shipmates get together at different locations around the world. Ship of Fools also ran a [[Ned Flanders]] Night at the Christian festival [[Greenbelt Festival|Greenbelt]].

"Church of Fools", an online 3D interactive church, ran as a multi-user 3D environment from May to September 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3623525.stm "Glimpse inside the virtual church"] [[BBC News]] 13 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3706897.stm "In cyberspace, can anyone hear you pray?"] [[BBC News]] 12 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and as a single-user environment since that date. The Church of Fools has now renamed itself [[St Pixels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=37654 "Glory be to God online"] [[Church Times]] 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts''''', a book published in 2001, discusses the archaeology of [[Land of Israel | Israel]] and its relationship to the origins and content of the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[Bible]]. The authors are [[Israel Finkelstein]], Professor of Archaeology at [[Tel Aviv University]], and [[Neil Asher Silberman]], an archaeologist,  historian and contributing editor to ''[[Archaeology Magazine]]''.

==Methodology==
The methodology applied by the authors is [[historical criticism]] with an emphasis on archaeology. Writing in the website of "The Bible and Interpretation", the authors describe their approach as one "in which the Bible is one of the most important artifacts and cultural achievements [but] not the unquestioned narrative framework into which every archaeological find must be fit." Their main contention is that:&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, I., Silberman, NA., The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, ''The Bible and Interpretation'', [http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Finkelstein_Silberman022001.shtml] Accessed 27 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|...an archaeological analysis of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchal]], [[Book of Joshua|conquest]], [[Book of Judges|judges]], and [[United Monarchy]] narratives [shows] that while there is no compelling archaeological evidence for any of them, there is clear archaeological evidence that places the stories themselves in a late 7th-century BCE context.}}

On the basis of this evidence they propose
{{cquote|... an archaeological reconstruction of the distinct histories of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], highlighting the largely neglected history of the [[Omride Dynasty]] and attempting to show how the influence of [[Assyria]]n imperialism in the region set in motion a chain of events that would eventually make the poorer, more remote, and more religiously conservative kingdom of Judah the belated center of the cultic and national hopes of all Israel.}}

As noted by a reviewer on [[Salon.com]]&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web |title=King David was a nebbish |first=Laura |last=Miller |date=7 February 2001 |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |url=http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2001/02/07/solomon/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010214416/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2001/02/07/solomon/index.html |archivedate=10 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the approach and conclusions of ''The Bible Unearthed'' are not particularly new. [[Ze'ev Herzog]], professor of archaeology at [[Tel Aviv University]], wrote a cover story for ''[[Haaretz]]'' in 1999 in which he reached similar conclusions following the same methodology; Herzog noted also that some of these findings have been accepted by the majority of biblical scholars and archaeologists for years and even decades, even though they have only recently begun to make a dent in the awareness of the general public.&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt;

==Content==
Early biblical archaeology was conducted with the presumption that the Bible must be true, finds only being considered as illustrations for the biblical narrative, and interpreting evidence to fit the Bible. Some archaeologists such as [[Eilat Mazar]] continue to take this "Bible and spade" approach, or, like the journal ''[[Bible and Spade]]'', attempt to treat archaeology as a tool for proving the Bible's accuracy,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} but since the 1970s most archaeologists, such as prominent Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]],&lt;ref name='Kitchen'&gt;On the Reliability of the Old Testament, by Kenneth Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=September 2014}} have begun instead to interpret the evidence only in the light of other archaeology, treating the Bible as an artifact to be examined, rather than as an unquestioned truth.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has led to results both in favor and against the historicity of the old Testament.&lt;ref name='Kitchen' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bible Unearthed, Section "History or Not History" of the Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestors and anachronisms===
[[File:Egypt 1450 BC.svg|thumb|right|Egypt in the 15th century BC, the time of [[the Exodus]] and the conquest of Canaan as described in the [[Book of Joshua]] according to the Biblical chronology. As the map indicates, Canaan was occupied by Egypt at that time, a fact which the Bible fails to register.]]
''The Bible Unearthed'' begins by considering what it terms the 'preamble' of the Bible—the [[Book of Genesis]]—and its relationship to archaeological evidence for the context in which its narratives are set. Archaeological discoveries about society and culture in the ancient Near East lead the authors to point out a number of anachronisms, suggestive that the narratives were actually set down in the 9th–7th centuries:&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]aeans are frequently mentioned, but no ancient text mentions them until around 1100 BCE, and they only begin to dominate Israel's northern borders after the 9th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The text describes the early origin of the neighbouring kingdom of [[Edom]], but [[Assyria]]n records show that Edom only came into existence after the conquest of the region by Assyria; before then it was without functioning kings, was not a distinct state, and archaeological evidence shows that the territory was only sparsely populated.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] story refers to [[camel]]-based traders carrying ''[[natural gum|gum]], [[Balsam of Mecca|balm]], and [[myrrh]]'', which is unlikely prior to the first millennium, such activity only becoming common in the 8th–7th centuries BCE, when Assyrian [[hegemony]] enabled this Arabian trade to flourish into a major industry.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] discovered what may be the earliest bones of domesticated camels found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Haaretz|date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapir-Hen|first=Lidar|author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley|journal=Tel Aviv|year=2013|volume=40|pages=277–285|url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2014|doi=10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[land of Goshen]] has a name that comes from an Arabic group who dominated the [[Nile Delta]] only in the 6th and 5th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] is portrayed as fearing invasion from the east, even though Egypt's territory stretched to the northern parts of [[Canaan]], with its main threat consequently being from the north, until the 7th century&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book comments that this corresponds with the [[documentary hypothesis]], in which [[textual criticism|textual scholarship]] argues for the majority of the [[pentateuch|first five biblical books]] being written between the 8th and 6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although archaeological results, and Assyrian records, suggest that the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] was the greater of the two, it is the [[Kingdom of Judah]] which is afforded greater prominence by ''Genesis'', whose narratives concentrate on Abraham, [[Jerusalem]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] (the patriarch), and [[Hebron]], more than on characters and places from the northern kingdom (Israel); ''the Bible Unearthed'' explains this pre-eminence of [[Yahwist]] text as an attempt to seize the opportunity, afforded by the destruction of Israel in 720 BCE, to portray the Israelites as a single people, with Judah having (always) had primacy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the Israelites===
The book remarks that, despite modern archaeological investigations and the meticulous ancient Egyptian records from the period of [[Ramesses II]], there is an obvious lack of any archaeological evidence for the migration of a band of semitic people across the [[Sinai Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; except for the [[Hyksos]]. Although the Hyksos are in some ways a good match, their main centre being at [[Avaris]] (later renamed 'Pi-Ramesses'), in the heart of the region corresponding to the 'land of Goshen', and [[Manetho]] later writing that the Hyksos eventually founded the [[Temple in Jerusalem]],&lt;ref name="p55"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; it throws up other problems, as the Hyksos became not slaves but rulers, and they were chased away rather than chased to bring them back.&lt;ref name="p55" /&gt; Nevertheless, the book posits that the exodus narrative perhaps evolved from vague memories of the Hyksos expulsion, spun to encourage resistance to the 7th century domination of Judah by Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein and Silberman argue that instead of the Israelites conquering Canaan after the Exodus (as suggested by the [[book of Joshua]]), most of them had in fact always been there; the Israelites were simply Canaanites who developed into a distinct culture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent surveys of long-term settlement patterns in the Israelite heartlands show no sign of violent invasion or even peaceful infiltration, but rather a sudden demographic transformation about 1200 BCE in which villages appear in the previously unpopulated highlands;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; these settlements have a similar appearance to modern Bedouin camps, suggesting that the inhabitants were once pastoral nomads, driven to take up farming by the [[Bronze Age collapse|Late Bronze Age collapse]] of the Canaanite city-culture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 111–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors take issue with the [[book of Joshua]]'s depiction of the Israelites conquering Canaan in only a few years—far less than the lifetime of one individual—in which cities such as [[Hazor (archaeological site)|Hazor]], [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], and [[Jericho]], are destroyed. Finkelstein and Silberman view this account as the result of the telescoping effect of the vagaries of folk memory about destruction caused by other events;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; modern archaeological examination of these cities shows that their destruction spanned a period of many centuries, with Hazor being destroyed 100 to 300 years after Jericho,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} while Ai (whose name actually means 'the ruin') was completely abandoned for roughly a millennium "before the collapse of Late Bronze Canaan. ... Like Jericho, there was no settlement at the time of its supposed conquest by the children of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===David and Solomon or the Omrides?===
Although the [[book of Samuel]], and initial parts of the [[books of Kings]], portray [[Saul]], [[David]] and [[Solomon]] ruling in succession over a powerful and cosmopolitan [[United Monarchy|united kingdom of Israel and Judah]], Finkelstein and Silberman regard modern archaeological evidence as showing that this may not be true. Archaeology instead shows that in the time of Solomon, the northern kingdom of Israel was quite small, too poor to be able to pay for a vast army, and with too little bureaucracy to be able to administer a kingdom, certainly not an empire;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; it only emerged later, around the beginning of the 9th century BCE, in the time of [[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little to suggest that [[Jerusalem]], called by the Bible David's capital, was "perhaps not more than a typical hill country village" during the time of David and of Solomon,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and Judah remained little more than a sparsely populated rural region, until the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Tel Dan Stele]] seems to confirm that a "House of David" existed, and "clearly validates the biblical description of a figure named David becoming the founder of the dynasty of Judahite kings in Jerusalem", it says nothing else about him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mesha Stele (511142469).jpg|left|thumb|150px|Mesha Stele]]
There are remains of once grand cities at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] and [[Gezer]], with archeological evidence showing that they suffered violent destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 135–139&lt;/ref&gt; This destruction once was attributed to the 10th century BCE campaigns by [[Shishak]], these cities therefore being ascribed to David and Solomon as proof of the Bible's account of them,&lt;ref name="p141-2"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; but the destruction layers have since been redated to the late 9th century BCE campaign of [[Hazael]], and the cities to the time of the [[Omrides|Omride]] kings.&lt;ref name="p141-2" /&gt;

The [[Tel Dan Stele]], the [[Mesha Stele]], the [[Black Obelisk|Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser]], and direct evidence from excavations, together paint a picture of the Omride kings ruling a rich, powerful, and cosmopolitan empire, stretching from [[Damascus]] to [[Moab]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt; and building some of the largest and most beautiful constructions of Iron Age Israel;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; by contrast, the Bible only remarks that the Omrides 'married foreign women' (presumably to make [[Marriage alliances|alliances]]) and upheld Canaanite religion, both of which it regards as wicked.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bible Unearthed'' concludes that the biblical writers deliberately invented the empire, power, and wealth, of Saul, David, and Solomon, by appropriating the deeds and achievements of the Omrides, so that they could then denigrate the Omrides and obscure their accomplishments, since these kings held a religious viewpoint that was anathema to the biblical editors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hezekiah and monolatry===

The Book of Kings, as it stands today, seems to suggest that the religion of Israel and Judah was primarily monotheistic, with one or two wayward kings (such as the Omrides) who tried to introduce Canaanite polytheism, the people occasionally joining in this 'apostasy' from monotheism, but a close reading and the archaeological record reveals that the opposite was true.&lt;ref name="p241-2"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iron Age]] remains show that in the time of the setting of the Book of Kings, sacrifices continued to be offered at hilltop shrines (which the Bible terms "high places"), incense and libations were being offered throughout the land, and clay figurines of deities were still being used in homes everywhere in the land as [[Household deity|household gods]].&lt;ref name="p241-2" /&gt; Inscriptions from "the early eighth century site of [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] in northeastern Sinai" as well as "in a late-monarchic inscription from the [[Shephelah]] of Judah", even seem to refer to "the goddess [[Asherah]] as being the consort of [[YHWH]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world changed for Judah when the kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians in 720 BCE. Judah was flooded with refugees; the population of Israel had been nine times larger than that of Judah, so many small Judean villages suddenly became cities,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeology evidencing that the population of Jerusalem itself expanded by about 15-fold, turning it from a small hilltown into a large city.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The social and religious struggles, which obviously would occur with such a large influx of population, are not mentioned by the Bible. Finkelstein and Silberman argue that the priests of Jerusalem began to promote Yahweh-based [[monolatry]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; aligning themselves with king [[Hezekiah]]'s anti-Assyrian views, perhaps because they believed that Assyrian domination of Israel had caused social injustice, or perhaps because they just wanted to gain economic and/or political control over the newly wealthy countryside;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Hezekiah advanced their agenda, banning the worship of deities other than Yahweh, destroying the hilltop shrines, actions which ''The Bible Unearthed'' views as preparation for rebelling against Assyria.

By 701 BCE, the Assyrians had captured most of Judah, and [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|then they besieged Jerusalem]]; the Bible's coverage of the events leading up to the siege is sparse, briefly listing only a few refortifications of Jerusalem, giving a passing mention to the [[Siloam tunnel]], and briefly admitting to the loss of most of Judah's cities, but archaeology gives much more detail. For example, the fortifications of [[Lachish]] were heavily strengthened by Hezekiah,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was besieged, fell, and was then burnt to the ground; according to an illustration on the walls of the Assyrian palace at [[Ninevah]], the Assyrians deported the city's population and religious objects before they burnt it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 260–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible claims that nearly 200,000 men in the army besieging Jerusalem were slaughtered one night by an [[angel]], causing the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] to relent and return to Assyria; it immediately goes on to state that Sennacherib was killed by his sons, while he was praying to his god, implying that this was shortly after the battle. However, as ''The Bible Unearthed'' points out, this contrasts with the Assyrian record on the [[Taylor Prism]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Hezekiah's mercenaries abandoned him, and he only then convinced the Assyrian army to leave by handing over not only vast amounts of money, jewels, and high quality ivory-inlaid furniture, but also his own daughters, harem, and musicians, and making Judah into a [[tributary state]] of the Assyrians.&lt;ref name="Taylor 3 37-49"&gt;(Taylor Prism", column 3, rows 37–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, although Sennacherib was clearly murdered (by person(s) uncertain), it was in 681 BCE; he had lived for over 19 years beyond the end of the siege, conducting several military campaigns elsewhere, and rebuilding and refurnishing his palace entirely.

Hezekiah predeceased Sennacherib, dying just a couple of years after the siege. His successor (and son), [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], reversed the religious changes, re-introducing religious pluralism; Finkelstein and Silberman suggest that this may have been an attempt to gain co-operation from village elders and clans, so that he would not need so much centralised administration, and could therefore allow the countryside to return to economic autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the archaeology there must have been a deliberate expansion of agriculture into the [[Negev|Judean desert]],&lt;ref name="p66"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rich finds from this period suggest that much profit was gained from Judah's now peaceful position in the middle of many of the caravan routes between Assyria's allies;&lt;ref name="p66" /&gt; the state certainly increased its administration of trade to levels that far exceed those before.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezekiah's actions had given away the gold and silver from the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:15-16|}}&lt;/ref&gt; impoverished his state, lost him his own daughters and concubines,&lt;ref name="Taylor 3 37-49" /&gt; and reduced his territory to a small region around Jerusalem, most of the people elsewhere in Judah being deported; Manasseh had brought peace and prosperity back to the country,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; but because the Book of Kings bases its decisions on theological prejudice, it condemns him as the most sinful monarch ever to rule Judah and hails instead Hezekiah as the great king.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bible Unearthed'' suggests that the priesthood and populace outside Jerusalem may well have held the opposite opinion—that Hezekiah's imposition of monolatry was blasphemous, and the disasters that befell the country during his reign had been punishment from the gods.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Josiah and the birth of the Bible===
As recorded in the Book of Kings, Manasseh's grandson, [[Josiah]], enacted a large religious reform soon after he became king; he ordered renovations to the Jerusalem Temple, during which the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] 'found' a ''scroll of the law'', which insisted on monotheism with sacrifice centralised at a single temple—that in Jerusalem. Finkelstein and Silberman note that most scholars regard the core of [[Deuteronomy]] as being the "scroll of the law" in question, and regard it as having been written not long before it was 'found', rather than being an ancient missing scroll as characterised in the Bible;&lt;ref name="p281"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy is strikingly similar to early 7th century Assyrian [[vassal]]-treaties, in which are set out the rights and obligations of a vassal state (in this case Judah) to their sovereign (in this case, Yahweh).&lt;ref name="p281" /&gt; Josiah imposed this ''scroll'' as the new religious orthodoxy, and, like Hezekiah before him, destroyed the old cult centres; Josiah even went so far as to slaughter the priests of these shrines, burn their bodies, and bury their bones in the tombs near them, upon the old altars.

The sudden collapse of the Assyrian Empire in the last decades of the 7th century BCE offered an opportunity for Josiah to expand Judah's territory into the former kingdom of Israel, abandoned by the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt; It was now that [[deuteronomist|the author of Deuteronomy]], working in Josiah's court, reworked older legends, texts, and histories into a single national history;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; with the message that it had been the non-Deuteronomic practices of the Israelites that had led to their downfalls, and implied that Joshua, as well as David in some respects, was a foreshadowing of what Josiah could achieve.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeology suggests that Josiah was initially successful, extending his territory northwards towards [[Bethel]], a cult-centre of the kingdom of Israel;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt; however he then rode out to meet the Egyptian Pharaoh—[[Necho II|Necho]]—at Meggido. Necho had been merely 'passing through', leading an army to join the Assyrian civil war on the side of the Assyrian (rather than [[Babylon]]ian) faction,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; but Josiah was killed; the circumstances of his death are uncertain, though the [[Book of Chronicles]] claims that despite Necho's lack of enmity for Josiah, Josiah insisted on attacking him. Finkelstein and Silberman suggest that Necho may have objected to Josiah's expansionist policies, which could have threatened the Egyptian dominance of the region to the west of Judah (the Philistine lands) or of the strategically important [[Jezreel Valley]] to its north, or could equally have objected to the effect of the new (deuteronomic) social policies on the caravan routes, which ran through southern Judah.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Josiah's death Egypt became [[suzerainty|suzerain]] over Judah. The new king, Egypt's vassal ruler, undid Josiah's changes, restoring the former shrines and returning the country once again to religious pluralism. But when the Babylonian faction eventually won the Assyrian civil war, they set out to forcibly retake the former Assyrian tributaries. Judah, as a loyal Egyptian vassal-state, resisted, with disastrous consequences: the Babylonians plundered Jerusalem in 597 BCE and imposed their own vassal king; these events are described in the Bible and confirmed, with variations, in the Babylonian Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, the king of Judah rebelled against his Babylonian masters, and the Babylonians returned to destroy all the cities in Judah, burning Jerusalem to the ground in 587 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyrus Cylinder.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The Cyrus cylinder, a contemporary [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] document proclaiming Cyrus as legitimate king of Babylon.]]
In 539 BCE, the [[Achaemenid]]s conquered Babylon, and, in accordance with their [[zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] perspective, allowed the people deported by the Babylonians to return; this is described by the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], which also indicates that the Persians repaired the temples in these conquered lands, returning any sacred artifacts to them. According to the archaeological record, no more than 25% of the population had actually been deported;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Book of Ezra]] and its parallel passages in the [[1 Esdras|First Book of Esdras]], when the deportees began to return, their leader—[[Zerubbabel]]—refused to allow the undeported Israelites to assist them in reconstructing the Jerusalem temple, apparently believing that only the former deportees had the right to determine the beliefs and practices which could count as the [[orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the undeported majority then tried to stop the reconstruction, [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]], the new Achaemenid king, eventually allowed it to continue.

The conflict between the returnees and those who had always been in Judah evidently required resolution; the two groups had to be reintegrated. Finkelstein and Silberman argue that the Deuteronomic law advanced by parts of the deported elite (the ancestors of the returnees),&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; and the laws and legends of the inveterate inhabitants, were melded together into a single [[Torah]] so that it could form a central authority able to unite the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], Darius' grandson, commissioned [[Ezra]] to take charge of Judah, following the divine laws which Ezra was holding in his hand;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|7:25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bible Unearthed'' comments that academics like [[Richard Elliott Friedman]] propose that Ezra himself was the [[Documentary hypothesis#R, Redactor|final redactor of the Torah]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Bible identifies him as ''the scribe of the law of the god of heaven''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|7:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Bible Unearthed'' was well received by some biblical scholars and archaeologists and critically by others. [[Baruch Halpern]], professor of Jewish Studies at [[Pennsylvania State University]] and leader of the archaeological digs at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] for many years, praised it as "the boldest and most exhilarating synthesis of Bible and archaeology in fifty years",&lt;ref&gt;http://icarusfilms.com/new2006/bib.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Kirsch]], writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', called it "a brutally honest assessment of what archeology can and cannot tell us about the historical accuracy of the Bible", which embraces the spirit of modern archaeology by approaching the Bible "as an artifact to be studied and evaluated rather than a work of divine inspiration that must be embraced as a matter of true belief".&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, Jonathan. [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/06/local/me-9147 "Digging for the Historical Truths of the Bible"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 6 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Trible]], professor of biblical studies at [[Wake Forest University]], concluded her review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as follows:
{{cquote|Finkelstein and Silberman have themselves written a provocative book that bears the marks of a detective story. In juxtaposing the biblical record and archaeological data, they work with tantalizing fragments of a distant past. Assembling clues to argue their thesis requires bold imagination and disciplined research. ''The Bible Unearthed'' exhibits both in abundance. Imagination invariably exceeds the evidence; research makes plausible the reconstruction. Fortunately, the book does not achieve its goal: "to attempt to separate history from legend." It is better than that, for it shows how intertwined they are. What ''actually happened'' and what a people thought happened belong to a single historical process. That understanding leads to a sobering thought. Stories of exodus from oppression and conquest of land, stories of exile and return and stories of triumphal vision are eerily contemporary. If history is written for the present, are we doomed to repeat the past?&lt;ref&gt;[[Phyllis Trible|Trible, Phyllis]]. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EEDE173FF937A35751C0A9679C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=The+Bible+Unearthed&amp;st=nyt "God's Ghostwriters"], ''The New York Times'', 4 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Kenneth Kitchen]] was critical, writing that "[A] careful critical perusal of this work—which certainly has much to say about both archaeology and the biblical writings—reveals that we are dealing very largely with a work of imaginative fiction, not a serious or reliable account of the subject", and "Their treatment of the exodus is among the most factually ignorant and misleading that this writer has ever read."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Kenneth Anderson. On the reliability of the Old Testament, p. 464-465. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hess]], also being critical, wrote that "The authors always present their interpretation of the archaeological data but do not mention or interact with contemporary alternative approaches. Thus the book is ideologically driven and controlled."&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Richard. Review of The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology’s New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of It’s Sacred Text, by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the book by fellow archeologist [[William G. Dever]] published in the ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' and subsequently in the ''[[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]]'', resulted in heated exchanges between Dever and Finkelstein. Dever's review noted that the book had many strengths, notably archaeology's potential for re-writing the history of "Ancient Israel", but complained that it misrepresented his own views and concluded by characterizing Finkelstein as "idiosyncratic and doctrinaire"; Finkelstein's reaction was to call Dever a "jealous academic parasite," and the debate quickly degenerated from that point.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks, Hershel. "In This Corner: William Dever and Israel Finkelstein Debate the Early History of Israel", ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Nov/Dec 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book became a bestseller within its field. In February 2009, [[Amazon.com]] ranked it as the 8th most popular in the fields of Old Testament Christian Theology, and the Archaeology of Christianity, as well as being the 22nd most popular book on the history of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0684869136 Ranking], Amazon.com, as of 28 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the popularity of the text led to a four-part documentary series upon it, which was subsequently broadcast on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://icarusfilms.com/new2006/bib2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{portal |Christianity}}
{{Reverend}}
'''The Reverend''' is an [[style (manner of address)|honorific style]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crockford.org.uk/help/how-to-address-the-clergy "How to address the clergy", ''Crockford's Clerical Directory'' website.]&lt;/ref&gt; most often placed before the names of Christian [[clergy]] and [[Minister of religion|minister]]s. There are sometimes differences in the way the style is used in different countries and church traditions. ''The Reverend'' is correctly called a ''style'' but is often and in some dictionaries called a title, form of address or title of respect.&lt;ref name = "ldoceonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/Reverend |title=Reverend | type = definition | publisher = Longman |work= LDoceOnline English Dictionary | edition = online |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is also sometimes used by leaders in non-Christian religions such as [[Judaism]] and [[Buddhism]].

The term is an [[anglicisation]] of the Latin ''reverendus'', the style originally used in Latin documents in medieval Europe. It is the gerundive or future passive participle of the verb ''revereri'' ("to respect; to revere"), meaning "[one who is] to be revered/must be respected". ''The Reverend'' is therefore equivalent to ''The Honourable'' or ''The Venerable''. It is paired with a modifier or noun for some offices in some religious traditions: [[Anglican]] archbishops and most [[Roman Catholic]] bishops are usually styled ''The Most Reverend'' (''reverendissimus''); other Anglican bishops and some Roman Catholic bishops are styled ''The Right Reverend''; some [[Reformed]] churches have used ''The Reverend Mister'' as a style for their clergy.

With Christian clergy, the forms ''His Reverence'' and ''Her Reverence'' is also sometimes used, along with its parallel in direct address, ''Your Reverence''.&lt;ref name="OED2017"/&gt; The abbreviation ''HR'' is sometimes used.&lt;ref name="OED2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/reverence|title=His/Your Reverence|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|language=English|accessdate=17 December 2017|quote=1.2His/Your Reverence A title or form of address to a member of the clergy, especially a priest in Ireland. ‘I regret, Your Reverence, that I cannot come to meet you.’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
In traditional and formal English usage, both British and American, it is still considered incorrect to drop the definite article, ''the'', before ''Reverend''. In practice, however, ''the'' is often not used in both written and spoken English. When the style is used within a sentence, ''the'' is correctly in lower-case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Chicago Manual of Style | edition = 16th | author = University of Chicago | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | place = Chicago | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual abbreviations for ''Reverend'' are ''Rev.'', ''Revd'' and ''Rev'd''.
 
''The Reverend'' is traditionally used as an adjectival form with first names (or initials) and surname (e.g. ''The Reverend John Smith'' or ''The Reverend J.F. Smith''); ''The Reverend Father Smith'' or ''The Reverend Mr Smith'' are correct though now old-fashioned uses. Use of the prefix with the surname alone (''The Reverend Smith'') is considered a [[solecism]] in traditional usage: it would be as irregular as calling the person in question "The Well-Respected Smith". In some countries, especially Britain, Anglican clergy are acceptably addressed by the title of their office, such as ''[[Vicar]]'', ''[[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]]'', or ''[[Archdeacon]]''.

In the 20th and 21st centuries it has been increasingly common for ''reverend'' to be used as a noun and for clergy to be referred to as being either ''a reverend'' or ''the reverend'' (''I talked to the reverend about the wedding service.'') or to be addressed as ''Reverend'' or, for example, ''Reverend Smith'' or ''the Reverend Smith''. This has traditionally been considered grammatically incorrect on the basis that it is equivalent to referring to a judge as being ''an honourable'' or an adult man as being ''a mister''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The New Fowler's Modern English Usage | editor-first = RW | editor-last = Burchfield | publisher = Clarendon | place = Oxford | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://library.thinkquest.org/10679/english/eng_abb.html |title=Information Internet: English Grammar, Abbreviations |publisher= Think quest |accessdate= 24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is formally an incorrect use of the term,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/reverend "Reverend, The"] in the glossary of the Episcopal Church's website.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reverend'' is sometimes used alone, without a name, as a reference to a member of the clergy and treated as a normal English noun requiring a definite or indefinite article (e.g. ''We spoke to the reverend yesterday.'') but such usage is incorrect. It is likewise incorrect to form the plural ''Reverends''.  Some dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861701835/Reverend.html | contribution = Reverend | title = Encarta | publisher = MSN | type = online dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, do place the noun rather than the adjective as the word's principal form, owing to an increasing use of the word as a noun among people with no religious background or knowledge of traditional styles of ecclesiastical address. When several clergy are referred to, they are often styled individually (e.g. ''The Reverend John Smith and the Reverend Henry Brown''); but in a list of clergy, ''The Revv'' is sometimes put before the list of names, especially in the Roman Catholic Church in the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive-uat.catholicherald.co.uk/article/6th-june-1947/7/ecclesiastical-and-other-information |title=Ecclesiastical and other information| publisher=The Catholic Herald |date=6 June 1947| access-date=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some churches, especially Protestant churches in the United States, ordained ministers are often addressed as ''[[Pastor]]'' (as in ''Pastor John'' or ''Pastor Smith''). ''Pastor'', however, is considered more correct in some churches when the minister in question is the head of a church or congregation.{{Citation needed|date = January 2009}}

Male Christian priests are usually addressed as ''Father'' or, for example, as ''Father John'' or ''Father Smith''. However, in official correspondence, such priests are not normally referred to as ''Father John'', ''Father Smith'', or ''Father John Smith'', but as ''The Reverend John Smith''. ''Father'' as an informal title is used for Roman Catholic, Orthodox and [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] priests and for many priests of the Anglican and Lutheran churches. In England, however, even Roman Catholic priests were often referred to as "Mr" until the 20th century except when members of a religious order. "Mr" is still not incorrect for priests of the Church of England.

Some female Anglican or Old Catholic priests use the style ''The Reverend Mother'' and are addressed as ''Mother''.

==Variations==
{{Main|Ecclesiastical titles and styles}}
''The Reverend'' may be modified to reflect ecclesiastical standing and rank. Modifications vary across religious traditions and countries. Some common examples are:

===Christianity===
====Roman Catholic====
* [[Nun|Religious sisters]] may be styled as ''Reverend Sister'' (in writing), though this is more common in Italy than in, for example, the United States. They may be addressed as ''Sister'' (in writing or in speaking).
* [[Deacons]] are addressed as
** ''The Reverend Deacon'' (in writing), or ''Father Deacon'' (in writing or speaking), or simply ''Deacon'' (in speaking), if ordained permanently to the diaconate.
*** ''The Reverend Mister'' (in writing) may be used for seminiarians who are ordained to the diaconate, before being ordained presbyters; ''Deacon'' (in speaking); nearly never ''Father Deacon'' in the Latin Rite in English.
* [[Priest]]s, whether [[Diocesan priest|diocesan]], or in an order of [[Canons Regular|canons regular]], in a [[monastic orders|monastic]] or a [[mendicant order]], or [[Clerics Regular|clerics regular]]  ''The Reverend'' or ''The Reverend Father'' (in writing).
** [[Protonotary apostolic|Protonotaries Apostolic]], [[Honorary Prelate|Prelates of Honor]] and [[chaplain of His Holiness|Chaplains of His Holiness]]: ''The Reverend [[Monsignor]]'' (in writing).
** Priests with various grades of jurisdiction above pastor (e.g., [[vicars general]], [[judicial vicar]]s, [[ecclesiastical judge]]s, [[episcopal vicar]]s, [[Provincial superior|provincials]] of religious orders of priests, rectors or presidents of colleges and universities, [[prior]]s of monasteries, [[Dean (religion)|dean]]s, [[vicars forane]], [[archpriests]]): ''The Very Reverend'' (in writing).
* [[Abbot]]s of monasteries: ''The Right Reverend'' (in writing).
* [[Abbess]]es of convents: ''The Reverend Mother Superior'', with their convent's name following (e.g., ''The Reverend Mother Superior of the Poor Clares of Boston'' in written form, while being referred to simply as ''Mother Superior'' in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.catholictradition.org/Saints/forms-address.htm | title =Catholic Forms of Address |publisher=Catholic tradition |accessdate= 24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bishop]]s and [[archbishop]]s: ''The Most Reverend''.
**In some countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], such as the United Kingdom (but not in Northern Ireland), only archbishops are styled ''The Most Reverend'' (and addressed as "Your Grace") and other bishops are styled ''The Right Reverend''.
*[[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] are styled as ''His Eminence'' 
*[[Patriarchs]] as ''His Beatitude''
*Patriarchs of Eastern-rite Catholic churches (those in full communion with Rome) who are made Cardinals are titled ''His Beatitude and Eminence''
*The Roman Catholic [[Pope]] and other Eastern-rite Catholic or Orthodox leaders with the title Pope as ''His Holiness''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/how-to-address-church-officials.html "How to Address Church Officials", ''Catholic Education Resource Center'' website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the clergy are usually addressed in speech as ''Reverend'' or ''The Reverend'' alone. Generally, ''Father'' is acceptable for all three orders of clergy, though in some countries this is customary for priests only. Deacons may be addressed as ''Deacon'', honorary prelates as ''Monsignor''; bishops and archbishops as ''Your Excellency'' (or ''Your Grace'' in Commonwealth countries), or, in informal settings, as ''Bishop'', ''Archbishop'', etc.

====Orthodox====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
*A deacon is often styled as ''The Reverend Deacon'' (or [[Hierodeacon]], [[Archdeacon]], [[Protodeacon]], according to ecclesiastical elevation), while in spoken use the title ''Father'' is used (sometimes ''Father Deacon'').
*A married priest is ''The Reverend Father''; a monastic priest is ''The Reverend [[Hieromonk]]''; a [[protopresbyter]] is ''The Very Reverend Father''; and an [[archimandrite]] is either ''The Very Reverend Father'' (Greek practice) or ''The Right Reverend Father'' (Russian practice). All may be simply addressed as ''Father''.
*[[Abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es are styled ''The Very Reverend Abbot/Abbess'' and are addressed as ''Father'' and ''Mother'' respectively.
*A bishop is referred to as ''The Right Reverend Bishop'' and addressed as ''Your Grace'' (or ''Your Excellency'').
*An archbishop or metropolitan, whether or not he is the head of an [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] or [[autonomous]] church, is styled ''The Most Reverend Archbishop/Metropolitan'' and addressed as ''Your Eminence''.
*Heads of autocephalous and autonomous churches with the title Patriarch are styled differently, according to the customs of their respective churches, usually ''Beatitude'' but sometimes ''Holiness'' and exceptionally ''All-Holiness''.

====Anglican Communion====
*[[Deacons]] are styled as ''The Reverend'', ''The Reverend Deacon'', or ''The Reverend Mr/Mrs/Miss''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crockford.org.uk/faq/how-to-address-the-clergy "How to address the clergy", ''Crockford's Clerical Directory'' website.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Priest]]s are usually styled as ''The Reverend'', ''The Reverend Father/Mother'' (even if not a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]]) or ''The Reverend Mr/Mrs/Miss''.
*Heads of some women's [[religious orders]] are styled as ''The Reverend Mother'' (even if not ordained).
*[[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s are often styled as ''The Reverend Canon''.
*[[Dean (religion)|Dean]]s are usually styled as ''[[The Very Reverend]]''.
*[[Archdeacon]]s are usually styled as ''[[Venerable|The Venerable]]'' (''The Ven'').
*[[Prior]]s of monasteries may be styled as ''[[The Very Reverend]]''.
* [[Abbot]]s of monasteries may be styled as ''[[The Right Reverend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Contact us | url = http://www.altonabbey.org.uk/contact-us | publisher = Alton Abbey | place = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bishop]]s are styled as ''[[The Right Reverend]]'' or ''[[Lord#Ecclesiastical|His Lordship]]''.&lt;ref name="Nathan1927"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nathan|first=George Jean|title=The American Mercury, Volume 10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B74OAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 December 2017|year=1927|publisher=Knopf|language=English|page=186|quote=When traveling in England they are customarily addressed as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship" and thus put on the same footing as the Bishops of the Established Church of that country, who, when sojourning in America, are properly so addressed. Similarly, a visiting Anglican Archbishop is "Your Grace." He is introduced as "The Most Reverend, His Grace, the Archbishop of York."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Archbishop]]s and [[primate (bishop)|primate]]s and (for historical reasons) the [[Bishop of Meath and Kildare]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/information/dioceses/68|title=The Church of Ireland |website=www.ireland.anglican.org |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are styled as ''[[The Most Reverend]]''.
*Some archbishops, such as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], are also styled ''[[Grace (style)|His Grace]]''.

====Baptists====

Among [[Southern Baptist]]s in the United States, [[pastor|pastors]] are often referred to in written communication and formal address as ''Reverend''. However,  Southern Baptist pastors are often  orally addressed as either ''Brother'' (''Brother Smith'', as New Testament writers describe Christians as being brothers and sisters in Christ) or ''Pastor'' (as in ''Pastor Smith'' or simply ''Pastor'' without the pastor's last name).

Many African American Baptists use "Reverend" informally and formally, however correctly ''The Reverend John Smith'' or ''The Reverend Mary Smith''. 

Members of the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] usually refer to their pastors as ''The Reverend''.

====Lutheran====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
*Deacons: Commonly styled ''Deacon'' and their last name (such as Deacon Smith)
*Pastors: ''The Reverend'' is usually written, but the person is commonly orally addressed as ''Pastor Smith'' or "Pastor John"; the latter frequently used by members of their congregation.
*Priests:{{Efn | In most European Lutheran churches (as well as some in America) most clergy are called ''priests'' rather than the American tradition of ''pastors''.}}  The formal style for a priest is either ''The Reverend'' or ''The Very Reverend'', but for male priests the title ''Father'' and the person's last name are frequently used (such as Father Smith).
*Bishops are styled as ''The Right Reverend''.
** In America the style ''The Reverend Bishop'' or simply ''Bishop'' and the person's last name are more frequently used.
*Archbishops are styled as ''The Most Reverend''.

====Methodist====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
In some Methodist churches, especially in the United States, ordained and licensed ministers are usually addressed as ''Reverend'', unless they hold a doctorate in which case they are often addressed in formal situations as ''The Reverend Doctor''. In informal situations ''Reverend'' is used. ''The Reverend'', however, is used in more formal or in written communication, along with ''His/Her Reverence'' or ''Your Reverence''. ''Brother'' or ''Sister'' is used in some places, although these are formally used to address members of Methodist religious orders, such as the [[Saint Brigid of Kildare Monastery]]. Use of these forms of address differs depending on the location of the church or [[Annual Conference]].

In British Methodism, ordained ministers can be either presbyters (ministers of word and sacrament) or deacons (ministers of witness and service).  Presbyters are addressed as ''The Revd'' (with given name and surname) or as Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms with surname alone.

The [[United Methodist Church]] in the United States often addresses its ministers as ''Reverend'' (e.g., ''Reverend Smith''). ''The Reverend'', however, is still used in more formal or official written communication.

====Presbyterian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Church ministers are styled ''The Reverend''. The [[Moderator of the General Assembly|moderators of the General Assemblies]] of the [[Church of Scotland]], the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]], the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]] and the [[United Church of Canada]], when ordained clergy, are styled ''The Right Reverend'' during their year of service and ''The Very Reverend'' afterwards. Moderators of the General Assembly of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] are styled simply ''The Reverend''. By tradition in the Church of Scotland, the ministers of [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh, (also known as the High Kirk of Edinburgh) and [[Paisley Abbey]] are styled ''The Very Reverend''.  In Presbyterian courts where elders hold equal status with ministers it is correct to refer to ministers by their title (Mr, Mrs, Dr, Prof etc.).  Traditionally in Scotland ministers are referred to in their communities in this way and this is an entirely correct form of address.

====Restoration Movement====
Like some other groups that assert the lack of clerical titles within the church as narrated in the New Testament, congregations in the [[Restoration Movement]] (i.e., influenced by [[Barton Warren Stone]] and [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]]), often disdain use of ''The Reverend'' and instead use the more generalized designation ''Brother''. The practice is universal within the [[Churches of Christ]] and prevalent in the [[Christian Churches and Churches of Christ]] but has become uncommon in the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]], which use ''The Reverend'' for ordained ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Frank S | last1 = Mead | first2 = Samuel S | last2 = Hill | first3 = Craig D | last3 = Atwood | title = Handbook of denominations in the United States | edition = 12th | place = Nashville | publisher = Abingdon | year = 2005 | ISBN = 0-687-05784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-first = Douglas A | editor1-last = Foster | editor1-link = Douglas A.

=====Latter Day Saints Movement=====
======Community of Christ======
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Internally, members of the priesthood do not use ''The Reverend'' as a style, but are generally known as "brother" or "sister" or by their specific priesthood office ("deacon", "teacher" or "priest" are often appended after the person's name, instead of, for example, "Deacon John Adams" or "Deacon Adams", and generally only in written form; in contrast, elders, bishops, evangelists, apostles, etc. are often, for example, known as "Bishop John Smith" or "Bishop Smith").  Any member of the priesthood who presides over a congregation can, and often is, known as "pastor" or (if an elder), "presiding elder".   Such use might only be in reference to occupying that position ("she is the pastor") as opposed to being used as a style ("Pastor Jane").  Priesthood members presiding over multiple congregations or various church councils are often termed "president".  Externally, in ecumenical settings, ''The Reverend'' is sometimes used.

====Nondenominational====
In some countries, including the United States, the title ''[[Pastor]]'' (such as ''Pastor Smith'' in more formal address or ''Pastor John'' in less formal) is often used in many nondenominational Christian traditions rather than ''The Reverend'' or ''Reverend''.

===Buddhist===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Virtually all Japanese Buddhist traditions, especially [[Jodo Shinshu]], which have carried over to the West style priests as ''the Reverend'' rather than ''the [[Venerable]]'', the religious style often used by Chinese and Tibetan Buddhists. This was a practice borrowed from Christianity and has been in use since the early 20th century.

===Judaism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Most Jewish ministers of religion have the title [[Rabbi]], which denotes that they have received rabbinical ordination ([[semicha]]). They are addressed as ''Rabbi'' or ''Rabbi Surname''. It is, however, not essential to be a rabbi to practice as a Jewish minister of religion.  In particular, few cantors ([[Hazzan|chazzanim]]) are rabbis but many have authority to perform functions such as witnessing marriages. In this case they often use the style ''The Reverend''; more usually, however, a cantor is called ''Cantor'' or ''Cantor Surname''.

Some small communities without a rabbi will be led by a knowledgeable person who is styled as "Reverend".  This is most often formally bestowed on the individual and is a requirement in some countries, which require a formally recognised religious leader to perform formal communal functions such as weddings and funerals.

[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|thumb|upright|Map of the Twelve Tribes of Israel]]

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the '''Twelve Tribes of Israel''' or '''Tribes of Israel''' ({{lang-he|שבטי ישראל}}) descended from the [[12 (number)#In religion and mythology|12 sons]] of the patriarch [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel) by two wives, [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]], and two [[Concubinage|concubines]], [[Zilpah]] and [[Bilhah]].

==Biblical tribes==
{{Tribes of Israel}}

{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|33:6–25|NKJV}} lists the twelve tribes:
* [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]]
* [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]]
* [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]]
* [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]]
* [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]]
* [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]]
* [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]]
* [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]]
* [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]]
* [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]]
* [[Tribe of Joseph|Joseph]] (including [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]])
* [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]]

Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh]] (the two sons of [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and his Egyptian wife [[Asenath]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|41:50|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the tribe of Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|48:5|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biblical narrative, the period from the [[conquest of Canaan]] under the leadership of [[Joshua]] until the formation of the first [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], passed with the tribes forming a loose confederation, described in the [[Book of Judges]]. Modern scholarship has called into question the beginning, middle, and end of this picture&lt;ref name="McNutt1999"&gt;"In any case, it is now widely agreed that the so-called 'patriarchal/ancestral period' is a later 'literary' construct, not a period in the actual history of the ancient world. The same is the case for the ‘exodus’ and the 'wilderness period,' and more and more widely for the 'period of the Judges.'" {{cite book|author=Paula M. McNutt|title=Reconstructing the Society of Ancient Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hd28MdGNyTYC&amp;pg=PA42|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22265-9|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levenson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan T.

Living in [[Babylonian captivity|exile]] in the sixth century BCE, the prophet [[Ezekiel]] has a vision for the restoration of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a future utopia in which the twelve tribes of Israel are living in their land again.&lt;ref name="Chyutin2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Chyutin|title=Architecture and Utopia in the Temple Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqB4ZSmemnkC&amp;pg=PA170|date=1 January 2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-567-03054-2|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==

In the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]], the twelve tribes of Israel are referred to twice in the [[gospels]] and twice in the [[Book of Revelation]]. In Matthew, [[Parallel passage|paralleled]] by Luke, [[Jesus]] anticipates that in the [[Kingdom of God]], his followers will "sit on [twelve] thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|19:28|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|22:30|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the vision of the writer of the Book of Revelation, [[144000 (number)|144,000]] of all the tribes of the children of Israel were "sealed", 12,000 from each tribe&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|7:1-8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his vision of the [[New Jerusalem|New or Heavenly Jerusalem]], the tribes' names were written on the city gates:{{quote|The names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|21:12-13|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Vanant'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; is the [[Avestan language]] name of a minor [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] divinity. The name literally means "conqueror", but in Zoroastrian tradition Vanant is the hypostasis of the "star of the west", variously identified with [[Altair]], [[Fomalhaut]], [[Vega]], [[Sargas]] or [[Kappa Scorpii|Kappa Scorpii/Girtab]].

Vanant may have its origins in the [[Babylonia|Sumero-Akkadian]] Vanand, perhaps incorporated in the Zoroastrian pantheon as a consequence of the close relations between Iran and Babylon during the late [[Achaemenid]] era. 

Vanant has no calendrical dedication (see [[Zoroastrian calendar]]), but is invoked together with the other astral divinities on the second and third days of the month. From amongst the hymns invoking divinities, ''[[Yasht]]'' 21 is dedicated to Vanant. The divinity is also invoked in the hymn dedicated to [[Tishtrya]], another star ''[[yazata]]'' for whom Vanant is a constant companion.

In the Zoroastrian tradition, Vanant is considered to be a guardian of goodness. An invocation of the ''Vanant Yasht'' is believed to be a potent remedy for fighting evil.

They follow the [[Shugendō]] doctrine, an integration of mainly [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]] of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] sect, with [[Tendai]] Buddhist, [[Taoism]], and elements of [[Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofugu.com/japan/yamabushi-japanese-mountain-people/|title=Japanese Mountain Folk|last=Hashi|website=Tofugu|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2017}} For the most part solitary, they did form loose confederations, and associations with certain temples, and also participated in battles and skirmishes alongside ''[[samurai]]'' and ''[[sōhei]]'' warrior monks on certain occasions. Their origins can be traced back to the solitary [[Yama-bito]] and some '''''hijiri''''' (聖) of the eighth and ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|title=The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan|date=1999|publisher=Japan Library|location=Richmond, Virginia|isbn=1873410859|pages=165-167|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been cross-teaching with samurai weaponry and Yamabushi's spiritual approach to life and fighting.{{Or|date=May 2017}}

In modern use, the term ''ubasoku-yamabushi'' refers to laymen practitioners of shugendō.{{Citation needed lead|date=May 2017}} The religion places a heavy emphasis on asceticism and feats of endurance, and white and saffron-robed ''yamabushi'' toting a ''[[horagai]]'' conch-shell trumpet are still a common sight near the shugendō holy site of [[Dewa Sanzan]] and in the sacred mountains of Kumano and Omine.{{Citation needed lead|date=May 2017}}

==History==
''Yamabushi'' began as ''yamahoshi'', isolated clusters (or individuals) of mountain hermits, ascetics, and "holy men", who followed the path of ''shugendō'', a search for spiritual, mystical, or supernatural powers gained through asceticism. This path may or may not have had a founder, as the myths surrounding [[En no Gyōja]] are numerous and complex; he is quite similar to a Japanese [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] in this way. Men who followed this path came to be known by a variety of names, including ''kenja'', ''kenza'', and ''[[shugenja]]''. These mountain mystics came to be renowned for their magical abilities and [[occult]] knowledge, and were sought out as healers or mediums, although [[Shinto shrines]] had traditionally reserved this role exclusively for maidens known as [[Miko]].

Most of these ascetics, in addition to their devotion to ''shugendō'', studied the teachings of the [[Tendai]] sect of Buddhism, or the Shingon sect, established by [[Kūkai|Kōbō Daishi]] in the 8th century. [[Shingon|Shingon Buddhism]] was one of the primary sects of ''mikkyō'' (密教) or [[Esoteric Buddhism]], according to which enlightenment is found through isolation, and the study and contemplation of oneself, as well as nature, and esoteric images called [[mandala]]. Both the Shingon sect and the Tendai viewed mountains as the ideal place for this sort of isolation and contemplation of nature.

In their mountain retreats, these monks studied not only nature and religious/spiritual texts and images, but also a variety of martial arts. Whether they felt they had to defend themselves from bandits, other monks, or samurai armies is questionable, but the idea of studying martial arts as a means to improve oneself mentally and spiritually, not just physically, has always been central to Japanese culture, beyond the specific tenets of one religious sect or another. Additionally, the Yamabushi developed their own forms of cooking that utilized vegetation that was naturally found on the mountains where they trained.  This cuisine allowed them to spend weeks or even months in the mountains without having to venture down into the towns or cities below to restock on supplies. Thus, like the ''sōhei'', the ''yamabushi''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehiddenjapan.com/yamabushi|title=Yamabushi Mountain Monks Of Yamagata|website=Yamagata {{!}} Shonai {{!}} The Hidden Japan|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; became warriors as well as monks.

As their reputation for mystical insight and knowledge grew, and their organization grew tighter, many of the masters of the ascetic disciplines began to be appointed to high spiritual positions in the court hierarchy. Monks and temples began to gain political influence. By the [[Nanboku-chō]] Period, in the 13th and 14th centuries, the ''yamabushi'' had formed organized cohorts called ''konsha'', &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yamabushi.org.uk/yamabushi.html|title=Yamabushi Page|website=Yamabushi Judo Club|accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source appears to be a self-published site.|date=October 2017}} and these ''konsha'', along with ''sōhei'' and other monks began to take direction from the central temples of their sects. They assisted [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] in his attempts to overthrow the [[Kamakura shogunate]], and proved their warrior skills to be up to the challenge of fighting professional samurai armies.

Several centuries later, in the [[Sengoku Period]], ''yamabushi'' could be found among the advisers and armies of nearly every major contender for dominion over [[Japan]]. Some, led by [[Takeda Shingen]], aided [[Oda Nobunaga]] against [[Uesugi Kenshin]] in 1568, while others, including the abbot [[Sessai Choro]], advised [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Many fought alongside their fellow monks, the ''[[Ikkō-ikki]]'', against [[Oda Nobunaga|Nobunaga]], who eventually crushed them and put an end to the time of the warrior monks.

Yamabushi also served as ''sendatsu'', or spiritual mountain guides, since medieval times for pilgrims along the [[Kumano Kodo]] to the Kumano Sanzan, including retired emperors and aristocrats.
