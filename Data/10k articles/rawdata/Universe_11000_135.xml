The '''Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|254}}) was a bill introduced in the [[113th United States Congress]] which passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 9, 2013.  The purpose of the act was to authorize the [[United States Department of the Interior]] to facilitate the development of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] on the [[Central Utah Project#Diamond Fork System|Diamond Fork System]] of the [[Central Utah Project]].  The Central Utah Project is a United States federal water project responsible for power generation, water for irrigation and community use, flood control, and recreation.  The bill would alter some of the financial requirements of building a plant in order to facilitate private development.

The bill was signed into law on July 22, 2013, becoming Public Law 113-20.

==Background==
According to information provided by House Republicans, this bill was necessary to remove financial barriers that were preventing the development of hydropower in this geographic region.&lt;ref name="gop"/&gt;  Additional background information can be found in [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt25/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt25-pt1.pdf House Committee Report 113-25].

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=hr254&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.254 - 113th Congress|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/254|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act states that its goal is to facilitate [[Hydroelectricity|hydropower]] development on the Diamond Fork System in [[Utah]].  In order to do this, the act would change some laws regarding the budget of the program.  More specifically, one of the changes the bill makes is to say that a certain amount of reimbursable costs allocated to project power in the Power Appendix of the [http://www.cupcao.gov/docs/BU-DPR/Supplement-DPR.pdf October 2004 Supplement] to the [[1988 Bonneville Unit Definite Plan Report]] shall be considered final costs, as well as specified costs in excess of the total maximum repayment obligation, subject to the same terms and conditions.

There are several additional provisions in the bill.  In section 4, it states two things.  First, that the Act does not obligate the [[Western Area Power Administration]] to purchase or market any of the power produced by the Diamond Fork [[Power station|power plant]].  Secondly, the act states that none of the costs associated with development of [[Electrical substation|transmission facilities]] to [[Electric power transmission|transmit power]] from the Diamond Fork power plant shall be assigned to power for the purpose of the [[Colorado River Storage Project]] and its [[Utility ratemaking|ratemaking]].

In section 5 of the bill, it prohibits any hydroelectric power generation or transmission facility on the Diamond Fork System from being financed or [[Refinancing|refinanced]] with any obligation whose interest enjoys federal [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status or which enjoys certain federal [[tax credit]]s.

Section 6 orders the Department of the Interior to report to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] if hydropower production on the Diamond Fork System has not commenced 24 months after enactment of this Act, stating the reasons such production has not commenced, and presenting a detailed timeline for future hydropower production.

Section 8 of the act restricts where the funding of these activities can come from.  It prohibits the use of Western Area Power Administration borrowing authority under the [[Hoover Power Plant Act of 1984]] to fund any study or construction of transmission facilities developed as a result of the Act.

==Congressional Budget Office report==
{{cbo summary}}&lt;ref name=cbo&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO {{!}} H.R. 254|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44058|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported that it expected that enacting H.R. 254 would lead to the development of hydropower facilities at the Diamond Fork Project in Utah by a nonfederal entity within a few years, sooner than was expected under current law. Based on information CBO received from the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]], the CBO estimated that the federal government would receive payments from the hydropower developer of about $4 million over the 2014-2023 period. Enacting the bill would decrease direct spending (by increasing offsetting receipts); therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.

==Procedural history==

===House===
The Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act was introduced into the House on January 15, 2013 by [[Jason Chaffetz|Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT)]].&lt;ref name="hr254"/&gt;  It was referred to two House committees and one subcommittee - the [[United States House Committee on the Budget]], the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]], and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power]].  The bill was passed by the House on April 9, 2013 with a vote of 400-4 in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll090.xml Roll Call Vote 90].  One [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and three [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] voted against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 90|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll090.xml|publisher=United States Clerk of the House|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate===
The Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act was received in the Senate on April 10, 2013.&lt;ref name="hr254"/&gt;

==Debate==
The House Republicans, on their official website, made a statement of support for the passage of H.R. 254.&lt;ref name=gop&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 254 - Legislative Digest - GOP.gov|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr254|publisher=House Republicans|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They argued that the bill would remove financial hurdles that are currently preventing developers from starting hydropower projects in the area due to their high costs.  The bill would also generate some revenue for the government that it is not making currently.&lt;ref name="gop"/&gt;

An alternative plan to have the government develop a plant at taxpayer expense, and then attempt to pay itself back with revenue from selling the hydropower, was also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hesterman|first=Billy|title=House passes bill related to hydropower in Diamond Fork Canyon|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/house-passes-bill-related-to-hydropower-in-diamond-fork-canyon/article_db691bd5-1d88-5830-9c8d-70ffcaeb5bdf.html|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=Daily Herald|date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CRC Industries''' is a manufacturer and distributor of [[industrial chemistry|industrial chemicals]] for [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] and [[repair]] of marine, electrical, industrial, automotive and aviation equipment.&lt;ref name="berwind"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBerg&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of CRC Industries, Inc|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=863797|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1958 after a verbal agreement between Rocket Chemical, the predecessor of the [[WD-40 Company]], and Charles J. Webb II to distribute [[WD-40]] fell apart.   Webb then set up a competitor company in Philadelphia, Corrosion Reaction Consultants, Inc., and hired away Rocket president [[Norman Larsen]] to lead it.&lt;ref name=CRCstory&gt;{{cite web|title=The CRC Story|url=http://www.crcindustries.com/files/thecrcstory.pdf|publisher=CRC Industries|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504181854/http://www.crcindustries.com/files/thecrcstory.pdf|archivedate=May 4, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 it consisted of Larsen, two chemists and five staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial Research Laboratories of the United States|date=1960|publisher=National Academies|page=129|edition=10th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzgrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA129|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first product was CRC Corrosion Inhibitor, also called  '''5–56'''.&lt;ref name=CRCstory/&gt;

The company has been owned by [[Berwind Corporation]] since 1981.&lt;ref name=CRCstory/&gt;

CRC's manufacturing is headquartered in [[Warminster, Pennsylvania]] with the corporate office in [[Horsham, Pennsylvania]]. It markets products through subsidiaries in the United States, Australia, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2findlocal.com/b/9164860 Germany Office]&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium, United Kingdom, China and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="berwind"&gt;[http://www.berwind.com/CRC.htm CRC Industries] on Berwind Corporation website, retrieved 2011-04-04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBerg/&gt;

Their facilities in Warminster include a private railroad spur, served by the [[New Hope and Ivyland Railroad]]. Traffic on the spur constitutes a sizable portion of the railroad's freight traffic; CRC Industries is their largest freight customer.

It is a soft, silvery-gold [[alkali metal]] with a melting point of 28.5&amp;nbsp;°C (83.3&amp;nbsp;°F), which makes it one of only five elemental [[metal]]s that are liquid at or near [[room temperature]].{{refn|Along with [[rubidium]] (39&amp;nbsp;°C [102&amp;nbsp;°F]), [[francium]] (estimated at 27&amp;nbsp;°C [81&amp;nbsp;°F]), [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (−39&amp;nbsp;°C [−38&amp;nbsp;°F]), and [[gallium]] (30&amp;nbsp;°C [86&amp;nbsp;°F]); bromine is also liquid at room temperature (melting at −7.2&amp;nbsp;°C, 19&amp;nbsp;°F), but it is a [[halogen]], not a metal.

Caesium is mined mostly from [[pollucite]], while the [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]], especially [[caesium-137]], a [[fission product]], are extracted from waste produced by [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].

The German chemist [[Robert Bunsen]] and physicist  [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of [[Atomic emission spectroscopy#Flame emission spectroscopy|flame spectroscopy]]. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a "[[getter]]" in [[vacuum tube]]s and in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]]. In 1967, acting on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] proof that the speed of light is the most constant dimension in the universe, the [[International System of Units]] used two specific wave counts from an [[emission spectrum]] of caesium-133 to co-define the [[second]] and the [[metre]]. Since then, caesium has been widely used in highly accurate [[atomic clock]]s.

Since the 1990s, the largest [[#Applications|application of the element]] has been as [[caesium formate]] for [[drilling fluid]]s, but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a [[half-life]] of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly [[Toxicity|toxic]], but the pure metal's tendency to react explosively with water means that caesium is considered a hazardous material, and the radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment.

The golden colour of caesium comes from the decreasing frequency of light required to excite electrons of the alkali metals as the group is descended. For lithium through rubidium this frequency is in the ultraviolet, but for caesium it enters the blue–violet end of the spectrum; in other words, the [[plasma oscillation|plasmonic frequency]] of the alkali metals becomes lower from lithium to caesium. Thus caesium transmits and partially absorbs violet light preferentially while other colours (having lower frequency) are reflected; hence it appears yellowish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Addison |first=C.

===Chemical properties===
[[File:Cesium water.theora.ogv|left|thumb|Addition of a small amount of caesium to cold water is explosive.|alt=A person adds a small amount of metal to a petri dish with cold water which produces a small explosion.]]
Caesium metal is highly reactive and very [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]. It ignites spontaneously in air, and reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures, more so than the other alkali metals ([[Alkali metal|first group]] of the [[periodic table]]).&lt;!--YES INCLUDING FRANCIUM--&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;  It reacts with solid water at temperatures as low as {{convert|−116|°C}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Because of this high reactivity, caesium metal is classified as a [[hazardous material]]. It is stored and shipped in dry, saturated hydrocarbons such as [[mineral oil]]. It can be handled only under [[inert gas]], such as [[argon]]. However, a caesium-water explosion is often less powerful than a [[sodium]]-water explosion with a similar amount of sodium. This is because caesium explodes instantly upon contact with water, leaving little time for hydrogen to accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Theodore (2012) ''The Elements'', Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers, p. 131, {{ISBN|1-57912-895-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesium can be stored in vacuum-sealed [[borosilicate glass]] [[ampoule]]s. In quantities of more than about 100&amp;nbsp;grams (3.5&amp;nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]), caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed, stainless steel containers.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

The chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals, in particular [[rubidium]], the element above caesium in the periodic table.&lt;ref name="greenwood" /&gt; As expected for an alkali metal, the only common oxidation state is +1.{{refn|It differs from this value in caesides, which contain the Cs&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; anion and thus have caesium in the −1 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=caeside/&gt; Additionally, 2013 calculations by Mao-sheng Miao indicate that under conditions of extreme pressure (greater than 30&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]]), the inner 5p electrons could form chemical bonds, where caesium would behave as the seventh 5p element. This discovery indicates that higher caesium fluorides with caesium in oxidation states from +2 to +6 could exist under such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=A Basic Rule of Chemistry Can Be Broken, Calculations Show|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=chemical-bonds-inner-shell-electrons|work=Scientific American|accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=oxistates|group=note}} Some small differences arise from the fact that it has a higher [[atomic mass]] and is more [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] than other (nonradioactive) alkali metals.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 953–955|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first1 = Arnold F.|last1 = Holleman|last2 = Wiberg|first2 = Egon |last3 =Wiberg|first3 = Nils|chapter = Vergleichende Übersicht über die Gruppe der Alkalimetalle| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesium is the most electropositive chemical element.{{refn|[[Francium]]'s electropositivity has not been experimentally measured due to its high radioactivity.

Like all metal cations, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; forms complexes with [[Lewis base]]s in solution.

Caesium has 39 known [[isotope]]s, ranging in [[mass number]] (i.e. number of [[nucleon]]s in the nucleus) from 112 to 151.

The radioactive [[caesium-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] has a very long half-life of about 2.3&amp;nbsp;million years, longest of all radioactive isotopes of caesium.

The isotopes with mass numbers of 129, 131, 132 and 136, have half-lives between a day and two weeks, while most of the other isotopes have half-lives from a few seconds to fractions of a second. At least 21 metastable [[nuclear isomer]]s exist.

Nevertheless, it is more abundant than such elements as [[antimony]], [[cadmium]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]], and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury and [[silver]]; it is 3.3% as abundant as [[rubidium]], with which it is closely associated, chemically.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

Due to its large [[ionic radius]], caesium is one of the "[[incompatible element]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.org/adb/02/13/02/cesium-occurrence-uses.html|title=Cesium as a Raw Material: Occurrence and Uses|first=Simon|last=Rowland|publisher=Artemis Society International|date=1998-07-04|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|magma crystallization]], caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone [[pegmatite]] ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because caesium does not substitute for [[potassium]] as readily as rubidium, the alkali evaporite minerals [[sylvite]] (KCl) and [[carnallite]] ({{chem|KMgCl|3|·6H|2|O}}) may contain only 0.002% caesium. Consequently, Cs is found in few minerals. Percentage amounts of caesium may be found in [[beryl]] ({{chem|Be|3|Al|2|(SiO|3|)|6}}) and [[avogadrite]] ({{chem|(K,Cs)BF|4}}), up to 15&amp;nbsp;wt% Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the closely related mineral [[pezzottaite]] (Cs(Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li)Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;), up to 8.4&amp;nbsp;wt% Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the rare mineral [[londonite]] ({{chem|(Cs,K)Al|4|Be|4|(B,Be)|12|O|28}}), and less in the more widespread [[rhodizite]].&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; The only economically important ore for caesium is [[pollucite]] {{chem|Cs(AlSi|2|O|6|)}}, which is found in a few places around the world in zoned pegmatites, associated with the more commercially important [[lithium]] minerals, [[lepidolite]] and [[petalite]]. Within the pegmatites, the large grain size and the strong separation of the minerals results in high-grade ore for mining.&lt;ref name="Cerny"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Tanco Pegmatite at Bernic Lake, Manitoba: X.

==Production==
Mining and refining pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a smaller scale than for most other metals. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite primarily by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burt&gt;{{cite book|last = Burt|first = R. O.|date = 1993|chapter = Caesium and cesium compounds|title = Kirk-Othmer encyclopedia of chemical technology|edition = 4th|place = New York|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|volume = 5|pages = 749–764|isbn = 978-0-471-48494-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the acid digestion, the [[silicate]] pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] (HCl), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}), [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]] (HBr), or [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] (HF) acids. With hydrochloric acid, a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced, and the insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride ({{chem|Cs|4|SbCl|7}}), caesium iodine chloride ({{chem|Cs|2|ICl}}), or caesium hexachlorocerate ({{chem|Cs|2|(CeCl|6|)}}). After separation, the pure precipitated double salt is decomposed, and pure CsCl is precipitated by evaporating the water.

The sulfuric acid method yields the insoluble double salt directly as caesium [[alum]] ({{chem|CsAl(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O}}). The [[aluminium sulfate]] component is converted to insoluble [[aluminium oxide]] by roasting the alum with [[carbon]], and the resulting product is [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] with water to yield a {{chem|Cs|2|SO|4}} solution.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

Roasting pollucite with [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium chloride]] yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride. Leaching with water or dilute [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|4|OH}}) yields a dilute chloride (CsCl) solution. This solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate. Though not commercially feasible, the ore can be directly reduced with potassium, sodium, or calcium in vacuum can produce caesium metal directly.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

Most of the mined caesium (as salts) is directly converted into [[formate|caesium formate]] (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) for applications such as [[oil drilling]]. To supply the developing market, [[Cabot Corporation]] built a production plant in 1997 at the Tanco mine near Bernic Lake in Manitoba, with a capacity of {{convert|12000|oilbbl|m3}} per year of caesium formate solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Benton|first1 = William|last2 = Turner| first2 = Jim|date = 2000|title = Cesium formate fluid succeeds in North Sea HPHT field trials|journal = Drilling Contractor|issue = May/June|pages = 38–41|url = http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-mayjun00/m-cabot.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary smaller-scale commercial compounds of caesium are [[caesium chloride]] and [[Caesium nitrate|nitrate]].&lt;ref name="CEC" /&gt;

Alternatively, caesium metal may be obtained from the purified compounds derived from the ore. Caesium chloride and the other caesium halides can be reduced at {{convert|700|to|800|°C|°F}} with calcium or [[barium]], and caesium metal distilled from the result. In the same way, the aluminate, carbonate, or hydroxide may be reduced by [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

The metal can also be isolated by [[electrolysis]] of fused caesium [[cyanide]] (CsCN). Exceptionally pure and gas-free caesium can be produced by {{convert|390|°C}} thermal decomposition of caesium [[azide]] {{chem|CsN|3}}, which can be produced from aqueous caesium sulfate and barium azide.&lt;ref name="Burt" /&gt; In vacuum applications, caesium [[dichromate]] can be reacted with [[zirconium]] to produce pure caesium metal without other gaseous products.&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-11-011451-5|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Owuv-c9L_IMC&amp;pg=PA198|page = 198|others = Eagleson, Mary |editor=Eagleson, Mary |year = 1994|publisher = de Gruyter|location = Berlin|title = Concise encyclopedia chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in the [[mineral water]] from [[Bad Dürkheim|Dürkheim]], Germany. Because of the bright blue lines in the [[emission spectrum]], they derived the name from the [[Latin]] word ''caesius'', meaning sky-blue.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bunsen quotes [[Aulus Gellius]] [[Aulus Gellius|Noctes Atticae]] II, 26 by [[Nigidius Figulus]]: ''Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BuKi1861" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite journal |title = The discovery of the elements.

To obtain a pure sample of caesium, {{convert|44,000|litre}} of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield {{convert|240|kg}} of concentrated salt solution. The [[alkaline earth metal]]s were precipitated either as sulfates or [[oxalate]]s, leaving the alkali metal in the solution. After conversion to the [[nitrate]]s and extraction with [[ethanol]], a sodium-free mixture was obtained. From this mixture, the lithium was precipitated by [[ammonium carbonate]]. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium form insoluble salts with [[chloroplatinic acid]], but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water, and the less-soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate ((Cs,Rb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) were obtained by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]]. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with [[hydrogen]], caesium and rubidium were separated by the difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol.

From the caesium chloride, the two scientists estimated the [[atomic weight]] of the new element at 123.35 (compared to the currently accepted one of 132.9).&lt;ref name="BuKi1861" /&gt; They tried to generate elemental caesium by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which "neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance"; as a result, they assigned it as a [[Non-stoichiometric compound|subchloride]] ({{chem|Cs|2|Cl}}). In reality, the product was probably a [[colloid]]al mixture of the metal and caesium chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zsigmondy|first=Richard |title=Colloids and the Ultra Microscope|publisher=Read books|date=2007|isbn=978-1-4067-5938-9|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac2mGhqjgUkC&amp;pg=PAPA69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrolysis of the aqueous solution of chloride with a mercury cathode produced a caesium amalgam which readily decomposed under the aqueous conditions.&lt;ref name="BuKi1861" /&gt; The pure metal was eventually isolated by the German chemist [[Carl Setterberg]] while working on his doctorate with [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Kekulé]] and Bunsen.&lt;ref name="Weeks" /&gt; In 1882, he produced caesium metal by electrolysing [[caesium cyanide]], avoiding the problems with the chloride.&lt;ref name="Sett"&gt;{{cite journal |title =Ueber die Darstellung von Rubidium- und Cäsiumverbindungen und über die Gewinnung der Metalle selbst|doi =10.1002/jlac.18822110105 |date =1882 |last1 =Setterberg |first1 =Carl |journal =Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie |volume =211 |pages =100–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical fields. Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s, when it came into use in radio [[vacuum tube]]s, where it had two functions; as a [[getter]], it removed excess oxygen after manufacture, and as a coating on the heated [[cathode]], it increased the [[electrical conductivity]]. Caesium was not recognized as a high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Strod|first = A. J.|date = 1957|title = Cesium—A new industrial metal|journal = American Ceramic Bulletin|volume = 36|issue = 6| pages = 212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications for nonradioactive caesium included [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], [[photomultiplier]] tubes, optical components of [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometers]], catalysts for several organic reactions, crystals for [[scintillation counter]]s, and in [[MHD generator|magnetohydrodynamic power generators]].&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; Caesium also was, and still is, used as a source of positive ions in [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS).

Since 1967, the [[International System of Units|International System of Measurements]] has based the primary unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles at the [[microwave]] [[frequency]] of the [[spectral line]] corresponding to the transition between two [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] [[energy level]]s of the [[ground state]] of [[caesium-133]].&lt;ref name=USNO&gt;{{cite web|title=Cesium Atoms at Work |publisher=Time Service Department—U.S. Naval Observatory—Department of the Navy |url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223231150/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |archivedate=February 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] of 1967 defined a second as: "the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of caesium-133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields".

==Applications==
===Petroleum exploration===&lt;!-- linked from "Formate" article --&gt;
The largest present-day use of nonradioactive caesium is in [[formate|caesium formate]] [[drilling fluid]]s for the [[extractive oil industry]].&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; Aqueous solutions of caesium formate (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)—made by reacting caesium hydroxide with [[formic acid]]—were developed in the mid-1990s for use as oil well drilling and [[completion (oil and gas wells)|completion fluids]]. The function of a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits, to bring rock cuttings to the surface, and to maintain pressure on the formation during drilling of the well. Completion fluids assist the emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production by maintaining the pressure.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

Unlike the components of many other heavy liquids, caesium formate is relatively environment-friendly.&lt;ref name="Down" /&gt; Caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and sodium formates to decrease the density of the fluids to that of water (1.0&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 8.3&amp;nbsp;pounds per gallon). Furthermore, it is biodegradable and may be recycled, which is important in view of its high cost (about $4,000&amp;nbsp;per [[Barrel (volume)#Oil barrel|barrel]] in 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Flatern|first = Rick|date = 2001|title = Keeping cool in the HPHT environment|journal = Offshore Engineer|issue = February|pages = 33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative, high-density brines (such as [[zinc bromide]] {{Chem|ZnBr|2}} solutions) sometimes do; they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

Caesium-based [[atomic clock]]s use the [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic transitions]] in the [[hyperfine structure]] of caesium-133 atoms as a reference point. The first accurate caesium clock was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=L.|last=Essen|first2=J.

===SI Units===
It is currently (2018) being [[Proposed redefinition of SI base units|proposed]] by the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) that the second, symbol s, the [[SI unit]] of time, be defined using the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency Δ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;Cs&lt;/sub&gt;, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom.

===Electric power and electronics===
Caesium vapour [[thermionic converter|thermionic generators]] are low-power devices that convert heat energy to electrical energy. In the two-electrode [[vacuum tube]] converter, caesium neutralizes the space charge near the cathode and enhances the current flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rasor| first1 = Ned S.| first2 = Charles|last2 =Warner| title = Correlation of Emission Processes for Adsorbed Alkali Films on Metal Surfaces| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 35| issue = 9| pages = 2589–2600| date = September 1964|doi = 10.1063/1.1713806|bibcode = 1964JAP....35.2589R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesium is also important for its [[Photoelectric effect|photoemissive]] properties, converting light to electron flow. It is used in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]] because caesium-based cathodes, such as the intermetallic compound {{chem|K|2|CsSb}}, have a low threshold voltage for emission of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanelements.com/cs.html |title=Cesium Supplier &amp; Technical Information |publisher=American Elements |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of photoemissive devices using caesium include [[optical character recognition]] devices, [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]], and [[video camera tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3215593|title = K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsSb Cathode Development| journal = AIP Conference Proceedings |date = 2009|volume = 1149| pages = 1062–1066|first1 =John|last1 = Smedley| first2 =Triveni|last2 = Rao| first3 =Erdong|last3 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = P.|last = Görlich|title = Über zusammengesetzte, durchsichtige Photokathoden|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 101|pages = 335–342|date =1936|doi =10.1007/BF01342330|bibcode = 1936ZPhy..101..335G|issue = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[germanium]], rubidium, selenium, silicon, tellurium, and several other elements can be substituted for caesium in photosensitive materials.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

[[Caesium iodide]] (CsI), [[caesium bromide|bromide]] (CsBr) and caesium fluoride (CsF) crystals are employed for [[scintillator]]s in [[scintillation counter]]s widely used in mineral exploration and particle physics research to detect [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-ray]] radiation. Being a heavy element, caesium provides good stopping power with better detection. Caesium compounds may provide a faster response (CsF) and be less hygroscopic (CsI).

Caesium vapour is used in many common [[magnetometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00340-005-1773-x|title = Comparison of discharge lamp and laser pumped cesium magnetometers|date = 2005|last1 = Groeger|first1 = S.|first2 = A.

===Centrifugation fluids===
The high density of the caesium ion makes solutions of caesium chloride, caesium sulfate, and caesium [[trifluoroacetic acid|trifluoroacetate]] ({{chem|Cs(O|2|CCF|3|)}}) useful in molecular biology for density gradient [[Differential centrifugation|ultracentrifugation]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Bick, Horst Prinz, "Cesium and Cesium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is used primarily in the isolation of [[virus|viral particles]], subcellular [[organelle]]s and fractions, and [[nucleic acid]]s from biological samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=1kn89nI2gUsC&amp;pg=PA61|pages = 61–62|isbn = 978-0-89603-564-5|chapter = Gradient Materials|editor =Desai, Mohamed A.|date = 2000|publisher = Humana Press|location = Totowa, N.J.|title = Downstream processing methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesium has also been used in thermoluminescent radiation [[dosimetry]] &lt;small&gt;(TLD)&lt;/small&gt;: When exposed to radiation, it acquires crystal defects that, when heated, revert with emission of light proportionate to the received dose. Thus, measuring the light pulse with a [[photomultiplier tube]] can allow the accumulated radiation dose to be quantified.

===Nuclear and isotope applications===
[[Caesium-137]] is a [[Radionuclide|radioisotope]] commonly used as a [[gamma ray|gamma]]-emitter in industrial applications. Its advantages include a half-life of roughly 30 years, its availability from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], and having [[Isotopes of barium|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Ba]] as a stable end product. The high water solubility is a disadvantage which makes it incompatible with large pool irradiators for food and medical supplies.&lt;ref name="Takeshi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth1.epa.gov/radiation/docs/source-management/csfinallongtakeshi.pdf |title=The material flow of radioactive cesium-137 in the U.S. 2000 |first=Takeshi |last=Okumura |date=2003-10-21 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-20 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720163223/http://earth1.epa.gov/radiation/docs/source-management/csfinallongtakeshi.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in agriculture, cancer treatment, and the [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of food, sewage sludge, and surgical equipment.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Jensen|first = N.

Caesium-137 has been used in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] studies analogous to those with [[tritium]]. As a daughter product of fission bomb testing from the 1950s through the mid-1980s, caesium-137 was released into the atmosphere, where it was absorbed readily into solution. Known year-to-year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers. Caesium-134, and to a lesser extent caesium-135, have also been used in hydrology to measure the caesium output by the nuclear power industry. While they are less prevalent than either caesium-133 or caesium-137, these bellwether isotopes are produced solely from anthropogenic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Carol|last=Kendall |url=http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/period/cs_iig.html |title=Isotope Tracers Project – Resources on Isotopes – Cesium|publisher=National Research Program – U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=pWDQnxd-r1UC&amp;pg=PT360 &amp;pg=PT12 --&gt;

Caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early [[ion thruster|ion engines]] designed for [[spacecraft propulsion]] on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions. The fuel was ionized by contact with a charged [[tungsten]] electrode.

Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic and nonradioactive caesium is not a significant environmental hazard.

Caesium metal is one of the most reactive elements and is highly [[explosive material|explosive]] in the presence of water. The hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time, causing ignition and a violent explosion. This can occur with other alkali metals, but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can be triggered even by cold water.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

It is highly [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]: the [[autoignition temperature]] of caesium is −116&amp;nbsp;°C, and it ignites explosively in air to form [[caesium hydroxide]] and various oxides. Caesium hydroxide is a very strong [[base (chemistry)|base]], and will rapidly corrode glass.&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/55/caesium|accessdate=2010-09-27|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|title=Chemical Data – Caesium – Cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[isotope]]s [[Caesium-134|134]] and 137 are present in the [[biosphere]] in small amounts from human activities, differing by location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as readily as other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium).

In [[chemistry]] the term '''chicken wire ''' is used in different contexts. Most of them relate to the similarity of the regular [[hexagonal]] ([[honeycomb]]-like) patterns found in certain [[chemical compounds]] to the [[mesh]] structure commonly seen in real [[chicken wire]].

==Examples==

=== Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ===
[[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s or [[graphene]]s&amp;mdash;including [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s, and [[graphite]]&amp;mdash;have a hexagonal structure that is often described as ''chicken wire-like''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calpoly.edu/~rbrown/soccerballs.html |title=Soccerballs |publisher=Calpoly.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/g.shtml |title=General Chemistry Online: Glossary: |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00099397-1687-1C75-9B81809EC588EF21 |title=Space Chemicals: Scientific American |publisher=Sciam.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical joke ===
It is an old joke in chemistry to draw a polycyclic hexagonal chemical structure and call this fictional compound ''chickenwire''. By adding one or two simple [[Functional group|chemical group]]s to this skeleton, the compound can then be named following the official [[IUPAC nomenclature|chemical naming convention]]. Examples are:

In [[computational chemistry]] a ''chicken wire model'' or ''chicken wire surface plot'' is a way to visualize molecular models by drawing the [[polygon]] mesh of their surface (defined e.g. as the [[van der Waals radius]] or a certain [[electron density]]). &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://scsg9.unige.ch/fln/eng/partie1a.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://zombie.imsb.au.dk/molscript/commands.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avatar.se/molscript/doc/interface.html |title=MolScript v2.1: Interface to external objects |publisher=Avatar.se |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsn.csiro.au/conscript/&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cscs.ch/molekel/manual/manual.4.3.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''Chromium carbide''' is a [[ceramic]] compound that exists in several different chemical compositions: Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,and Cr&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. At standard conditions it exists as a gray solid. It is extremely hard and [[corrosion]] resistant. It is also a [[refraction (metallurgy)|refractory]] compound, which means that it retains its strength at high temperatures as well. These properties make it useful as an additive to metal [[alloy]]s. When chromium carbide crystals are integrated into the surface of a metal it improves the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of the metal, and maintains these properties at elevated temperatures. The hardest and most commonly used composition for this purpose is Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Related minerals include [[tongbaite]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-3994.html Tongbaite: Tongbaite mineral information and data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and isovite, (Cr,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, both extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;Generalov ME, Naumov VA, Mokhov AV, Trubkin NV, "Isovite (Cr,Fe)23C6 - a new mineral from the gold-platinum bearing placers of the Urals", Zapiski Vserossiyskogo mineralogicheskogo obshchestva, vol. 127, pp.26-37, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another chromium-rich carbide mineral is yarlongite, Cr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NiC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mindat, http://www.mindat.org/min-35899.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
There are three different crystal structures for chromium carbide corresponding to the three different chemical compositions. Cr&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has a cubic crystal structure and a Vickers hardness of 976&amp;nbsp;kg/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Chattopadhyay&gt;{{cite book|last=Chattopadhyay|first=R.|title=Surface Wear: Analysis, Treatment, and Prevention|year=2001|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, OH|isbn=978-0-87170-702-4|pages=228–229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulNg1Cf-tGAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a hexagonal crystal structure and a microhardness of 1336&amp;nbsp;kg/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Chattopadhyay /&gt; Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the most durable of the three compositions, and has an orthorhombic crystal structure with a microhardness of 2280&amp;nbsp;kg/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Chattopadhyay /&gt; For this reason Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the primary form of chromium carbide used in surface treatment.

==Synthesis==
Synthesis of chromium carbide can be achieved through [[mechanical alloying]]. In this type of process metallic [[chromium]] and pure carbon in the form of [[graphite]] are loaded into a [[ball mill]] and ground into a fine powder. After the components have been ground they are pressed into a pellet and subjected to hot [[isostatic press]]ing. Hot isostatic pressing utilizes an inert gas, primarily [[argon]], in a sealed oven. This pressurized gas applies pressure to the sample from all directions while the oven is heated. The heat and pressure cause the graphite and metallic chromium to react with one another and form chromium carbide. Decreasing the percentage of carbon content in the initial mixture results in an increase in the yield of the Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Cr&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; forms of chromium carbide.&lt;ref name=Cintho&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cintho|first=Osvaldo|author2=Favilla, Eliane |author3=Capocchi, Jose |title=Mechanical–thermal synthesis of chromium carbides|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|date=1 July 2007|volume=439|issue=1–2|pages=189–195|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method for the synthesis of chromium carbide utilizes chromium oxide, pure aluminum, and graphite in a self-propagating [[exothermic reaction]] that proceeds as follows:&lt;ref name="Cintho"/&gt;

::3Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6Al + 4C → 2Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In this method the reactants are ground and blended in a ball mill. The blended powder is then pressed into a pellet and placed under an inert atmosphere of argon. The sample is then heated. A heated wire, a spark, a laser, or an oven may provide the heat. The exothermic reaction is initiated, and the resulting heat propagates the reaction throughout the rest of the sample.

==Uses==
Chromium carbide is useful in the surface treatment of metal components. Chromium carbide is used to coat the surface of another metal in a technique known as [[thermal spraying]]. Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; powder is mixed with solid [[Nichrome|nickel-chromium]]. This mixture is then heated to very high temperatures and sprayed onto the object being coated where it forms a protective layer. This layer is essentially its own [[metal matrix composite]], consisting of hard ceramic Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles embedded in a nickel-chromium matrix. The matrix itself contributes to the corrosion resistance of the coating because both [[nickel]] and chromium are corrosion resistant in their metallic form. After over spraying the coating, the coated part must run through a diffusion heat treatment to reach the best results in matter of coupling strength to the basemetal and also in matter of hardness.
Another technique utilizes chromium carbide in the form of overlay plates. These are prefabricated chromium carbide coated steel plates, which are meant to be welded onto existing structures or machinery in order to improve performance.
Chromium carbide is used as an additive in cutting tools made out of [[cemented carbide]]s, in order to improve [[toughness]] by preventing the growth of large grains.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Jonathan|author2=Haw, Michael|title=Chromium Carbides|journal=Materials World|date=November 1997|volume=5|issue=11|url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary constituent in most extremely hard cutting tools is [[tungsten carbide]]. The tungsten carbide is combined with other carbides such as titanium carbide, niobium carbide, and chromium carbide and [[sintering|sintered]] together with a cobalt matrix. Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; prevents large grains from forming in the composite, which results in a fine-grained structure of superior toughness.

In aerosol physics, '''deposition''' is the process by which [[aerosol]] particles collect or deposit themselves on solid surfaces, decreasing the concentration of the particles in the air.  It can be divided into two sub-processes: ''dry'' and ''wet'' deposition. The rate of deposition, or the '''deposition velocity''', is slowest for particles of an intermediate size.  Mechanisms for deposition are most effective for either very small or very large particles.  Very large particles will settle out quickly through sedimentation (settling) or impaction processes, while [[Brownian motion|Brownian]] diffusion has the greatest influence on small particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Seinfeld  | first = John  |author2=Spyros Pandis  | title = Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change  | edition = Second  | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.  | year = 2006  | location = Hoboken, New Jersey  | isbn =  0-471-72018-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because very small particles coagulate in few hours until they achieve a diameter of 0.3 [[micrometre]]s.  At this size they no longer coagulate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} This has a great influence in the amount of [[PM-2.5]] present in the air.

''Deposition [[velocity]]'' is defined from {{math|1='''F''' = '''v'''''c''}}, where {{math|'''F'''}} is [[flux density]], {{math|'''v'''}} is deposition velocity and {{mvar|c}} is [[concentration]]. In gravitational deposition, this velocity is the [[settling velocity]] due to the [[gravity]]-induced [[drag (force)|drag]].

Often studied is whether or not a certain particle will impact with a certain obstacle. This can be predicted with the [[Stokes number]] {{math|1=Stk = ''S'' ∕ ''d''}}, where {{mvar|S}} is stopping distance (which depends on particle size, velocity and drag forces), and {{mvar|d}} is characteristic size (often the [[diameter]] of the obstacle). If the value of Stk is less than 1, the particle will not collide with that obstacle. However, if the value of Stk is greater than 1, it will.

Deposition due to [[Brownian motion]] obeys both [[Fick's law of diffusion|Fick's first and second laws]]. The resulting deposition flux is defined as {{math|1=''J'' = ''n''}}{{sqrt|''D'' ∕ π''t''}}, where {{mvar|J}} is deposition flux, {{mvar|n}} is the initial [[number density]], {{mvar|D}} is the diffusion constant and {{mvar|t}} is time. This can be integrated to determine the concentration at each moment of time.

== Dry deposition ==
[[Image:impaction scrub.gif|thumb|right| '''Figure 1''' – Impaction]]
[[Image:diffusion scrub.gif|thumb|right| '''Figure 2''' – Diffusion]]

'''Dry deposition''' is caused by:
* [[aerosol impaction|Impaction]]. This is when small particles interfacing a bigger obstacle are not able to follow the curved streamlines of the flow due to their inertia, so they hit or impact the droplet. The larger the masses of the small particles facing the big one, the greater the displacement from the flow streamline.
* Gravitational [[sedimentation]] – the settling of particles fall down due to gravity.
* Interception. This is when small particles follow the streamlines, but if they flow too close to an obstacle, they may collide (e.g. a branch of a tree).
* [[Turbulence]]. Turbulent [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] in the air transfer particles which can collide. Again, there is a net flux towards lower concentrations.
* Other processes, such as: [[thermophoresis]], [[turbophoresis]], [[diffusiophoresis]] and [[electrophoresis]].

== Wet deposition ==

In '''wet deposition''', [[Precipitation (meteorology)|atmospheric hydrometeors]] (rain drops, snow etc.) scavenge aerosol particles. This means that wet deposition is gravitational, Brownian and/or turbulent coagulation with [[water|water droplets]]. Different types of wet deposition include:
* Below-cloud scavenging. This happens when falling rain droplets or snow particles collide with aerosol particles through Brownian diffusion, interception, impaction and turbulent diffusion.
* In-cloud scavenging. This is where aerosol particles get into cloud droplets or cloud ice crystals through working as cloud nuclei, or being captured by them through collision. They can be brought to the ground surface when rain or snow forms in clouds. Within aerosol computer models aerosols and cloud droplets are mostly treated separately so that [[nucleation]] represents a loss process that has to be [[Parametrization|parametrised]].

'''EVER Monaco''' is annual exhibition and conference event showcasing the latest [[renewable energy]] technology with a focus on vehicle design.  "EVER" is a (somewhat flawed) [[acronym]] for "ecologic vehicles and renewable energies."

The [[Venturi Fetish]], the world’s first production two-seater electric sports car, became the sensation of the first EVER, held in 2005. The Fetish has a range of 250 to 350&amp;nbsp;km (155 to 217 miles) and boasts a 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h (0–60&amp;nbsp;mph) time of 4.5 seconds.

The 2009 EVER took place in and around [[Monaco]]’s [[Grimaldi Forum]], a 35,000-m² (377,000-sq. ft.) arena on the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], from 26 to 29 March.

An '''Eco-house''' (or eco-home) is an environmentally low-impact home designed and built using materials and technology that reduces its [[carbon footprint]] and lowers its energy needs.

An eco house could include some or all of the following:
* Higher than normal levels of [[thermal insulation]]
* Better than normal airtightness
* Good levels of daylight
* Passive solar orientation — glazing oriented south for light and heat
* Thermal mass to absorb that solar heat
* Minimum north-facing glazing — to reduce heat loss
* [[Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery]] (MVHR) system
* Heating from [[renewable resource]]s (such as solar, heat pump or biomass)
* [[Photovoltaic panel]]s, small wind turbine or electricity from a ‘green’ supplier
* Natural materials — avoidance of PVCu and other plastics
* [[Rainwater harvesting]]
* Greywater collection
* [[Composting toilet]]
* Glass that has two or three layers with a vacuum in between to prevent heat loss; (double or triple-glazed windows)
* Solar panels or wind turbines
* Geothermal heating and growing plants on the roof to regulate temperature, quieten the house, and to produce oxygen
* A vegetable patch outside the house for some food

The concept of an eco-house means a dwelling that has a low impact on the environment.

==Building concepts==
===Energy loss===
Buildings use up enormous amounts of energy. Some calculations make it as much as 70% of all the energy used in the UK when all the factors are taken into account. This energy is mainly for [[heating]] and lighting and therefore the aim is to design houses that are well insulated and make the best use of natural light.&lt;ref name = "Living Village"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thelivingvillagetrust.com/what-is-an-eco-house/ | title = What is an eco-house | website = The Living Village Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insulation===
Increasing the amount of [[thermal insulation]] is the main component of preventing [[energy loss]]. This includes draft exclusion, glazing, wall and roof insulation.

===Passive solar gain===
In the northern hemisphere, a south facing site will be a much better location than a north facing site because of access to sunlight and protection from the cold northerly wind. An eco-house starts life facing the sun.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

Ideally the site for the house should have a south westerly aspect and be protected from the north and east. It’s not always possible to do this but there will usually be an opportunity to take advantage of the passive solar gain by having more glazing on either the front or the back of the building. Planting trees and creating wind breaks on the north and east sides of the site can enhanced the solar gain effect by protecting the house from the cold north easterly winds.

Having faced the house towards the sun, high performance windows are used to draw in as much light and warmth as possible. Sunlight then floods into the house and any heat generated is retained by a highly insulated building shell, draught proof windows and doors and thermal mass within the building.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

===Active solar gain===
Orientation towards the sun also means that active solar systems can be fitted, both solar water heating panels and electricity generating solar panels on the roofs, further adding to the free heat and electricity gained from the sun.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

===Living gain===
Living in the house also generates heat. Active human beings can produce as much heat as a one bar electric fire. Add to this heat from cooking, washing, lights etc. and you can begin to see how an eco-house could get too hot. Conventionally opening the windows reduces heat, but an eco-house design could include heat recovery ventilation systems. &lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

===Heat recovery ventilation===
These systems extract the warm, moist air from bathrooms and kitchens and take the heat out of the stale, damp air before venting it outside. The heat recovery system transfers this collected heat to fresh air coming into the building and distributes it to the bedrooms and living rooms. Fresh air, at room temperature. An added benefit is that filters can be fitted on the air intake to provide a barrier to pollen or other irritants.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

===Living heat loss===
With the passive and active solar gains, insulation, draft proofed building shell and heat recovery system, eco-houses could be zero heat, that is, in theory, you shouldn’t need to keep pumping heat into them from a central heating system. In practice life isn’t like that. Kids leave the door open, pets come in and out, people go out all day, cold snaps happen and some people like to sleep with the window open. An eco-house can incorporate design to have heating systems that can react quickly and efficiently to any changes in room temperature as well as providing a heat boost to the water temperature down-stream of the solar panels.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

===Health===
Other benefits of an eco-house, aside from the obvious one of having minimal heating costs, are a healthy living environment. The heat recovery system can eliminate dampness and the moulds that are so often a health hazard. The air intake filters prevent dust coming in with the incoming fresh air and the internal vacuum cleaner system extracts dust from the house and vents it (via the dust collection bag and filter) to the outside, thus no microscopic particles of dust remain in the house.

Load bearing internal walls are minimised to allow rearrangements of the interior spaces, and the build technology is such that local trades can carry out alterations and easy maintenance.

For the health of the householder, and the planet, an eco-house should be built with materials that are free, wherever possible, from toxins or harmful products of the petro-chemical industry.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt; 

===Sustainable materials===
One of the wider issues of energy efficiency is the [[embodied energy]] within the construction materials. (Embodied energy is the energy taken up with producing and transporting the materials used).&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

====Timber====
Wood is a primary building material for eco-housing. This is because trees grow using energy from the sun, they don’t pollute, they produce oxygen, absorb CO2, they provide a wild life habitat, they can be replanted, they can be sourced locally, the timber can easily be put to some other use after a building is demolished.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

====Lime====
Cement is a very useful building material and there are places where we have to be practical and use it. However, one alternative to cement is lime. Lime has been used as a building material for thousands of years and although energy and CO2 are used in its production it gently returns back to limestone in time, taking in CO2 in the process.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;  

====Reclaimed materials====
There is also the use reclaimed materials, particularly bricks, slates and roof tiles, to make use of the embodied energy within these materials. This can also help new buildings to blend in with their surroundings.&lt;ref name = "Living Village" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">'''Electronic Beam curing''' (EBC) is a surface curing process in the manufacture of [[high pressure laminate]] (HPL) boards. The process applies color to a single sheet of [[Kraft paper]] which is adhered to a HPL board in such a way that it will keep its color durably while remaining scratch-resistant. Unlike other HPL creation methods, EBC does not use heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cpr/pres/105990.pdf Electronic Beam Curing of Composites] on [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBC machine used in the curing process gives the finished HPL boards a surface that is both color-fade resistant and has a high resistance to damage. The process works by first mixing color pastes to the desired color and then applying it to a single sheet of [[kraft paper]]. This [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] is then put in the EBC machine together with a [[Foil stamping|protective foil]]. In the machine this sheet is then shot with [[electrons]] at such high velocity that the color impregnated paper hardens almost instantly. After being stored in a [[Temperature control|temperature-controlled]] room for a short duration the sheets are ready to be adhered to unfinished HPL boards in a process called [[dry forming]].

[[File:ECN-terrein Petten.jpg|thumb|right|ECN in Petten]]
The '''Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands''' ('''ECN''') is one of the largest [[energy]] research institute in Europe and holds a strong international position. With and for the market, ECN develops knowledge and technology that enable a transition to a sustainable energy system. The main office is located in [[Petten]]. ECN also has offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Wieringermeer]], [[Brussels]] and [[China]]. ECN has a staff of about 550 employees.

==Activities==
ECN’s research and technology development focuses on:
* [[Solar Energy]]
* [[Wind Energy]]
* [[Biomass]]
* Environmental research
* Energy efficiency
* Policy Studies

The total package of sustainable energy generation, clean use of fossil fuels and reduction of total energy use are key topics. ECN also conducts research on future opportunities and economic backgrounds in the field of energy.

==Publications==
ECN researchers disseminate their results in publications such as reports, peer reviewed articles in scientific and professional journals, conference contributions and books and chapters in books. In 2011, ECN published 481 reports (public and confidential) and 176 articles in scientific journals.

==International position==
ECN participates in international projects, advises authorities and collaborates with the industry in the Netherlands, Europe and worldwide. A number of examples:
* EERA: together with nine other research organisations in Europe, ECN founded the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA). The aim is to harmonise the research programmes through joint research and optimal deployment of facilities. 
* ADEM: an initiative of ECN and three collaborating Technical Universities ([[Delft University of Technology]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], and the [[University of Twente]]). They wish to give strong impetus to Dutch materials research in relation to energy technology.
* FLOW: the FLOW programme enables Dutch businesses to take a leading position on the international market for offshore wind farms. The programme was initiated by RWE, Eneco, TenneT, Ballast Nedam, Van Oord, IHC Merwede, 2-B Energy, XECM Darwind, ECN and Delft University of technology. 
* Solliance: Solliance is a collaboration of TNO, Eindhoven University of Technology, ECN and IMEC, focusing on research and development in the field of thin film solar panels (PV) in the ELAT region (Eindhoven-Louvain-Aachen triangle).
* CARENA ('''CA'''talytic '''RE'''actors based on '''N'''ew m'''A'''terials): a European collaborative project coordinated by ECN. The project aim to create possibilities for the use of cheaper, less reactive, raw materials by using membrane reactor technology. CARENA brings together companies and institutes from 8 European countries. European chemical companies as Akzo Nobel and Arkema ensure a strong industrial leadership to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecn.nl/fileadmin/ecn/units/ei/images/IEG/Public_project_summary_CARENA_-_negotiation_phase.pdf |title=Public project summary CARENA - negotiation phase |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ECN participates in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[International Energy Agency]].

==History==
ECN received its current name in 1976. Before that time, the centre, which was founded in 1955, was solely focused on the peaceful deployment of nuclear energy  under the name of Reactor Centre Netherlands (RCN). In 1976 it became clear that the energy supply of the future should not rely on nuclear energy alone. Alternative forms of energy were called for. RCN was appointed as the institute that should conduct the largest part of this research.

==Subsidiary company==
The [[Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group]] (NRG) is a full subsidiary of ECN and the most important manufacturer of radio-active isotopes for medical use in Europe. NRG manages the nuclear reactors in Petten, which are owned by the European Union.
Admatec Europe is partially owned by ECN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dprintingmaterialsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140620_Admatecprintconf_publ.pdf |title=Presentation Admatec Europe 2014 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admatec Europe manufactures ceramic components via 3D printing.

==Board of directors and Supervisory Board==
The Board of directors of ECN consists of one statutory director (chairman of the board of directors) and two deputy directors. The Supervisory Board consists of six members. It is the duty of the Supervisory Board to supervise the administration of the foundation by the Board of directors as well as the general affairs. The members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation.

== Controversies == 
A former director of ECN, Wim Stam, made headlines with his private investment in four windmills. In his role as public servant, Wim Stam also advised the Dutch Government on the placement, quality and efficiency of wind mills.
Wim made over one million Euros with his private investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/belangenverstrengeling-bij-adviseur-windenergie~a4230597/ |title=Conflict of Interest Article Volkskrant 2016 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his actions, ECN changed its regulations so conflict of interests would be prevented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/ecn-scherpt-regels-aan-na-schijn-van-belangenverstrengeling~a4242972/ |title=ECN changes regulations after conflict of Interest Wim Stam, Volkskrant 2016 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8298">In [[nuclear physics]], an '''energy amplifier''' is a novel type of [[nuclear power]] reactor, a ''[[subcritical reactor]]'', in which an energetic [[Charged particle beam|particle beam]] is used to stimulate a reaction, which in turn releases enough energy to power the [[particle accelerator]] and leave an energy profit for power generation. The concept has more recently been referred to as an '''accelerator-driven system''' (ADS) or [[Accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor]].

None have ever been built.

==History==

The concept is credited  to Italian scientist [[Carlo Rubbia]], a Nobel Prize particle [[physicist]] and former director of Europe's [[CERN]] international [[nuclear physics]] lab. He published a proposal for a power reactor based on a proton [[cyclotron]] accelerator with a beam energy of 800 [[MeV]] to 1 [[GeV]], and a target with [[thorium]] as fuel and [[lead]] as a coolant.  Rubbia's scheme also borrows from ideas developed by a group led by nuclear physicist Charles Bowman of the Los Alamos National Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rubbia Floats a Plan for Accelerator Power Plants|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/262/5138/1368|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Science|date=Nov 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle and feasibility==
The energy amplifier first uses a particle accelerator (e.g. [[linac]], [[synchrotron]], [[cyclotron]] or  [[FFAG accelerator|FFAG]]) to produce a beam of high-energy (relativistic) protons. The beam is directed to smash into the nucleus of a heavy metal target, such as lead, thorium or uranium.  Inelastic collisions between the proton beam and the target results in [[spallation]], which produces twenty to thirty neutrons per event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psi.ch/bsq/spallation-target |title=Spallation Target &amp;#124; Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) |website=Psi.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be possible to increase the neutron flux through the use of a [[neutron amplifier]], a thin film of [[fissile]] material surrounding the spallation source; the use of neutron amplification in [[CANDU]] reactors has been proposed. While [[CANDU]] is a critical design, many of the concepts can be applied to a sub-critical system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~valeri/Mars/Mo-o-f10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neutron amplification in CANDU reactors |url=http://canteach.candu.org/library/20041209.pdf |publisher=CANDU |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124454/http://canteach.candu.org/library/20041209.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorium nuclei absorb neutrons, thus breeding fissile [[uranium-233]], an isotope of uranium which is not found in nature. [[Thermal neutron|Moderated neutron]]s produce U-233 fission, releasing energy.

This design is entirely plausible with currently available technology, but requires more study before it can be declared both practical and economical.

OMEGA project ({{nihongo|'''O'''ption '''M'''aking of '''E'''xtra '''G'''ain from '''A'''ctinides and fission products|[[:ja:オメガ計画|オメガ計画]]|}}) is being studied as one of methodology of accelerator-driven system (ADS) in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jolisfukyu.tokai-sc.jaea.go.jp/fukyu/gihou/pdf2/5913.pdf|script-title=ja:大電流電子線加速器の性能確認試験|date=December 2000|publisher=[[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]]|location=[[Ōarai, Ibaraki]]|language=Japanese|trans-title=Performance of Ｈigh Power CW Electron Linear Accelerator|format=pdf|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Garwin]] and [[Georges Charpak]] describe the energy amplifier in detail in their book [[Megawatts and Megatons]]  A Turning Point in the Nuclear Age?" (2001) on pages 153-163.

Earlier, the general concept of the energy amplifier, namely an [[Accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor]], was covered in
"The Second Nuclear Era" (1985) pages 62–64, by [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] and others.

==Advantages==

The concept has several potential advantages over conventional nuclear [[fission reactor]]s:

* Subcritical design means that the reaction could not run away &amp;mdash; if anything went wrong, the reaction would stop and the reactor would cool down. A [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] could however occur if the ability to cool the core was lost.
* [[Thorium]] is an abundant element &amp;mdash; much more so than [[uranium]] &amp;mdash; reducing strategic and political supply issues and eliminating costly and energy-intensive [[isotope]] [[Enriched uranium|separation]]. There is enough thorium to generate energy for at least several thousand years at current consumption rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c24/page_166.shtml David JC McKay Sustainable Energy - without the hot air']&lt;/ref&gt;
* The energy amplifier would produce very little [[plutonium]], so the design is believed to be more [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]]-resistant than conventional nuclear power (although the question of [[uranium]]-233 as [[nuclear weapon]] material must be assessed carefully).
* The possibility exists of using the reactor to consume plutonium, reducing the world stockpile of the very-long-lived element.
* Less long-lived [[radioactive waste]] is produced &amp;mdash; the waste material would decay after 500 years to the radioactive level of [[coal]] ash.
* No new science is required; the technologies to build the energy amplifier have all been demonstrated. Building an energy amplifier requires only [[engineering]] effort, not fundamental research (unlike [[nuclear fusion]] proposals).
* Power generation might be economical compared to current nuclear reactor designs if the total [[Nuclear fuel cycle|fuel cycle]] and [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] costs are considered.
* The design could work on a relatively small scale, making it more suitable for countries without a well-developed [[power grid]] system
* [[Inherent safety]] and safe fuel transport could make the technology more suitable for [[developing countries]] as well as in densely populated areas.

==Disadvantages==
* Each reactor needs its own facility ([[particle accelerator]]) to generate the high energy proton beam, which is very costly. Apart from [[linear particle accelerator]]s, which are very expensive, no proton accelerator of sufficient power and energy {{nowrap|(&gt; ~12 MW}} at {{nowrap|1 GeV)}} has ever been built.  Currently, the [[Spallation Neutron Source]] utilizes a {{nowrap|1.44 MW}} proton beam to produce its neutrons, with upgrades envisioned to {{nowrap|5 MW.}}&lt;ref&gt;http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/e04/PAPERS/TUPLT170.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;  Its {{nowrap|1.1 billion USD}} cost included research equipment not needed for a commercial reactor.
* The fuel material needs to be chosen carefully to avoid unwanted nuclear reactions. This implies a full-scale [[nuclear reprocessing]] plant associated with the energy amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppd.fnal.gov/experiments/e907/raja/energy_amplifier/cer-0210391.pdf ''Conceptual design of a fast neutron operated high power energy amplifier''], [[Carlo Rubbia]] et al., CERN/AT/95-44, pages 42 ff., section ''Practical considerations''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy sources==
Russia is rich in energy resources. Russia has the largest known [[natural gas]] reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest [[coal]] reserves, and the eighth largest [[petroleum|oil]] reserves. This is 32% of world proven natural gas reserves (23% of the probable reserves), 12% of the proven oil reserves, 10% of the explored coal reserves (14% of the estimated reserves) and 8% of the proven [[uranium]] reserves.&lt;ref name=eia&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Russia/Full.html | title=Country Analysis Brief.

{{main|Natural gas in Russia}}
Russia has identified the gas sector as being of key strategic importance. The share of natural gas as a primary energy source is remarkably high compared to the rest of world. Russia has the world biggest natural gas reserves, mainly owned and operated by the Russian monopoly [[Gazprom]], which produces 94% of Russia's natural gas production. In global context Gazprom holds 25% of the world's known gas reserves and produces 16% of global output.&lt;ref name=euractiv&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/energy/eu-russia-energy-dialogue/article-150061 | title=EU-Russia Energy Dialogue | publisher = EurActive.com | date = 2005-11-28 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Russia was the world's biggest natural gas producer with {{convert|677|e9m3|abbr=off}} which accounted 20.0% of global natural gas production. It is also the biggest gas exporter with {{convert|196|e9m3|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=IEA2012&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/kwes.pdf Key world statistics 2012] IEA&lt;/ref&gt; The main export markets of Russian natural gas are the [[European Union]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. Russia supplies a quarter of the EU gas consumption, mainly via transit through [[Ukraine]] (Soyuz, Brotherhood) and [[Belarus]] ([[Yamal-Europe pipeline]]).

===Oil===
{{Main|Oil industry of Russia}}

===Conventional oil===
Russia is the largest oil producer in the non-[[OPEC]] countries, and second biggest in the world after [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref name=eneken&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://eneken.ieej.or.jp/en/data/pdf/311.pdf | title=The Russian Oil Policies and Its Oil Industry Trends | publisher = The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan |author1=Goichi Komori |author2=Sanae Kurita |author3=Keishi Nakashima | format=PDF |date=December 2005 | accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it overtakes as the world's number one from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2058214.stm |title=Russia's oil renaissance |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-06-24 |accessdate=2007-05-19| first=James| last=Schofield}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2006, Russia contributed 12.1% of global oil production and 11.6% of global oil exports.&lt;ref name=iea11&gt;IEA (2007), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, Russian crude oil and condensate production reached the post-Soviet maximum of {{convert|9.7|Moilbbl|m3}} per day, exceeding production in 2000 by {{convert|3.2|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}. Russian export consists more than {{convert|5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of oil and nearly {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of refined products, which go mainly to the European market. The domestic demand in 2005 was {{convert|2.6|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} on average.&lt;ref name=esai&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Russian oil industry between state and market |title= Fundamentals of the global oil and gas industry, 2006 |first=Yulia | last =Woodruff |publisher = [[Petroleum Economist]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-86186-266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Russia is also the main transit country for oil from [[Kazakhstan]].

The biggest Russian oil company is [[Rosneft]] followed by [[Lukoil]], [[TNK-BP]], [[Surgutneftegaz]], [[Gazprom Neft]] and [[Tatneft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbcnews.com/komment/komment.shtml?2007/01/11/31319500 LUKoil to lose the lead soon.

Retrieved 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; All oil trunk pipelines (except the [[Caspian Pipeline Consortium]]) are owned and operated by the state-owned monopoly [[Transneft]]; oil products pipelines are owned and operated by its subsidiary [[Transnefteproduct]]. Currently, Transneft is constructing the [[Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] that would bring Russian oil to the Asian-Pacific markets ([[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]]).

====Oil shale====
Russia owns the biggest [[oil shale]] reserves in Europe equal to 35.47 billion tonnes of [[shale oil]]. More than 80 oil shale deposits have been identified. Main deposits are located in the Volga-Petchyorsk province and the Baltic Basin. Extraction of the deposits in the Volga-Petchyorsk province began in the 1930s, but was abandoned due to environmental problems. Main [[oil shale industry]] was concentrated on the Baltic Basin in [[Slantsy, Leningrad Oblast|Slantsy]], but at the end of the 1990s the Slantsy oil shale processing plant and oil shale-fired power station were converted to use traditional hydrocarbons and mining activities ceased before 2005. In [[Syzran]] a small processing plant continues to operate.&lt;ref name=wec114&gt;WEC (2007), p.114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil====
Small [[Heavy crude oil|extra-heavy oil]] reserves have been identified in the Volga-Urals and North Caucasus-Mangyshlak basins. Large deposits of natural bitumen are located in Eastern Siberia in the Lena-Tunguska basin. Other bitumen deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Urals Basins, and in [[Tatarstan]].&lt;ref name=wec140&gt;WEC (2007), p.140&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 2007, [[Tatneft]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] announced a strategic partnership to develop [[heavy crude oil]] production in [[Tatarstan]], where Tatneft already has pilot production of [[bitumen]].&lt;ref name=shell&gt;{{cite web |title = Tatneft and Shell to develop strategic partnership.

===Coal===
{{Main|Coal power in Russia}}
Russia has the world’s second largest coal reserves, with 157 billion tonnes of reserves.

Russian coal reserves are widely dispersed. The principal hard coal deposits are located in the Pechora and Kuznetsk basins. The Kansk-Achinsk basin contains huge deposits of [[Lignite|brown coal]]. The Siberian Lena and Tunguska basins constitute largely unexplored resources, the commercial exploitation of which would probably be difficult.&lt;ref name=wec34&gt;WEC (2007), p.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydropower===
Hydropower accounts for about 21% of Russia's total electric power production. Russia now has 102 hydropower plants in operation, with aggregate installed capacity of over 35 GW. Russia's [[RusHydro]] is the world's second-largest hydroelectric power producer.&lt;ref name=RusHydro&gt;[http://www.eng.rushydro.ru/industry/history] RusHydro&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross theoretical potential of the Russian hydro resource base is 2,295&amp;nbsp;TWh per year, of which 852&amp;nbsp;TWh is regarded as economically feasible. Most of this potential is located in Siberia and the Far East.&lt;ref name=wec308&gt;WEC (2007), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Hydro generation (including pumped-storage output) in 2005 was 175&amp;nbsp;TWh, which represents 5.8% of world hydroelectricity generation. Russia ranks as the fifth largest hydroelectricity producer in the world.&lt;ref name=iea19&gt;IEA (2007), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2005 installed hydroelectric generating capacity was 45.7&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name=wec308&gt;WEC (2007), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power===
{{Main|Nuclear power in Russia}}
In 2005 nuclear energy supply in Russia amounted to 149&amp;nbsp;TWh, which is 15.7% of total Russian electricity output and 5.4% of global nuclear energy production.&lt;ref name=iea17&gt;IEA (2007), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The total installed capacity of nuclear reactors is 21,244MW. There are plans to increase the number of commercial reactors from thirty one to fifty nine.

From 2001 all Russian civil reactors were operated by [[Energoatom (Russia)|Energoatom]]. On 19 January 2007 Russian Parliament adopted legislation which created [[Atomenergoprom]] - a holding company for all Russian civil nuclear industry, including Energoatom, the nuclear fuel producer and supplier [[TVEL]], the uranium trader [[Tekhsnabexport]] (Tenex) and nuclear facilities constructor [[Atomstroyexport]].

Uranium exploration and development activities have been largely concentrated on three east-of-Urals uranium districts (Transural, West Siberia and Vitim). The most important uranium producing area has been the Streltsovsky region near Krasnokamensk in the [[Chita Oblast|Chitinskaya Oblast]]. In 2005, the Russian Federation was the world’s fourth largest producer of uranium, accounting for 8.2% of global output.&lt;ref name=wec229&gt;WEC (2007), p.229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewable energy===
{{Main|Renewable energy in Russia}}
Low prices for energy and in particular subsidies for natural gas hinder renewable energy development in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Indra_Overland/publication/289325179_Russian_renewable_energy_The_potential_for_international_cooperation/links/5b433c09aca2728a0d65a451/Russian-renewable-energy-The-potential-for-international-cooperation.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=fJROtvVQJaGcTFYuJzrRw5YvRJ6kigQ7JivnE2OehtRLANQN5UY6hfCuKCR6dinnMB_D3ujxLErL1PIDI5HelQ.A13qk_1frVttX8HtCbEnBrEbAxm7nmNYLuAtXa57cd0YKMrMtQprdrDwA20j4-00EHuPWI9IpsTeoGqBbrFhoQ&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=UwM1losY1xmC998Vnnf7Cp9PESfdrYEJ3o8-qKxIFeSRwtMnvae0dRvvReNFkUcpoCX7plJM8Aqq2hjRaHWmHbqV04_RPTuPCE31huwCJSQ2.A13qk_1frVttX8HtCbEnBrEbAxm7nmNYLuAtXa57cd0YKMrMtQprdrDwA20j4-00EHuPWI9IpsTeoGqBbrFhoQ&amp;_iepl=|title=Russian renewable energy: The potential for international cooperation|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Kjaernet|first2=Heidi|publisher=Asghate|year=2009|isbn=|location=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Indra_Overland/publication/289325179_Russian_renewable_energy_The_potential_for_international_cooperation/links/5b433c09aca2728a0d65a451/Russian-renewable-energy-The-potential-for-international-cooperation.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=fJROtvVQJaGcTFYuJzrRw5YvRJ6kigQ7JivnE2OehtRLANQN5UY6hfCuKCR6dinnMB_D3ujxLErL1PIDI5HelQ.A13qk_1frVttX8HtCbEnBrEbAxm7nmNYLuAtXa57cd0YKMrMtQprdrDwA20j4-00EHuPWI9IpsTeoGqBbrFhoQ&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=UwM1losY1xmC998Vnnf7Cp9PESfdrYEJ3o8-qKxIFeSRwtMnvae0dRvvReNFkUcpoCX7plJM8Aqq2hjRaHWmHbqV04_RPTuPCE31huwCJSQ2.A13qk_1frVttX8HtCbEnBrEbAxm7nmNYLuAtXa57cd0YKMrMtQprdrDwA20j4-00EHuPWI9IpsTeoGqBbrFhoQ&amp;_iepl=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia lags behind other countries in creating a conducive framework for renewable energy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2010|title=The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693_The_Siberian_Curse_A_Blessing_in_Disguise_for_Renewable_Energy|journal=Sibirica Journal of Siberian Studies|volume=9|pages=1–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-hydroelectric [[renewable energy]] in Russia is largely undeveloped although Russia has many potential renewable energy resources.

====Geothermal energy====
{{Main|Geothermal power in Russia}}
[[geothermal power|Geothermal energy]], which is used for heating and electricity production in some regions of the [[North Caucasus economic region|Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Far Eastern economic region|Far East]], is the most developed renewable energy source in Russia.&lt;ref name="Russia: Energy overview"/&gt; Geothermal resources have been identified in the Northern Caucasus, Western Siberia, Lake Baikal, and in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands. In 1966 a 4&amp;nbsp;MWe single-flash plant was commissioned at Pauzhetka (currently 11&amp;nbsp;MWe) followed by a 12&amp;nbsp;MWe geothermal power plant at Verkhne Mutnovsky, and 50&amp;nbsp;MWe Mutnovsky geothermal power plant. At the end of 2005 installed capacity for direct use amounted to more than 307&amp;nbsp;MWt.&lt;ref name=wec470&gt;WEC (2007), pp. 470-471&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peat====
Principal peat deposits are located in the north-western parts of Russia, in West Siberia, near the western coast of Kamchatka and in several other far-eastern regions. The Siberian peatlands account for nearly 75% of Russia's total reserves of 186&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes, second only to Canada’s. Approximately 5% of exploitable peat (1.5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes per annum) is used for fuel production. Although peat was used as industrial fuel for power generation in Russia for a long period, its share has been in long-term decline, and since 1980 has amounted to less than 1%.&lt;ref name=wec331&gt;WEC (2007), p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar energy====
It has been estimated that Russia's gross potential for solar energy is 2.3&amp;nbsp;trillion tce. The regions with the best solar radiation potential are the North Caucasus, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea areas, and southern parts of Siberia and the Far East. This potential is largely unused, although the possibilities for off-grid solar energy or hybrid applications in remote areas are huge. However, the construction of a single solar power plant Kislovodskaya SPP (1.5&amp;nbsp;MW) has been delayed.&lt;ref name=wec420&gt;WEC (2007), p.420&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind energy====
Russia has high quality wind resources on the Pacific and Arctic coasts and in vast steppe and mountain areas. Large-scale wind energy systems are suitable in [[Siberia]] and the Far East (east of [[Sakhalin Island]], the south of [[Kamchatka]], the [[Chukotka Peninsula]], [[Vladivostok]]), the steppes along the Volga river, the northern Caucasus steppes and mountains and on the Kola Peninsula, where power infrastructure and major industrial consumers are in place. At the end of 2006, total installed wind capacity was 15&amp;nbsp;MW. Major wind power stations operate at Kalmytskaya (2&amp;nbsp;MW), Zapolyarnaya (1.5&amp;nbsp;MW), Kulikovskaya (5.1&amp;nbsp;MW), Tyupkildi (2.2&amp;nbsp;MW) and Observation Cape (2.5&amp;nbsp;MW). Feasibility studies are being carried out on the Kaliningradskaya (50&amp;nbsp;MW) and the Leningradskaya (75&amp;nbsp;MW) wind farms. There are about 100&amp;nbsp;MW of wind projects in [[Kalmykia]] and in [[Krasnodar Krai]].&lt;ref name=wec515&gt;WEC (2007), pp. 515-516&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tidal energy====
A small pilot tidal power plant with a capacity of 400&amp;nbsp;kW was constructed at [[Kislaya Guba Tidal Power Station|Kislaya Guba]] near [[Murmansk]] in 1968. In 2007, Gidro OGK, a subsidiary of the Unified Energy System (UES) began the installation of a 1.5&amp;nbsp;MW experimental orthogonal turbine at Kislaya Guba. If it proves successful, UES plans to continue with [[Mezen Bay]] (15,000&amp;nbsp;MW) and [[Tugur Bay]] (7,980&amp;nbsp;MW) projects.&lt;ref name=wec538&gt;WEC (2007), pp.538-539&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity sector==
{{See also|Electricity sector in Russia}}
[[File:Russia electricity production by source pie.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Russia's electricity production by source in 2007]]
Russia is the world's fourth largest electricity producer after the United States, China, and [[Japan]]. 
In 2005, Russia produced 951&amp;nbsp;TWh and exported 23&amp;nbsp;TWh of electricity.&lt;ref name=iea27&gt;IEA (2007), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roughly 63% of Russia's electricity is generated by thermal plants, 21% by [[hydroelectricity|hydropower]] and 16% comes from [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear reactor]]s.&lt;ref name="Russia: Energy overview"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4699942.stm Russia: Energy overview], by BBC News 13 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Russia exports electricity to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], China, [[Poland]], Turkey and [[Finland]].

'''Engineering bricks''' are a type of [[brick]] used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed. Engineering bricks can be used for [[Damp proofing|damp-proof course]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Clay engineering bricks are defined in ''§ 6.4.51'' of ''British Standard BS ISO 6707-1;2014 (buildings &amp; civil engineering works - vocabulary - general terms)'' as "fire-clay brick that has a dense and strong semi-vitreous body and which conforms to defined limits for water absorption and compressive strength"&lt;ref&gt;https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030257212&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stronger and less porous engineering bricks (UK Class A) are usually blue due to the higher firing temperature&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/brick&lt;/ref&gt; whilst class B bricks are usually red. Class A bricks have a strength of 125 N/mm² and water absorption of less than 4.5%; Class B bricks have a strength greater than 75 N/mm² and water absorption of less than 7%.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12958">'''Environmental issues in Africa''' are caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] effects on the [[Africa]]n [[natural environment]] and have major impacts on [[humans]] and nearly all forms of [[endemism|endemic life]]. Issues include [[desertification]], problems with access to safe [[water supply]], [[population explosion]] and [[fauna depletion]]. These issues are ultimately linked to [[over-population]] in Africa, as well as on a global scale. Nearly all of Africa's [[environmental problems]] are [[geography|geographically]] variable and human induced, though not necessarily by Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5194/acp-8-2267-2008 |title=The influence of European pollution on ozone in the Near East and northern Africa |journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=2267–83 |year=2008 |last1=Duncan |first1=B. N |last2=West |first2=J. J |last3=Yoshida |first3=Y |last4=Fiore |first4=A. M |last5=Ziemke |first5=J. R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deforestation==
{{main article|Deforestation in Africa}}

The large scale falling of trees and the resulting decreases in forest areas are the main environmental issues of the African Continent. Rampant clearing of forests and [[land conversion]] goes on for agriculture, settlement and [[fuel]] needs. Ninety percent of Africa's population requires wood to use as fuel for heating and cooking. As a result, forested areas are decreasing daily, as for example, in the region of equatorial evergreen forests. ''Africa's desertification rate is twice that of the world's.''{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The rate of illegal logging, which is another main cause of [[deforestation]], varies from country to country, such as 50% in [[Cameroon]] and 80% in [[Liberia]]. In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], deforestation is primarily caused by the needs of the [[poverty|poor]] citizens, along with [[illegal logging|unsupervised logging]] and [[illegal mining|mining]].
In Ethiopia, the main cause is the country's growing population, which induces an increase in agriculture, livestock production, and fuel wood. [[Low education]] and little government intervention also contributes to deforestation. [[Madagascar]]'s forest loss is partially caused by citizens using [[slash-and-burn]] techniques after independence from the French.
[[Nigeria]] has the highest rate of deforestation of primary forests, according to the [[gfy]]. Deforestation in Nigeria is caused by logging, [[subsistence agriculture]], and the collection of wood for fuel. 
According to the gfy, deforestation has wiped out nearly 90% of Africa's forest. [[West Africa]] only has 22.8% of its moist forests left, and 81% of Nigeria's old-growth forests disappeared within 15 years. Deforestation also lowers the chance of rainfall; [[Ethiopia]] has experienced [[famine]] and [[drought]]s because of this. 98% of Ethiopia's forests have disappeared over the last 50 years.
Within 43 years, [[Kenya]]'s forest coverage decreased from about 10% to 1.7%. [[Deforestation in Madagascar]] has also led to desertification, [[soil loss]], and water source degradation, resulting in the country's inability to provide necessary resources for its growing population. In the last five years, Nigeria lost nearly half of its primary forests.

Ethiopia's government, along with organizations like [[Farm Africa]], is starting to take steps to stop [[Deforestation by region|excessive deforestation]].

[[Deforestation]] is an issue, and forests are important in Africa, as populations have relied heavily on them to provide basic needs. Woods are used for shelter, clothing, agricultural elements, and much more. Woodland supplies are also used to create medicines and a wide variety of food. Some of these foods include fruits, nuts, honey, and much more. Wood is crucial for economic gain in Africa, especially in developing countries. Forests also help the environment. It is estimated that the green belt of Africa contains over 1.5 million species. Without the forest habitat to protect the species, the populations are at risk. The livelihoods of millions of people and species are at risk with deforestation. The act is a domino effect that affects multiple aspects of a community, ecosystem, and economy.&lt;ref&gt;Hillstrom &amp; Hillstrom The Worlds environments. a continental overview of environmental issues 2003 pg. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil degradation==
The [[erosion]] caused by rains, rivers and winds as well as over-utilization of soils for agriculture and low use of [[manure]]s have resulted in turning the [[soil fertility|soils infertile]], as for example, in the plains of the [[Nile]] and the [[Orange River]]. A main cause of [[soil degradation]] is lack of manufactured [[fertilizer]]s being used, since African soil lacks organic sources of nutrients.  The increase in population has also contributed when people need to crop, as a source of income, but do not take measures to [[soil protection|protect the soil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFA : International Fertilizer Industry Association - Soil Degradation in Africa IFA|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/HomePage/SUSTAINABILITY/Soil-degradation-in-Africa|work=fertilizer.org |publisher=IFA|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  due to low income.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Land and Environmental Degradation and Desertification in Africa|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5318E/x5318e02.htm|work=Land and Environmental Degradation and Desertification in Africa|publisher=FAO|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current methods create too much pressure on other environmental aspects, such as forests, and are not sustainable.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=IFA : International Fertilizer Industry Association - Soil Degradation in Africa / SUSTAINABILITY / HomePage / IFA|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/HomePage/SUSTAINABILITY/Soil-degradation-in-Africa|work=fertilizer.org |publisher=IFA|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also ecological causes of the poor soil quality. Much of the soil has rocks or clay from volcanic activity. Other causes include erosion, desertification, and deforestation.

Degradation of African soil causes decreased [[food production]], damaging ecological effects, and an overall decrease in the [[quality of living]] in Africa.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This issue would lessen if fertilizers and other cropping supplies were more affordable and thus used more.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The United Nations has commissioned a Global Assessment of Human Induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) to further investigate the causes and state of the soil.  Access to information collected is freely available, and it is hoped that awareness will be raised among politicians in threatened areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil Degradation|url=http://www.goodplanet.info/eng/Pollution/Soils/Soil-degradation|publisher=Goodplanet.info|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution==
The air in Africa is greatly [[air pollution|polluted]] due to multiple reasons stated below. The primitive method of farming that takes place in most areas in Africa is certainly a causal factor. The [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that 11.3 million hectares of land are being lost annually to agriculture, [[grazing]], uncontrolled burning and fuelwood consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Lanly, J.P. (1982) ''Tropical Forest Resources''. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Rome, Italy: United Nations. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/an778e/an778e00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Combustion of wood and [[charcoal]] are used for cooking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.eg.10.110185.002203 |title=Fuelwood and Charcoal Use in Developing Countries |journal=Annual Review of Energy |volume=10 |pages=407–29 |year=1985 |last1=Wood |first1=T S |last2=Baldwin |first2=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this results to a release of [[carbon dioxide]] into the atmosphere, which is a toxic pollutant in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2007GL031101 |title=On the causal link between carbon dioxide and air pollution mortality |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=L03809 |year=2008 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |bibcode=2008GeoRL..35.3809J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, due to the poor supply of power, most homes have to rely on fuel and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] in [[Engine-generator|generator]]s to keep their electricity running.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;World Health Organization (2013). Regional burden of disease due to indoor air pollution. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/burden_regional/en/&lt;/ref&gt; 
Air pollution in Africa is coming to the forefront and must not be ignored. For example, in South Africa the mercury levels are severe due to coal combustion and gold mining. Mercury is absorbed from the air into the soil and water. The soil allows the crops to absorb the mercury, which humans ingest. Animals eat the grass which has absorbed the mercury and again humans may ingest these animals. Fish absorb the mercury from the water, humans also ingest the fish and drink the water that have absorbed the mercury. This increases the mercury levels in humans. This can cause serious health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gexplo.2013.08.010 |title=The impact of post gold mining on mercury pollution in the West Rand region, Gauteng, South Africa |journal=Journal of Geochemical Exploration |volume=134 |pages=111–9 |year=2013 |last1=Lusilao-Makiese |first1=J.G |last2=Cukrowska |first2=E.M |last3=Tessier |first3=E |last4=Amouroux |first4=D |last5=Weiersbye |first5=I }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/B917452D |pmid=20145889 |title=Elevated mercury exposure in communities living alongside the Inanda Dam, South Africa |journal=J.

The [[World Health Organization]] reports of the need to intervene when more than one third of the total Disability Adjusted Life Years&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2013). Mental Health - DALYs/YLDs definition. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/mental_health/management/depression/daly/en/&lt;/ref&gt; was lost as a result of exposure to indoor air pollution in Africa.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Fuel is needed to power lights at night. The fuel being burned causes great emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Because of the increased [[Urbanization in Africa]], people are burning more and more fuel and using more vehicles for [[transportation]]. The rise in [[vehicle emissions]] and the trend towards greater [[industrialization]] means the urban [[air quality]] in the continent is worsening. In many countries, the use of [[leaded gasoline]] is still widespread, and vehicle emission controls are nonexistent. [[Indoor air pollution]] is widespread, mostly from the burning of coal in the kitchen for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Quality in Africa|url=http://www.epa.gov/international/air/africa.htm|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds released from fuel stations and nitrogen and hydrocarbon released from airports cause air pollution.  Carbon dioxide other greenhouse gases in the air causes an increase of people with respiratory issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scorgie|first=Yvanne|title=Air Quality and Regulation|url=http://www.naca.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74:air-quality-and-regulation&amp;catid=37:the-air-quality-act-aqa&amp;Itemid=56|publisher=NACA|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common relationship between air pollution and population. Africa widely diverse between areas that are over populated versus areas that are scarcely populated. In regions where there is little industrial development and few people, air quality is high. Vice versa, in densely populated and industrialized regions the air quality is low. Addressing the air pollution in big cities is often a big priority, even though the continent as a whole produces little air pollutants by international standards. Even so, air pollutants are causing a variety of health and environmental problems. These pollutants are a threat to the population of Africa and the environment they try so hard to sustain.&lt;ref&gt;Hillstrom &amp; Hillstrom The Worlds environments. a continental overview of environmental issues 2003 pg. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

The X-ray diffractogram of this material would resemble that of graphite, in that the 002 peak would still appear at ~26&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 2 theta. However, the peak would appear considerably smaller and broader. These features indicate that the interplanar distance in exfoliated graphite is similar to that of the parent graphite, but the stack size (of graphene layers) is small. Since xGnP is composed of the same material as [[carbon nanotubes]], it shares many of the electrochemical characteristics, although not the tensile strength. The platelet shape, however, offers xGnP edges that are easier to modify chemically for enhanced dispersion in polymers.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

Composite materials made with [[polymers]], like [[plastics]], [[nylon]], or [[rubber]], can be made electrically or thermally conductive with the addition of small amounts of xGnP. These nanoparticles can change the fundamental properties of plastics, enabling them to perform more like metals with metallic properties. These new nanoparticles also improve barrier properties, modulus, and surface toughness when used in composites.

==Properties==
[[Graphene]] is extremely electrically conductive material. In turn, xGnP has a percolation threshold for conductivity of 1.9 wt% in thermoplastic matrix.{{fact|date=April 2016}} At densities of 2–5 wt%, conductivity reaches sufficient levels to provide electromagnetic shielding. xGnP can also be combined with glass fibers or other matrix materials to provide sufficient conductivity for electrostatic painting or other applications requiring electrical conductivity.

xGnP significantly outperforms most other forms of carbon in terms of thermal conductivity when used at densities of 20 wt% in control resins. At these densities, xGnP also confers significant electrical conductivity as well as improved mechanical properties to most thermoplastic, thermoset, or elastomeric systems. At lesser densities, xGnP adds thermal stability to a variety of matrix materials.

As opposed to materials like [[carbon black]], xGnP improves mechanical properties of most composites, particularly stiffness and tensile strength. Elastomeric compounds have been shown to experience increased life and reduced surface wear when reinforced with xGnP.

Because of the platelet shape, xGnP significantly improves the impermeability of composites when used at densities of ~3 wt% or greater. xGnP particles can be aligned using electric field, although alignment is not necessary for use in most extrusion systems. Because xGnP also imparts electrical conductivity at these densities, the resulting composites offer attractive cost savings for applications like fuel lines or fuel tank linings.

==Reactions==
Treatment of ferrocyanide with ferric-containing salts gives the intensely coloured pigment [[Prussian blue]] &lt;ref name=Holl/&gt; (sometimes called [[ferric]] ferrocyanide and [[ferrous]] ferricyanide).

Ferrocyanide may undergo oxidation, resulting in [[ferricyanide]]:
:[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
This conversion can be followed [[UV/VIS spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] at 420&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], since ferrocyanide has negligible absorption while ferricyanide has an [[Molar absorptivity|extinction coefficient]] of 1040&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Appleby |first1=C.

===Research===
Ferrocyanide and its oxidized product ferricyanide cannot freely pass through the [[plasma membrane]]. For this reason ferrocyanide has been used as a probe of extracellular electron receptor in the study of [[redox reaction]]s in [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Ferricyanide is used thus any increase in ferrocyanide can be attributed to secretions of reductants or transplasma membrane electron transport activity.

It has been studied as an electrolyte in [[flow battery|flow batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Holy Grail of energy policy in sight as battery technology smashes the old order (telegraph.co.uk) |https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/10/holy-grail-of-energy-policy-in-sight-as-battery-technology-smash/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Developing Organic Flow Batteries for Energy Storage (arpa-e.gov)  http://arpa-e.energy.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/HarvardFlowBattery_OPEN2012_ExternalProjectImpactSheet_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
According to the recommendations of [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]], ferrocyanide should be called "hexacyanoferrate(II)". Cyanides as a chemical class were named because they were discovered in ferrocyanide. Ferrocyanide in turn was named in Latin to mean "blue substance with iron." The dye [[Prussian blue]] had been first made in the early 18th century. The word "cyanide" used in the name is from κύανος ''kyanos'', Greek for "(dark) blue."

Green waste, also known as "biological waste," is any [[Organic matter|organic]] waste that can be [[Compost|composted]]. It is most usually composed of refuse from gardens such as grass clippings or leaves, and domestic or industrial kitchen wastes. Green waste does not include things such dried leaves, pine straw, or hay. Such materials are rich in [[carbon]] and considered "[[Brown waste|brown wastes]]," while green wastes contain high in concentrations of [[nitrogen]]. Green waste can be used to increase the efficiency of many composting operations and can be added to soil to sustain local [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling.]]  

== Collection of Green waste ==
Green waste can be collected via [[municipal]] [[curbside collection]] schemes or through private [[waste management]] businesses. Many communities, especially in the United Kingdom, have initiated green waste [[Recycling in the United Kingdom|recycling and collection programs]] in order to decrease the amount of [[Biodegradable waste|biodegradable materials in landfills]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=I.D.|last2=Kelly|first2=J.|date=2003|title=Green waste collection and the public's recycling behaviour in the Borough of Wyre, England|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-3449(02)00106-4|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=38|issue=2|pages=139–159|doi=10.1016/s0921-3449(02)00106-4|issn=0921-3449|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Communities are provided with, or can provide their own, compost receptacles that they fill with plant and food remains, which are then emptied on a regular basis. Programs such as this allow communities to be an active part of composting their green waste which allows them to play an active role in decreasing the amount of food being dumped into local and [[Landfill|regional landfills]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 
[[File:Compost_bin_image.jpg|thumb|This is a bin filled with materials that comprise green waste, such as kitchen wastes and plant trimmings.]]

== Uses ==
Green waste can be used to improve the quality and sustainability of industrially [[Topsoil|manufactured topsoils]] and the sanitariness and efficiency of [[Sewage treatment|sewage disposal]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belyaeva|first=O.N.|last2=Haynes|first2=R.J.|date=2009|title=Chemical, microbial and physical properties of manufactured soils produced by co-composting municipal green waste with coal fly ash|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.032|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=100|issue=21|pages=5203–5209|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.032|issn=0960-8524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouraiphy|first=Abdelmajid|last2=Amir|first2=Soumia|last3=El Gharous|first3=Mohamed|last4=Revel|first4=Jean-Claude|last5=Hafidi|first5=Mohamed|date=2005|title=Chemical and spectroscopic analysis of organic matter transformation during composting of sewage sludge and green plant waste|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2005.06.002|journal=International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation|volume=56|issue=2|pages=101–108|doi=10.1016/j.ibiod.2005.06.002|issn=0964-8305}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sewage treatment|.]]

=== Manufactured Topsoils ===
Green waste is an integral part of many [[Topsoil|manufactured topsoils]], as it provides both nutrients for growing plants and increases the volume of manufactured topsoils&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Its woody components do not decompose quickly, so they provide the bulk that is necessary for supplementary topsoils&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Mixing industrial wastes such as [[fly ash]] or [[coal dust]] with green waste to create artificial topsoil not only facilitates the [[repurposing]] of industrial debris and keeps it out of landfills, but it also allows the nutrients in green waste materials to be cycled back into the environment. By utilizing fly ash in conjunction with green waste, manufactured soils are able to increase their water holding capacity while simultaneously recycling refuse materials that might otherwise take up space in a landfill&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This allows fly ash and green waste to increase local soil nutrient levels and promotes natural nutrient cycling processes.

=== Sewage Disposal ===
Green waste can also be mixed with [[Sewage|sewage wastes]] and composted, providing a safe, environmentally sustainable option for sewage disposal&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Co-composting green and sewage wastes eliminates the risk that [[Pathogen|pathogens]] and [[Pollutant|pollutants]] contained in sewage wastes might pose to the environment&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Utilization of green waste to dispose of sewage wastes not only decreases the amount of sewage [[Incineration|incinerated]] and dumped each year, it also facilitates the cycling of organic wastes back into the environment. The co-composted remains of these organic wastes can be safely employed for use in [[agriculture]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This process decreases the amount of trash being dumped into landfills and other trash repositories and allows for the complete [[Nutrient cycle|cycling of organic nutrients]] through the environment.

=== Renewable Energy ===
[[Image:Veg waste Hyd Market.jpg|thumb|right|Vegetable waste being dumped in a market in [[Hyderabad, India]].]]

[[Biogas]] captured from biodegradable green waste can be used as [[biofuel]]. Green waste can be composed of [[non-food crop|non-food crops]], which decompose to produce [[cellulosic ethanol]]. It can also help reduce the necessity of petroleum gases, which produce large amounts of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]], when burned.

=== Soil Health ===
Green waste composting has also been linked to suppression of soil borne diseases such as [[damping off]] and [[Root rot|root rots]] that affect large agricultural ventures like [[Greenhouse|greenhouses]] and [[Farm|large-scale farms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble|first=R.|last2=Coventry|first2=E.|date=2005|title=Suppression of soil-borne plant diseases with composts: A review|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09583150400015904|journal=Biocontrol Science and Technology|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.1080/09583150400015904|issn=0958-3157}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This disease suppressive quality has positive implications for lesser-developed nations that do not have the technology or resources to purchase expensive [[Fertilizer|fertilizers]].

Addition of  composts which contain residues and particles of [[heavy metals]] to soil can raise the soil's heavy metal content and increase the probability of these metals to transfer into crop plants&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SMITH|first=S|date= 2009|title=A critical review of the bioavailability and impacts of heavy metals in municipal solid waste composts compared to sewage sludge|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2008.06.009|journal=Environment International|volume=35|issue=1|pages=142–156|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2008.06.009|issn=0160-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When biological, or green waste is added to these soil samples, plant uptake of heavy metal has been shown to decrease crop uptake of metals compared to other types of compost composed of things such as sewage sludge&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. This can protect consumers and the environment from [[biomagnification]] caused by long-term [[Accumulation zone|accumulation]] of heavy metal particles within the soil and plant life of an area&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

A '''heavy liquid''' is a [[solution]] or [[liquid]] [[chemical substance]] with a high [[density]] and a relatively low [[viscosity]]. Heavy liquids are often used for determination of density in mineralogy, for [[density gradient centrifugation]] and for [[separating mixtures]].

== Uses ==

Common applications of heavy liquids include:
* [[Density gradient centrifugation]]
* [[Separating mixtures]] and sink/swim analysis
* [[Flotation process]]
* Determination of [[density]]

== Toxicity ==

The classical heavy liquids like [[Tetrabromoethane|1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane]] (''Muthmanns solution''), [[potassium tetraiodomercurate(II)]] (''Thoulets solution''), [[bromoform]] or [[diiodomethane]] which are used in mineralogy are very toxic. These toxic chemicals are avoided today in consideration of the fact that there are alternative water based, non-toxic heavy liquids like [[sodium polytungstate]] solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan J, ''A non-toxic heavy liquid and inexpensive filters for separation of mineral grains'', in ''Journal of Sedimentary Petrology'', 57/1987, S.765-6&lt;/ref&gt; With this relatively new heavy liquid densities up to 3.1&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; can be adjusted . Adding parts of pulverulent [[Tungsten carbide]] increases the density to 4.6&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;CD Römpp Chemie Lexikon – Version 1.0: ''Schwerflüssigkeiten'', Georg Thieme Verlag, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Integrated computational materials engineering]] (ICME) involves the integration of experimental results, design models, simulations, and other computational data related to a variety of materials used in multiscale engineering and design. Central to the achievement of ICME goals has been the creation of a [[cyberinfrastructure]], a Web-based, collaborative platform which provides the ability to accumulate, organize and disseminate knowledge pertaining to [[Materials science|materials science and engineering]] to facilitate this information being broadly utilized, enhanced, and expanded.

The '''ICME cyberinfrastructure''' provides storage, access, and computational capabilities for an extensive network of manufacturing, design, and life-cycle simulation software.&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/380113187413k353/ John Allison, Dan Backman and Leo Christodoulou, ''Integrated computational materials engineering: A new paradigm for the global materials profession'', JOM Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Volume 58, Number 11, 25-27 (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Within this software framework, data is archived, searchable and interactive, offering engineers and scientists a vast database of materials-related information for use in research, [[multiscale modeling]], simulation implementation, and an array of other activities in support of more efficient, less costly product development. Furthermore, the ICME cyberinfrastructure is expected to provide the capability to access and link application codes, including the development of protocols necessary to integrate hierarchical modeling approaches. With an emphasis on computational efficiency, experimental validation of models, and protecting intellectual property, the cyberinfrastructure assimilates 1) process-microstructure-property relations, 2) development of constitutive materials models that accurately predict multiscale material behaviors admitting microstructure/inclusions and history effects, 3) access to shared databases of analytical and experimental data, and 4) material models. As such, it is also crucial to identifying gaps in materials knowledge, which, in turn, guides the development of new materials theories, models, and simulation tools. Such a community-based knowledge foundation ultimately enables materials informatics systems that fuse high fidelity experimental databases with models of physical processes.

In addition, the vision of the ICME cyberinfrastructure is compatible with the [[National Science Foundation]]'s (NSF) ''Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery'', which advocates development and deployment of human-centered [[information technology]] (IT) systems that address the needs of science and engineering communities and open new opportunities for enhancing education and workforce development programs. According to the NSF directive, IT systems, such as the ICME cyberinfrastructure, should provide access to tools, services, and other networked resources, including high-performance computing facilities, data repositories, and libraries of computational tools, enabling and reliably supporting secure and efficient nationwide or global [[Virtual organization (grid computing)|virtual organizations]] spanning across administrative boundaries.&lt;ref name="nsf"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf0728/index.jsp National Science Foundation: ''Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery,'' NSF 07-28 (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

The National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB) of  the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) committee proposed the following definition for the term ICME cyberinfrastructure:

''"The Internet-based collaborative materials science and engineering research and development environments that support advanced data acquisition, data and model storage, data and model management, data and model mining, data and model visualization, and other computing and information processing services required to develop an integrated computational materials engineering capability."''&lt;ref name="NAE"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12199 ICME National Academy Report: ''Integrated Computational Materials Engineering: A Transformational Discipline for Improved Competitiveness and National Security'', The National Academy Press (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NMAB's vision, the building blocks of the ICME cyberinfrastructure are the individual web sites ([[Web portal|Web Portals]]) which offer access to information, data, and tools, each established for specific purposes by different organizations. Linked together, these "constituent" Web Portals will form the ICME cyberinfrastructure, or ICME "Supply-Chain," i.e., a series of well-established, capable and viable organizations.&lt;ref name="tms2011"&gt;David Furrer, ''The Development of the ICME Supply-Chain: Route to ICME Implementation and Sustainment'' at  ICME: Overcoming Barriers and Streamlining the Transition of Advanced Technologies to Engineering Practice -- The 12th MPMD Global Innovations Symposium: Plenary Session and the Integration of ICME at the 2011 Annual Meeting &amp; Exhibition ([http://www.tms.org/meetings/annual-11/AM11home.aspx TMS 2011 home page])&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations are to provide necessary portions of the ICME cyberinfrastructure's value chain:
* Fundamental model development
* Model integration into software packages
* Maintenance of software tools
* Database generation
* Application engineering
* Customer approval and certification

For example, Mississippi State University has created an [https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page ICME cyberinfrastructure] where different models, codes, and experimental structure-property data are available and discussed. Researchers are encouraged to upload their own models, codes, and experimental data with associated references for others to use.

      <comment>The post-1906 Wright engines were not exhaust over inlet; they were overhead-valve engines, since both inlet and exhaust valves were in the head. (It's the inlet valve location, not whether it is suction-operated, that makes an engine EOI or IOE.) The citation does not back up the EOI claim for the Wright engines. The Ford Quadricycle does seem to have an EOI engine.</comment>

[[File:Inlet over exhaust.JPG|thumb|Yale IOE engine from 1911]]
The '''intake/inlet over exhaust''', or "IOE" engine, known in the US as '''F-head''', is a [[four-stroke cycle|four-stroke]] [[internal combustion engine]] whose [[valvetrain]] comprises [[overhead valve|OHV]] inlet [[poppet valve|valves]] within the cylinder head and  exhaust [[Flathead engine|side-valves]] within the engine block.

IOE engines were widely used in early [[motorcycle]]s, initially with the inlet valve being operated by engine suction instead of a cam-activated valvetrain. When the suction-operated inlet valves reached their limits as engine speeds increased, the manufacturers modified the designs by adding a mechanical valvetrain for the inlet valve. A few automobile manufacturers, including [[Willys]], [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Humber Limited|Humber]] also made IOE engines for both cars and military vehicles. [[Rover Company|Rover]] manufactured line four and six cylinder engines with a particularly efficient version of the IOE induction system.

A few designs with the reverse system, exhaust over inlet (EOI), have been manufactured, such as the [[Ford Quadricycle]] of 1896.

==Description==
In a F-head/IOE engine, the [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] and its valves are located in the [[cylinder head]] above the cylinders, and are operated by rocker arms which reverse the motion of the [[Overhead valve engine|pushrods]] so that the intake valves open downward into the combustion chamber. The exhaust manifold and its valves are located beside or as part of the cylinders, in the block.&lt;ref name="VehicleTech48" /&gt; The exhaust valves are either roughly or exactly parallel with the pistons; their faces point upwards and they are not operated by separate pushrods, but by contact with a camshaft through the tappet or valve lifter and an integrated valve stem/pushrod.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The valves were offset to one side, forming what seemed to be a pocket, leading to the term "pocket valve" being used for IOE engines.&lt;ref name="Girdler2_09single"&gt;{{cite book| last1       = Girdler| first1      = Allan| first2 = Ron | last2 = Hussey| others        = Photographs by Ron Hussey| title         = Harley-Davidson: The American Motorcycle| series    = Motorbooks Classic| year      = 2003| publisher = MotorBooks International| location  = | isbn      = 978-0-7603-1651-1| pages      = 13&amp;ndash;16| chapter   = Chapter 1: 1909 Model 5 - The One That Worked| quote         = The exhaust valve was below the intake valve, so the design was called intake over exhaust, or IOE. The valves were off to one side of the cylinder bore, so the same design was called the pocket valve.  In a poetic way, the valvetrain forms sort of an F shape, especially later with a pushrod and rocker arm, so the system has been known as the F head. | lastauthoramp = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An F-head engine combines features from both [[Overhead valve engine|overhead-valve]] and [[flathead engine|flathead]] type engines, the inlet valve operating via pushrod and rocker arm and opening downward like an overhead valve engine, while the exhaust valve is offset from the cylinder and opens upward via an integrated pushrod/valve stem directly actuated by the camshaft, much like the valves in a flathead engine.

==Origin==
The earliest IOE layouts used atmospheric inlet valves which were held closed with a weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the [[Stroke (engine)|inlet stroke]].&lt;ref name="UltiMotoGlossary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Hugo|authorlink=|others=Photography by Dave King|title=The Ultimate Motorcycle Book|year=1993|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|language=|isbn=0-7513-0043-8|page=188|chapter=Glossary|quote='''IOE''' Inlet over exhaust. Valve layout in which the inlet valve is placed directly over the (side) exhaust valve. Common on early engines, a development of atmospheric valve engines.|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This worked well with low-speed early engines and had the benefit of being very simple and cheap, but the weak spring was unable to close the valve fast enough as the RPM's of engines increased, necessitating stronger springs, which in turn needed direct mechanical action to open, as the atmospheric pressure of 15psi limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential, meaning that a 15-lb spring is the strongest that can be used (for practical purposes, it would have to be lighter still). When the limits of this system were reached, the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the inlet valves and stronger springs to close them.&lt;ref name="Girdler1_09V2"&gt;{{cite book| last1       = Girdler| first1      = Allan| first2 = Ron | last2 = Hussey| others        = Photographs by Ron Hussey| title         = Harley-Davidson: The American Motorcycle| series    = Motorbooks Classic| year      = 2003| publisher = MotorBooks International| location  = | isbn      = 978-0-7603-1651-1| page      = 29| chapter   = Chapter 2: 1909 Model 5D - The First V-Twin| quote         = In 1911 the V-twin went back into production, same general idea except that this time it came with a belt tensioner and with proper cam lobes and rockers and springs for the intake valves. | lastauthoramp = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the exhaust valves were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or valve lifter and closed by springs.&lt;ref name="UltiMotoGlossary" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The IOE design allows the use of larger valves than a [[Flathead engine|sidevalve]] (or L-head) or [[overhead valve]] engine.&lt;ref name="VehicleTech48"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nunney |first1=M. J. |title= Light and Heavy Vehicle Technology |url=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=xLxySLNAe3YC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |format= |accessdate=2013-01-09 |type= |edition=Fourth|series= |volume= |year=2007 |origyear=1988 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-7506-8037-0 |page=48 |chapter=1 The reciprocating piston petrol engine |chapterurl=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=xLxySLNAe3YC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote=The main advantage of this type of layout was that larger inlet valves could be used, but being heavier they also placed limitations on maximum allowable engine speed. |ref=VehicleTech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its advantages over the sidevalve/flathead also include a compact combustion chamber, a well-located spark plug, and a cooling effect from the mixture swirl,&lt;ref name="Judge108" /&gt; along with better intake mixture flow.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. Disadvantages include a combustion chamber of more complex shape than that of an overhead valve engine, which affects combustion rates and can create hot spots in the piston head, and inferior valve location, which hinders efficient scavenging. Due to the added complications of rocker arms and pushrods, it is also more complex and expensive to make than a sidevalve engine, as well as being physically larger due to the rocker arms being placed over the cylinder head, and it requires an inlet valve and ports in the cylinder head, while the cylinder of a sidevalve engine is simply a closed-end cylinder.

[[Rover (marque)|Rover]] used a more advanced form of IOE engine. It was designed by Jack Swain in the mid-late 1940s and was in production from 1948 to the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=P4Bobbitt&gt;{{cite book |last=Bobbit |first=Malcolm |title=Rover P4 |url=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=1sR68p5zDdsC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2013-01-02 |date=2002-11-11 |origyear=1994|publisher=Veloce Publishing |location=Dorchester, UK |isbn=978-1-903706-57-2 |pages=23, 41&amp;ndash;42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the conventional F-head IOE, this had an efficient combustion chamber designed for good combustion, rather than simple manufacture.&lt;ref name="Ricardo, High-Speed Internal Combustion Engine, 4th ed., Rover IOE" &gt;{{cite book  |last=Ricardo  |first=Harry R., Sir  |authorlink=Harry Ricardo  |title=The High-Speed Internal Combustion Engine  |year=1953  |edition=4th  |publisher=Blackie  |location=Glasgow  |ref=Ricardo, High-Speed Internal Combustion Engine, 4th ed.  |pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top surface of the block was machined at an angle, with the piston crowns angled in a "pitched roof" to match.

The unusual combustion chamber arrangement with its angled valves also led to an unusual valve train. The block-mounted camshaft operates small wedge shaped rockers, one for each valve. In early models the camshaft acts on a simple pad on the rocker, but for later models this pad was replaced by a roller follower. The exhaust rockers act directly on the valves, whilst the inlet rockers act on pushrods running up to a second set of longer flat rockers operating the inlet valves. The Rover engine, like many 1940s and earlier British designs, was a small bore, long stroke ([[Stroke ratio#Undersquare or long-stroke engine|undersquare]]) engine to keep the [[tax horsepower|RAC]] tax horsepower rating as low as possible, thus keeping the road tax as low as possible.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The IOE layout enabled Rover to use larger valves than would normally be possible in a small bore engine, allowing better breathing and better performance.&lt;ref name="Judge108" /&gt;

The Rover IOE engine family encompassed [[Inline-four engine|straight-4]] (1.6- and 2.0-litres) and [[Straight-six engine|straight-6]] (2.1-, 2.2-, 2.3-, 2.4-, 2.6- and 3.0-litres) engines and powered much of the company's post-war range in the form of the [[Rover P3|P3]], [[Rover P4|P4]] and [[Rover P5|P5]] models. Adapted versions of the 1.6 and 2.0 IOE engines were used in early version of the Land Rover as well. Power outputs ranged from 50bhp (Land Rover 1.6) to 134bhp ([[Rover P5|P5]] 3 litre MkII &amp; III). The 2.6 6-cylinder IOE engine had a particularly long career. After being used in Rover [[Rover P4|P4]] saloon cars it was added to long-wheelbase Land Rover models from 1963 in the 2A Forward Control models, then in 1967 in the bonneted 109",&lt;ref name="Taylor, Specification Guide II and IIa, Land Rover" &gt;{{cite book  |title=Land Rover Series II and IIa Specification Guide  |last=Taylor  |first=James  |authorlink= |publisher=The Crowood Press  |location=Ramsbury, Wiltshire  |year=2010  |isbn=978-1-84797-160-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained an optional fitment until 1980 when it was replaced by the [[Rover V8]].

===Similar Packard cylinder head===
The shape of the combustion chamber as an "inverted hemi-head", along with the angled cylinder head joint and pitched-roof piston crowns, had earlier been used in the 1930 [[C. W. Van Ranst|Van Ranst]]-designed [[Packard]] V12 engine, although in this case the valves were both in the block as side valves and the [[spark plug]] was poorly placed at the extremity of the combustion chamber.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, V12 Engine, Packard" &gt;{{cite book  |title=The V12 Engine  |last=Ludvigsen  |first=Karl  |authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen  |publisher=Haynes Publishing  |location=Sparkford, Yeovil  |year=2005  |isbn=1-84425-004-0  |ref=Ludvigsen, V12 Engine  |pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe in the same period Humber Limited of Coventry, England produced a full range of cars using IOE engines, these were however phased out at the end of the 1920s in favour of models using cheaper L head engines shared with [[Hillman]]

A more advanced shorter stroke passenger car development the FB60 engine, a straight-six IOE engine displacing 3909cc and producing a claimed 175&amp;nbsp;, was used by BMC  in the [[Vanden Plas Princess#Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre R|Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre R]] saloon car.&lt;ref name="AutocarTestNo1989"&gt;{{cite journal |date=28 August 1964|title=Autocar road test 1989 &amp;ndash; Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre R 3,909&amp;nbsp;c.c.|journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume= |series= |issue= |pages=406&amp;ndash;410 |location= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 6000 of these cars were made.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Exhaust over intake (EOI)==
Some engines have been made with the reverse configuration, having the exhaust valve in the cylinder head and the intake valve in the block. The [[ABC motorcycles#ABC Skootamota|ABC Skootamota]] began production with an engine of this configuration,&lt;ref name="EncycloMoto170"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Hugo|title=The Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle|year=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|isbn=0-7513-0206-6|page=170|chapter=The A-Z of Motorcycles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncycloMoto212"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Hugo|title=The Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle|year=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|language=|isbn=0-7513-0206-6|page=212|chapter=The Directory of Motorcycles}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was changed to an overhead valve engine before production ended.&lt;ref name="EncycloMoto170" /&gt;

In 1936 and 1937, the Indian Four had the valve positions reversed, with the exhaust valve in the head and the inlet valve in the block. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the engine was actually more powerful.  However, the new system made the cylinder head very hot.  The exhaust valve linkage required frequent adjustment. The design was returned to the original IOE configuration in 1938.&lt;ref name="HallFame36I4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmMoto199108Classic" /&gt;

{{Main|Ideonella sakaiensis}}
In 2016 [[Ideonella sakaiensis|''I. sakaiensis'']] was shown to degrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], a [[polymer]] widely used in food containers, bottles and synthetic fibers. Adhered to a low-grade PET film, the bacteria used two novel [[enzyme]]s to decompose the plastic into two environmentally benign substances, which served as their main food source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-species-of-bacteria-eats-plastic-1457636401|title=New Species of Bacteria Eats Plastic|last=Long|first=Kat|date=March 10, 2016|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colony of ''I. sakaiensis'' could completely degrade a low-grade plastic water bottle in six weeks. Higher-grade PET products would require heating and cooling to weaken it before bacteria could start eating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The bacteria could also be used to reduce industrial waste during plastics manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], an '''interface''' is the boundary between two spatial regions occupied by different matter, or by matter in different physical states. The interface between matter and air, or matter and vacuum, is called a '''surface''', and studied in [[surface science]]. In [[thermal equilibrium]], the regions in contact are called [[phase (matter)|phases]], and the interface is called a [[phase boundary]]. An example for an interface out of equilibrium is the [[grain boundary]] in polycrystalline matter.

The importance of the interface depends on the type of system: the bigger the quotient area/volume, the greater the effect the interface will have. Consequently, interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area-to-volume ratios, such as [[colloid]]s.

Interfaces can be flat or curved. For example, [[oil]] droplets  in a [[salad dressing]] are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat.

[[Surface tension]] is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids. For a liquid film on flat surfaces, the liquid-vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. For a liquid film on rough surfaces, the [[surface tension]] tends to keep the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] flat, while the [[disjoining pressure]] makes the film conformal to the substrate. The equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the [[capillary pressure]] and [[disjoining pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5037066 Han Hu, Christopher R. Weinberger, and Ying Sun ''[[Nano Lett.]]'', 14 (12), pp 7131–7137 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaces may cause various [[optical phenomena]], such as [[refraction]].  [[Lens (optics)|Optical lenses]] serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between [[glass]] and air.

One topical interface system is the gas-liquid interface between [[aerosols]] and other atmospheric molecules.

[[File:Jute Field Bangladesh (7749587518).jpg|thumb|A Jute field in Bangladesh.]]
[[File:Jute Rope (சணல் கயிறு).jpg|thumb|Jute rope]]

'''Jute''' is a long, soft, shiny [[Fiber crop|vegetable fiber]] that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is produced primarily from plants in the genus ''[[Corchorus]]'', which was once classified with the family [[Tiliaceae]], and more recently with [[Malvaceae]]. The primary source of the fiber is ''[[Corchorus olitorius]]'', but it is considered inferior to ''[[Corchorus capsularis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Corchorus+olitorius |title=Plants for a Future |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Jute" is the name of the plant or fiber that is used to make [[Hessian (cloth)|burlap, hessian or gunny]] cloth.

Jute is one of the most affordable [[natural fiber]]s in existence and it is second only to [[cotton]] in amount produced and variety of uses. Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. It falls into the [[bast fiber]] category (fiber collected from bast, the [[phloem]] of the plant, sometimes called the "skin") along with [[kenaf]], [[Hemp|industrial hemp]], [[flax]] ([[linen]]), [[ramie]], etc. The industrial term for jute fiber is ''raw jute''. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1–4 metres (3–13&amp;nbsp;feet) long. Jute is also called the ''golden fiber'' for its color and high cash value.

== Cultivation ==
{{Main article|Jute cultivation}}
[[File:Jute plant.gif|thumb|Jute plants (''Corchorus olitorius'' and ''Corchorus capsularis'')]]

Jute plant needs a plain [[alluvial]] soil and standing water. The suitable climate for growing jute (warm and wet) is offered by the [[monsoon]] climate, during the monsoon season. Temperatures from 20˚C to 40˚C and relative humidity of 70%–80% are favourable for successful cultivation. Jute requires 5–8&amp;nbsp;cm of rainfall weekly, and more during the sowing time.  Soft water is necessary for the jute production.

===White jute (''Corchorus capsularis'')===

Historical documents (including ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]'' by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazal]] in 1590) state that the poor villagers of [[India]] used to wear clothes made of jute. Simple handlooms and hand spinning wheels were used by the weavers, who used to spin cotton yarns as well. History also suggests that Indians, especially [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], used ropes and twines made of white jute from ancient times for household and other uses. It is highly functional in carrying grains or other agricultural products.

===Tossa jute (''Corchorus olitorius'')===
Tossa jute (''[[Corchorus olitorius]]'') is a variety thought to be native to [[South Asia]]. It is grown for both fiber and culinary purposes. The leaves are used as an ingredient in a [[Mucilage|mucilaginous]] [[Leaf vegetable|potherb]] called "[[molokhiya]]" ([[ملوخية]], of uncertain etymology). It is very popular in some [[Arabian]] countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]] as a soup-based dish, sometimes with meat over rice or [[lentil]]s. The [[Book of Job]] (chapter 30, verse 4), in the King James translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] מלוח ''MaLOo-aĤ'' "salty",&lt;ref&gt;The New Bantam-Megiddo Hebrew &amp; English Dictionary, Sivan and Levenston, Bantam books, NY, 1875&lt;/ref&gt; mentions this vegetable potherb as "mallow, giving rise to the term [[Jew]]'s Mallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiffolo|first=Anthony F|title=Cooking With the Bible: Biblical Food, Feasts, And Lore|date=30 August 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313334108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j74CAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA327&amp;lpg=RA1-PA327&amp;dq=jew's+mallow+jute+bible&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XOeHTGWozS&amp;sig=TL7Om6LTxGWmtJ_37cI1fhzO3vw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oRbZT8GWBOqK6QHHhOikAw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=jew's%20mallow%20jute%20bible&amp;f=false|author2=Rayner W.

On the other hand, it is used mainly for its fiber in [[Bangladesh]], in other countries in [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. Tossa jute fiber is softer, silkier, and stronger than white jute. This variety astonishingly shows good sustainability in the climate of the [[Ganges Delta]]. Along with white jute, tossa jute has also been cultivated in the soil of [[Bengal]] where it is known as ''paat'' from the start of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Coremantel, Bangladesh, is the largest global producer of the tossa jute variety.

==History==

For centuries, jute has been an integral part of the culture of [[East Bengal]] and some parts of [[West Bengal]], precisely in the southwest of Bangladesh. Since the seventeenth century the British started trading in jute. During the reign of the [[British Empire]], jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish [[jute trade]]. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during [[World War I]] and also exported to the United States southern region to bag cotton. It was used in the fishing, construction, art and the arms industry. Initially, due to its texture, it could only be processed by hand until it was discovered in Dundee that by treating it with [[whale oil]], it could be treated by machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n5pvr | title=BBC Two - Brian Cox's Jute Journey |publisher=BBC |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry boomed throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ("jute weaver" was a recognised trade occupation in the 1900 UK census), but this trade had largely ceased by about 1970 due to the emergence of synthetic fibers. In the 21st century, jute again rose to be an important crop for export around the world in contrast to synthetic fiber, mainly from Bangladesh.

==Production==
{{Main article|Jute trade}}
[[File:পাট পঁচানো.jpg|thumb|Jute stems being [[retting|retted]] in water to separate the fibers]]
The jute fiber comes from the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The fibers are first extracted by [[retting]]. The retting process consists of bundling jute stems together and immersing them in slow running water. There are two types of retting: stem and ribbon. After the retting process, stripping begins; women and children usually do this job. In the stripping process, non-fibrous matter is scraped off, then the workers dig in and grab the fibers from within the jute stem.&lt;ref name="IJSG"&gt;Jute. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080526151933/http://www.jute.org/home2.htm (IJSG)]. Retrieved 13 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jute is a rain-fed crop with little need for fertilizer or pesticides, in contrast to [[cotton]]'s heavy requirements.  Production is concentrated mostly in Bangladesh, as well as [[India]]'s states of Assam, Bihar, and West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutecomm.gov.in/statewise%20P%20&amp;%20R%20jute.htm |title=Office of the Jute Commissioner&amp;nbsp;— Ministry of Textiles  |publisher=www.jutecomm.gov.in|date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is the world's largest producer of jute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jute.org/statistics_01.htm#4 |title=Statistics&amp;nbsp;— World production of Jute Fibres from 2004/2005 to 2010/2011  |publisher=[[International Jute Study Group]] (IJSG)|date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but imported approximately 162,000 tonnes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jute.org/statistics_06.htm |title=Statistics&amp;nbsp;— World Import of raw Jute, Kenaf and Allied Fibres  |publisher=International Jute Study Group (IJSG)|date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of raw fiber and 175,000 tonnes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jute.org/statistics_07.htm |title=Statistics&amp;nbsp;— World Imports of Products of Jute, Kenaf and Allied Fibres  |publisher=International Jute Study Group (IJSG)|date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of jute products in 2011.

==Genome==
{{main article|Jute genome}}
At the beginning of the 21st century, in 2002 Bangladesh commissioned a consortium of researchers from [[University of Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh Jute Research Institute]] (BJRI) and private software firm DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Ltd., in collaboration with Centre for Chemical Biology, [[University of Science Malaysia]] and [[University of Hawaii]], to research different fibers and hybrid fibers of jute. The draft genome of jute (''Corchorus olitorius'') was completed.&lt;ref name="The Jute Genome Project Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutegenome.org/|title=The Jute Genome Project Homepage |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Making twine, rope, and matting are among its uses.

In combination with sugar, the possibility of using jute to build aeroplane panels has been considered.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUGAR AND JUTE AEROPLANE PANELS|url=http://dailyfuture.eu/en/environment/sugar-and-jute-aeroplane-panels/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415041105/http://dailyfuture.eu/en/environment/sugar-and-jute-aeroplane-panels/|archivedate=2015-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jute is in great demand due to its cheapness, softness, length, lustre and uniformity of its fiber. It is called the 'brown paper bag' as it is also used to store rice, wheat, grains, etc. It is also called the 'golden fiber' due to its versatile nature.

===Fibers===
[[File:Tessuto iuta.jpg|thumb|Jute [[fabric]]]]
[[File:Coffee sacks.jpg|thumb|[[Coffee]] sacks made of jute.]]
[[File:Jute fibre extraction.jpg|thumb|Jute fiber is extracted from retted stem of jute plants]]

Jute matting is used to prevent flood erosion while natural vegetation becomes established. For this purpose, a natural and biodegradable fiber is essential.

Jute is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton due to its versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHAT IS JUTE AND JUCO?|url=https://www.jutexpo.co.uk/about-us/what-is-jute-juco/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jute is used chiefly to make [[cloth]] for wrapping bales of raw cotton, and to make sacks and coarse cloth. The fibers are also woven into [[curtain]]s, [[chair]] coverings, [[carpet]]s, area rugs, [[Hessian (cloth)|hessian cloth]], and backing for [[linoleum]].

While jute is being replaced by synthetic materials in many of these uses,{{fact|date=September 2017}} some uses take advantage of jute's [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] nature, where synthetics would be unsuitable. Examples of such uses include containers for planting young trees, which can be planted directly with the container without disturbing the roots, and land restoration where jute cloth prevents erosion occurring while natural vegetation becomes established.

The fibers are used alone or blended with other types of fiber to make [[twine]] and [[rope]]. Jute butts, the coarse ends of the plants, are used to make inexpensive cloth. Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into ''imitation silk''. As jute fibers are also being used to make pulp and paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the [[wood pulp]] used to make most paper, the importance of jute for this purpose may increase. Jute has a long history of use in the sackings, carpets, wrapping fabrics (cotton bale), and construction fabric manufacturing industry.

Jute was used in traditional textile machinery as fibers having cellulose (vegetable fiber content) and [[lignin]] (wood fiber content). But, the major breakthrough came when the automobile, pulp and paper, and the furniture and bedding industries started to use jute and its allied fibers with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwovens, [[technical textiles]], and composites. Therefore, jute has changed its textile fiber outlook and steadily heading towards its newer identity, i.e., wood fiber. As a textile fiber, jute has reached its peak from where there is no hope of progress, but as a wood fiber jute has many promising features.&lt;ref&gt;The Golden Fiber Trade Centre Limited. [http://exporter-of-jute-products.blogspot.com/ (GFTCL) - Articles &amp; Information on Jute, Kenaf, &amp; Roselle Hemp].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jute is used in the manufacture of a number of fabrics, such as [[Hessian (cloth)|Hessian cloth]], sacking, [[Scrim (material)|scrim]], carpet backing cloth (CBC), and [[canvas]]. Hessian, lighter than sacking, is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is used as an eco-friendly substitute.

Diversified jute products are becoming more and more valuable to the consumer today. Among these are [[espadrilles]], soft [[sweaters]] and [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigans]], floor coverings, home textiles, high performance technical textiles, geotextiles, composites, and more.

Jute floor coverings consist of woven and tufted and piled carpets. Jute mats and mattings with 5/6 mts width and of continuous length are easily being woven in southern parts of India, in solid and fancy shades, and in different weaves, like bouclé, Panama, herringbone, etc. Jute mats and rugs are made both by powerloom and habdloom in large volume in Kerala, India. The traditional Satranji mat is becoming very popular in home décor. Jute non-wovens and composites can be used for underlay, linoleum substrate, and more.

Jute has many advantages as a home textile, either replacing cotton or blending with it. It is a strong, durable, color and light-fast fiber. Its UV protection, sound and heat insulation, low thermal conduction and anti-static properties make it a wise choice in home décor. Also, fabrics made of jute fibers are carbon-dioxide neutral and naturally decomposable. These properties are also why jute can be used in high performance technical textiles.&lt;ref name="IJSG"/&gt;

Moreover, jute can be grown in 4–6 months with a huge amount of cellulose being produced from the jute hurd (inner woody core or [[parenchyma]] of the jute stem) that can meet most of the wood needs of the world. Jute is the major crop among others that is able to protect deforestation by industrialisation.{{Clarify|reason=is this sentence trying to say that jute can prevent deforestation by substituting for wood??  Maybe then say "Jute could be a major factor in preventing deforestation by substituting for wood."|date=May 2014}}

Thus, jute is the most environment-friendly fiber starting from the seed to expired fiber, as the expired fibers can be recycled more than once.

Jute is also used to make ghillie suits, which are used as camouflage and resemble grasses or brush.

Another diversified jute product is geotextiles, which made this agricultural commodity more popular in the agricultural sector. It is a lightly woven fabric made from natural fibers that is used for soil erosion control, seed protection, weed control, and many other agricultural and [[landscaping]] uses. The geotextiles can be used more than a year and the bio-degradable jute geotextile left to rot on the ground keeps the ground cool and is able to make the land more fertile.

===Culinary uses===
In Nigeria, leaves of ''Corchorus olitorius'' are prepared in sticky soup called ''ewedu'' together with ingredients such as sweet potato, dried small fish or shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;AVRDC. [http://avrdc.org/?p=2844 Recipes - African Sticky Soup (Ewedu)]. Retrieved 27 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves are rubbed until foamy or sticky before adding to the soup. Amongst the Yoruba of Nigeria, the leaves are called ''Ewedu'', and in the Hausa-speaking northern Nigeria, the leaves are called ''turgunuwa'' or ''lallo''. The jute leaves are cut into shreds and added to the soup which would normally contain other ingredients such as meat and/or fish, pepper, onions, and other spices. Likewise, the [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] of [[West Nile sub-region|Northwestern Uganda]] eat the leaves as soup, locally called ''pala bi''. Jute is also a [[totem]] for Ayivu, one of the Lugbara [[clan]]s.

In the Philippines, especially in Ilocano-dominated areas, this vegetable, locally known as ''saluyot'', can be mixed with either bitter gourd, bamboo shoots, loofah, or sometimes all of them. These have a slimy and slippery texture.

Similarly, the leaves are used in Cypriot cuisine as an ingredient for stews. It is known locally as [[Mulukhiyah|molohiya]]. It is typically cooked with lamb or chicken.

===Sonali Bag===
{{main article|Sonali Bag}}
Sonali Bag is [[biodegradable]] and eco-friendly poly bag that made from Jute and invented by [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]] scientist Dr. Mubarak Ahmad Khan.&lt;ref&gt; Textiletoday [https://www.textiletoday.com.bd/jute-poly-bag-discovered-bjmc-begin-new-era-reviving-jute/] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; BBC Bangla [https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1842811932424370&amp;id=264572343581678&amp;ref=m_notif&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic] &lt;/ref&gt; The bag named Sonali bag (English: Golden Bag). It is producing experimantaly on Latif Bawani Jute Mill Bangladesh. After a research of 20 years Dr. Mubarak Ahmad Khan invented it. It is recyclable, biodegradable and eco friendly than regular polythene.

The lower part is hard fiber, which is called ''jute cuttings'' in Bangladesh and India (commonly called ''jute butts'' or ''jute tops'' elsewhere).

* Jute fiber is 100% bio-degradable and recyclable and thus environmentally friendly.
* Jute has low pesticide and fertilizer needs.
* It is a natural fiber with golden and silky shine and hence called ''The Golden  Fiber''.
* It is the cheapest vegetable fiber procured from the bast or skin of the plant's stem.
* It is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton, in terms of usage, global consumption, production, and availability.
* It has high tensile strength, low [[extensibility]], and ensures better [[Waterproof fabric|breathability]] of fabrics. Therefore, jute is very suitable in agricultural commodity bulk packaging.
* It helps to make top quality industrial yarn, fabric, net, and sacks. It is one of the most versatile natural fibers that has been used in raw materials for packaging, textiles, non-textile, construction, and agricultural sectors. Bulking of [[yarn]] results in a reduced breaking tenacity and an increased breaking extensibility when blended as a ternary blend.
* The best source of jute in the world is the Bengal Delta Plain in the Ganges Delta, most of which is occupied by Bangladesh.
* Advantages of jute include good insulating and [[static electricity|antistatic]] properties, as well as having low [[thermal conductivity]] and a moderate [[moisture regain]]. Other advantages of jute include [[Soundproofing|acoustic insulating]] properties and manufacture with no [[Irritation|skin irritations]].
* Jute has the ability to be blended with other fibers, both synthetic and natural, and accepts cellulosic [[dye]] classes such as [[natural dye|natural]], [[basic dye|basic]], [[vat dye|vat]], [[Sulfur dye|sulfur]], [[reactive dye|reactive]], and [[dye|pigment dyes]]. As the demand for natural comfort fibers increases, the demand for jute and other natural fibers that can be blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, some manufactures in the natural fiber industry plan to modernize processing with the [[Rieter]]'s [[Elitex]] system. The resulting jute/cotton yarns will produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments. Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with [[caustic soda]], crimp, softness, pliability, and appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool. Liquid [[ammonia]] has a similar effect on jute, as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance when treated with [[fireproofing|flameproofing]] agents.
* Some noted disadvantages include poor drapability and crease resistance, [[brittleness]], fiber shedding, and yellowing in sunlight. However, preparation of fabrics with [[castor oil]] [[lubricant]]s result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, as well as increased dyeing brilliance. Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to [[Microorganism|microbial]] attack in humid climates. Jute can be processed with an [[enzyme]] in order to reduce some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from [[Asteraceae|marigold]] flower extract. In one attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was [[mordant]]ed with [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulphate]], increasing the fabric's dye uptake value. Jute also responds well to [[reactive dye]]ing. This process is used for bright and fast coloured value-added diversified products made from jute.

A '''LNG (liquefied natural gas) pier''' is a specialized kind of working [[pier]] designed for the loading and offloading of [[liquefied natural gas]] from ships to shore based tanks. 

A typical LNG pier could accommodate [[LNG carrier]]s from 138,000 cubic metres to 200,000 cubic metres in capacity. The pier would have at least one {{convert|44|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} liquid unloading line using [[cryogenic]] transfer pumps to transfer the LNG to the [[LNG storage tank]]s on shore.

Some of these piers are very long, up to {{convert|4000|ft}}, in order to not have to dredge and blast underwater, in order to reach to the depth needed to accommodate LNG tanker traffic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4185">A '''liquid-liquid critical point''' (or '''LLCP''') is the endpoint of a [[polyamorphism|liquid-liquid phase transition]] line (LLPT); it is a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] where two types of local structures coexist at the exact ratio of unity. This hypothesis was first developed by [[H. Eugene Stanley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Poole, P. H.; Sciortino, F.; Essmann, U.; Stanley, H.

Near a liquid-liquid critical point, there is always a mixture of two alternative local structures. For instance, in supercooled water, two types of local structures exist, a low-density liquid (LDL) and a high-density liquid (HDL), so above the critical pressure, a higher percentage of HDL exists while below the critical pressure a higher percentage of LDL is present. The ratio ''r'' = LDL/(LDL + HDL) of phase amounts {{Clarify|reason=Which physical property of the substances is used? Mass? Volume? Number of structures?

At any point of the liquid-liquid phase transition, including the associated liquid-liquid critical point, the ratio of LDL to HDL is exactly one (''r'' = ½).

The liquid-liquid critical point theory can be applied to all liquids that possess the [[tetrahedral]] symmetry.

'''Low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS)''', sometimes referred to simply as ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), is a [[surface science|surface-sensitive analytical technique]] used to characterize the chemical and structural makeup of materials.  LEIS involves directing a [[ion beam|stream of charged particles]] known as [[ions]] at a surface and making observations of the positions, [[velocity|velocities]], and [[energy|energies]] of the ions that have interacted with the surface.  Data that is thus collected can be used to deduce information about the material such as the relative positions of [[atoms]] in a [[lattice (group)|surface lattice]] and the [[Chemical element|elemental]] identity of those atoms.  LEIS is closely related to both [[medium-energy ion scattering]] (MEIS) and [[rutherford backscattering|high-energy ion scattering]] (HEIS, known in practice as [[Rutherford backscattering]] spectroscopy, or RBS), differing primarily in the energy range of the ion beam used to probe the surface.  While much of the information collected using LEIS can be obtained using other surface science [[list of materials analysis methods|techniques]], LEIS is unique in its [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] to both structure and composition of surfaces.  Additionally, LEIS is one of a very few surface-sensitive techniques capable of directly observing [[hydrogen]] atoms, an aspect that may make it an increasingly more important technique as the [[hydrogen economy]] is being explored.

== Experimental setup ==

LEIS systems consist of the following:
[[Image:LEIS experimental setup 2.gif|thumb|450px|right|General experimental setup for LEIS.]]

# '''[[Ion Gun]]''', used to direct a beam of [[ions]] at a target sample.  An [[electron ionization]] ion source is typically used to ionize [[noble gas]] atoms such as [[helium|He]], [[neon|Ne]] or [[argon|Ar]], while heating of wafers containing [[alkali metal|alkali]] atoms is used to create an alkali [[ion beam]].  The ions thus created hold a positive [[electric charge|charge]], typically +1, due to the ejection of [[electron]]s from the atoms.  The range of energies used most often in LEIS is 500 [[electronvolt|eV]] to 20 keV.  In order to attain good experimental [[sensor|resolution]] it is important to have a narrow energy spread (ΔE/E &lt; 1%) in the outgoing [[ion beam]]. 
# '''Ion beam manipulator''', includes the [[electrostatic lens]]es of the ion gun for [[Focus (optics)|focus]]ing and beam-chopping.  [[einzel lens|Lenses]] consist of a series of either plate or [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] geometries and serve to [[collimator|collimate]] the beam as well as to selectively filter the beam based on [[mass]] and [[velocity]].  Beam chopping is performed using a [[pulse wave|pulsed-wave]] generator when [[time-of-flight]] (TOF) experiments are performed.  Ions only pass through the chopper when there is no applied [[voltage]].  
# '''Sample [[UHV manipulator|manipulator]]''', allows an operator to change the position and/or [[angle]] of the target in order to perform experiments with varying [[geometry|geometries]].  Using directional controls, [[azimuth]]al (rotational) and [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident angle]] adjustments may be made. 
# '''Drift tube/drift region''', used in TOF setup.  TOF measurements are used when analysis of particle velocity is required.  By pulsing ions towards the sample with a regular [[frequency]], and observing the time to travel a certain distance after surface [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] to a detector, it is possible to calculate the velocity of ions and neutrals coming from the surface.  An [[electrical mobility|accelerator]] may also be used in this setup, prior to the drift tube, in order to achieve separation of ions from [[neutral particle|neutrals]] when desired.
# '''Detector/[[electrostatic analyzer]]''', used to detect the velocities and/or energies of scattered particles including ions and, in some cases, neutral species.  [[File:HEA.svg|thumb|250px|right|Diagram of an electrostatic analyzer in the hemispherical geometry. Only ions of a selected energy pass through to the detector.]]As opposed to TOF analyzers, electrostatic analyzers achieve ion energy resolution using electrostatic deflectors to direct only ions of a particular energy range into a collector, while all other ions are redirected.  This type of analyzer can give good energy resolution (and thus, [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]]) but typically suffers from poor [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] due to the fact that it only detects ions of a certain energy range and ignores neutral species altogether.  Two types of detectors are used:  [[electron multiplier|channel electron multiplier]] (CEM) and [[microchannel plate detector|microchannel plate]] (MCP) detectors.  CEMs operate in a similar manner to [[photomultiplier]]s, displaying a cascade of secondary electron emission processes initiated by ion or fast neutral (energy &gt; 1 keV) impact to give a [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] in signal [[electric current|current]].  In this way it is possible to efficiently detect even small ion or neutral particle fluxes.  MCP detectors are essentially 2-dimensional arrays of CEMs, and they allow additional information about particle position to be obtained at the cost of sensitivity at any given position.
# '''[[Vacuum pump]]s''';  Studies are performed in [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV) conditions (&lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]) in order to prevent unwanted interference with the [[mean free path|ion beam]] and/or [[adsorption|sample]].  Common UHV pumps include [[turbomolecular pump|turbomolecular]] and [[ion pump|ion]] pumps, with [[roughing pump]]ing typically performed using a [[rotary vane pump]].  Due to the extreme surface (i.e. first-layer) sensitivity of LEIS, samples also need to be rigorously cleaned prior to analysis.  Some common processes used to clean samples include [[sputtering]] and [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]].  Appropriate equipment for cleaning must be contained within the vacuum chamber.
# '''Other analysis tools''';  in many cases it is desirable to perform multiple types of analysis on a sample within the same UHV system, or even at the same time.  Some additional tools may include [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES), [[low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED), and [[x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS).  Use of these tools typically requires the presence of additional detectors as well as [[thermionic emission|electron]] and/or [[x-ray]] sources where applicable.

== Physics of ion-surface interactions ==
[[Image:Ion surface interactions.gif|thumb|450px|right|Diagram of various ion-surface interactions (non-exhaustive). (1) Incoming ion; (2) Scattering; (3) Neutralization and scattering; (4) Sputtering or recoiling; (5) Electron emission; (6) Photon emission; (7) Adsorption; (8) Displacement.  LEIS is unique in its high sensitivity to the first surface layer in a sample.]]

Several different types of [[summary of ion surface interactions|events]] may take place as a result of the ion beam impinging on a target surface.  Some of these events include electron or photon emission, electron transfer (both ion-surface and surface-ion), [[scattering]], [[adsorption]], and [[sputtering]] (i.e. ejection of atoms from the surface).  For each system and each interaction there exists an interaction [[cross section (physics)|cross-section]], and the study of these cross-sections is a field in its own right.  As the name suggests, LEIS is primarily concerned with scattering phenomena.

=== Elemental composition and two-body collision model ===

Due to the energy range typically used in ion scattering experiments (&gt; 500 eV), effects of thermal vibrations, [[phonon]] oscillations, and interatomic [[chemical bond|binding]] are ignored since they are far below this range (~a few eV), and the interaction of particle and surface may be thought of as a [[classical mechanics|classical]] two-body [[elastic collision]] problem.  Measuring the energy of ions [[scattering|scattered]] in this type of interaction can be used to determine the elemental composition of a surface, as is shown in the following:
	
Two-body elastic collisions are governed by the concepts of [[conservation of energy|energy]] and [[conservation of momentum|momentum]] conservation.  Consider a particle with mass m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, velocity v&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and energy given as &lt;math&gt; E_0 = \tfrac {1}{2} m_x v_0^2 \,\! &lt;/math&gt; impacting another particle at rest with mass m&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.  The energies of the particles after collision are &lt;math&gt; E_1 = \tfrac {1}{2} m_x v_1^2 \,\! &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; E_2 = \tfrac {1}{2} m_y v_2^2 \,\! &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E_0 = E_1 + E_2 \,\! &lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{2} m_x v_0^2 =  \tfrac{1}{2} m_x v_1^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_y v_2^2 \,\! &lt;/math&gt;.  Additionally, we know&lt;math&gt;m_x v_0 = m_x v_1 \cos \theta_1 + m_y v_2 \cos \theta_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Using [[trigonometry]] we are able to determine

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_0 \left( \frac{m_x \cos \theta_1 \pm \sqrt{m_y^2 - m_x^2 \sin^2 \theta_1}}{m_x + m_y}  \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Similarly, we know

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; E_2 = E_0 \left (\frac{4 m_x m_y cos^2 (\theta_1)}{(m_x + m_y)^2}  \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|}

In a [[murphy's law|well-controlled]] experiment the energy and mass of the primary ions (E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) and the scattering or recoiling geometries are all known, so '''determination of surface elemental composition''' is given by the correlation between E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.  Higher energy scattering peaks correspond to heavier atoms and lower energy peaks correspond to lighter atoms.

=== Getting quantitative ===

While obtaining [[qualitative property|qualitative]] information about the elemental composition of a surface is relatively straightforward, it is necessary to understand the [[statistics|statistical]] [[cross section (physics)|cross-section]] of interaction between ion and surface atoms in order to obtain [[quantitative property|quantitative]] information.  Stated another way, it is easy to find out if a particular species is present, but much more difficult to determine how much of this species is there.

The two-body collision model fails to give quantitative results as it ignores the contributions of [[coulomb’s law|coulomb repulsion]] as well as the more complicated effects of charge [[electric field screening|screening]] by electrons.  This is generally less of a problem in MEIS and RBS experiments but presents issues in LEIS.  Coulomb repulsion occurs between positively charged primary [[ions]] and the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of surface atoms.  The interaction potential is given as:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;V(r) = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r} \phi (r) \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Where &lt;math&gt;Z_1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the atomic numbers of the primary ion and surface atom, respectively, &lt;math&gt;e \,\! &lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]], &lt;math&gt;r \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the interatomic distance, and &lt;math&gt;\phi (r) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the screening function.  &lt;math&gt;\phi (r) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; accounts for the interference of the electrons orbiting each nucleus.  In the case of MEIS and RBS, this potential can be used to calculate the Rutherford scattering cross section (see [[Rutherford scattering]]) &lt;math&gt; \tfrac {d \sigma}{d \Omega} &lt;/math&gt;:
[[Image:ScatteringDiagram.svg|thumb|200px|right|Repulsive scattering by a point particle.]]

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega} = \left (\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 E_0} \right)^2 \frac{1}{\sin ^4 \left (\frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As shown at right, &lt;math&gt; d \sigma \,\!&lt;/math&gt; represents a finite region for an incoming particle, while &lt;math&gt; d \Omega \,\!&lt;/math&gt; represents the solid scattering angle after the scattering event.  However, for LEIS &lt;math&gt; \phi (r) \,\! &lt;/math&gt; is typically unknown which prevents such a clean analysis.  Additionally, when using noble gas ion beams there is a '''high probability of neutralization on impact''' (which has strong angular dependence) due to the strong desire of these ions to be in a neutral, closed shell state.  This results in poor secondary ion flux.  See AISS and TOF-SARS below for approaches to avoiding this problem.

=== Shadowing and blocking ===
[[Image:Shadowing and blocking.gif|thumb|400px|right|Shadowing and blocking effects in two dimensions. No ions will be detected at angles below &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{crit}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt; Primary ions are approaching from the upper left.]]

[[Shadowing (scattering)|Shadowing]] and [[Blocking (scattering)|blocking]] are important concepts in almost all types of ion-surface interactions and result from the [[electric charge|repulsive]] nature of the ion-nucleus interaction.  As shown at right, when a flux of ions flows in '''parallel''' towards a '''scattering center''' (nucleus), they are each scattered according to the force of the Coulomb repulsion.  This effect is known as '''shadowing'''.  In a simple Coulomb repulsion model, the resulting region of “forbidden” space behind the scattering center takes the form of a [[paraboloid]] with [[radius]] &lt;math&gt;r = 2 \sqrt {\tfrac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2 L}{E_0}} &lt;/math&gt; at a distance L from the scattering center.  The '''flux density is increased''' near the edge of the paraboloid.

'''Blocking''' is closely related to shadowing, and involves the interaction between scattered ions and a neighboring scattering center (as such it inherently requires the presence of at least two scattering centers).  As shown, ions scattered from the first nucleus are now on '''diverging paths''' as they undergo interaction with the second nucleus.  This interaction results in another “shadowing cone” now called a blocking cone where ions scattered from the first nucleus are blocked from exiting at angles below &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{crit} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Focusing effects again result in an '''increased flux density near &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{crit} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;'''.

In both shadowing and blocking, the "forbidden" regions are actually accessible to trajectories when the mass of incoming ions is greater than that of the surface atoms (e.g. [[argon|Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] impacting [[silicon|Si]] or [[aluminium|Al]]).  In this case the region will have a finite but '''depleted flux density'''.

For higher energy ions such as those used in MEIS and RBS the concepts of shadowing and blocking are relatively straightforward since ion-nucleus interactions dominate and electron screening effects are insignificant.  However, in the case of LEIS these screening effects do interfere with ion-nucleus interactions and the repulsive potential becomes more complicated.  Also, multiple scattering events are very likely which complicates analysis.  '''Importantly''', due to the lower energy ions used LEIS is typically characterized by '''large interaction cross-sections''' and shadow cone radii.  For this reason '''penetration depth''' is low and the method has much higher '''first-layer sensitivity''' than MEIS or RBS.  Overall, these concepts are essential for data analysis in impact collision LEIS experiments (see below).

=== Diffraction does not play a major role ===

The [[de Broglie wavelength]] of ions used in LEIS experiments is given as &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \tfrac{h}{m v} &lt;/math&gt;.  Using a worst-case value of 500 eV for an &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, we see λ is still only 0.006 Å, still well below the typical interatomic spacing of 2-3 Å.  Because of this, the effects of [[diffraction]] are not significant in a normal LEIS experiment.

[[Image:Shadowing and blocking ICISS 2.gif|thumb|350px|right|ICISS geometry and its relevance to structural characterization of surfaces. The direction and length of the surface-subsurface bond may be determined from an intensity vs. &lt;math&gt;\alpha \,\! &lt;/math&gt; plot.  Red: determining the shape of the shadow cone; Green: determining surface-subsurface spacing and direction with a known shadow cone shape.]]

=== Variations of technique ===

Depending on the particular experimental setup, LEIS may be used to obtain a variety of information about a sample.  The following includes several of these methods.

* '''Alkali ion scattering spectroscopy (AISS)''' uses [[alkali metal|alkali]] ions in place of noble gas ions to give a distinctly different type of interaction.  The primary difference between AISS and normal ISS is the increase in ion survival [[probability]] when using alkali ions.  This is due to the relative stability of alkali (+1) ions as opposed to noble gas ions which have a much stronger [[ionization potential|energetic incentive]] for abstracting electrons from the sample.  Increasing the ion survival probability results in an increase in ion [[flux]] and an improvement in sensitivity, which in turn allows for a reduction in primary ion flux to a point where the method is almost [[nondestructive testing|non-destructive]].  A disadvantage of using alkali ions in place of noble gas ions is the increased likelihood of [[adsorption]] or [[physical vapor deposition|deposition]] to the sample surface.
* '''Impact-collision ion scattering spectroscopy (ICISS)''' takes advantage of shadowing and blocking in order to make [[Accuracy and precision|precise]] determinations about interatomic spacing of the first 1-2 layers in a surface.  The specific scattering geometry (180 degrees) ensures detection of only those particles which have undergone head-on collisions with surface atoms (thereby avoiding the complications of multiple scattering events).  Starting sampling at a relatively high [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] and scanning over varying incidence angles, the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of one particular energy peak is monitored.  Scattered ions form shadow cones (see above) behind each atom, which prevents any backscattering at low incidence angles.  A peak in scattering intensity is observed when the cones line up such that each passes over the adjacent atom.  Performing such an analysis on a sample with known interatomic spacing enables determination of the shape of the shadow cone, where as shown at right, &lt;math&gt; r = d\sin\alpha_{crit}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; L = d\cos\alpha_{crit}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Image:ICISS intensity graph.gif|thumb|350px|right|A graph of intensity versus angle of incidence for scattering from a subsurface atom in the ICISS geometry. The directionality of the surface-subsurface bond (see diagram above) may be deduced from &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0 \,\! &lt;/math&gt;.  The length of this bond may be deduced from &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1 \,\! &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2 \,\! &lt;/math&gt; when the shape of the shadow cone is known.]]If the shape of the shadow cone is known, the interatomic spacing between surface atoms as well as the spacing and directionality between surface and subsurface atoms can then be calculated from the resulting peak-and-valley structure in a graph of intensity versus scattering angle.  In the graph at right showing scattering intensity from a subsurface (second layer) atom, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the middle of the "valley" where the atom is being blocked by a surface atom.  &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the peaks due to intersection of the shadow cone with the subsurface atom.  Interatomic spacing can be directly calculated from these values if the shape of the shadow cone is known.
* '''Neutral Impact-collision ion scattering spectroscopy (NICISS)''' uses detection of backscattered projectiles to determine concentration depth profiles of the elements. The NICISS technique uses noble gas ions (usually He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of energy 1-5 keV. When the projectile ions are within a few angstrom of the surface they are neutralised, and proceed to penetrate into the surface. The projectiles may be backscattered (at an angle of up to 180°) upon collision with a target atom. This backscattering causes the projectiles to lose energy proportional to the mass of the target and is of the order of a few hundred eV. The final energy of the projectiles is determined via [[time-of-flight]] (TOF). Hence by knowing the initial and final energies of the projectile, it is possible to determine the identity of the target atom. The projectiles also experience an additional energy loss while penetrating through the bulk, of the order of a few eV per angrstrom. Hence the depth that each target atom was hit can also be determined. From the TOF spectrum it is then possible to gain the concentration depth profiles of the elements present in the sample. NICISS is able to probe to a depth of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;nm with a resolution of only a few angstrom.
* '''Reactive ion scattering (RIS)''' utilizes a stream of very low-energy (1-100 eV) [[caesium|Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions to probe molecules adsorbed at the surface of a sample.  Upon impact the ions may interact with and [[chemical reaction|chemically bind]] to [[adsorbate|species]] present at the surface.  These interactions take place on a rapid ([[picosecond]]) timescale and can be used to analyze for the presence of different molecules or molecular fragments by observing spectra of Cs-X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coming from the surface.
* '''[[Time-of-flight]] scattering and recoiling spectroscopy (TOF-SARS)''' uses the TOF analysis setup.  Elemental analysis may be performed via observation of in-plane scattering, while structural information may be obtained by following certain spectral peaks while shifting either sample incident or azimuthal angle.
* '''Scattering and recoiling imaging spectroscopy (SARIS)''' takes advantage of blocking cone geometries to focus ions in a manner similar to conventional [[optics]].  This gives very large [[magnification]]s (~10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) when projected onto a 2-d detector and may be used to give element-specific images of the sample surface.  The use of a wide 2-d MCP detector greatly reduces sample analysis time as opposed to the TOF geometry with an inherently narrow-angle detector (see drift tube above).  J. Wayne Rabalais at the [[University of Houston]] is one of the pioneers of this method, and a fine image of the output of a SARIS experiment can be found [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808030120/http://www.chem.uh.edu/Faculty/Rabalais/ here].

== Comparison to other analytical techniques ==

* [[Medium energy ion scattering]] (MEIS) and [[Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy|Rutherford backscattering]] (RBS) spectroscopies involve a similar setup to LEIS but use ions in the energy range of ~100 keV (MEIS) and ~1-2 MeV (RBS) to probe surfaces.  Surface sensitivity is lost as a result of the use of higher energy particles, so while MEIS and RBS can still provide information about a sample they are incapable of providing true first-layer sensitivity.
* [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) involves the detection of ionic species ejected from a surface as a result of energetic particle impact.  While SIMS is capable of giving depth profiles of the elemental composition of a sample, it is an inherently destructive method and is generally does not give [[crystal structure|structural]] information.
* [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS) is capable of surface elemental analysis, but samples a much more broad region of a sample than LEIS and so is not able to distinguish the first layer from subsurface layers.  Since XPS relies on ejection of [[core electron|core-level electrons]] from atoms it is unable to detect [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]] atoms in a sample.
* [[Low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED) is often used in combination with LEIS in order to facilitate proper sample alignment.  LEED can give detailed structural information about a sample including surface [[superstructure]]s and alignment of [[adsorbate]]s.  LEED is not element-specific and so cannot be used to determine surface elemental composition.
* [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES) involves the detection of electrons [[auger effect|emitted]] as a result of core hole excitation and relaxation processes.  Since the process involves core levels it is insensitive to hydrogen and helium atoms.  AES results may typically be used to infer information on the [[chemical state|chemical environment]] of particular atoms in a surface.

'''Magnesium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Mg''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (group 2, or [[alkaline earth metals]]) of the [[periodic table]]: all group 2 elements have the same [[electron]] configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.

Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft3rd|pages=305–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ash |first=Russell |title=The Top 10 of Everything 2006: The Ultimate Book of Lists |publisher=Dk Pub |date=2005 |url=http://plymouthlibrary.org/faqelements.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005083153/http://plymouthlibrary.org/faqelements.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-05 |isbn=0-7566-1321-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced in large, aging [[star]]s from the sequential addition of three [[Helium nucleus|helium nuclei]] to a [[carbon]] nucleus. When such stars explode as [[supernova]]s, much of the magnesium is expelled into the [[interstellar medium]] where it may recycle into new star systems. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the [[Earth's crust]]&lt;ref name="Abundance" /&gt; and the fourth most common element in the Earth (after [[iron]], [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater, after [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/seawater.htm#composition|title=The chemical composition of seawater|author=Anthoni, J Floor|date=2006|work=seafriends.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnesium occurs naturally only in combination with other elements, where it invariably has a +2 [[oxidation state]]. The free element (metal) can be produced artificially, and is highly reactive (though in the atmosphere, it is soon coated in a thin layer of oxide that partly inhibits reactivity – see [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light. The metal is now obtained mainly by [[electrolysis]] of magnesium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] obtained from [[brine]], and is used primarily as a component in [[aluminium]]-magnesium alloys, sometimes called ''[[magnalium]]'' or ''[[magnalium|magnelium]]''. Magnesium is less dense than [[aluminium]], and the alloy is prized for its combination of lightness and strength.

Magnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the [[human body]] and is essential to all cells and some 300 [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=nih/&gt; Magnesium ions interact with [[polyphosphate]] compounds such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[DNA]], and [[RNA]]. Hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function.  Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common [[laxatives]], [[antacids]] (e.g., milk of magnesia), and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm in such conditions as [[eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Physical properties ===
Elemental magnesium is a gray-white lightweight metal, two-thirds the density of aluminium. It [[tarnish]]es slightly when exposed to air, although, unlike the heavier [[alkaline earth metals]], an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove. Magnesium has the lowest melting ({{convert|923|K|°F}}) and the lowest boiling point {{convert|1363|K|°F}} of all the alkaline earth metals.

Magnesium reacts with water at room temperature, though it reacts much more slowly than calcium, a similar group 2 metal.  When submerged in water, [[hydrogen]] bubbles form slowly on the surface of the metal – though, if powdered, it reacts much more rapidly. The reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures (see [[Magnesium#Safety precautions|safety precautions]]). Magnesium's reversible reaction with water can be harnessed to store energy and run a [[Magnesium injection cycle|magnesium-based engine]].

Magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), producing the metal chloride and hydrogen gas, similar to the HCl reaction with aluminium, zinc, and many other metals.

=== Chemical properties ===

====Flammability====
Magnesium is highly [[flammability|flammable]], especially when powdered or shaved into thin strips, though it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk. Flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach {{convert|3100|C|F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Dreizin, Edward L.; Berman, Charles H. and Vicenzi, Edward P. 2000 30"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Condensed-phase modifications in magnesium particle combustion in air|author=Dreizin, Edward L.|author2=Berman, Charles H.|author3=Vicenzi, Edward P.|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=122|doi=10.1016/S0010-2180(00)00101-2|date=2000|pages=30–42|url=http://mineralsciences.si.edu/staff/pages/vicenzi/Dreizin}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="DOE"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once ignited, such fires are difficult to extinguish, because combustion continues in [[nitrogen]] (forming [[magnesium nitride]]), [[carbon dioxide]] (forming [[magnesium oxide]] and [[carbon]]), and water (forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen). This property was used in incendiary weapons during the [[firebombing]] of cities in [[World War II]], where the only practical [[civil defense]] was to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude atmosphere from the combustion.

Magnesium may also be used as an igniter for [[thermite]], a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that ignites only at a very high temperature.

====Source of light====
When burning in air, magnesium produces a brilliant-white light that includes strong ultraviolet wavelengths. Magnesium powder ([[flash powder]]) was used for subject illumination in the early days of [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography|last=Hannavy|first=John|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135873271|page=84|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3E3AQAAMAAJ|title=Scientific American: Supplement|year=1899|publisher=Munn and Company|volume=48|page=20035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, magnesium filament was used in electrically ignited single-use photography [[Flash (photography)#Flashbulbs|flashbulbs]].

=== Occurrence ===
{{Category see also|Magnesium minerals}}
{{See also|Boninite}}

Magnesium is the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass and tied in seventh place with [[iron]] in [[molarity]].&lt;ref name="Abundance"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abundance and form of the most abundant elements in Earth's continental crust |format=PDF |accessdate=15 February 2008|url=http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/Fundamentals/ElementalAbundanceTableP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in large deposits of [[magnesite]], [[dolomite]], and other [[mineral]]s, and in mineral waters, where magnesium ion is soluble.

Although magnesium is found in more than 60 [[mineral]]s, only [[dolomite]], [[magnesite]], [[brucite]], [[carnallite]], [[talc]], and [[olivine]] are of commercial importance.

The {{chem|Mg|2+}} [[cation]] is the second-most-abundant cation in seawater (about ⅛ the mass of sodium ions in a given sample), which makes seawater and sea salt attractive commercial sources for Mg. To extract the magnesium, [[calcium hydroxide]] is added to [[seawater]] to form [[magnesium hydroxide]] [[precipitate]].
: {{chem|MgCl|2}} + {{chem|Ca(OH)|2}} → {{chem|Mg(OH)|2}} + {{chem|CaCl|2}}

Magnesium hydroxide ([[brucite]]) is insoluble in water and can be filtered out and reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produced concentrated [[magnesium chloride]].
: {{chem|Mg(OH)|2}} + 2 HCl → {{chem|MgCl|2}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}
From magnesium chloride, [[electrolysis]] produces magnesium.

== Forms ==

=== Alloy ===
As of 2013, magnesium alloy consumption was less than one million tons per year, compared with 50 million tons of [[aluminum alloy]]s. Its use has been historically limited by its tendency to corrode, [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] at high temperatures, and combust.&lt;ref name=giz /&gt;

====Corrosion====
The presence of [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], and [[cobalt]] strongly activates [[corrosion]]. Greater than a very small percentage, these metals precipitate as [[intermetallic compound]]s, and the precipitate locales function as active [[cathode|cathodic]] sites that reduce water, causing the loss of magnesium.&lt;ref name=giz /&gt;  Controlling the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance. Sufficient [[manganese]] overcomes the corrosive effects of iron. This requires precise control over composition, increasing costs.&lt;ref name=giz /&gt; Adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within the structure of a metal. This prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas, an essential factor of corrosive chemical processes. The addition of about one in three hundred parts [[arsenic]] reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a factor of nearly ten.&lt;ref name=giz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/stainless-magnesium-corrosion-monash/28856 |title=Stainless magnesium breakthrough bodes well for manufacturing industries |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=29 August 2013|author=Dodson, Brian |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Birbilis | first1 = N. | last2 = Williams | first2 = G. | last3 = Gusieva | first3 = K. | last4 = Samaniego | first4 = A. | last5 = Gibson | first5 = M.

====High-temperature creep and flammability====
Research showed that magnesium's tendency to creep at high-temperatures is eliminated by the addition of [[scandium]] and [[gadolinium]]. Flammability is greatly reduced by a small amount of [[calcium]] in the alloy.&lt;ref name=giz /&gt;

=== Compounds ===
Magnesium forms a variety of compounds important to industry and biology, including [[magnesium carbonate]], [[magnesium chloride]], [[magnesium citrate]], [[magnesium hydroxide]] (milk of magnesia), [[magnesium oxide]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate ([[Epsom salts]]).

=== Isotopes ===
{{main|Isotopes of magnesium}}

Magnesium has three stable [[isotope]]s: {{chem|24|Mg}}, {{chem|25|Mg}} and {{chem|26|Mg}}. All are present in significant amounts (see table of isotopes above). About 79% of Mg is {{chem|24|Mg}}. The isotope {{chem|28|Mg}} is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was produced by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments. This isotope has a relatively short half-life (21 hours) and its use was limited by shipping times.

The nuclide {{chem|26|Mg}} has found application in [[isotope|isotopic]] [[geology]], similar to that of aluminium. {{chem|26|Mg}} is a [[radiogenic]] daughter product of [[aluminium-26|{{chem|26|Al}}]], which has a [[half-life]] of 717,000 years. Excessive quantities of stable {{chem|26|Mg}} have been observed in the [[Ca-Al-rich inclusions]] of some [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite]]s. This anomalous abundance is attributed to the decay of its parent {{chem|26|Al}} in the inclusions, and researchers conclude that such meteorites were formed in the [[solar nebula]] before the {{chem|26|Al}} had decayed.  These are among the oldest objects in the [[solar system]] and contain preserved information about its early history.

It is conventional to plot {{chem|26|Mg}}/{{chem|24|Mg}} against an Al/Mg ratio. In an [[isochron dating]] plot, the Al/Mg ratio plotted is{{chem|27|Al}}/{{chem|24|Mg}}. The slope of the isochron has no age significance, but indicates the initial {{chem|26|Al}}/{{chem|27|Al}} ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir.

[[File:Mg sheets and ingots.jpg|thumb|Magnesium sheets and ingots]]
[[People's Republic of China|China]] is the dominant supplier of magnesium, with approximately 80% of the world market share. China is almost completely reliant on the [[Silicothermic reaction|silicothermic]] [[Pidgeon process]] (the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon, often provided by a ferrosilicon alloy in which the iron is but a spectator in the reactions) to obtain the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinamagnesiumcorporation.com/our-business/magnesium-overview| publisher=China magnesium Corporation| title=Magnesium Overview|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process can also be carried out with [[carbon]] at approx 2300&amp;nbsp;°C:
:{{chem|2MgO|(s)}} + {{chem|Si|(s)}} + {{chem|2CaO|(s)}} → {{chem|2Mg|(g)}} + {{chem|Ca|2|SiO|4(s)}}
:{{chem|MgO|(s)}} + {{chem|C|(s)}} → {{chem|Mg|(g)}} + {{chem|CO|(g)}}

In the United States, magnesium is obtained principally with the [[Dow process]], by [[electrolysis]] of fused magnesium chloride from [[brine]] and [[sea water]]. A saline solution containing {{chem|Mg|2+}} ions is first treated with [[Calcium oxide|lime]] (calcium oxide) and the precipitated [[magnesium hydroxide]] is collected:
:{{chem|Mg|2+|(aq)}} + {{chem|CaO|(s)}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|Ca|2+|(aq)}} + {{chem|Mg(OH)|2(s)}}

The hydroxide is then converted to a partial [[hydrate]] of [[magnesium chloride]] by treating the hydroxide with [[hydrochloric acid]] and heating of the product:
:{{chem|Mg(OH)|2(s)}} + 2 HCl → {{chem|MgCl|2(aq)}} + 2{{chem|H|2|O|(l)}}

The salt is then electrolyzed in the molten state. At the [[cathode]], the {{chem|Mg|2+}} ion is reduced by two [[electron]]s to magnesium metal:
:{{chem|Mg|2+}} + 2 {{Subatomic particle|electron}} → Mg

At the [[anode]], each pair of {{chem|Cl|-}} ions is oxidized to [[chlorine]] gas, releasing two electrons to complete the circuit:
:2 {{chem|Cl|-}} → {{chem|Cl|2}} (g) + 2 {{Subatomic particle|electron}}

A new process, solid oxide membrane technology, involves the electrolytic reduction of MgO. At the cathode, {{chem|Mg|2+}} ion is reduced by two [[electron]]s to magnesium metal. The electrolyte is [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ). The anode is a liquid metal. At the YSZ/liquid metal anode {{chem|O|2-}} is oxidized. A layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode, and at this interface carbon and oxygen react to form carbon monoxide.

The United States has traditionally been the major world supplier of this metal, supplying 45% of world production even as recently as 1995. Today, the US market share is at 7%, with a single domestic producer left, US Magnesium, a [[Renco Group]] company in [[Utah]] born from now-defunct Magcorp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0722/044_print.html| publisher=Forbes.com| title=Man With Many Enemies| first=Nathan| last= Vardi |date=22 February 2007|accessdate=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Bolton-davy.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Humphry Davy]]]]
The name magnesium originates from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for a district in [[Thessaly]] called [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webelements.com/magnesium/history.html |title=Magnesium: historical information |publisher=webelements.com |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[magnetite]] and [[manganese]], which also originated from this area, and required differentiation as separate substances. See [[manganese]] for this history.

In 1618, a farmer at Epsom in England attempted to give his cows water from a well there. The cows refused to drink because of the water's bitter taste, but the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes. The substance became known as [[Magnesium sulfate|Epsom salts]] and its fame spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ainsworth|first1=Steve|title=Epsom's deep bath|journal=Nurse Prescribing|date=June 1, 2013|volume=11|issue=6|page=269|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate, {{chem|MgSO|4}}·7{{hsp}}{{chem|H|2|O}}.

The metal itself was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] in England in 1808. He used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and [[Mercury(II) oxide|mercuric oxide]].&lt;ref name="Davy1808"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davy | first = H. | date= 1808 | title =  Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 98 | pages = 333–370|bibcode = 1808RSPT...98..333D | jstor=107302 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Bussy]] prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy's first suggestion for a name was magnium,&lt;ref name="Davy1808" /&gt; but the name magnesium is now used.

==Uses as a metal==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12062, Wasserreiter mit Magnesiumfackeln.jpg|thumb|An unusual application of magnesium as an [[Illumination (lighting)|illumination]] source while [[wakeskating]] in 1931]]

Magnesium is the third-most-commonly-used structural metal, following [[iron]] and aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9DskDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT256&amp;dq=%C2%A0Magnesium+is+the+third-most-commonly-used+structural+metal,+following+iron+and+aluminium.#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Magnesium%20is%20the%20third-most-commonly-used%20structural%20metal,%20following%20iron%20and%20aluminium.&amp;f=false|title=Materials for the 21st Century|last=Segal|first=David|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0192526090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main applications of magnesium are, in order: aluminium alloys, [[die-casting]] (alloyed with [[zinc]]),&lt;ref name="BakerM. M. Avedesian1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Hugh D.

Magnesium is used in super-strong, lightweight materials and alloys.  For example, when infused with silicon carbide nanoparticles, it has extremely high specific strength.&lt;ref name=UCLA_Research&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-researchers-create-exceptionally-strong-and-lightweight-new-metal |title=UCLA researchers create super-strong magnesium metal |publisher=ucla.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for German military aircraft as early as World War I and extensively for German aircraft in World War II.

The Germans coined the name "[[Elektron (alloy)|Elektron]]" for magnesium alloy, a term which is still used today. In the commercial aerospace industry, magnesium was generally restricted to engine-related components, due to fire and corrosion hazards. Currently, magnesium alloy use in aerospace is increasing, driven by the importance of fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.350-351.19 |title= Magnesium Alloys Development towards the 21st Century |date= 2000 |last1= Aghion |first1= E. |last2= Bronfin |first2= B. |journal= Materials Science Forum |volume= 350–351 |pages= 19–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development and testing of new magnesium alloys continues, notably Elektron 21, which (in test) has proved suitable for aerospace engine, internal, and airframe components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bronfin|first1=B.|display-authors=etal|editor=Kainer, Karl|title=Magnesium: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Magnesium Alloys and Their Applications|date=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Weinheim, Germany|isbn=978-3527317646|page=23|chapter=Elektron 21 specification}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Community runs three R&amp;D magnesium projects in the Aerospace priority of Six Framework Program.

In the form of thin ribbons, magnesium is used to [[Solvent#Desiccant|purify solvents]]; for example, preparing super-dry ethanol.

===Aircraft===
* [[Wright Aeronautical]] used a magnesium [[crankcase]] in the WWII-era [[Wright R-3350|Wright Duplex Cyclone]] aviation engine. This presented a serious problem for the earliest models of the [[Boeing B-29]] heavy bomber when an in-flight engine fire ignited the engine crankcase.  The resulting combustion was as hot as 5,600&amp;nbsp;°F (3,100&amp;nbsp;°C) and could sever the wing spar from the [[fuselage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Condensed-phase modifications in magnesium particle combustion in air|author1=Dreizin, Edward L. |author2=Berman, Charles H. |author3=Vicenzi, Edward P. |journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=122|doi=10.1016/S0010-2180(00)00101-2|year=2000|pages=30–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EBmynsBj2BUC&amp;pg=PA40| pages=40–41 | title = Mission to Tokyo: The American Airmen Who Took the War to the Heart of Japan | isbn = 978-1610586634 | author1 = Dorr | first1 = Robert F. | date = 15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JEwpAQAAIAAJ | title=AAHS Journal |volume=44–45 | date=1999 |publisher=American Aviation Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automotive===

[[File:Mg alloy car engine blocks.jpg|thumb|Mg alloy motorcycle engine blocks]]
* [[Mercedes-Benz]] used the alloy [[Elektron (alloy)|Elektron]] in the body of an early model [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR]]; these cars ran (with successes) at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], the [[Mille Miglia]], and other world-class race events in 1955.
* [[Porsche]] used magnesium alloy frames in the [[Porsche 917|917/053]] that won Le Mans in 1971, and continues to use magnesium alloys for its engine blocks due to the weight advantage.
* [[Volkswagen Group]] has used magnesium in its engine components for many years.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
* [[Mitsubishi Motors]] uses magnesium for its [[paddle shifters]].
* [[BMW]] used magnesium alloy blocks in their [[BMW N52|N52]] engine, including an aluminium alloy insert for the cylinder walls and cooling jackets surrounded by a high-temperature magnesium alloy AJ62A.  The engine was used worldwide between 2005 and 2011 in various 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 series models; as well as the Z4, X1, X3, and X5.
* [[Chevrolet]] used the magnesium alloy AE44 in the 2006 Corvette [[Corvette C6|Z06]].
Both AJ62A and AE44 are recent developments in high-temperature low-[[Creep (deformation)|creep]] magnesium alloys. The general strategy for such alloys is to form [[intermetallic]] precipitates at the [[crystallite|grain boundaries]], for example by adding [[mischmetal]] or [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tensile and Compressive Creep of Magnesium-Aluminum-Calcium Based Alloys |format=PDF |date=2001 |author=Luo, Alan A. |author2=Powell, Bob R. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Materials &amp; Processes Laboratory, General Motors Research &amp; Development Center |accessdate=21 August 2007 |url=http://doc.tms.org/ezmerchant/prodtms.nsf/productlookupitemid/01-481x-137/%24FILE/01-481X-137F.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023445/http://doc.tms.org/ezmerchant/prodtms.nsf/productlookupitemid/01-481x-137/%24FILE/01-481X-137F.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; New alloy development and lower costs that make magnesium competitive with aluminium will increase the number of automotive applications.

===Electronics===

Because of low weight and good mechanical and electrical properties, magnesium is widely used for manufacturing of mobile phones, laptop and [[tablet computers]], cameras, and other electronic components.
[[File:Magnesium-products.jpg|thumb|left|Products made of magnesium: firestarter and shavings, sharpener, magnesium ribbon]]

===Other===

Magnesium, being readily available and relatively nontoxic, has a variety of uses:
* Magnesium is flammable, burning at a temperature of approximately {{convert|3100|°C|K °F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Dreizin, Edward L.; Berman, Charles H. and Vicenzi, Edward P. 2000 30" /&gt; and the [[autoignition temperature]] of magnesium ribbon is approximately {{convert|473|°C|K °F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces intense, bright, white light when it burns. Magnesium's high combustion temperature makes it a useful tool for starting emergency fires. Other uses include flash [[photography]], flares, [[pyrotechnics]], and fireworks sparklers. Magnesium is also often used to ignite thermite or other materials that require a high ignition temperature.[[File:Magnesium Sparks.jpg|thumb|Magnesium firestarter (in left hand), used with a [[pocket knife]] and flint to create sparks that ignite the shavings]]
* In the form of turnings or ribbons, to prepare [[Grignard reagent]]s, which are useful in [[organic synthesis]].
* As an additive agent in conventional propellants and the production of [[Ductile iron|nodular graphite in cast iron]].
* As a reducing agent to separate [[uranium]] and other metals from their [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]].
* As a [[Sacrificial anode|sacrificial (galvanic) anode]] to protect boats, underground tanks, pipelines, buried structures, and water heaters.
* Alloyed with zinc to produce the zinc sheet used in [[photoengraving]] plates in the printing industry, [[Dry cell|dry-cell battery]] walls, and [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|roofing]].&lt;ref name="BakerM. M. Avedesian1999" /&gt;
* As a metal, this element's principal use is as an alloying additive to aluminium with these aluminium-magnesium alloys being used mainly for [[beverage can]]s, sports equipment such as golf clubs, fishing reels, and archery bows and arrows.
* Specialty, high-grade car wheels of magnesium alloy are called "[[Magnesium alloy wheel|mag wheels]]", although the term is often misapplied to aluminium wheels. Many car and aircraft manufacturers have made engine and body parts from magnesium.
* [[Magnesium battery|Magnesium batteries]] have been commercialized as [[primary battery|primary batteries]], and are an active topic of research for rechargeable [[secondary battery|secondary batteries]].

Magnesium metal and its alloys can be explosive hazards; they are highly flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form. Burning or molten magnesium reacts violently with water. When working with powdered magnesium, [[safety glasses]] with [[eye protection]] and UV filters (such as welders use) are employed because burning magnesium produces [[ultraviolet]] light that can permanently damage the [[retina]] of a human eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/docs/support/scisafe/chapter8.html |title=Science Safety: Chapter 8 |publisher=Government of Manitoba |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnesium is capable of reducing [[water (molecule)|water]] and releasing highly flammable [[hydrogen]] gas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Mg/chem.html| title=Chemistry : Periodic Table : magnesium : chemical reaction data| accessdate=26 June 2006| publisher=webelements.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Mg (s) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} (l) → [[Magnesium hydroxide|{{chem|Mg(OH)|2}}]] (s) + {{chem|H|2}} (g)

Therefore, water cannot extinguish magnesium fires. The hydrogen gas produced intensifies the fire. Dry sand is an effective smothering agent, but only on relatively level and flat surfaces.

Magnesium reacts with [[carbon dioxide]] exothermically to form [[magnesium oxide]] and [[carbon]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/demos/main_pages/9.8.html |title=Magnesium Burns in Dry Ice (CO2 Saturated) Environment |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 Mg + {{chem|CO|2}} → 2 MgO + C (s)

Hence, carbon dioxide fuels rather than extinguishes magnesium fires.

Burning magnesium can be quenched by using a [[Fire extinguisher#Class D|Class D]] dry chemical fire extinguisher, or by covering the fire with [[sand]] or magnesium foundry flux to remove its air source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cote |first=Arthur E. |date=2003 |title=Operation of Fire Protection Systems |publisher= Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |page=667 |isbn= 978-0877655848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Useful compounds==
Magnesium compounds, primarily [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO), are used as a [[refractory]] material in [[furnace]] linings for producing [[iron]], [[steel]], [[nonferrous metal]]s, [[glass]], and [[cement]].  Magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used in the agricultural, chemical, and construction industries. Magnesium oxide from [[calcination]] is used as an electrical insulator in [[Mineral-insulated copper-clad cable|fire-resistant cables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linsley|first=Trevor|title=Basic Electrical Installation Work|isbn=978-0080966281|page=362|date=2011|chapter=Properties of conductors and insulators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnesium reacted with an [[alkyl halide]] gives a [[Grignard reaction|Grignard reagent]], which is a very useful tool for preparing [[alcohols]].

Magnesium salts are included in various [[food]]s, [[fertilizer]]s (magnesium is a component of [[chlorophyll]]), and [[culture medium|microbe culture media]].

[[Magnesium sulfite]] is used in the manufacture of [[paper]] ([[sulfite process]]).

[[Magnesium phosphate]] is used to fireproof wood used in construction.

Magnesium hexafluorosilicate is used for moth-proofing [[textile]]s.

== Biological roles ==
{{Main|Magnesium in biology}}

===Mechanism of action===
The important interaction between [[phosphate]] and magnesium ions makes magnesium essential to the basic [[nucleic acid]] chemistry of all cells of all known living organisms. More than 300 [[enzyme]]s require magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including all enzymes using or synthesizing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and those that use other [[nucleotides]] to synthesize [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. The ATP molecule is normally found in a [[Chelation|chelate]] with a magnesium ion.&lt;ref&gt;

Sorted by type of magnesium salt, other therapeutic applications include:
* [[Magnesium sulfate]], as the [[hydrate|heptahydrate]] called Epsom salts, is used as [[bath salts]], a [[laxative]], and a highly soluble [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GP1caeWDUWkC&amp;pg=PA224 | page=224 | title = The Fertilizer Encyclopedia | isbn = 978-0470431764 | last1 = Gowariker | first1 = Vasant | last2 = Krishnamurthy |first2=V.

* [[Borate|Magnesium borate]], [[magnesium salicylate]], and [[magnesium sulfate]] are used as [[antiseptic]]s.
* [[Magnesium bromide]] is used as a mild [[sedative]] (this action is due to the [[bromide]], not the magnesium).
* [[Magnesium stearate]] is a slightly [[fire|flammable]] white [[Powder (substance)|powder]] with [[lubricant|lubricating]] properties. In [[pharmacology|pharmaceutical]] technology, it is used in pharmacological manufacture to prevent [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] from sticking to the equipment while compressing the ingredients into tablet form.
* Magnesium carbonate powder is used by athletes such as [[gymnastics|gymnasts]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifters]], and [[climbing|climbers]] to eliminate palm sweat, prevent sticking, and improve the grip on gymnastic apparatus, lifting bars, and climbing rocks.

===Overdose===

Overdose from dietary sources alone is unlikely because excess magnesium in the blood is promptly filtered by the [[kidney]]s,&lt;ref name= Ayuk /&gt; and overdose is more likely in the presence of impaired renal function. In spite of this, [[Megavitamin therapy|megadose therapy]] has caused death in a young child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGuire|first1=John|last2=Kulkarni|first2=Mona Shah|last3=Baden|first3=Harris|title=Fatal Hypermagnesemia in a Child Treated With Megavitamin/Megamineral Therapy|journal=Pediatrics|date=February 2000|volume=105|issue=2|pages=E18|pmid=10654978|url=http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/105/2/e18|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and severe [[hypermagnesemia]] in a woman&lt;ref name="Kontani M, Hara A, Ohta S, Ikeda T 2005 448–452"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kontani M|author2=Hara A|author3=Ohta S|author4= Ikeda T |title=Hypermagnesemia induced by massive cathartic ingestion in an elderly woman without pre-existing renal dysfunction |journal=Intern.

The most common symptoms of overdose are [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]]; other symptoms include [[hypotension]], confusion, slowed heart and [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] rate, deficiencies of other minerals, [[coma]], [[Cardiac arrhythmia/bradycardia|cardiac arrhythmia]], and death from [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name=ummedu /&gt;

===Function in plants===
[[Plants]] require magnesium to synthesize [[chlorophyll]], essential for [[photosynthesis]]. Magnesium in the center of the [[porphyrin ring]] in chlorophyll functions in a manner similar to the iron in the center of the porphyrin ring in [[heme]]. [[Magnesium deficiency (plants)|Magnesium deficiency]] in plants causes late-season yellowing between leaf veins, especially in older leaves, and can be corrected by either applying [[epsom salts]] (which is rapidly [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]]), or crushed [[dolomite|dolomitic]] [[limestone]], to the soil.

'''Magnesium oxide''' ('''[[Magnesium|Mg]][[Oxide|O]]'''), or '''magnesia''', is a white [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] solid [[mineral]] that occurs naturally as [[periclase]] and is a source of [[magnesium]] (see also [[oxide]]). It has an [[empirical formula]] of {{Magnesium}}{{Oxygen}} and consists of a lattice of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions held together by [[ionic bond]]ing. [[Magnesium hydroxide]] forms in the presence of water (MgO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but it can be reversed by heating it to separate moisture.

Magnesium oxide was historically known as '''magnesia alba''' (literally, the white mineral from magnesia – other sources give magnesia alba as MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), to differentiate it from ''[[magnesia negra]]'', a black mineral containing what is now known as [[manganese]].

While "magnesium oxide" normally refers to MgO, [[magnesium peroxide]] MgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also known as a compound. According to evolutionary crystal structure prediction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Zhu| first = Qiang|author2=Oganov A.R. |author3=Lyakhov A.O.  |title= Novel stable compounds in the Mg-O system under high pressure |journal= Phys.

Because of its stability, MgO is used as a model system for investigating vibrational properties of crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Mei| first = AB|author2=O. Hellman|author3=C. M.

==Production==
Magnesium oxide is produced by the [[calcination]] of [[magnesium carbonate]] or [[magnesium hydroxide]].  The latter is obtained by the treatment of [[magnesium chloride]] solutions, typically seawater, with [[Lime (material)|lime]].&lt;ref name = ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | title = Magnesium Compounds | author1 = Margarete Seeger | author2 = Walter Otto | author3 = Wilhelm Flick | author4 = Friedrich Bickelhaupt | author5 = Otto S. Akkerman | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a15_595.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
Calcining at different temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity. High temperatures 1500 – 2000&amp;nbsp;°C diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned (often called dead burnt) magnesia, an unreactive form used as a refractory. Calcining temperatures 1000 – 1500&amp;nbsp;°C produce hard-burned magnesia, which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature, (700–1000&amp;nbsp;°C) produces light-burned magnesia, a reactive form, also known as caustic calcined magnesia.  Although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700&amp;nbsp;°C, the resulting materials appears to reabsorb carbon dioxide from the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ropp, R C |title=Encyclopedia of the alkaline earth compounds|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444595508|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
MgO is prized as a [[refractory material]], i.e. a solid that is physically and chemically stable at high temperatures. It has two useful attributes: high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity. "By far the largest consumer of magnesia worldwide is the refractory industry, which consumed about 56&amp;nbsp;% of the magnesia in the United States in 2004, the remaining 44&amp;nbsp;% being used in agricultural, chemical, construction, environmental, and other industrial applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark A. Shand |title=The chemistry and technology of magnesia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ShuV4W0V2gC |accessdate=10 September 2011 |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-65603-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; MgO is used as a basic [[refractory]] material for [[crucible]]s.

It is a principal fireproofing ingredient in construction materials. As a construction material, [[magnesium oxide wallboard]]s have several attractive characteristics: fire resistance, termite resistance, moisture resistance, mold and mildew resistance, and strength.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

===Niche uses===
MgO is one of the components in [[Portland cement]] in [[Cement kiln#The wet process and the dry process|dry process plants]]. 

Magnesium oxide is used extensively in the soil and groundwater remediation, wastewater treatment, drinking water treatment, air emissions treatment, and waste treatment industries for its acid buffering capacity and related effectiveness in stabilizing dissolved heavy metal species.{{says who|date=December 2016}}

Many heavy metals species, such as lead and cadmium are most soluble in water at acidic pH (below 6) as well as high pH (above 11).  Solubility of metals affects bioavailability of the species and mobility soil and groundwater systems.  Most metal species are toxic to humans at certain concentrations, therefore it is imperative to minimize metal bioavailability and mobility.

Granular MgO is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material, which is also commonly of a low (acidic) pH, in order to drive the pH into the 8–10 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities.  Metal-hydroxide complexes have a tendency to precipitate out of aqueous solution in the pH range of 8–10. MgO is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to Portland cement, lime, kiln dust products, power generation waste products, and various proprietary products due to MgO's superior buffering capacity, cost effectiveness, and ease/safety of handling.

Most, if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high pH conditions in aquifers whereas MgO creates an ideal aquifer condition with a pH of 8–10.   Additionally, magnesium, an essential element to most biological systems, is provided to soil and groundwater microbial populations during MgO-assisted metals remediation as an added benefit.

===Medical===
Magnesium oxide has poor solubility in water and is poorly absorbed from the gut. For this reason, magnesium oxide is relatively ineffective for correcting magnesium deficiency. Magnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and sour stomach, as an antacid, magnesium supplement, and as a short-term [[laxative]]. It is also used to improve symptoms of [[indigestion]]. Side effects of magnesium oxide may include nausea and cramping.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601074.html Magnesium Oxide]. MedlinePlus. Last reviewed 02/01/2009&lt;/ref&gt; In quantities sufficient to obtain a laxative effect, side effects of long-term use include [[enterolith]]s resulting in [[bowel obstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3989">A '''methane reformer''' is a device based on [[steam reforming]], [[autothermal reforming]] or [[partial oxidation]] and is a type of [[chemical synthesis]] which can produce pure [[hydrogen]] gas from [[methane]] using a [[catalyst]]. There are multiple types of reformers in development but the most common in industry are autothermal reforming (ATR) and steam methane reforming (SMR). Most methods work by exposing methane to a catalyst (usually [[nickel]]) at high temperature and pressure.

==Steam reforming==
{{main|Steam reforming}}
Steam reforming (SR), sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR) uses an external source of hot gas to heat tubes in which a catalytic reaction takes place that converts steam and lighter hydrocarbons such as methane, [[biogas]] or refinery feedstock into hydrogen and [[carbon monoxide]] (syngas).  Syngas reacts further to give more hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the reactor. The carbon oxides are removed before use by means of [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) with molecular sieves for the final purification. The PSA works by adsorbing impurities from the syngas stream to leave a pure hydrogen gas.
     CH4 + H2O (Steam)  =  CO  + 3H2 Endothermic
     CO + H2O    "     =  CO2 + H2  Exothermic

==Autothermal reforming==

[[Autothermal reforming]] (ATR) uses oxygen and carbon dioxide or steam in a reaction with methane to form [[syngas]]. The reaction takes place in a single chamber where the methane is partially oxidized. The reaction is exothermic due to the oxidation. 
When the ATR uses carbon dioxide the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO ratio produced is 1:1; when the ATR uses steam the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO ratio produced is 2.5:1

The reactions can be described in the following equations, using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

: 2CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr; 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

And using steam:

: 4CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; 10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4CO

The outlet temperature of the syngas is between 950-1100 C and outlet pressure can be as high as 100 [[bar (unit)|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topsoe.com/business_areas/methanol/Processes/AutothermalReforming.aspx Topsoe ATR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between SMR and ATR is that SMR only uses oxygen via air for combustion as a heat source to create steam, while ATR directly combusts oxygen. The advantage of ATR is that the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO can be varied, this is particularly useful for producing certain second generation [[biofuel]]s, such as [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] which requires a 1:1 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO ratio.

==Partial oxidation ==
{{main|Partial oxidation}}
Partial oxidation (POX) is a type of chemical reaction. It occurs when a substoichiometric fuel-air mixture is partially combusted in a reformer, creating a hydrogen-rich syngas which can then be put to further use. 
==Advantages and disadvantages==
The capital cost of steam reforming plants is prohibitive for small to medium size applications because the technology does not scale down well. Conventional steam reforming plants operate at pressures between 200 and 600 psi with outlet temperatures in the range of 815 to 925&amp;nbsp;°C. However, analyses have shown that even though it is more costly to construct, a well-designed SMR can produce hydrogen more cost-effectively than an ATR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblymag.com/CDA/Archives/edabe122ce5c9010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ AIA: Software Analyzes Cost of Hydrogen Production - Archives - ASSEMBLY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4408">A '''methanol reformer''' is a device used in [[chemical engineering]], especially in the area of [[fuel cell]] technology, which can produce pure [[hydrogen]] gas and [[carbon dioxide]] by reacting a [[methanol]] and [[water]] (steam) mixture.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ CH_3OH_{(g)} + H_2O_{(g)} \;\longrightarrow\; CO_2 + 3\ H_2 \qquad}  \Delta H_{R\ 298}^0 = 49.2\ \mathrm{kJ/mol} &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;small&gt;Methanol is transformed into hydrogen and carbon dioxide by pressure and heat and interaction with a [[catalysis|catalyst]].&lt;/small&gt;

== Technology ==
A mixture of water and methanol with a molar [[concentration]] ratio (water:methanol) of 1.0&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1.5 is pressurized to approximately 20 [[bar (unit)|bar]], vaporized and heated to a temperature of 250&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;360&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]. The hydrogen that is created is separated through the use of [[Pressure swing adsorption]] or a [[hydrogen-permeable membrane]] made of [[polymer]] or a [[palladium]] alloy.

There are two basic methods of conducting this process.
* The water-methanol mixture is introduced into a tube-shaped reactor where it makes contact with the catalyst. Hydrogen is then separated from the other [[reagent|reactants]] and products in a later chamber, either by pressure swing adsorption (PSA), or through use of a membrane where the majority of the hydrogen passes through. This method is typically used for larger, non-mobile units.
* The other process features an integrated reaction chamber and separation membrane, a [[membrane reactor]]. In this, relatively new approach, the reaction chamber is made to contain high-temperature, hydrogen-permeable membranes that can be formed of [[refractory metals]], palladium alloys, or a PdAg-coated [[ceramic]]. The hydrogen is thereby separated out of the reaction chamber as the reaction proceeds, This purifies the hydrogen and, as the reaction continues, increases both the reaction rate and the amount of hyrogen extracted.

With either design, not all of the hydrogen is removed from the product gases (raffinate). Since the remaining gas mixture still contains a significant amount of chemical energy, it is often mixed with air and burned to provide heat for the endothermic reforming reaction.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Methanol reformers are being considered as a component of a hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicle. A prototype car, the [[Mercedes-Benz NECAR|NECAR 5]], was introduced by [[Daimler-Chrysler]] in the year 2000. The primary advantage of a vehicle with a reformer is that it does not need a pressurized gas tank to store hydrogen fuel; instead methanol is stored as a liquid. The logistic implications of this are great; pressurized hydrogen is difficult to store and produce. Also, this could help ease the public's concern over the danger of hydrogen and thereby make fuel cell powered vehicles more attractive. However, methanol, like [[gasoline]], is toxic and (of course) flammable. The cost of the PdAg membrane and its susceptibility to damage by temperature changes provide obstacles to adoption.

While hydrogen power produces energy without CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a methanol reformer creates the gas as a byproduct. &lt;!---The high level of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere significantly contributes to [[global warming]].---&gt;

Methanol (prepared from natural gas) that is used in an efficient fuel cell, however, releases less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere than gasoline, in a net analysis.&lt;ref&gt;George A. Olah (2005). "Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy". Angewandte Chemie International Edition 44 (18): 2636–2639. {{doi|10.1002/anie.200462121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3512">'''Obvio! 828''' is a [[automobile|car]] made by [[Obvio!]]. The car was originally made by [[Dacon]] as Dacon 828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dacon.html | title = Dacon | first = Pal | last = Negyesi | accessdate = 2012-10-10 | work = KTUD Automotive Web | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120229133954/http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dacon.html | archivedate = 2012-02-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dacon was originally the Brazilian representative of [[Porsche]], but when imports were prohibited in 1976 they developed a car of their own. The name was chosen to remind one of [[Porsche 928]] and the Dacon 828 used rear lights and other Porsche parts for their car. The Dacon version was only sold between 1983 and July 1994, only 47 cars were sold. It was then powered by a 1.6 litre VW boxer engine connected to a 4 speed gearbox.

It is a [[mid-engine]] design using a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT) transmission (that also can mimic a 6 speed sequential gearbox) and powered by a 4 cylinder, inline 16 valve 1.6 liter {{convert|115|hp|abbr=on}} [[Tritec engine]] (high power version with either {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} or {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} are also available). They are described as "high performance urban cars". Fuel consumption is {{convert|12.5|km/L|abbr=on}} in the city or {{convert|17.3|km/L|abbr=on}} in highways. It is a [[flexible-fuel vehicle]] that runs on either neat [[ethanol fuel]] ([[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|E100]]) or [[gasoline]] or any mix thereof.

The chassis is designed as a series of ellipses to be strong, yet low weight. A system called "Niess Elliptical Survive Rings". The cars have three seats and are fitted with [[airbag]]s. It has [[MacPherson strut|McPherson suspension]]s and [[disc brake]]s all round. The internal and external panels of the bodyshell is made of ABS/PMMA plastic. It uses [[scissor doors]] and also has a ''Boblbee'' [[backpack]] space integrated into the design.

The 828 has a list price of {{USD|14,000}}. Extras offered are air conditioning, individual seats, power windows/rear mirror/door lock package, leather seats and an ''iMobile Carputer''.

[[Image:Ozokerite natural Paraffin wax Soldier Summit Minnind District - Colton - Wasatch County Utah 1963.jpg|thumb|right|Ozokerite, [[Wasatch County, Utah]] ]]
'''Ozokerite''' or '''ozocerite''' (Gr. Όζο ''oze'', stench, and κερί ''kero'', wax), archaically referred to as '''earthwax''' or '''earth wax''', is a naturally occurring odoriferous mineral wax or [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] found in many localities. 
==Sources==
Specimens have been obtained from [[Scotland]], [[Northumberland]], [[Wales]], as well as from about thirty different countries. Of these occurrences the ozokerite of the island (now peninsula) of [[Cheleken Peninsula|Cheleken]], near [[Türkmenbaşy Bay]], parts of the [[Himalayas]] in [[India]] and the deposits of [[Utah]] in the United States, deserve mention, though the last-named have been largely worked out. The sole sources of commercial supply are in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], at [[Boryslav]], [[Dzwiniacz]] and [[Starunia]], though the mineral is found at other points on both flanks of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]].

Ozokerite deposits are believed to have originated in much the same way as [[Vein (geology)|mineral veins]], the slow evaporation and oxidation of [[petroleum]] having resulted in the deposition of its dissolved paraffin in the fissures and crevices previously occupied by the liquid. As found native, ozokerite varies from a very soft wax to a black mass as hard as [[gypsum]].

==Properties==
Its specific gravity ranges from 0.85 to 0.95, and its melting point from {{convert|58|to|100|C|F}}. It is soluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]], petroleum, [[benzene]], [[turpentine]], [[chloroform]], [[carbon disulfide]] and others. Galician ozokerite varies in color from light yellow to dark brown, and frequently appears green owing to [[dichroism]]. It usually melts at {{convert|62|C}}. Chemically, ozokerite consists of a mixture of various [[hydrocarbon]]s, containing 85-87% by weight of carbon and 14-13% of hydrogen.

==Mining==
The mining of ozokerite began in Galicia in the 1880s, and was formerly carried on by means of hand-labor, but in the ozokerite mines owned by the [[Boryslaw Actien Gesellschaft]] and the [[Galizische Kreditbank]], the workings of which extend to a depth of {{convert|200|m}}, and {{convert|225|m}}, respectively, electrical power is employed for hauling, pumping and ventilating. In these mines there are the usual main shafts and galleries, the ozokerite being reached by levels driven along the strike of the deposit. The wax, as it reaches the surface, varies in purity, and, in new workings especially, only hand-picking is needed to separate the pure material. In other cases much earthy matter is mixed with the material, and then the rock or shale having been eliminated by hand-picking, the "wax-stone" is boiled with water in large coppers, when the pure wax rises to the surface. This is again melted without water, and the impurities are skimmed off, the material being then run into slightly conical cylindrical [[molding (process)|moulds]], and thus made into blocks for the market. The crude ozokerite is refined by treatment first with [[sulfuric acid]], and subsequently with [[charcoal]], when the [[ceresine]] or cerasin of commerce is obtained. The refined ozokerite or ceresine, which usually has a melting-point of {{convert|61|to|78|C|F}}, is largely used as an [[adulterant]] of [[beeswax]], and is frequently colored artificially to resemble that product in appearance.

On distillation in a current of superheated steam, ozokerite yields a [[candle]]-making material resembling the paraffin obtained from petroleum and shale-oil but of higher melting-point, and therefore of greater value if the candles made from it are to be used in hot climates. There are also obtained in the distillation light oils and a product resembling [[vaseline]]. The residue in the stills consists of a hard, black, waxy substance, which in admixture with [[India-rubber]] was employed under the name of [[okonite]] as an [[electrical insulator]]. From the residue a form of the material known as [[heel-ball]], used to impart a polished surface to the heels and soles of boots, was also manufactured.

Mining of ozokerite fell off after 1940 due to competition from [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]]s manufactured from [[petroleum]], but as it has a higher melting point than most petroleum waxes, it is still favored for some applications, such as electrical insulators and candles.

'''Prismane''' or '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Ladenburg benzene'''' is a [[polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] [[hydrocarbon]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. It is an [[isomer]] of [[benzene]], specifically a [[valence isomer]]. Prismane is far less stable than benzene. The carbon (and hydrogen) atoms of the prismane [[molecule]] are arranged in the shape of a six-atom [[triangular]] [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]—this compound is the parent and simplest member of the [[prismanes]] class of molecules. [[Albert Ladenburg]] proposed this structure for the compound now known as [[benzene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Albert Ladenburg|Ladenburg A.]]|title= Bemerkungen zur aromatischen Theorie| journal= [[Chemische Berichte]]| volume= 2| pages= 140–2 | year=1869 | doi= 10.1002/cber.18690020171 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Epg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound was not synthesized until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Katz T. J. |author2=Acton N. | title= Synthesis of Prismane | journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]  | year=1973 | volume=95 | pages=2738–2739|doi =10.1021/ja00789a084 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid 19th century, investigators proposed several possible structures for benzene which were consistent with its empirical formula, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which had been determined by [[Combustion analysis|combustion&amp;nbsp;analysis]]. The first, which was proposed by [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Kekulé]] in 1865, later proved to be closest to the true structure of benzene. This structure inspired several others to propose structures that were consistent with benzene's empirical formula; for example, [[Albert Ladenburg|Ladenburg]] proposed prismane, [[James Dewar|Dewar]] proposed [[Dewar benzene|Dewar&amp;nbsp;benzene]], and Koerner and Claus proposed [[Claus' benzene]]. Some of these structures would be synthesized in the following years. Prismane, like the other proposed structures for benzene, is still often cited in the literature, because it is part of the historical struggle toward understanding the mesomeric structures and [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] of benzene. Some computational chemists still research the differences between the possible isomers of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=UD Priyakumar |author2=TC Dinadayalane |author3=GN Sastry | title=A computational study of the valence isomers of benzene and their group V hetero analogs
| journal= New J. Chem.| volume= 26| pages= 347–353 | year=2002|url =http://pubs.rsc.org/ej/NJ/2002/b109067d.pdf
| doi=10.1039/b109067d | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Prismane is a colourless liquid at room temperature.  The deviation of the carbon-carbon bond angle from 109° to 60° in a [[triangle]] leads to a high [[ring strain|ring&amp;nbsp;strain]], reminiscent of that of [[cyclopropane]] but greater. The compound is explosive, which is unusual for a hydrocarbon. Due to this ring strain, the bonds have a low bond energy and break at a low [[activation energy]], which makes synthesis of the molecule difficult; Woodward and Hoffmann noted that prismane's thermal rearrangement to benzene is [[Woodward–Hoffmann rules|symmetry-forbidden]], comparing it to "an angry tiger unable to break out of a paper cage."  On account of its strain energy and the aromatic stabilization of benzene, the molecule is estimated to be 90 kcal/mole less stable than benzene, but the activation of this highly exothermic transformation is a surprisingly high 33 kcal/mol, making it persistent at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Woodward and R. Hoffmann, ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.'', '''8''', 789, (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

The substituted derivative hexamethylprismane (in which all six hydrogens are substituted by [[methyl]] groups) has a higher stability, and was synthesized by [[rearrangement reaction]]s in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lemal D. M. |author2=Lokensgard J. P. | title= Hexamethylprismane | journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]  | year=1966 | volume=88 | pages=5934–5935|doi =10.1021/ja00976a046 | issue= 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
[[Image:Prismane synthesis.svg|700px|center|thumb|Synthesis of Prismane:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.synarchive.com/syn/105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00789a084| title = Synthesis of prismane| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 95| issue = 8|page=2738| year = 1973| last1 = Katz | first1 = T.

J.| last2 = Wang | first2 = E. J.| last3 = Acton | first3 = N.| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 93| issue = 15|page=3782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The synthesis starts from [[benzvalene]] ('''1''') and [[4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-dione|4-phenyltriazolidone]] ('''2'''), which is a strong [[dienophile]]. The reaction is a stepwise [[Diels-Alder reaction|Diels-Alder like reaction]], forming a [[carbocation]] as intermediate. The adduct ('''3''') is then hydrolyzed under basic conditions and afterwards transformed into a [[copper(II) chloride]] derivative with acidic copper(II) chloride. Neutralized with a strong base, the [[azo compound]] ('''5''') could be crystallized with 65% yield. The last step is a [[photolysis]] of the azo compound. This photolysis leads to a [[biradical]] which forms prismane ('''6''') and [[nitrogen]] with a yield of less than 10%.  The compound was isolated by preparative [[gas chromatography]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8701">In [[nuclear engineering]], a '''prompt neutron''' is a [[neutron]] immediately emitted by a [[nuclear fission]] event, as opposed to a [[delayed neutron|delayed neutron decay]] which can occur within the same context, emitted after [[beta decay]] of one of the [[fission product]]s anytime from a few milliseconds to a few minutes later.

Prompt neutrons emerge from the fission of an unstable [[fissionable]] or [[fissile]] heavy nucleus almost instantaneously. There are different definitions for how long it takes for a prompt neutron to emerge. For example, the [[United States Department of Energy]] defines a prompt neutron as a neutron born from fission within 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the fission event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

This emission is controlled by the [[nuclear force]] and is extremely fast. By contrast, so-called delayed neutrons are delayed by the time delay associated with beta decay (mediated by the weak force) to the precursor excited nuclide, after which neutron emission happens on a prompt time scale (i.e., almost immediately).

==Principle==

Using [[Uranium-235|U-235]] as an example, this nucleus absorbs [[thermal neutron]]s, and the immediate mass products of a fission event are two large fission fragments, which are remnants of the formed U-236 nucleus. These fragments emit two or three free neutrons (2.5 on average), called ''prompt'' neutrons. A subsequent fission fragment occasionally undergoes a stage of radioactive decay that yields an additional neutron, called a ''delayed'' neutron. These neutron-emitting fission fragments are called ''delayed neutron precursor atoms''.

Delayed neutrons are associated with the [[beta decay]] of the fission products. After prompt fission neutron emission the residual fragments are still neutron rich and undergo a beta decay chain. The more neutron rich the fragment, the more energetic and faster the beta decay. In some cases the available energy in the beta decay is high enough to leave the residual nucleus in such a highly excited state that neutron emission instead of [[gamma ray|gamma emission]] occurs.

==Importance in nuclear fission basic research==

The   standard deviation of the final kinetic energy distribution as a function of mass of final fragments from low energy  fission of uranium 234 and uranium 236, presents a peak around light fragment masses region and another on heavy fragment masses region. Simulation by Monte Carlo method of these experiments suggests that those peaks are produced by prompt neutron emission.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brissot, J.P. Boucquet, J. Crançon,C.R. Guet, H.A. Nifenecker. and Montoya, M., "Kinetic-Energy Distribution for Symmetric Fission of 235U", Proc. of a Symp. On Phys. And Chem. Of Fission, IAEA.

==Importance in nuclear reactors==

If a [[nuclear reactor]] happened to be [[prompt critical]] - even very slightly - the number of neutrons and power output would increase exponentially at a high rate. The response time of mechanical systems like control rods is far too slow to moderate this kind of power surge. The control of the power rise would then be left to its intrinsic physical stability factors, like the thermal dilatation of the core, or the increased [[resonance absorption]]s of neutrons, that usually tend to decrease the reactor's reactivity when temperature rises; but the reactor would run the risk of being damaged or destroyed by heat.

However, thanks to the delayed neutrons, it is possible to leave the reactor in a [[subcritical]] state as far as only prompt neutrons are concerned: the delayed neutrons come a moment later, just in time to sustain the chain reaction when it is going to die out. In that regime, neutron production overall still grows exponentially, but on a time scale that is governed by the delayed neutron production, which is slow enough to be controlled (just as an otherwise unstable bicycle can be balanced because human reflexes are quick enough on the time scale of its instability). Thus, by widening the margins of non-operation and supercriticality and allowing more time to regulate the reactor, the delayed neutrons are essential to [[Passive nuclear safety|inherent reactor safety]] and even in reactors requiring active control.

==Fraction definitions==

The factor β is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\beta = \frac{\mbox{precursor atoms}}
             {\mbox{prompt neutrons}+\mbox{precursor atoms}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

and it is equal to 0.0064 for U-235.

The delayed neutron fraction (DNF) is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
DNF = \frac{\mbox{delayed neutrons}}
           {\mbox{prompt neutrons}+\mbox{delayed neutrons}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

These two factors, β and ''DNF'', are not the same thing in case of a rapid change in the number of neutrons in the reactor.

Another concept, is the ''effective fraction of delayed neutrons'', which is the fraction of delayed neutrons weighted (over space, energy, and angle) on the adjoint neutron flux. This concept arises because delayed neutrons are emitted with an energy spectrum more thermalized relative to prompt neutrons. For low enriched uranium fuel working on a thermal neutron spectrum, the difference between the average and effective delayed neutron fractions can reach 50 pcm (1 pcm = 1e-5).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?query_id=1&amp;page=0&amp;osti_id=991100 Deterministic and Monte Carlo Analyses of YALINA Thermal Subcritical Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2924">The '''Santa Rosa Storm''' occurs in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] up to fifteen days earlier than or fifteen days later than the festival of Santa Rosa of [[Lima]], [[Perú]], celebrated on August 30 each year. 

Legend has it that [[Isabel Flores de Oliva]], a.k.a. Rosa de Lima,  caused a mighty storm which prevented [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[pirate]]s from attacking the city of Lima in 1615. However, [[meteorology|meteorologists]] attribute the storm to the clash of the first warm winds which are a product of the arrival of [[Spring (season)|spring]] with [[cold front]]s.  

The legend is very popular in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], especially around the [[Rio de la Plata]] area (including [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]]) and the Argentinian province of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and the [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo region]], west of Buenos Aires.

Climate data show that the storm is one of the first to form at the end of [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]] winter, some 10 days before August 20 and September 20.

In popular belief, the Santa Rosa storm is one of the most violent of the year. However, reality is different. For the City of [[Buenos Aires]] (according to the Villa Ortúzar SMN Observatory), the storm has only appeared five days before or after the 30 August on sixteen occasions since 1861. However, showers are frequent in this period, which helps keep the myth alive. 

Of the sixteen storms, seven have occurred since 1992, probably owing to global warming.

'''Scottish Renewables''' is the representative body of the Scottish [[renewable energy]] industry. Since 1996, it has aimed to present a united voice to decision makers who make [[energy policy]].  Scottish Renewables represents over 300 members and member organisations are wide ranging across all technologies and supply chains. Scottish Renewables has developed 14 focus areas to fully represent the renewable energy industry. These include: [[offshore wind power]], [[wind power|onshore wind power]], [[bioenergy]], [[heat]], [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]], [[marine energy]], and [[microgeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scottishrenewables.com/sectors/ |title=Sectors |publisher=Scottish Renewables |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johanna Yates, offshore policy manager for Scottish Renewables, has said Scotland is the natural home to offshore renewable energy, with abundant natural resources and long heritage of maritime industry – principally oil and gas and fisheries. Scotland’s potential is well known and in recent months there has been investment from significant international players, such as Doosan, Mitsubishi and Gamesa, all vying to establish their [[wind turbine]]s in Scottish waters. Future employment for offshore wind projects is promising, with up to 28,000 direct jobs being created by 2020, leading to an economic input of £7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/environment/analysis_offshore_wind_power_is_the_best_chance_of_reaping_the_benefits_industry_has_to_offer_1_1977988 |title=Analysis: ‘Offshore wind power is the best chance of reaping the benefits industry has to offer’ |first=Johanna |last=Yates  |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NaK is highly reactive with water (like its constituent elements) and may [[Pyrophoricity|catch fire when exposed to air]], so must be handled with special precautions.

When stored in [[air]], it forms a yellow [[potassium superoxide]] coating and may ignite. This superoxide reacts explosively with water and organics. NaK is not dense enough to sink in most [[hydrocarbon]]s, but will sink in lighter [[mineral oil]]. It is unsafe to store in this manner if the superoxide has formed. A large explosion took place at the Oak Ridge [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12 facility]] on December 8, 1999, when NaK cleaned up after an accidental spill and inappropriately treated with mineral oil was scratched with a metal tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hss.energy.gov/csa/csp/aip/accidents/typea/9912y12/ |title=Y-12 NaK Accident Investigation |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=February 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528034133/http://www.hss.energy.gov/csa/csp/aip/accidents/typea/9912y12/ |archivedate=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid alloy also attacks [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] ("Teflon").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6vHjYe2pBdsC | page = 97 | title = Liquid-metals Handbook | author1 = Klinkrad, Heiner | date = October 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171221231730/https://books.google.com/books?id=6vHjYe2pBdsC | archivedate = 2017-12-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NaK has a very high [[surface tension]], which makes large amounts of it pull into a [[bun]]-like shape. Its [[specific heat capacity]] is {{nowrap|982 J/kg⋅K}}, which is roughly one quarter of that for water, but heat transfer is higher over a temperature gradient due to higher thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name="nordichardware-p2_s549"&gt;{{cite web|title=Danamics LM10 - Liquid metal put to the test|url=http://www.nordichardware.com/en/component/content/article/181-danamics-lm10-liquid-metal-put-to-the-test-.html?start=2|publisher=NordicHardware}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}} 2010-01-10 nordichardware.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
=== Coolant ===
NaK has been used as the [[coolant]] in experimental [[Fast neutron reactor|fast neutron nuclear reactor]]s. Unlike commercial plants, these are frequently shut down and defuelled. Use of [[lead]] or pure sodium, the other materials used in practical reactors, would require continual heating to maintain the coolant as a liquid. Use of NaK overcomes this. The [[Dounreay Fast Reactor]] is an example.

The Soviet [[RORSAT]] radar satellites were powered by a [[BES-5]] reactor, which was cooled with NaK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Desiccant ===
Sodium-potassium alloys are used as [[desiccant]]s in drying [[solvent]]s prior to [[distillation]], although they are inferior to [[molecular sieves]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. B. G., Lawton, M., "Drying of Organic Solvents: Quantitative Evaluation of the Efficiency of Several Desiccants", The Journal of Organic Chemistry 2010, vol. 75, 8351. {{DOI| 10.1021/jo101589h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydraulic fluid ===
NaK-77, a [[eutectic]] alloy of [[sodium]]-[[potassium]], can be used as a [[hydraulic fluid]] in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, for temperature ranges of {{convert|10|to|1400|F|C}}. Its [[bulk modulus]] at {{convert|1000|F|C}} is 310,000 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (2.14 GPa), higher than of a hydraulic oil at room temperature. Its [[lubricity]] is poor, so positive-displacement [[pump]]s are unsuitable and centrifugal pumps have to be used. Addition of [[caesium]] shifts the useful temperature range to {{convert|-95|to|1300|F|C}}. NaK-77 alloy was tested in hydraulic and fluidic systems for the [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Controlled_Bombs_and_Guided_Missiles_of.html?id=rr-LaaEJudoC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Controlled Bombs and Guided Missiles of the World War II and Cold War Eras'' 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis and production ==
Industrially, NaK is produced in a [[reactive distillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1021/ba-1957-0019.ch018|volume=19&lt;!--|isbn=978-0-8412-0020-3--&gt;|isbn=9780841221666|chapter=18|pages=169–173|last2=Werner|first2=R. C.|last1=Jackson|first1=C. B.|date=1957-01-01 |title=The Manufacture of Potassium and NaK|series=Advances in Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this continuous process, a distillation column is fed with potassium chloride and sodium. In the reaction zone, [[potassium chloride]] reacts with sodium to form [[sodium chloride]] and potassium. The lighter-boiling potassium is enriched in an upper fractionating zone and drawn at the column head while molten sodium chloride is withdrawn from the bottom.

'''TAPPS2''' ('''Technische Alternative Planungs- und Programmier-System''') is a tool used for developing software for [[solar thermal]] controllers by [[Austria]]n manufacurer [[Technische Alternative]].&lt;ref name="tappstutorial"&gt;{{cite web|title=TAPPS Tutorial|periodical=|publisher=Technische Alternative|url=https://www.ta.co.at/fileadmin/Downloads/Software/Tapps/TAPPS_Tutorial_1.29_DE.pdf|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-01-22|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary usecase is defining the exact reaction of the controller to a certain event. Other than its predecessor, TAPPS, which could only be used to program controllers of type UVR1611, TAPPS2 can also be used to program type UVR16x2 controllers, as well as several control modules.&lt;ref name="devices"&gt;{{Cite book|title=TAPPS2 Manual|last=|first=|publisher=Technische Alternative|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tonite''' is an [[explosive]] sometimes used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It consists of a mixture of equal weights of [[barium nitrate]] and [[guncotton]]. 
According to "Nitro-Explosives: A Practical Treatise" by P. Gerald Sanford (available via [[Project Gutenberg]]): "The products of perfectly detonated gun-cotton may be expressed by the following equation: 2C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 18CO + 6CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 14H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 12N. It does not therefore contain sufficient oxygen for the complete combustion of its carbon."
The production of [[carbon monoxide]] is dangerous in mining operations in particular, so additional [[oxygen]] is provided by mixing a nitrate compound with the [[guncotton]]. Various nitrates have been used ([[nitre]], [[potassium nitrate]], [[barium nitrate]], [[ammonium nitrate]]).
The explosive was patented by Messrs Trench, Faure, and Mackie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improvement in explosive compounds|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US187155|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The high gas pressures generated by [[detonation]] of Tonite resulted in it being used as a bursting charge for some early [[hand grenades]] used in [[World War I]].
Its name was taken from the [[Latin]] verb ''tonat'' = "it [[thunder]]s", and is pronounced "toe-nite" and not as "tonight".

'''United Arab Airlines Flight 749''' was a scheduled international passenger flight on 18 March 1966 that crashed while attempting to land in [[Cairo]], Egypt. All thirty passengers and crew on board were killed.

==Crash==
Flight 749 took off from [[Nicosia Airport]] bound for [[Cairo International Airport]]. En route, the aircraft encountered bad weather and conditions were poor in Cairo due to the presence of [[Dust storm|sandstorms]]. The crew of Flight 749 contacted Mirsair's Operations about diversion options. The flight crew also reported they were flying through thunderstorms with icing conditions, that two of the aircraft's altimeters were giving different readings, the magnetic compass being unserviceable, and that there was a crack in a cockpit window panel due to the thunderstorms. After diverting was discussed, Flight 749 continued to Cairo. The flight was cleared for a Runway 23 approach but crashed approximately 5 kilometres from it. Everyone on board Flight 749 perished in the accident.

After the crash, the sandstorm hampered rescue operations. Visibility was near zero and rescue vehicles became bogged down in the drifting sands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mwxSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9TQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6637,3356541&amp;dq=nicosia+plane+crash&amp;hl=en Plane crashes in sandstorm; 30 fear perish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1966/03/19/page/44/article/fear-30-flying-to-cairo-die-in-sandstorm Fear 30 flying to Cairo die in sandstorm ]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Among those killed in the crash was Yemen's Agriculture Minister, Ali Mohammad Abdou.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vjA_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cFEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4322,2452546&amp;hl=en Crash kills Minister, 29 others]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Accident investigators determined that "the accident arose from the descent of the aircraft below the safe flight altitude in the final approach and the impact of the port wing against the sand dunes lying to the northeast of the aerodrome. As a result the pilot lost control of his aircraft and hit the ground.

It is probable that the cause of descent of the aircraft below the safe level was due to the change from IFR to VFR, taking into consideration that considerable time would have been needed for the pilot to have adapted to this change in the prevailing weather conditions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19660318-0 Aircraft accident Antonov 24B SU-AOA Cairo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''wet scrubber''' describes a variety of devices that remove [[pollutant]]s from a [[furnace]] [[flue gas]] or from other gas streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted  gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.

== Design ==
{{see also|Particle collection in wet scrubbers}}
[[File:venturimistelim.gif|thumb|A [[venturi scrubber]] design. The mist eliminator for a venturi scrubber is often a separate device called a cyclonic separator]]
[[File:packedtowerex.gif|thumb|A packed bed tower design where the mist eliminator is built into the top of the structure. Various tower designs exist]]

The design of wet scrubbers or any air pollution control device depends on the industrial process conditions and the nature of the air pollutants involved. Inlet gas characteristics and dust properties (if [[particulate|particles]] are present) are of primary importance. Scrubbers can be designed to collect particulate matter and/or gaseous pollutants. The versatility of wet scrubbers allow them to be built in numerous configurations, all designed to provide good contact between the liquid and polluted gas stream.

Wet scrubbers remove dust particles by ''capturing'' them in liquid  droplets. The droplets are then collected, the liquid ''dissolving'' or ''absorbing''  the pollutant gases. Any droplets that are in the scrubber inlet gas must be separated from the outlet gas stream by means of another device referred to as a [[Entrainment (engineering)|mist]] eliminator or [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrainment]] separator (these terms are interchangeable). Also, the resultant scrubbing liquid must be treated prior to any ultimate discharge or being reused in the plant.

A wet scrubber's ability to collect small particles is often directly proportional to the power input into the scrubber. Low energy devices such as [[spray towers]] are used to collect particles larger than 5 micrometers. To obtain high efficiency removal of 1 micrometer (or less) particles generally requires high-energy devices such as venturi scrubbers or augmented devices such as condensation scrubbers. Additionally, a properly designed and operated entrainment separator or mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal efficiencies. The greater the number of liquid droplets that are not captured by the mist eliminator, the higher the potential emission levels.

Wet scrubbers that remove gaseous pollutants are referred to as ''absorbers''. Good [[Liquid-to-gas ratio|gas-to-liquid contact]] is essential to obtain high removal efficiencies in absorbers.  Various wet-scrubber designs are used to remove gaseous pollutants, with the [[packed bed|packed tower]] and the [[theoretical plate|plate]] tower being the most common.

If the gas stream contains both particulate matter and gases, wet scrubbers are generally the only single air pollution control device that can remove both pollutants. Wet scrubbers can achieve high removal efficiencies for either particles or gases and, in some instances, can achieve a high removal efficiency for both pollutants in the same system. However, in many cases, the best operating conditions for particles collection are the poorest for gas removal.

In general, obtaining high simultaneous gas and particulate removal efficiencies requires that one of them be easily collected (i.e., that the gases are very soluble in the liquid or that the particles are large and readily captured), or by the use of a scrubbing reagent such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[sodium hydroxide]].

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

For particulate control, wet scrubbers (also referred to as wet collectors) are evaluated against [[fabric filter]]s and [[electrostatic precipitator]]s (ESPs). Some ''advantages'' of wet scrubbers over these devices are as follows:

* Wet scrubbers have the ability to handle high [[temperature]]s and [[moisture]].
* In wet scrubbers, flue gases are cooled, resulting in smaller overall size of equipment.
* Wet scrubbers can remove both gases and particulate matter.
* Wet scrubbers can neutralize [[corrosion|corrosive]] gases.

Some ''disadvantages'' of wet scrubbers include corrosion, the need for entrainment separation or mist removal to obtain high efficiencies and the need for treatment or reuse of spent liquid.

Wet scrubbers have been used in a variety of industries such as [[acid plant]]s, [[fertilizer]] plants, [[steel mill]]s, [[asphalt]] plants, and large [[power plant]]s.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Relative advantages and disadvantages of wet scrubbers compared to other control devices
|-
! Advantages
! Disadvantages
|-
| 
* Small space requirements: Scrubbers reduce the temperature and volume of the unsaturated exhaust stream. Therefore, vessel sizes, including fans and ducts downstream, are smaller than those of other control devices. Smaller sizes result in lower capital costs and more flexibility in site location of the scrubber.
* No secondary dust sources: Once particulate matter is collected, it cannot escape from hoppers or during transport.
* Handles high-temperature, high-humidity gas streams: No temperature limits or condensation problems can occur as in baghouses or ESPs.
* Minimal fire and explosion hazards: Various dry dusts are flammable. Using water eliminates the possibility of explosions.
* Ability to collect both gases and particulate matter.
| 
* Corrosion problems: Water and dissolved pollutants can form highly corrosive acid solutions. Proper construction materials are very important. Also, wet-dry interface areas can result in corrosion.
* High power requirements: High collection efficiencies for particulate matter are attainable only at high pressure drops, resulting in high operating costs.
* [[Water pollution]] problems: [[Settling pond]]s or sludge [[clarifier]]s may be needed to meet [[Industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater]] regulations.
* Difficult product recovery: Dewatering and drying of scrubber sludge make recovery of any dust for reuse very expensive and difficult.

'''Wet Scrubber Repairs'''

Various factors in addition to time and use can cause a chemical or particulate scrubber to degrade and operate less efficiently. Unfortunately, if your equipment is not working properly, your operations could be negatively affected, and because of this, it is extremely important to conduct scrubber repairs, retrofits and upgrades as soon as they are needed. Here are the most common issues for wet scrubbers:
* Corrosion removal/repair
* Instrumentation replacement, calibration, tuning
* Motor, fan, pump, and metering pump maintenance/repair
* Equipment wash-outs

== Components ==

Wet scrubber systems generally consist of the following components:

* Ductwork and [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]] system
* A saturation chamber (optional)
* Scrubbing vessel
* Entrainment separator or mist eliminator
* Pumping (and possible recycle system)
* Spent scrubbing liquid treatment and/or reuse system
* An exhaust [[Flue gas stacks|stack]]

A typical wet scrubbing process can be described as follows:

* Hot flue gas from a furnace enters a saturator (if present) where gases are cooled and humidified prior to entering the scrubbing area. The saturator removes a small percentage of the particulate matter present in the flue gas.
* Next, the gas enters a [[venturi scrubber]] where approximately half of the gases are removed. Venturi scrubbers have a minimum particle removal efficiency of 95%.
* The gas flows through a second scrubber, a [[packed bed|packed bed absorber]], where the rest of the gases (and particulate matter) are collected.
* An entrainment separator or mist eliminator removes any liquid droplets that may have become entrained in the flue gas.
* A recirculation pump moves some of the spent scrubbing liquid back to the [[venturi scrubber]] where it is recycled and the remainder is sent to a [[industrial wastewater treatment|treatment system]].
* Treated scrubbing liquid is recycled back to the saturator and the [[packed bed|packed bed absorber]].
* [[Fan (mechanical)|Fans]] and ductwork move the flue gas stream through the system and eventually out the [[Flue gas stacks|stack]].

== Categorization ==

Since wet scrubbers vary greatly in complexity and method of operation, devising categories into which all of them neatly fit is extremely difficult. Scrubbers for particle collection are usually categorized by the gas-side [[pressure drop]] of the system. Gas-side pressure drop refers to the pressure difference, or [[pressure drop]], that occurs as the exhaust gas is pushed or pulled through the scrubber, disregarding the pressure that would be used for pumping or spraying the liquid into the scrubber.

Scrubbers may be classified ''by pressure drop'' as follows:

* ''Low-energy scrubbers'' have pressure drops of less than 12.7&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;in) of water.
* ''Medium-energy scrubbers'' have pressure drops between 12.7 and 38.1&amp;nbsp;cm (5 and 15 in) of water.
* ''High-energy scrubbers'' have pressure drops greater than 37.1&amp;nbsp;cm (15&amp;nbsp;in) of water.

However, most scrubbers operate over a wide range of [[pressure drop]]s, depending on their specific application, thereby making this type of categorization difficult.

Another way to classify wet scrubbers is by their ''use'' - to primarily collect either [[particulates]] or gaseous pollutants. Again, this distinction is not always clear since scrubbers can often be used to remove both types of pollutants.

Wet scrubbers can also be categorized by the manner in which the gas and liquid phases are brought into contact. Scrubbers are designed to use power, or energy, from the gas stream or the liquid stream, or some other method to bring the pollutant gas stream into contact with the liquid. These categories are given in '''Table 2'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/apti/ US EPA Air Pollution Training Institute] developed in collaboration with North Carolina State University, College of Engineering (NCSU)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material of construction and design ==

Corrosion can be a prime problem associated with chemical industry scrubbing systems. [[Fibre-reinforced plastic]] and dual keys are often used as most dependable materials of construction.

'''Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field''' is a facility managed by the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU) for testing of [[wind turbine]]s with a pinnacle height up to {{convert|330|m|ft}}&lt;ref name="DTU Wind Energy"&gt;{{cite web|title=DTU Wind Energy|url=http://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english/test-centers/oesterild}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Thisted]]-Østerild, [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/%c3%b8sterild--nationalt-testcenter-for-store-vindm%c3%b8ller(onshore)-denmark-dk78.html |title=Østerild: Nationalt testcenter for store vindmøller(onshore) - 4C Offshore|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area was plagued by [[Saltation (geology)|flying sand]] from about 1450, and a plantation was started from 1889 to keep the sand in check.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/oesterild-klitplantage/historie/ |title=Historie|publisher=[[Danish Nature Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international [[IEC 61400]] standard specifies how to design and validate wind turbines to gain commercial value.&lt;ref name=iec61400&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec61400-1%7Bed3.0%7Den.pdf International Standard IEC 61400-1, Third Edition] ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'', August 2005. Accessed: 12 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A suitable area for testing wind turbines must have good wind, a specific [[surface roughness]], a clear area around the site, and not be in an EU [[Special Protection Area]]. After investigating 17 areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/planlaegning/landskab/landskabsinteresser/anlaeg-i-landskabet/vindmoeller/oesterild-nationalt-testcenter-for-vindmoeller/saadan-blev-oesterild-valgt/ |title=Sådan blev Østerild valgt|publisher=[[Danish Nature Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/vindmolleindustrien-derfor-hastede-osterild-beslutning-131593 |title=Vindmølleindustrien: Derfor hastede Østerild-beslutning|work=[[Ingeniøren]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Folketing]] decided in June 2010 to establish a wind turbine test center at Østerild. It was inaugurated in 2012,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and is popular among tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/turister-elsker-kaempe-vindmoeller-173866 |title=Turister elsker kæmpe-vindmøller|work=[[Ingeniøren]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[visitor center]] opened in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english/news/nyhed?id=6E5EE366-337B-4841-A05D-DE5A597F6C1D |title=Enthusiasm in Thy for the Test Centre for Large Wind Turbines in Østerild |date= 26 September 2017 |first=Mette Bischoff |last=Kristiansen |publisher=[[Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy]] / DTU Wind Energy|work=vindenergi.dtu.dk |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New ponds and open areas have improved conditions for bats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturstyrelsen.dk/media/132325/sr133_first-year-monitoring-bats-birds-%C3%B8sterild.pdf Monitoring bats and birds] [[Danish Nature Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/nyheder/2015/jan/fugle-undviger-testcenterets-vindmoeller/ |title=Fugle undviger testcenterets vindmoeller |publisher=[[Danish Nature Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[sea eagle]]s came to the area in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/lokale-enheder/lokale-nyheder/2015/jul/havoerne-unger-i-thy/ |title=Havørne-unger i Thy |publisher=[[Danish Nature Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
There are 7 test stands, and each test stand has its own meteorological mast due west. Some stands were not yet put in use in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/endelig-bliver-testcenter-oesterild-fyldt-op-171063 |title=Endelig bliver Testcenter Østerild fyldt op|work=Ingeniøren}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the wind turbine industry requested more stands to fulfill future test requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ing.dk/artikel/industrien-oensker-flere-testpladser-til-store-vindmoeller-181938 |title=Industrien ønsker flere testpladser til store vindmøller|work=[[Ingeniøren]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbines are not permanent, but spend some months in test at the site before being replaced by the next turbines.

At the northern and the southern end of the test field, there are two 250 metre tall guyed masts equipped with lamps to warn aircraft.

The masts are situated at {{coord|57.087056|N|8.880673|E |type:landmark|name=Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field Lighting Mast North}} and at {{coord|57.048882|N|8.880799|E |type:landmark|name=Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field Lighting Mast South}}.
