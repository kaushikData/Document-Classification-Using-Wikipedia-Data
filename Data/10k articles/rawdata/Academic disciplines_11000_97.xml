[[File:Mackie CFX12 Live Sound Mixer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mackie CFX12 Live Sound Mixer]]
An '''aux-send''' (auxiliary send) is an electronic signal-routing output used on  multi-channel sound [[mixing console]]s used in recording and broadcasting settings and on [[PA system]] amplifier-mixers used in music concerts. The signal from the auxiliary send is often routed through outboard audio processing [[effects unit]]s (e.g., reverb, digital delay, compression, etc.) and then returned to the mixer using an auxiliary return input jack, thus creating an [[effects loop]]. This allows effects to be added to an audio source or channel within the mixing console. Another common use of the aux send mix is to create monitor mixes for the onstage performers' [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] or [[in-ear monitors]]. The aux send's monitor mix is usually different from the front of house mix the audience is hearing.

==Purpose==
The routing configuration and usage of an aux-send will vary depending on the application. Two types of aux-sends commonly exist: pre-fader and post-fader. Pre-fader sends are not affected by the main fader for the channel, while post-fader sends ones are affected by the position of the main fader slider control for the channel.

In a common configuration, a post-fader aux-send output is connected to the audio input of an outboard (i.e., an external [usually rack-mounted] unit that is not part of the mixer console) audio [[effects unit]] (most commonly a temporal/time-based effect such as [[reverb]] or [[delay (audio effect)|delay]]; [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]]s and other dynamic processors would normally be on an [[Insert (effects processing)|insert]], instead). The audio output of the outboard unit is then connected to the aux-return input on the mixing console (if the recording console has one), or, alternatively, it can be looped back to one of the console's unused input channels. A post-fader output is used in order to prevent channels whose faders are at zero gain from "contaminating" the effects-return loop with hiss and hum.

Mixing consoles most commonly have a group of aux-send knobs in each channel strip, or, on small mixers, a single aux-send knob per channel, where one knob corresponds to each aux-send on the board. The controls enable the operator to adjust the amount of signal that will be sent from its corresponding channel into the signal bus routed to its corresponding aux-send output. The largest, most expensive mixers have a number of aux-send knobs on every channel, thus giving the audio engineer the flexibility to create many live sound and/or recording applications for the mixer.

[[File:ALTO S-8 mixer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Alto S-8 mixer has two knobs for controlling the aux-send mix (the third and fourth knobs from the bottom).]]
A benefit of using an aux-send is that it enables the signals from multiple channels on a mixing console to be simultaneously routed to a single outboard device. For instance, audio signals from all the channels of a sixteen-channel mixing console can be routed to a single outboard reverb unit so that all channels are heard with reverb. 

The aux-sends from a group of inputs can also be routed to an amplifier and then sent to [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speaker]]s so that the onstage musicians can hear their singing or playing through monitor wedge speakers on the stage or through [[in ear monitor]]s. The benefit of using the pre-fader aux-send function is that the volume of the vocals or instruments in the monitor mix does not have to be the same as the "front-of-house" mix for the audience. Musicians whose voices are barely present in the "front-of-house" mix, such as [[backup vocal]]ists, can have their sound clearly and loudly sent through a monitor speaker so that they can hear themselves singing and ensure that their pitch and timing is correct.

'''Bats''' are the only mammal capable of '''true flight'''. Bats use flight for capturing prey, breeding, avoiding predators, and long-distance migration. Bat wing morphology is often highly specialized to the needs of the species.

==Evolution==
[[Charles Darwin]] foresaw an issue with his theory of evolution by natural selection in the evolution of [[complex traits]] such as eyes or "the structure and habits of a bat."&lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;Darwin, C. (1968). On the origin of species by means of natural selection. 1859. London: Murray Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the oldest [[Onychonycteris|bat fossils]] are very similar in wing morphology to the bats of today, despite living and dying 52.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Sears 2006"&gt;Sears, K. E., Behringer, R. R., Rasweiler, J. J., &amp; Niswander, L. A. (2006). Development of bat flight: morphologic and molecular evolution of bat wing digits. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103(17), 6581-6586.&lt;/ref&gt; The common ancestor of all bats is hypothesized to have been an [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] of the [[northern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Teeling 2005"&gt;Teeling, E. C., Springer, M. S., Madsen, O., Bates, P., O'brien, S. J., &amp; Murphy, W. J. (2005). A molecular phylogeny for bats illuminates biogeography and the fossil record. Science, 307(5709), 580-584.&lt;/ref&gt; This ancestor is predicted to have lived 64 million years ago at the border of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|Cretaceous and Paleogene]], based on molecular and paleontological data.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2008"&gt;Cooper, K. L., &amp; Tabin, C. J. (2008). Understanding of bat wing evolution takes flight. Genes &amp; development, 22(2), 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a gap in the fossil record, and no transitional fossils exist from this quadrupedal ancestor to the appearance of the modern bat. It is unclear how long the transition from quadrupedalism to powered flight took. After evolving powered flight, bats underwent massive [[adaptive radiation]], becoming the second-most speciose [[mammal classification|mammal order]], after [[rodent]]s.&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;Nowak, R. M. (1994). Walker's bats of the world. JHU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have shown that, rather than having evolved from gliders, the ancestors of bats were flutterers.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Matt |title=Ancient bats got in a flap over food |journal=Nature|year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations for flight==
To make powered flight possible, bats had to evolve several features. Bat flight necessitated the increase of membrane surface area between the digits of the forelimbs, between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, and between the hindlimbs.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2008"/&gt; Bats also had to evolve a thinner cortical bone to reduce torsional stresses produced by propulsive downstroke movements.&lt;ref name="Swartz 1992"&gt;Swartz, S. M., Bennett, M. B., &amp; Carrier, D. R. (1992). Wing bone stresses in free flying bats and the evolution of skeletal design for flight. Nature, 359(6397), 726.&lt;/ref&gt; Bats had to reroute innervation to their wing muscles to allow for control of powered flight.&lt;ref name="Thewissen 1991"&gt;Thewissen, J. G. M., &amp; Babcock, S. K. (1991). Distinctive cranial and cervical innervation of wing muscles: new evidence for bat monophyly. Science, 251(4996), 934-937.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength and mass of forelimb musculature also had to be increased to allow powerful upstrokes and downstrokes.&lt;ref name="Thewissen 1992"&gt;Thewissen, J. G. M., &amp; Babcock, S. K. (1992). The origin of flight in bats. BioScience, 42(5), 340-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wing shape==

=== Wing chord ===
The [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]] length of a bat wing is the distance from the [[leading edge]] to the [[trailing edge]] measured parallel to the direction of flight. The mean chord length &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt; is a standardized measure which captures a representative chord length over a whole flap cycle. Given wing area ''S'', and wingspan ''b'', the mean chord can be calculated by,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/468014494|title=Bird flight performance : a practical calculation manual|last=J.|first=Pennycuick, Colin|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198577214|oclc=468014494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Von Busse|first=R.|last2=Hedenstrom|first2=A.|last3=Winter|first3=Y.|last4=Johansson|first4=L. C.|date=2012-10-11|title=Kinematics and wing shape across flight speed in the bat, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/bio.20122964|journal=Biology Open|volume=1|issue=12|pages=1226–1238|doi=10.1242/bio.20122964|issn=2046-6390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{c} = \frac{S}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

===Aspect ratio===
[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)|Aspect ratio]] has been calculated with different definitions. The two methods outlined here give different, non-comparable values. The first method of calculation uses the wingspan ''b'', and the wing area ''S,'' and is given by,&lt;ref name="Farney 1969"&gt;Farney, J., &amp; Fleharty, E. D. (1969). Aspect ratio, loading, wing span, and membrane areas of bats. Journal of Mammalogy, 50(2), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedenström|first=A.|last2=Johansson|first2=L. C.|last3=Wolf|first3=M.|last4=Busse|first4=R. von|last5=Winter|first5=Y.|last6=Spedding|first6=G. R.|date=2007-05-11|title=Bat Flight Generates Complex Aerodynamic Tracks|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5826/894|journal=Science|language=en|volume=316|issue=5826|pages=894–897|doi=10.1126/science.1142281|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17495171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-10-01|title=Recent progress in flapping wing aerodynamics and aeroelasticity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376042110000023|journal=Progress in Aerospace Sciences|language=en|volume=46|issue=7|pages=284–327|doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2010.01.001|issn=0376-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{AR} \equiv \frac{b^2}{S} = \frac{b}{\bar{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this definition, typical values of aspect ratio fall between 5 and 11 depending on the wing morphology of a given species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Faster flight speed is significantly correlated with higher aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Findley 1972"&gt;Findley, J. S., Studier, E. H., &amp; Wilson, D. E. (1972). Morphologic properties of bat wings. Journal of Mammalogy, 53(3), 429-444.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher aspect ratios decrease the energetic costs of flight, which is beneficial to migratory species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;

Another way to calculate the wing aspect ratio is by taking the length of the wrist to the tip of the third finger, adding the length of the forearm, and then dividing that total by the distance from the wrist to the fifth finger.&lt;ref name="Freeman 1981"&gt;Freeman, P. W. (1981). A multivariate study of the family Molossidae (Mammalia, Chiroptera): morphology, ecology, evolution. Mammalogy papers: University of Nebraska State Museum, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wing loading===
[[Wing loading]] is the weight of the bat divided by the wing area and is reported in the units, &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Given a bat of mass ''m'', the wing loading ''Q'' is,

&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{m g}{S}&lt;/math&gt;

For bats, wing loading values typically range from 4 to 35 N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the bat species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Mass loading differs only by a constant ''[[Gravity of Earth|g]]'', and is reported as &lt;math&gt;\frac{kg}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;as opposed to &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a meta analysis covering 257 species of bats, higher relative wing loading values were observed in bats which fly at higher velocities, while lower wing loading values were correlated with improved flight maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Additionally, bats with lower wing loading were seen to have better mass-carrying ability, and were able carry larger prey while flying.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;

===Wingtips===
Bats with larger wingtips have slower flight speeds.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Wings with rounded tips have lower aspect ratios, and are associated with slower, more maneuverable flight.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

==Wing morphology as it relates to ecology==
===Fast hawking===
Bats that consume insects by hawking (aerial pursuit and capture) must be able to travel at fast speeds, and must employ a high level of maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"&gt;Norberg and Rayner (1987). Ecological morphology and flight in bats (Mammalia; Chiroptera): wing adaptations, flight performance, foraging strategy and echolocation. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences 316.1179 (1987): 335–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological adaptations that favor this style of flight include high wing loading, long and pointed wingtips, and wings with high aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The bat family [[Molossidae]] is considered highly specialized at hawking, with unusually high aspect ratios and wing loading.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; These traits make them capable of incredibly-fast speeds. [[Mexican free-tailed bat]]s are thought to be the fastest animal on earth, capable of horizontal flight speeds over a level surface up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/hr (99&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name="McCracken 2016"&gt;McCracken, G. F., Safi, K., Kunz, T. H., Dechmann, D. K., Swartz, S. M., &amp; Wikelski, M. (2016). Airplane tracking documents the fastest flight speeds recorded for bats. Royal Society Open Science, 3(11), 160398.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gleaning===
Bats that glean insects capture stationary prey on a solid substrate. This foraging method requires bats to hover above the substrate and listen for insect noises.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2000"&gt;Schmidt, S., Hanke, S., &amp; Pillat, J. (2000). The role of echolocation in the hunting of terrestrial prey–new evidence for an underestimated strategy in the gleaning bat, Megaderma lyra. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 186(10), 975-988.&lt;/ref&gt; Short, rounded wingtips in gleaning bats may be advantageous to allow maneuverability of flight in cluttered airspace.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Pointed wingtips may be detrimental to a bat's ability to glean insects.&lt;ref name="Stoffberg 2004"&gt;Stoffberg, S., &amp; Jacobs, D. S. (2004). The influence of wing morphology and echolocation on the gleaning ability of the insectivorous bat ''Myotis tricolor''. Canadian journal of zoology, 82(12), 1854-1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trawling===
Bats with this foraging style pluck insects off the surface of a body of water. [[Piscivore]]s employ the same flight style to catch fish just below the water's surface.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Trawling bats travel at slower speeds, which means that they require low wing loading.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Frugivory===
[[Frugivore]]s have below-average aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Fruit-eating bats have variable wing-loading, which corresponds to vertical stratification of rain forests.&lt;ref name="Hodgkison 2004"&gt;Hodgkison, R., Balding, S. T., Zubaid, A., &amp; Kunz, T. H. (2004). Habitat structure, wing morphology, and the vertical stratification of Malaysian fruit bats (Megachiroptera: Pteropodidae). Journal of Tropical Ecology, 20(06), 667-673.&lt;/ref&gt; Fruit-eating bats that travel below the canopy have higher wing-loading; bats that travel above the canopy have intermediate wing-loading; bats that travel in the understory have low wing-loading.&lt;ref name="Hodgkison 2004"/&gt; This pattern of decreasing wing-loading as airspace becomes more cluttered is consistent with data that suggest that lower wing-loading is associated with greater maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Nectarivory===
[[Nectarivore]]s, like gleaners, will frequently employ hovering during foraging. Hovering nectarivores are more likely to have rounded wingtips, which aids in maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores that land on the flower before feeding have worse maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores in general have lower aspect ratios, which makes them more suited to flight in a cluttered environment.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores that migrate to seasonal food resources, such as the genus ''[[Leptonycteris]]'', have lower wing-loading than nectarivorous species with small home ranges.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Carnivory===
Bats that consume non-insect animal prey are benefited by low wing-loading, which allows them to lift and carry larger prey items.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; This increased capacity for lift even allows them to take flight from the ground while carrying a prey item that is half of their body weight.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Sanguinivory===
The three species of [[Hematophagy|sanguinivorous]] bats belong to the subfamily [[Vampire bat|Desmodontinae]]. These bats are characterized by relatively high wing-loading and short or average wingspans.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The high wing-loading allows them faster flight speeds, which is advantageous when they have to commute long distances from their roosts to find prey.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[common vampire bat]] has an average aspect ratio and very short, slightly rounded wingtips.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[hairy-legged vampire bat]] has the lowest aspect ratio of the three species; it also has relatively long and rounded wingtips.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Hairy-legged vampire bats are more adapted to maneuverable flights than the other two species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[white-winged vampire bat]] has the highest aspect ratio of the three species, which means it is most adapted to long flights.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

H.|publisher=Academic Press, London|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=121-122}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as larger invertebrates, such as [[crustacean]]s and [[polychaete]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baybenthos.versar.com/benthos.htm |title=What Are Benthos? |publisher=Baybenthos.versar.com |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Organisms here generally live in close relationship with the substrate and many are permanently attached to the bottom. The [[benthic boundary layer]], which includes the bottom layer of water and the uppermost layer of sediment directly influenced by the overlying water, is an integral part of the benthic zone, as it greatly influences the biological activity that takes place there. Examples of contact soil layers include [[sand]] bottoms, rocky outcrops, [[coral]], and [[bay mud]].

==Description==
The benthic region of the ocean begins at the shore line ([[intertidal zone|intertidal]] or [[littoral zone]]) and extends downward along the surface of  the [[continental shelf]] out to sea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Angelo Mark P. Walag |author2=Mae Oljae P. Canencia |title = Physico-chemical Parameters and Macrobenthic Invertebrates of the Intertidal Zone of Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines |journal=Advances in Environmental Sciences - International Journal of the Bioflux Society |year=2016 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=71–82 |url = https://www.academia.edu/17269986/Physico-chemical_Parameters_and_Macrobenthic_Invertebrates_of_the_Intertidal_Zone_of_Gusa_Cagayan_de_Oro_City_Philippines |accessdate = 2015-12-08}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- article uses the word "benthic" but never defines it --&gt; The continental shelf is a gently sloping benthic region that extends away from the land mass. At the continental shelf edge, usually about 200 meters deep, the gradient greatly increases and is known as the continental slope. The continental slope drops down to the deep sea floor. The deep-sea floor is called the [[abyssal plain]] and is usually about 4,000 meters deep. The ocean floor is not all flat but has [[Mid-ocean ridge|submarine ridges]] and deep [[ocean trench]]es known as the [[hadal zone]].

For comparison, the [[pelagic zone]] is the descriptive term for the ecological region above the benthos, including the water-column up to the surface. Depending on the water-body, the benthic zone may include areas that are only a few inches below water, such as a stream or shallow pond; at the other end of the spectrum, benthos of the deep ocean includes the bottom levels of the oceanic [[abyssal zone]].

For information on animals that live in the deeper areas of the oceans see [[aphotic zone]]. Generally, these include life forms that tolerate cool [[temperature]]s and low [[oxygen]] levels, but this depends on the depth of the water.

==Organisms==
{{main article|Benthos}}
Benthos are the organisms that live in the benthic zone, and are different from those elsewhere in the [[water column]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2016}} Many have adapted to live on the substrate (bottom). In their habitats they can be considered as dominant creatures, but they are often a source of prey for [[Carcharhinidae]] such as the [[lemon shark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright|first=Michael|title=The private life of sharks: the truth behind the myth|year=2000|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-8117-2875-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the water column. The pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] for each 10 meters of water depth).

Because light does not penetrate very deep into ocean-water, the energy source for the benthic ecosystem is often organic matter from higher up in the water column that drifts down to the depths. This [[detritus|dead and decaying matter]] sustains the benthic [[food chain]]; most organisms in the benthic zone are [[scavenger]]s or [[detritivore]]s. Some [[microorganism]]s use [[chemosynthesis]] to produce [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].

Benthic organisms can be divided into two categories based on whether they make their home on the ocean floor or an inch or two into the ocean floor. Those living on the surface of the ocean floor are known as [[epifauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epifaunal |title=Epifaunal - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who live burrowed into the ocean floor are known as [[infauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infauna |title=Infauna - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremophiles, including [[piezophile]]s, which thrive in high pressures, may also live there.

==Nutrient flux==
Sources of food for benthic communities can derive from the water column above these habitats in the form of aggregations of [[detritus]], inorganic matter, and living organisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- It says "most benthic organisms feed on debris that settle on the bottom of the water" but where does it support that they eat living organisms from above? Sorry if I missed it or misunderstand it.--&gt; These aggregations are commonly referred to as [[marine snow]], and are important for the deposition of organic matter, and bacterial communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alldredge|first=Alice|author2=Silver, Mary W.|title=Characteristics, dynamics and significance of marine snow|journal=Progress in Oceanography|year=1988|volume=20|pages=41–82|doi=10.1016/0079-6611(88)90053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount of material sinking to the ocean floor can average 307,000 aggregates per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shanks|first=Alan|author2=Trent, Jonathan D.|title=Marine snow: sinking rates and potential role in vertical flux|journal=Deep-Sea Research|year=1980|volume=27A|pages=137–143|doi=10.1016/0198-0149(80)90092-8|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount will vary on the depth of the benthos, and the degree of benthic-pelagic coupling. The benthos in a shallow region will have more available food than the benthos in the deep sea. Because of their reliance on it, microbes may become spatially dependent on detritus in the benthic zone. The microbes found in the benthic zone, specifically [[dinoflagellates]] and [[foraminifera]], colonize quite rapidly on detritus matter while forming a symbiotic relationship with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bprc.osu.edu/geo/projects/foram/whatarefor.htm | title=Foraminifera | accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GeolSci/micropal/foram.html#histofstudy | title=foraminifera | accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitats==
Modern seafloor mapping technologies have revealed linkages between seafloor geomorphology and benthic habitats, in which suites of benthic communities are associated with specific geomorphic settings.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K. 2012. "GeoHab Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats – synthesis and lessons learned", in: Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K. (eds.), ''Seafloor Geomorphology as Benthic Habitat: GeoHab Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats''. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 871-890.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include cold-water coral communities associated with seamounts and submarine canyons, kelp forests associated with inner shelf rocky reefs and rockfish associated with rocky escarpments on continental slopes.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K.; 2012. ''Seafloor Geomorphology as Benthic Habitat: GeoHab Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats''. Elsevier, Amsterdam, p. 947.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ocean]]ic environments, benthic [[habitats]] can also be zoned by depth. From the shallowest to the deepest are: the [[epipelagic]] (less than 200 meters), the [[mesopelagic]] (200–1,000 meters), the [[bathyal]] (1,000–4,000 meters), the [[abyssal]] (4,000–6,000 meters) and the deepest, the [[hadal]] (below 6,000 meters).

The lower zones are in deep, pressurized areas of the ocean. Human impacts have occurred at all ocean depths, but are most significant on shallow continental shelf and slope habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P. T., 2012. "Anthropogenic threats to benthic habitats", in: Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K. (eds.), ''Seafloor Geomorphology as Benthic Habitat: GeoHab Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats''. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 39-60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many benthic organisms have retained their historic evolutionary characteristics. Some organisms are significantly larger than their relatives living in shallower zones, largely because of higher oxygen concentration in deep water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalsciences.be/active/sciencenews/archive2005/polarregions/page3/document_view Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, news item March 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928104251/http://www.naturalsciences.be/active/sciencenews/archive2005/polarregions/page3/document_view |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not easy to map or observe these organisms and their habitats, and most modern observations are made using [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROVs), and rarely [[submarine]]s.

==Ecological research==
Benthic [[macroinvertebrate]]s have many important ecological functions, such as regulating the flow of materials and energy in [[river ecosystem]]s through their [[food web]] linkages. Because of this correlation between flow of energy and nutrients, benthic macroinvertebrates have the ability to influence food resources on fish and other organisms in [[aquatic ecosystems]]. For example, the addition of a moderate amount of [[nutrients]] to a river over the course of several years resulted in increases in invertebrate richness, abundance, and [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. These in turn resulted in increased food resources for native species of fish with insignificant alteration of the macroinvertebrate community structure and [[trophic network|trophic]] pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minshall |first=Wayne |author2=Shafii, Bahman |author3=Price, William J. |author4=Holderman, Charlie |author5=Anders, Paul J. |author6=Lester, Gary |author7=Barrett, Pat |title=Effects of nutrient replacement on benthic macroinvertebrates in an ultraoligotrophic reach of the Kootenai River, 2003–2010 |journal=Freshwater Science |jstor=10.1086/677900 |doi=10.1086/677900}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of macroinvertebrates such as [[Amphipoda#Ecology|Amphipoda]] also affect the dominance of certain types of algae in Benthic ecosystems as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Strong impacts of grazing amphipods on the organization of a benthic community|url = http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9615%282000%29070%5B0237%3ASIOGAO%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal = Ecological Monographs|date = 2000-05-01|issn = 0012-9615|pages = 237–263|volume = 70|issue = 2|doi = 10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0237:SIOGAO]2.0.CO;2|first = J. Emmett|last = Duffy|first2 = Mark E.|last2 = Hay|citeseerx = 10.1.1.473.4746}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because benthic zones are influenced by the flow of dead [[organic matter|organic material]], there have been studies conducted on the relationship between stream and river water flows and the resulting effects on the benthic zone. Low flow events show a restriction in nutrient transport from benthic [[substrate (marine biology)|substrates]] to food webs, and caused a decrease in benthic macroinvertebrate biomass, which lead to the disappearance of food sources into the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rolls |first=Robert |author2=Leigh, Catherine |author3=Sheldon, Fran |title=Mechanistic effects of low-flow hydrology on riverine ecosystems: ecological principles and consequences of alteration |journal=Freshwater Science |year=2012 |volume=31 |pages=1163–1186 |issue=4 |jstor=10.1899/12-002.1 |doi=10.1899/12-002.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the benthic system regulates energy in aquatic ecosystems, studies have been made of the mechanisms of the benthic zone in order to better understand the ecosystem. Benthic [[diatom]]s have been used by the European Union's [[Water Framework Directive]] (WFD) to establish ecological quality ratios that determined the ecological status of lakes in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennion |first=Helen |author2=Kelly, Martyn G. |author3=Juggins, Steve |author4=Yallop, Marian L. |author5=Burgess, Amy |author6=Jamieson, Jane |author7=Krokowski, Jan |title=Assessment of Ecological Status in UK lakes using benthic diatoms|journal=Freshwater Science |year=2014 |volume=33 |pages=639–654 |jstor=10.1086/675447 |doi=10.1086/675447|issue=2|url=http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/88889408/Bennionetal.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning research is being made on benthic assemblages to see if they can be used as indicators of healthy aquatic ecosystems. Benthic assemblages in urbanized coastal regions are not functionally equivalent to benthic assemblages in untouched regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowe |first=Michael |author2=Peterson, Mark S. |title=Effects of Coastal Urbanization on Salt-Marsh Faunal Assemblages in the Northern Gulf of Mexico |journal= Marine and Coastal Fisheries: Dynamics, Management, and Ecosystem Science  |year=2014 |volume=6 |pages=89–107 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1080/19425120.2014.893467 |doi=10.1080/19425120.2014.893467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecologists are attempting to understand the relationship between [[heterogeneity]] and maintaining [[biodiversity]] in aquatic ecosystems. Benthic [[algae]] has been used as an inherently good subject for studying short term changes and community responses to heterogeneous conditions in streams. Understanding the potential mechanisms involving benthic [[periphyton]] and the effects on heterogeneity within a stream may provide a better understanding of the structure and function of stream ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wellnitz |first=Todd |author2=Rader, Russell B. |title=Mechanisms influencing community composition and succession in mountain stream periphyton: interactions between scouring history, grazing, and irradiance |journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society |year=2003 |volume=22 |pages=528–541 |doi=10.2307/1468350|issue=4 |jstor=1468350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benthic [[gross primary production]] (GPP) may be important in maintaining biodiversity hotspots in [[littoral zone]]s in large [[lake ecosystem]]s. However, the relative contributions of benthic habitats within specific ecosystems are poorly explored and more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Althouse |first=Bryan |author2=Higgins, Scott |author3=Vander Zanden, Jake M. |title=Benthic and Planktonic primary production along a nutrient gradient in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA |journal=Freshwater Science |year=2014 |volume=33 |pages=487–498 |jstor=10.1086/676314 |doi=10.1086/676314|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biomedical Engineering''' ('''BME''') or '''Medical Engineering''' is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes (e.g. diagnostic or therapeutic). This field seeks to close the gap between [[engineering]] and [[medicine]], combining the design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance health care treatment, including [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical monitor|monitoring]], and [[therapy]].&lt;ref name="EnderleBronzino2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Denis Enderle|author2=Joseph D. Bronzino|title=Introduction to Biomedical Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twc-GLOtlOQC&amp;pg=PP2|year=2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374979-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also included under the scope of a biomedical engineer is the management of current medical equipment within hospitals while adhering to relevant industry standards. This involves equipment recommendations, procurement, routine testing and preventative maintenance, through to decommissioning and disposal. This role is also known as a [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET)]] or [[clinical engineering]]. 

Biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own study, as compared to many other engineering fields.  Such an evolution is common as a new field transition from being an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of [[research and development]], spanning a broad array of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of [[biocompatible]] [[prosthesis|prostheses]], various diagnostic and therapeutic [[medical device]]s ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, common imaging equipment such as [[MRI]]s and [[EKG]]/ECGs, [[regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] tissue growth, pharmaceutical [[medication|drugs]] and therapeutic biologicals.

==Bioinformatics==
{{Main article|Bioinformatics}}

'''Bioinformatics'''  is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data.

Bioinformatics is considered both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences.

==Biomechanics==
{{Main article|Biomechanics}}
Biomechanics is the study of the structure and function of the mechanical aspects of biological systems, at any level from whole [[organism]]s to [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[cell organelle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[R. McNeill Alexander]] (2005) ''Mechanics of animal movement'', [[Current Biology]] Volume 15, Issue 16, 23 August 2005, Pages R616-R619. {{DOI|10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the methods of [[mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hatze| first1=Herbert| year=1974| title=The meaning of the term biomechanics| journal=Journal of Biomechanics| volume= 7| issue =12| pages=189–190| doi=10.1016/0021-9290(74)90060-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomaterial==
{{Main article|Biomaterial}}

A '''biomaterial''' is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with living systems. As a science, '''biomaterials''' is about fifty years old. The study of biomaterials is called '''biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering'''. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.

==Biomedical optics==
Biomedical optics refers to the interaction of biological tissue and light, and how this can be exploited for sensing, imaging, and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medphys/contacts/people/bcox/MPHYX910_Biomedical_Optics_notes_Nov2015.pdf Introduction to Biomedical Optics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissue engineering==
{{Main article|Tissue engineering}}

Tissue engineering, like genetic engineering (see below), is a major segment of [[biotechnology]] – which overlaps significantly with BME.

One of the goals of tissue engineering is to create artificial organs (via biological material) for patients that need organ transplants. Biomedical engineers are currently researching methods of creating such organs. Researchers have grown solid [[Human jawbone|jawbones]]&lt;ref name = BBC&gt;{{cite news | title = Jaw bone created from stem cells | date =  October 10, 2009 |   accessdate = 11 October 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8290138.stm | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheas]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Thorsten Walles|Walles T]]. Tracheobronchial bio-engineering: biotechnology fulfilling unmet medical needs. Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2011; 63(4-5): 367–74.&lt;/ref&gt; from human stem cells towards this end.

==Genetic engineering==

{{Main article|Genetic engineering}}

Genetic engineering, recombinant DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) and gene splicing are terms that apply to the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (''not a medical application'', but see [[biological systems engineering]]), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin through the use of modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.

==Neural engineering==

[[Neural engineering]] (also known as neuroengineering) is a discipline that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems. Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs.

==Pharmaceutical engineering==

[[Pharmaceutical engineering]] is an interdisciplinary science that includes drug engineering, novel drug delivery and targeting, pharmaceutical technology, unit operations of [[Chemical Engineering]], and Pharmaceutical Analysis. It may be deemed as a part of [[pharmacy]] due to its focus on the use of technology on chemical agents in providing better medicinal treatment. The [[International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering|ISPE]] is an international body that certifies this now rapidly emerging interdisciplinary science.

==Medical devices==

{{Main article|Medical devices|medical equipment|Medical technology}}

This is an ''extremely broad category''—essentially covering all health care products that do not achieve their intended results through predominantly chemical (e.g., pharmaceuticals) or biological (e.g., vaccines) means, and do not involve metabolism.

A medical device is intended for use in:
* the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or
* in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.

Some examples include [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[infusion pump]]s, the [[heart-lung machine]], [[dialysis]] machines, [[artificial organ]]s, [[implant (medicine)|implants]], [[artificial limb]]s, [[corrective lenses]], [[cochlear implant]]s, [[ocular prosthetics]], [[facial prosthetics]], somato prosthetics, and [[dental implant]]s.

Medical devices are regulated and classified (in the US) as follows (see also ''Regulation''):
* Class I devices present minimal potential for harm to the user and are often simpler in design than Class II or Class III devices.  Devices in this category include tongue depressors, bedpans, elastic bandages, examination gloves, and hand-held surgical instruments and other similar types of common equipment.
* Class II devices are subject to special controls in addition to the general controls of Class I devices. Special controls may include special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarket surveillance]]. Devices in this class are typically non-invasive and include X-ray machines, PACS, powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps, and surgical drapes.
* Class III devices generally require premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification (510k), a scientific review to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness, in addition to the general controls of Class I.  Examples include replacement heart valves, hip and knee joint implants, silicone gel-filled breast implants, implanted cerebellar stimulators, implantable pacemaker pulse generators and endosseous (intra-bone) implants.

===Medical imaging===
{{Main article|Medical imaging}}

Medical/biomedical imaging is a major segment of [[medical device]]s. This area deals with enabling clinicians to directly or indirectly "view" things not visible in plain sight (such as due to their size, and/or location).  This can involve utilizing ultrasound, magnetism, UV, radiology, and other means.

[[File:brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An [[MRI]] scan of a human head, an example of a biomedical engineering application of [[electrical engineering]] to [[diagnostic imaging]]. [[:Image:brain chrischan 300.gif|Click here]] to view an animated sequence of slices.]]Imaging technologies are often essential to medical diagnosis, and are typically the most complex equipment found in a hospital including: [[fluoroscopy]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[nuclear medicine]], [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[PET-CT scanning|PET-CT scans]], projection radiography such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Computed tomography|CT scans]], [[tomography]], [[ultrasound]], [[optical microscopy]], and [[electron microscopy]].

===Implants===
An implant is a kind of medical device made to replace and act as a missing biological structure (as compared with a transplant, which indicates transplanted biomedical tissue). The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone or apatite depending on what is the most functional. In some cases, implants contain electronics, e.g. artificial pacemakers and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or [[drug-eluting stent]]s.

===Bionics===
{{further information|Bionics#In medicine}}
Artificial body part replacements are one of the many applications of bionics. Concerned with the intricate and thorough study of the properties and function of human body systems, bionics may be applied to solve some engineering problems. Careful study of the different functions and processes of the eyes, ears, and other organs paved the way for improved cameras, television, radio transmitters and receivers, and many other useful tools. These developments have indeed made our lives better, but the best contribution that bionics has made is in the field of biomedical engineering (the building of useful replacements for various parts of the human body). Modern hospitals now have available spare parts to replace body parts badly damaged by injury or disease [Citation Needed]. Biomedical engineers work hand in hand with doctors to build these artificial body parts.

==Clinical engineering==
{{Main article|Clinical engineering}}

[[Clinical engineering]] is the branch of biomedical engineering dealing with the actual implementation of [[medical equipment]] and technologies in hospitals or other clinical settings. Major roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs)]], selecting technological products/services and logistically managing their implementation, working with governmental regulators on inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (e.g. physicians, administrators, I.T., etc.). Clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state of the art so as to redirect procurement patterns accordingly.

Their inherent focus on ''practical'' implementation of technology has tended to keep them oriented more towards ''incremental''-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to revolutionary research &amp; development or ideas that would be many years from clinical adoption; however, there is a growing effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a "bridge" between the primary designers and the end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both 1) close to the point-of-use, while 2) trained in product and process engineering. Clinical engineering departments will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research/optimization, human factors, cost analysis, etc. Also see [[safety engineering]] for a discussion of the procedures used to design safe systems.

==Rehabilitation engineering==
{{Main article |Rehabilitation engineering}}

'''Rehabilitation engineering''' is the systematic application of engineering sciences to design, develop, adapt, test, evaluate, apply, and distribute technological solutions to problems confronted by individuals with disabilities. Functional areas addressed through rehabilitation engineering may include mobility, communications, hearing, vision, and cognition, and activities associated with employment, independent living, education, and integration into the community.&lt;ref name="EnderleBronzino2012"/&gt;

While some rehabilitation engineers have master's degrees in rehabilitation engineering, usually a subspecialty of Biomedical engineering, most rehabilitation engineers have undergraduate or graduate degrees in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering. A Portuguese university provides an undergraduate degree and a master's degree in Rehabilitation Engineering and Accessibility.&lt;ref name = BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnngrow"/&gt; Qualification to become a Rehab' Engineer in the UK is possible via a University BSc Honours Degree course such as Health Design &amp; Technology Institute, Coventry University.&lt;ref name="chicagoliver"/&gt;

The rehabilitation process for people with disabilities often entails the design of assistive devices such as Walking aids intended to promote inclusion of their users into the mainstream of society, commerce, and recreation.[[File:SinusRhythmLabels.svg|200px|right|thumb|Schematic representation of a normal ECG trace showing ''[[sinus rhythm]];'' an example of widely used clinical medical equipment (operates by applying [[electronic engineering]] to [[electrophysiology]] and [[medical diagnosis]]).]]

==Regulatory issues==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2017}}
Regulatory issues have been constantly increased in the last decades to respond to the many incidents caused by devices to patients. For example, from 2008 to 2011, in US, there were 119 FDA recalls of medical devices classified as class I. According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), [[Class I recall]] is associated to "a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Medical &amp; Radiation Emitting Device Recalls http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfres/res.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the country-specific legislation, the main regulatory objectives coincide worldwide.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO), 2003 Medical Device Regulations Global overview and guiding principles. http://www.who.int/medical_devices/publications/en/MD_Regulations.pdf (last visit Sept 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the medical device regulations, a product must be: 1) safe ''and'' 2) effective and 3) for all the manufactured devices

A product is safe if patients, users and third parties do not run unacceptable risks of physical hazards (death, injuries, …) in its intended use. Protective measures have to be introduced on the devices to reduce residual risks at acceptable level if compared with the benefit derived from the use of it.

A product is effective if it performs as specified by the manufacturer in the intended use. Effectiveness is achieved through clinical evaluation, compliance to performance standards or demonstrations of substantial equivalence with an already marketed device.

The previous features have to be ensured for all the manufactured items of the medical device. This requires that a quality system shall be in place for all the relevant entities and processes that may impact safety and effectiveness over the whole medical device lifecycle.

The medical device engineering area is among the most heavily regulated fields of engineering, and practicing biomedical engineers must routinely consult and cooperate with regulatory law attorneys and other experts.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the principal healthcare regulatory authority in the United States, having jurisdiction over medical ''devices, drugs, biologics, and combination'' products.  The paramount objectives driving policy decisions by the FDA are safety and effectiveness of healthcare products that have to be assured through a quality system in place as specified under [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations|21 CFR 829 regulation]]. In addition, because biomedical engineers often develop devices and technologies for "consumer" use, such as physical therapy devices (which are also "medical" devices), these may also be governed in some respects by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]. The greatest hurdles tend to be 510K "clearance" (typically for Class 2 devices) or pre-market "approval" (typically for drugs and class 3 devices).

In the European context, safety effectiveness and quality is ensured through the "Conformity Assessment" that is defined as "the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies with the requirements of the European [[Medical Devices Directive|Medical Device Directive]]". The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file,  the technical file and the quality system deliveries.  The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients for the use of the device. The [[technical file]] contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content although organized in different structure.  The Quality System deliverables usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life cycle. The same standard (ISO EN 13485) is usually applied for quality management systems in US and worldwide.

[[File:Hip replacement Image 3684-PH.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Implants, such as [[artificial hip]] joints, are generally extensively regulated due to the invasive nature of such devices.]]

In the European Union, there are certifying entities named "[[Notified Body|Notified Bodies]]", accredited by European Member States. The Notified Bodies must ensure the effectiveness of the certification process for all medical devices apart from the class I devices where a declaration of conformity produced by the manufacturer is sufficient for marketing. Once a product has passed all the steps required by the Medical Device Directive, the device is entitled to bear a [[CE marking]], indicating that the device is believed to be safe and effective when used as intended, and, therefore, it can be marketed within the European Union area.

The different regulatory arrangements sometimes result in particular technologies being developed first for either the U.S. or in Europe depending on the more favorable form of regulation.  While nations often strive for substantive harmony to facilitate cross-national distribution, philosophical differences about the ''optimal extent'' of regulation can be a hindrance; more restrictive regulations seem appealing on an intuitive level, but critics decry the tradeoff cost in terms of slowing access to life-saving developments.

===RoHS II===
Directive 2011/65/EU, better known as RoHS 2 is a recast of legislation originally introduced in 2002. The original EU legislation "Restrictions of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronics Devices" (RoHS Directive 2002/95/EC) was replaced and superseded by 2011/65/EU published in July 2011 and commonly known as RoHS 2.
[[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]] seeks to limit the dangerous substances in circulation in electronics products, in particular toxins and heavy metals, which are subsequently released into the environment when such devices are recycled.

The scope of RoHS 2 is widened to include products previously excluded, such as medical devices and industrial equipment. In addition, manufacturers are now obliged to provide conformity risk assessments and test reports – or explain why they are lacking. For the first time, not only manufacturers, but also importers and distributors share a responsibility to ensure Electrical and Electronic Equipment within the scope of RoHS comply with the hazardous substances limits and have a CE mark on their products.

===IEC 60601===
The new International Standard [[IEC 60601]] for home healthcare electro-medical devices defining the requirements for devices used in the home healthcare environment. IEC 60601-1-11 (2010) must now be incorporated into the design and verification of a wide range of home use and point of care medical devices along with other applicable standards in the IEC 60601 3rd edition series.

The mandatory date for implementation of the EN European version of the standard is June 1, 2013. The US FDA requires the use of the standard on June 30, 2013, while Health Canada recently extended the required date from June 2012 to April 2013.  The North American agencies will only require these standards for new device submissions, while the EU will take the more severe approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to consider the home healthcare standard.

===AS/NZS 3551:2012===
[[Standards Australia|AS/ANS 3551:2012]] is the Australian and New Zealand standards for the management of medical devices. The standard specifies the procedures required to maintain a wide range of medical assets in a clinical setting (e.g. Hospital).&lt;ref name="Standards Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/details.aspx?ProductID=1595659|title=AS/NZS 3551:2012 Management programs for medical equipment|last=|first=|date=2016-10-18|website=|publisher=Standards Australia|isbn=978-1-74342-277-9|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards are based on the IEC 606101 standards.

The standard covers a wide range of medical equipment management elements including, procurement, acceptance testing, maintenance (electrical safety and preventative maintenance testing) and decommissioning.

==Training and certification==

===Education===

Biomedical engineers require considerable knowledge of both engineering and biology, and typically have a Bachelor's (B.Tech., B.S.) or Master's (M.S., M.Tech., M.S.E., or M.Eng.) or a doctoral (Ph.D.) degree in BME (Biomedical Engineering) or another branch of engineering with considerable potential for BME overlap. As interest in BME increases, many engineering colleges now have a Biomedical Engineering Department or Program, with offerings ranging from the undergraduate (B.Tech., B.S., B.Eng. or B.S.E.) to doctoral levels. Biomedical engineering has only recently been emerging as ''its own discipline'' rather than a cross-disciplinary hybrid specialization of other disciplines; and BME programs at all levels are becoming more widespread, including the [[Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering]] which actually includes so much biological science content that many students use it as a "[[pre-med]]" major in preparation for [[medical school]]. The number of biomedical engineers is expected to rise as both a cause and effect of improvements in medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics] - Profile for Engineers {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219092732/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm |date=February 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., an increasing number of [[undergraduate]] programs are also becoming recognized by [[ABET]] as accredited bioengineering/biomedical engineering programs. Over 65 programs are currently accredited by ABET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmes.org/accreditation/accredited_eng_pgms.asp |title=Accredited Biomedical Engineering Programs |publisher=Bmes.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928120032/http://www.bmes.org/accreditation/accredited_eng_pgms.asp |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/schoolalleac.asp ABET List of Accredited Engineering Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823111341/http://www.abet.org/schoolalleac.asp |date=August 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada and Australia, accredited graduate programs in biomedical engineering are common, for example in universities such as [[McMaster University]], and the first Canadian [[undergraduate]] BME program at [[Ryerson University]] offering a four-year B.Eng. program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msbe.mcmaster.ca/ |title=McMaster School of Biomedical Engineering |publisher=Msbe.mcmaster.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/undergraduate/current/bme.html |title=Biomedical Engineering - Electrical and Computer Eng.

As with many degrees, the reputation and ranking of a program may factor into the desirability of a degree holder for either employment or graduate admission. The reputation of many undergraduate degrees are also linked to the institution's graduate or research programs, which have some tangible factors for rating, such as research funding and volume, publications and citations. With BME specifically, the ranking of a university's hospital and medical school can also be a significant factor in the perceived prestige of its BME department/program.

[[Graduate school|Graduate education]] is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm#outlook|work=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Job Outlook for Engineers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219172748/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm|archivedate=December 19, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in [[pharmaceutical]] and [[medical device]] development, graduate education is almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a Masters or Doctoral level degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need for some kind of graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate BME programs will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school afterwards.

Graduate programs in BME, like in other scientific fields, are highly varied, and particular programs may emphasize certain aspects within the field. They may also feature extensive collaborative efforts with programs in other fields (such as the University's Medical School or other engineering divisions), owing again to the interdisciplinary nature of BME. M.S. and Ph.D. programs will typically require applicants to have an undergraduate degree in BME, or ''another engineering'' discipline (plus certain life science coursework), or ''life science'' (plus certain engineering coursework).

Education in BME also varies greatly around the world. By virtue of its extensive biotechnology sector, its numerous major universities, and relatively few internal barriers, the U.S. has progressed a great deal in its development of BME education and training opportunities. Europe, which also has a large biotechnology sector and an impressive education system, has encountered trouble in creating uniform standards as the European community attempts to supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist. Recently, initiatives such as BIOMEDEA have sprung up to develop BME-related education and professional standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2005|url=http://www.bmt.uni-stuttgart.de/biomedea/biomedea.htm|title=BIOMEDEA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506113817/http://www.bmt.uni-stuttgart.de/biomedea/biomedea.htm|archivedate=May 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as Australia, are recognizing and moving to correct deficiencies in their BME education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lithgow, B. J.|date=October 25, 2001|url=http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA410442|title=Biomedical Engineering Curriculum: A Comparison Between the USA, Europe and Australia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501063532/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA410442|archivedate=May 1, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as high technology endeavors are usually marks of developed nations, some areas of the world are prone to slower development in education, including in BME.

===Licensure/certification===
{{See also|Professional engineer}}
As with other learned professions, each state has certain (fairly similar) requirements for becoming licensed as a registered [[Professional Engineer]] (PE), but, in US, in industry such a license is not required to be an employee as an engineer in the majority of situations (due to an exception known as the industrial exemption, which effectively applies to the vast majority of American engineers). The US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety, safeguarding of life, health, or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education, and government need not be licensed. This is notably not the case in many other countries, where a license is as legally necessary to practice engineering as it is for law or medicine.

Biomedical engineering is regulated in some countries, such as Australia, but registration is typically only recommended and not required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerb.org.au/aop/nper_areas_biomedical.cfm National Engineering Registration Board - Areas Of Practice - NPER Areas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105230101/http://www.nerb.org.au/aop/nper_areas_biomedical.cfm |date=January 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, mechanical engineers working in the areas of Medical Engineering, [[Bioengineering]] or Biomedical engineering can gain [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] status through the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]].  The Institution also runs the Engineering in Medicine and Health Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Engineering: Homepage|work=Institution of Mechanical Engineers|url=http://www.imeche.org/industries/medical/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502205758/http://www.imeche.org/industries/medical/ |archivedate= May 2, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) has a panel for the accreditation of MSc courses in Biomedical Engineering and Chartered Engineering status can also be sought through IPEM.

The [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]] – the first (and more general) of two licensure examinations for most U.S. jurisdictions—does now cover biology (although technically not BME).  For the second exam, called the Principles and Practices, Part 2, or the Professional Engineering exam, candidates may select a particular engineering discipline's content to be tested on; there is currently not an option for BME with this, meaning that any biomedical engineers seeking a license must prepare to take this examination in another category (which does not affect the actual license, since most jurisdictions do not recognize discipline specialties anyway).  However, the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) is, as of 2009, exploring the possibility of seeking to implement a BME-specific version of this exam to facilitate biomedical engineers pursuing licensure.

Beyond governmental registration, certain private-sector professional/industrial organizations also offer certifications with varying degrees of prominence.  One such example is the Certified Clinical Engineer (CCE) certification for Clinical engineers.

==Career prospects==
In 2012 there were about 19,400 biomedical engineers employed in the US, and the field was predicted to grow by 27% (much faster than average) from 2012 to 2022.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. [http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014–15 Edition: Biomedical Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt; Biomedical engineering has the highest percentage of women engineers compared to other common engineering professions.

In molecular biology, '''BpuJI''' is a type II [[restriction endonuclease]] which recognises the [[asymmetry|asymmetric]] [[Nucleotide sequence|sequence]] 5'-CCCGT and cuts at multiple sites in the surrounding area of the target sequence. The BpuJI protein consists of two distinct modules; an N-terminal DNA recognition domain, and a C-terminal dimerisation and catalysis domain. The N-terminal domain is composed of two [[winged-helix]] subdomains and a disrupted linker subdomain. Target sequence recognition occurs through major groove contacts of [[amino acid]]s in the winged-helix subdomains.&lt;ref name="pmid18433771"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sukackaite R, Grazulis S, Bochtler M, Siksnys V | title = The recognition domain of the BpuJI restriction endonuclease in complex with cognate DNA at 1.3-A resolution | journal = J.

'''Cabinets of curiosities''' (also known in [[German language|German]] loanwords as '''Kunstkabinett''', '''Kunstkammer''' or '''Wunderkammer'''; also '''Cabinets of Wonder''', and '''wonder-rooms''') were encyclopedic collections of objects the categorical boundaries of which were, in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], yet to be defined. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to [[natural history]] (sometimes faked), [[geology]], [[ethnography]], [[archaeology]], religious or historical [[relic]]s, works of art (including  [[cabinet painting]]s), and [[antiquities]]. "The Kunstkammer was regarded as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Francesaco Fiorani, reviewing Bredecamp 1995 in ''Renaissance Quarterly'' '''51'''.1  (Spring 1998:268-270) p 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Charles I of England]]'s collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, "The ''Kunstkabinett'' itself was a form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, "Charles I of England: The tragedy of Absolutism", A.G. Dickens, ed. ''The Courts of Europe'' (London) 1977:201.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of [[science]] in [[Europe]] formed collections that were precursors to [[museum]]s.

The term ''[[Cabinet (architecture)|cabinet]]'' originally described a room rather than a [[Cabinet (furniture)|piece of furniture]]. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. The Kunstkammer of [[Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the [[Hradschin]] at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplation&lt;ref&gt;This is the secretive aspect emphasised by R.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;W. Evans, ''Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II and His World: A Study in Intellectual History'' (Oxford) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, "Remarks on the Collections of Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II: The Kunstkammer as a Form of Representatio",&lt;!--Representatio is correct--&gt; ''Art Journal'' '''38'''.1 (Autumn 1978:22–28).&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf's uncle, [[Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II, Archduke of Austria]], also had a collection, with a special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities]] at [[Ambras Castle]] in Austria.

==History==
[[Image:RitrattoMuseoFerranteImperato.jpg|thumb|left|Fold-out engraving from [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599), the earliest illustration of a natural history cabinet]]
[[Image:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|A corner of a cabinet, painted by [[Frans II Francken]] in 1636 reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era ''[[virtuoso]]'' might evince]]
The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599) (''illustration, left''). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his [[herbarium]]. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a ''studiolo''&lt;ref&gt;''Studiolo'': the small retreats in the palaces of Urbino and Gubbio were inlaid with [[intarsia]] that figured just such fitted cabinets with feigned lattice doors and shelves filled with scientific instruments, books and small sculptures in ''trompe-l'oeil'' perspective. The Gubbio ''studiolo'' has been reassembled at the [[Metropolitan Museum]]; the Urbino ''studiolo'' remains in situ.&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Sixteenth-century cabinet-makers serving the luxury trades of [[Florence]] and [[Antwerp]] were beginning to produce moveable cabinets with similar architectural interior fittings, which could be set upon a carpet-covered table or on a purpose-built stand.&lt;/ref&gt; Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.

In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised [[Christian&amp;nbsp;I of Saxony]] that three types of item were indispensable in forming a "Kunstkammer" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly "curious items from home or abroad"; and thirdly "antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals".&lt;ref&gt;B. Gutfleish and J. Menzhausen, "How a Kunstkammer Should Be Formed", ''Journal of the History of Collections'', 1989 Vol I: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Albrecht Dürer]] visited the [[Netherlands]] in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to [[Nuremberg]] various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 48.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly characteristic range of interests represented in  [[Frans II Francken]]'s painting of 1636 (''illustration, left'') shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'') intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely [[amber]], which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing ''Libera'', a Roman fertility goddess)&lt;ref&gt;Her base is inscribed LIBER[A]&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand and modern and religious (''Christ at the Column''&lt;ref&gt;It appears to represent a reduction of a well-known sculpture by [[Alessandro Algardi]].&lt;/ref&gt;) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): [[portrait miniature]]s, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro woodcuts]] or drawings, and a small [[still-life]] painting&lt;ref&gt;Still life was considered a [[hierarchy of genres|lesser genre]] than even portraits or landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt; leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.

Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of [[Ole Worm]], known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (''illustration, above right''), and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork [[automaton|automata]]; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently [[mythology|mythical]] creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Scythian Lamb]], a woolly [[fern]] thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the [[narwhal]]'s tusk as coming from a whale rather than a [[unicorn]], as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.

In the second half of the 18th century, [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (c. 1735–1815) operated in [[Ljubljana]], then the capital of [[Carniola]], a natural history cabinet ({{lang-de|Naturalienkabinet}}) that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Russian grand duke [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]] and [[Pope Pius VI]], as well as by famous naturalists, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Griselini|it}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Benedikt Hermann|de|3=Franz Benedikt Hermann (Geologe)}}. It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the [[Idrija mercury mine|Idrija mine]], a ''[[herbarium vivum]]'' with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an [[anatomical theatre]].&lt;ref name=Jezernik&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-IARZL5AU |title=Ljubljanske »knjige sveta« od Auerspergov do Hacqueta |first=Božidar |last=Jezernik |year=2009 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Ljubljana's "Books of the World" – from the Auerspergs to Hacquet |journal=Etnolog |id={{COBISS|ID=1242502}} |volume=19=70 |pages=23–33 |issn=0354-0316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the ''Museum Wormianum'' (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.

Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many [[monarch]]s, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the [[Studiolo of Francesco&amp;nbsp;I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;III of Denmark]], who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the [[Kunstkamera]] founded by [[Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from [[Albertus Seba]] and [[Frederik Ruysch]]. The fabulous [[Habsburg]] Imperial collection included important [[Aztec]] artifacts, including the [[Montezuma's headdress|feather head-dress]] or crown of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] now in the [[Vienna Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]]. 
[[File:Berlin Naturkundemuseum Korallen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An early eighteenth-century German  ''Schrank'' with a traditional display of [[coral]]s (Naturkundenmuseum Berlin)]]

Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex ''Kunstschränke'' produced in the early seventeenth century by the [[Augsburg]] merchant, diplomat and collector [[Philipp Hainhofer]]. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in 1632, which is kept in the [[Gustavianum|Museum Gustavianum]] in [[Uppsala]]. The [[curio cabinet]], as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.

The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.

A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the [[Grünes Gewölbe]], the "Green Vaults" formed by [[Augustus the Strong]] in [[Dresden]] to display his chamber of wonders.  The "Enlightenment Gallery" in the [[British Museum]], installed in the former "Kings Library" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/themes/room_1_enlightenment.aspx |title=Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a ''cabinet'' came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of ''[[virtù]]'' or curiosities, such as a ''[[virtuoso]]'' would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, [[Michael Bernhard Valentini]] published an early [[Museology|museological]] work, ''Museum Museorum'', an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.

Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial [[freak show]]s and [[sideshows]].

[[Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753) was an English physician, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]], and the founder of the [[British Museum]] in London. He began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the [[Duke of Albemarle]] offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, ''Natural History of Jamaica'', published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; Clark, Jack A. " Sir Hans Sloane and Abbé Jean Paul Bignon: Notes on Collection Building in the Eighteenth Century," in ''The Library Quarterly'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (October 1980), 475–482; de Beer, G.&amp;nbsp;R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; and [[Kay Dian Kriz|Kriz, Kay Dian]].

Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. [[Herman Boerhaave]] gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased [[Leonard Plukenet]]'s collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715)]], left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and [[James Petiver]]'s virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. [[Mark Catesby]] gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. [[Philip Miller]] gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P.

"Sloane and the Kaempfer Collection," in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 20–23; and "The Sloane Collection of Manuscripts" in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.
"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain [[James Cook]] in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the [[British Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s royal library was added to Sloane’s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.

[[John Tradescant the elder]] (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, [[John Tradescant the younger]] (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to [[Powhatan]], father of [[Pocahontas]]. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[dodo]] from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr"&gt;Ivins, Jr., William M. "The Tradescant Collection", in ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Vol. 20, No. 8 (August 1925), 194–197; Josten, C.H. ''Elias Ashmole (1617–1692): His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, His Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to His Life and Work: Texts, 1661–1672'', (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967); Leith-Ross, Prudence.

''Strange Blooms: The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants'', (London: Atlantic, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, [[Freemason]], and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of ''Musaeum Tradescantianum'', a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the [[University of Oxford]], provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole’s donation formed the foundation of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at Oxford.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr" /&gt;

Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at [[Snowshill Manor]] and [[Wallington Hall]]. The concept has been reinterpreted at [[The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A two-headed lamb and ancient dildos: the UK's strangest new museum|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/two-headed-lamb-ancient-dildos-uks-strangest-new-museum|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Oliver|last = Wainwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social function====
[[File:17th-Century Cabinet of Curiosities.jpg|thumb|left|Italian Baroque-era cabinet of curiosities, circa 1635.]]
Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be "the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic," or the less grandiose, "the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes." Evans goes on to explain that "no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Impey, MacGregor|first1=Oliver, Arthur|title=The Origins of Museums: The Cabinet of Curiosities in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]], whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of “learned entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/detail.action?docID=10677039&amp;p00=cabinet+curiosities|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.

Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was “a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the [[English Civil War]] and Interregum [sic].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/reader.action?docID=10677039|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which “[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.”&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as “something much more like a gentleman’s club,&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;” an idea supported by [[John Evelyn]], who depicts the Royal Society as “an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty’s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;”

===United States===
Thomas Dent Mütter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the [[American College of Physicians]] in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The [[Mütter Museum]] began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including [[Benjamin Rush]]'s medical chest and [[Florence Nightingale]]'s sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, [[Joseph Hyrtl]] (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the "soap lady"; the conjoined liver and death cast of [[Chang and Eng Bunker]], the Siamese twins; and in 1893, [[Grover Cleveland]]'s jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022221/http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundieart.com/cabinet/ |title=James G.

[[P.&amp;nbsp;T. Barnum]] took over [[Barnum's American Museum]] on five floors in New York, "perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, "THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!" at the exit door".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324407504578185622576715416?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_Life%26Culture "Catalog of Curiosities"] by BARRYMORE LAURENCE SCHERER Wall Street Journal. January 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, New York businessmen formed the [[Hobby Club]], a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their "cabinets of wonder" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and [[incunable]]; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.&lt;ref&gt;According to its constitution, "This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects."[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912–1920].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
[[Image:My Cabinet o'Curiosities1.jpg|thumb|right|upright||Modern interpretation of a Wunderkammer]]

The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale. In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the modern-day [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused.&lt;ref&gt;The American writer Lawrence Weschler, wrote an entire book about the museum: ''Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as [[House on the Rock]], can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], [[Musée Patamécanique]] is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by [['Pataphysics|Pataphysics]]. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderkammern.net// Wunderkammern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325091444/http://www.wunderkammern.net/ |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how "amazement" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called "Wunder Kammer", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120918075929/http://www.wunder-kammer.com/ wunder-kamer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as [[YouTube]] as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions "just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehl|first=Robert W.|title=Youtube As Archive: Who Will Curate This Digital Wunderkammer?|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|year=2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=43–60|doi=10.1177/1367877908098854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''climate-friendly school''' is a school that uses [[education for sustainable development]] (ESD) to promote a culture of sustainability in which students, staff and families hold shared values and beliefs about the importance of taking action for a more sustainable society. Taking care of the environment and contributing to reducing [[climate change]] is an integral part of this. [[Climate action]] means different things to different schools. Some schools see climate action as key to “doing their part” to take care of the planet. For other schools, it is about addressing issues directly affecting them. For example, several schools in disaster-prone [[Japan]] see climate action as a practical way of helping students and their families stay safe and prepare for the future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002467/246740e.pdf|title=Getting Climate-Ready: A Guide for Schools on Climate Action|last=Gibb|first=Natalie|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100193-2|location=|pages=5, 7–8, 10, 15, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whole-school approach to climate action ==
[[File:Figure 1 Whole school approach to climate change Getting Climate-Ready.svg|thumb|The whole-school approach to climate change]]
In a whole-school approach, students’ classroom learning about climate change is reinforced by the formal and informal messages promoted by the school’s values and actions. In other words, students and other members of the school community live what they learn, and learn what they live. The whole-school approach to climate change means that an educational institution includes action for reducing climate change in every aspect of school life. This includes school governance, teaching content and methodology, campus and facilities management as well as cooperation with partners and the broader communities. The active involvement of all internal and external school stakeholders, namely students, teachers, principals, school staff at all levels and the wider school community such as families and community members in reflecting and acting on climate change is key to a whole-school approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio, Athens, Greece ===
As an experimental school, the 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio is encouraged to introduce innovative programmes. In 2013, the school introduced complex systems into biology and chemistry courses for 157 senior secondary students. In the complex systems unit, students worked in groups to investigate climate change, virus transmission, and ecosystem dynamics with the help of computer simulations. Through their investigations, students discovered the properties of complex systems, such as positive and negative [[Feedback|feedback loops]]. They also had opportunities to apply their learning. For example, a group of students measured the energy sustainability of the school building, to find its weaknesses and construct an action plan to improve it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Al-Kawthar Secondary School, Beirut, Lebanon ===
Al-Kawthar Secondary School works to raise awareness of climate change within their school. So far, 2,421 students, 310 teachers, and 110 families have been involved in projects including [[Tree planting|tree-planting]], making handicrafts from recycled materials, visiting national forests, recycling, and conserving water. The school also hosted film nights and workshops where students, families and teachers suggested ways to save the planet. Following the ISO-26000 guidelines for socially responsible institutions, the school has committed to a continuous process of improvement. At the beginning of the school year, the environmental committee develops an action plan based on what was learned and achieved the previous year. The committee keeps a record of their activities, so the school can identify high-impact activities and activities that could be scaled up. Teachers and students deepen their learning by sharing their experiences with other schools in [[Lebanon]] and around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ASPnet Schools, Côte d’Ivoire ===
In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], one of the most widespread uses of forest resources is in [[traditional medicine]] which is of vital importance with regard to primary health care and contributes to preserving traditional knowledge and cultural heritage. Realizing that the biodiversity of their forests is under threat, the [[UNESCO ASPNet|ASPnet]] schools, together with university researchers and medical practitioners, united their forces to come to the rescue of the forest resources in Côte d'Ivoire. The schools promote botanical gardens where parents as well as traditional medicine practitioners teach students how to conserve and manage forest resources in a more sustainable way. Through the study visits in the botanical garden, students acquire traditional knowledge of medicinal plant cultivation which will enable them to identify, protect, preserve and promote the medicinal plants which have tremendous ecological and cultural importance in Côte d'Ivoire. In collaboration with the experts and researchers, the ASPnet schools are now considering creating a genebank as well as replanting endangered species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ===
Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen's environment team has invited janitors, teachers, students, engineers and others to participate in experiential, non-formal learning activities. They created a [[green roof]], built [[Solar cooker|solar ovens]] and bamboo bicycle racks, planted spice, flower, and meditation gardens, and converted used cooking oil into [[biodiesel]]. These activities have created bonds between different members of the school community, awakened a sense of belonging and pride in the school, and built an environment where ideas and information are shared freely. The environment team has also offered trainings for school community members in order to secure buy-in for the projects. For example, training on waste sorting and cooking oil collection was offered to employees. Also, a gardening workshop was organized for student volunteers, so they could assist maintenance staff in caring for the expanding school gardens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Endrupskolen School, Fredensborg, Denmark ===
Thanks to a partnership with a local non-profit organization, Endrupskolen School offers students inspiring and hands-on learning experiences. Eight times throughout the school year, students visit gardens, farms and kitchens run by the non-profit organization “Haver til Maver.” During each visit, classes meet experts such as farmers, cooks, biologists or gardeners who guide students in exploring plants, trees, vegetables, smells and tastes. According to Endrupskolen teachers, these visits have given students the skills and commitment needed to build better food futures for themselves, their families and society as a whole. In addition, learning outside the traditional classroom has helped students develop better relationships with their peers and a better sense of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nagoya International School, Nagoya, Japan ===
The [[Nagoya International School]] is committed to developing a school culture of sustainability, as expressed in their school mission statement. The institution aims to “nurture in its students the capacity to objectively define what is truly needed in the global society, to take action on their own, and to become active agents for [[sustainable development]].”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

'''Content and language integrated learning''' ('''CLIL''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/clil British Council BBC Teaching English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson &amp; McKinley|title=Integration of content and language learning|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/integration_of_content_and_langauge_tesol_encyclopedia_author_version.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach for learning content through an additional language (foreign or second), thus teaching both the subject and the language. 

==CLIL origin==
The term '''CLIL''' was created in 1994 by  [http://clil-cd.ecml.at/Team/Teammember4/tabid/941/language/en-GB/Default.aspx David Marsh] as a methodology similar to but distinct from [[language immersion]] and [[content-based instruction]]. The idea of its proponents was to create an "umbrella term" which encompasses different forms of using language as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onestopenglish.com/clil/what-is-clil/ | title=What is CLIL? | work=Onestopenglish | accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology has been applied in a business context in many countries and widely accepted as an effective approach. In Italy for example, it is being used as an accelerated method to teach management concepts in English to business people. Among CLIL's proponents and practitioners there is Dr Maurizio Morselli, a Human Resources professional and Executive Coach, who believes that "this hybrid immersion approach produces a lot more immediate results and it appeals to self-motivated adult audiences who possess a basic knowledge and understanding of the target language".

==CLIL and language immersion==
CLIL is fundamentally based on methodological principles established by research on [[language immersion]]. This kind of approach has been identified as very important by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0449:FIN:EN:PDF Commission Of The European Communities Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004 – 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; because: "It can provide effective opportunities for pupils to use their new language skills now, rather than learn them now for use later. It opens doors on languages for a broader range of learners, nurturing self-confidence in young learners and those who have not responded well to formal language instruction in general education. It provides exposure to the language without requiring extra time in the curriculum, which can be of particular interest in vocational settings." This approach involves learning subjects such as history, geography, managerial skills/concepts or others, through an additional language. It can be very successful in enhancing the learning of languages and other subjects, and helping children develop a positive attitude towards themselves as language learners. 

The European Commission has therefore decided to promote the training of teachers to "...enhancing the language competences in general, in order to promote the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in foreign languages".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:320:0001:0003:EN:PDF Journal of the European Union Council Resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An educational project called [http://e-clil.uws.ac.uk/ ECLIL] was also supported from the European Union within the [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/index_en.php Lifelong Learning Programme EACEA Agency], to develop interactive resources for European schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLIL objectives==
CLIL objectives are varied, but among the most relevant ones the following can be pointed out (Coyle et al., 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Coyle, D., Hood, P. &amp; Marsh, D. (2010). CLIL. Cambridge: C.U.P.&lt;/ref&gt;: To improve the educational system. To establish the necessary conditions that will allow students to achieve the appropriate level of academic performance in CLIL subjects. To improve students’ proficiency in both their mother tongue and the target language, attaching the same importance to each. To develop the intercultural understanding. To develop social and thinking skills.

CLIL advocates claim that this educational approach (Lorenzo et al., 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, F., Trujillo, F. &amp; Vez, M. (2011). Educación bilingüe. Integración de contenidos y segundas lenguas. Madrid: Síntesis.&lt;/ref&gt;: Improves L1 and L2 development. Prepares students for the globalized world. Increases students’ motivation to learn foreign languages. Promotes the learning of a more extensive and varied vocabulary. Enhances students’ confidence in the target language. Improves language competence in the target language, CLIL being more beneficial that traditional foreign language teaching courses. Helps develop intercultural competence.

==CLIL in English as an international language==
The integration of content and language learning in [[international English|English as an international language]] (EIL) is found in approaches to [[bilingual education]].&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches include [[language immersion|immersion]], [[content-based instruction]] (CBI), content-based language teaching (CBLT), and the movement towards [[English-medium education|English medium instruction]] (EMI). All of these approaches raise a number of questions that a view of English as an international language has for content-integrated approaches (Thompson &amp; McKinley, 2018).&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplicity of terms===
The multiplicity of terms used to refer to instructional approaches for the integration of content and language learning (immersion, CBI, CBLT, CLIL, EMI) can be a source of confusion in EIL studies, although they all commonly share the purpose of additive bilingualism via a dual focus on content and language learning. Debate continues about the extent to which immersion, CBLT, CBI, and CLIL are different, similar, or the same. Some argue that CLIL represents an appropriate umbrella term that can be used to house various approaches towards content integration (e.g., immersion is a type of CLIL), where terms can be used interchangeably (e.g., CLIL and CBI are the same concept with a different name) (Cenoz et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenoz, Gennessee &amp; Gorter|title=Critical analysis of CLIL: Taking stock and looking forward.|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=3|pages=243-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that CLIL and CBI represent very different concepts, where CLIL represents the intersection between content and language from the content perspective (i.e., CLIL happens in content classes), while CBI is an attempt at responding to the content needs of learners in language classes (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton-Puffer, Llinares, Lorenzo &amp; Nikula|title=“You can stand under my umbrella”: Immersion, clil and bilingual education. A response to Cenoz, Genesee &amp; Gorter (2013).|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=2|pages=213-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The similarities (and variability) between approaches lead to circular arguments about whether the key features of one approach are also shared by others (e.g., immersion and CLIL), and therefore they are indistinguishable. In some ways, this is an inevitable result of terms being used outside of academia, by educators applying ideas from one context to another,&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the lines of demarcation become more unclear as approaches are transported to different countries and contextualized to meet different learning situations.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In EIL studies, different terms have been associated with different regions, such as CLIL, which is associated with Europe, and was “purposefully coined” by European educators and researchers attempting to influence language policy and ideology (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014:214).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CLIL represented a deliberate attempt to develop a European model for additive bilingual education.&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[policy-maker|policy makers]], educators, and researchers from international contexts have started to apply and develop CLIL approaches in distinctly non-European situations, and the term is now widely used within the wider international foreign language learning community.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18873">The '''De Candolle system''' is a [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|system of plant taxonomy]] by French (Swiss) [[botanist]] [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] (1778−1841).

==History==
The first taxonomic system by de Candolle, who introduced the term [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], appeared in his description of the plants of France, his ''Flore française'' (1805–1815), in 5 volumes dealing with [[Flora of France|plant species found in France]].

The De Candolle system is a subsequent taxonomic system.
* It was originally published by de Candolle in the ''Théorie élémentaire de la botanique, ou exposition des principes de la classification naturelle et de l’art de décrire et d’etudier les végétaux'' (1813).{{sfn|de Candolle|1819}} 
* It was further developed and published in editions of the very extensive but unfinished ''[[Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis]]'' (''Prodromus'') (1824–1873), dealing only with dicotyledons.{{sfn|de Candolle|1824–1873}}

The abbreviation ''Syst.'' in de Candolle's work and subsequent literature refers to his ''Regni vegetabilis systema naturale''.

==Systems==

The De Candolle system recognises the following groups of vascular plants (references to ''Prodromus''). Within the ''Prodromus'' he cross references his earlier ''Regni vegetabilis systema naturale''.

A general schema is laid out in the ''Regnii vegetabilis'' pp.&amp;nbsp;117–122, as follows:{{sfn|de Candolle|1818–1821|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/127665#page/127/mode/1up pp.&amp;nbsp;117–122]}}

=== Prodromus ===
The De Candolle system [[family (botany)|families]] were further developed in the ''[[Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis|Prodromus]]'' (1824–1873).{{sfn|de Candolle|1824–1873}}

Note that this system was published well before there were internationally accepted rules for [[botanical nomenclature]]. Here, a [[family (biology)|family]] is indicated as "ordo". Terminations for families were not what they are now. Neither of these phenomena is a problem from a nomenclatural perspective, the present day [[ICBN]] provides for this.

Within the [[dicotyledon]]s ("classis prima '''DICOTYLEDONEÆ'''") the De Candolle system recognises (Pagination from ''Prodromus'', 17 Parts) the list:{{sfn|de Candolle|1824–1873}}

'''Environmental social science''' is the broad, [[transdisciplinary]] study of interrelations between humans and the natural environment. Environmental social scientists work within and between the fields of [[anthropology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; and also in the [[interdisciplinary]] fields of [[environmental studies]], [[human ecology]] and [[political ecology]], [[social epidemiology]], among others.

== Ideologies, fields and concepts ==

Ideologies, fields and concepts in environmental social science aim to convey environmental issues as intertwined in societal relations, institutions and human activities that continually shape the environment or are themselves shaped by the environment. For example, political ecology is based on the premise that the environment is not "A-political" therefore the way it is managed, who has access to the environment, how environmental resources are distributed are shaped through political structures, power relations, economic institutions and social processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paul Robbins, conveys this in his differentiation of "A-political verse political ecologies". According to Robbins political ecology places emphasis on identifying "broader systems rather than blaming proximate and local forces; between viewing ecological systems as power-laden rather than politically inert; and between taking an explicitly normative approach rather than one that claims the objectivity of disinterest".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology: A critical introduction|last=Robbins|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackbell|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=13 - 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human environmental relations reverberate through "the system" &amp;nbsp;(politics, economics, power relations) moving through an entire web of human relations and structures that are intertwined in ecological relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology: A critical Introduction|last=Robbins|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackbell|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, environmental social scientists stress human – environmental relationships. Another idea that has risen to prominence in environmental social science in light of this, is the idea of "environmental justice" which connects issues in the field of social justice with issues related to the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|last2=Kopnina|first=Eleanor and Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=120 - 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing environmental justice, the concepts emphasized by Shoreman-Ouimet and Kopnina include "equity equality, and rights issues in relation to both social and ecological actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|last2=Kopnina|first=Eleanor and Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=London, Newyork|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pans out in debates about environmental vulnerability and the unequal distribution of resources. Here lies the idea, that certain groups are made more vulnerable to "environmental burdens"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while others gain more access to "environmental benefits"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as defined in terms of environmental resources and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In further attempting to understand human - environmental relationships disciplines of environmental social science have begun to explore relationships between humans and non-humans, to understand how both interact with each other within the natural world. Ideas related to exploring human and animal interactions within the natural world, have become prominent in environmental ethics. Shoreman Ouimet and Kopnina define environment ethics as "a sub-discipline of philosophy that deals with the ethical problems surrounding the environment, in some cases providing ethical justification and moral motivation for the cause of environmental protection or for considerations of animal welfare".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has culminated in debates regarding environmental value and moral rights and who within the larger ecosystem should be assigned these rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Environmental ethics explores the dialectic between human and nature exploring how the human configuration of nature may in turn reshape humans, their relationships and their conditions. Ideas that have emerged from the questions seeking to examine this dialectic include those of "post-domesticity and domesticity".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology of Meat|last=Emel|last2=Neo|first=Jodey &amp; Harvey|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domesticity refers to societal dynamics produced in societies in which humans have daily contact with animals other than pets in contrast in post-domesticity people are quite distant from the animals they consume in referencing the ideas of Bulliet (2005) Emel and Neo convey that a distance from witnessing the processes that govern animal life including births, deaths while consuming animals as food, impacts people differently than if they were to be interacting continuously with animals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They mention that post- domesticity may produce feelings of guilt however the continued distance between animal life brought by interacting with animals as a commodity may cause people to only distantly relate to them or think of them as packages in a store disassociating them from the life-cycles they embody.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore environmental science has paved the way to multiple concepts, ideas and paradigms that differ among each other but all seek to intertwine issues related to the environment with other fields and issues in the social sciences.

== Social epidemiology ==
Social epidemiologists research how SES (socio-economic status) determines varying access to resources like income and prestige can generate stratification in health and quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=snippet&amp;q=social%20epidemiologist&amp;f=false|title=Social Epidemiology|last=Berkman|first=Lisa F.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichirō|last3=Glymour|first3=M. Maria|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195377903|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, their investigations relate to the social determinants of health which the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reports as the "conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play ... that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/|title=Social Determinants of Health {{!}} CDC|date=2017-07-28|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These epidemiologists must work in conjunction with environmental social scientists to understand the significance of different environments' effects on humans. Such work influences environmental and public health policies to better the living standards for humans globally. The Fifth European [[Ministerial Conference]] on Environment and Health agreed to work on improving low-income housing conditions with new [[urban planning]], [[health equity]], and environmental justice policies with a specific focus on preventing children from exposure to significant environmental health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hia/housing/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Housing and Health|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain environments' affects on humans provides trends that social epidemiologists can investigate to determine if they are related to a divide of social status especially if only a certain part of the population is negatively affected. [[Epidemiology]] uses a host-agent-environment triangle framework to understand why humans are falling ill and this three prong approach allows social epidemiologists to explore how the environment is contributing to the decline in health status for a subsection of or the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulis|first=Gabriel|last2=Fujino|first2=Yoshihisa|date=2015-03-05|title=Epidemiology, Population Health, and Health Impact Assessment|journal=Journal of Epidemiology|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–180|doi=10.2188/jea.JE20140212|issn=0917-5040|pmc=4340993|pmid=25716580}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes the idea that the social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors are all important factors to be considered, and health impact assessments (HIA) recommended by social epidemiologists working with environment social scientists are effectively making positive changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulis|first=Gabriel|last2=Fujino|first2=Yoshihisa|date=2015-03-05|title=Epidemiology, Population Health, and Health Impact Assessment|journal=Journal of Epidemiology|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–180|doi=10.2188/jea.JE20140212|issn=0917-5040|pmc=4340993|pmid=25716580}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) worked with its members to compose the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) protocol in 2001 to ensure health impact assessments would be made with environmental assessments for policies relating to bettering the quality of life especially within low socioeconomic communities all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hia/network/who_role/en/index2.html|title=WHO {{!}} WHO activities in HIA|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the environment can create stressors that are factors (i.e. low quality housing in areas of high pollution) that limit the quality of life of millions of people globally, environmental social scientists work collaboratively with the data social epidemiologists investigate and provide to understand the relationship between health status and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=environment&amp;f=false|title=Social Epidemiology|last=Berkman|first=Lisa F.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichirō|last3=Glymour|first3=M.

'''Erskine College''' is a private [[Christian]] college in [[Due West, South Carolina]]. It offers an undergraduate [[liberal arts college]] and a graduate [[theological seminary]]. The college was founded in 1839 by the [[Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church]], and its sports teams compete in [[NCAA Division II]] as a member of [[Conference Carolinas]].

==History==
Established in 1839 by the Associate Reformed Synod of the South as an academy for men, the college became the first four-year, church-related college in South Carolina{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was named for [[Ebenezer Erskine]], one of the founders of one of the antecedent bodies of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and a [[pastor]]. Erskine had led a group of separatists from the [[Church of Scotland]] to found an Associate [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]]. 

Erskine began to admit women in 1894 and officially became [[coeducational]] in 1899. In 1927, it merged with [[Women's College of Due West]], founded in 1859. In 1929, [[Bryson College]] closed and merged with Erskine College.&lt;ref name="Bryson historical marker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=14782|title=Bryson College Memorial|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandlapper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.erskine.edu/news_archive/news/sandlapper.6.8.01.html|title=Erskine College: Hard To Find, Harder To Leave|accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2014, a website article on [[Outsports]] detailed the coming out of two male players on the college's volleyball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsports.com/2014/3/11/5496256/drew-davis-erskine-college-gay-volleyball-juan-varona |title=Rural South Carolina Div.

Although Erskine is regionally accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], it was placed on "Warning" status following its most recent decennial accreditation review in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacscoc.org/gendisc/29440.pdf |title=Disclosure Statement Regarding the Status of ERSKINE COLLEGE |author=[[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Colleges |date=December 19, 2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College's status was reviewed in December 2014, and the sanction was then escalated to "Probation" status, due to continued failure to comply with accreditation standards related to fiscal stability and institutional effectiveness in student learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacscoc.org/2014decemberActionsandDisclosureStatements/14cractdecember.pdf|title=Actions taken by the SACSCOC Board of Trustees December 7, 2014|author=[[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Colleges|first=|date=December 7, 2014|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216101208/http://www.sacscoc.org/2014decemberActionsandDisclosureStatements/14cractdecember.pdf|archive-date=2015-02-16|dead-url=yes|accessdate=March 1, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SACSCOC removed all accreditation sanctions and reaffirmed Erskine’s regional accreditation in December 2015.

==Athletics==
Erksine College teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]]. The Flying Fleet are a member of the [[Conference Carolinas]]. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country,football, golf, soccer, tennis and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

==The Flying Fleet==
Back in 1896, Erskine College began its first American football team. They had very successful seasons between 1917 and 1921. During those seasons they have wins against Wofford, Presbyterian, South Carolina, Clemson, and the Citadel. One of the memorable games of Erskine's football team was against Furman University. It was during that game in 1929 that Erskine took on the name "The Flying Fleet". They were given that name by a Greenville reporter who was blown away by their passing performance in that game. On October 18, 1948 when they defeated Florida State 14-6. It was only a couple more years until the Flying Fleet ended their football program in 1951.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1235">The '''Escalation Hypothesis''' is a theory put forward by [[Geerat J.  Vermeij]].  It states that organisms are in constant conflict with one another and therefore devote lots of resources to thwarting the adaptations [[evolution]] brings to all competing organisms as time advances.  This is in contrast to adaptations evolution may bring that are unrelated to competition with other organisms such as adapting to ecological niches based upon other factors such as geology and climate.  

Vermeij's extensive work with the characteristics of marine [[gastropod]] fossils informed his development of thoughts on escalation.  One prediction of the Escalation Hypothesis is that individual species having fewer adaptations that enable them to compete with other life forms are more likely to survive a mass [[extinction event]] such as one of [[extinction event#Major extinction events|The Big Five]].  This is because there is more flexibility to fit into new ecological niches that arduous adaptations such as heavy shells or energy consuming venom production would hinder.

'''Fish''' are [[gill]]-bearing [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[craniate]] animals that lack [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] with [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]]. They form a sister group to the [[tunicate]]s, together forming the [[Chordate|olfactores]]. Included in this definition are the living [[hagfish]], [[lamprey]]s, and [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous]] and [[bony fish]] as well as various extinct related groups. [[Tetrapod]]s emerged within [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fishes]], so [[Cladistics|cladistically]] they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered [[paraphyletic]] by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in [[systematics|systematic biology]], unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.weber.edu/choagstrom/Zoology1120CH10.pdf|title=Zoology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Harry W.|date=1998-01-01|title=We are primates and we are fish: Teaching monophyletic organismal biology|journal=Integrative Biology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=108–111|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6602(1998)1:3&lt;108::aid-inbi5&gt;3.0.co;2-t|issn=1520-6602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional term '''pisces''' (also '''ichthyes''') is considered a [[wikt:typology|typological]], but not a [[phylogenetic]] classification.

The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied [[chordate]]s that first appeared during the [[Cambrian]] period. Although they lacked a [[vertebrate|true spine]], they possessed [[notochord]]s which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the [[Paleozoic]] era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed [[placodermi|external armor]] that protected them from predators. The first fish with [[jaw]]s appeared in the [[Silurian]] period, after which many (such as [[shark]]s) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of [[arthropod]]s.

Most fish are [[ectotherm]]ic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like [[white shark]] and [[tuna]] can hold a higher [[core temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=K.J. |title=Regulation of body temperature in the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'' |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=1997 |volume=167 |series=B Biochemical Systemic and Environmental Physiology |issue=6 |pages=423–429 |doi=10.1007/s003600050092 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406114844/http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carey |first=F.G. |author2=Lawson, K.D. |title=Temperature regulation in free-swimming bluefin tuna |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |date=February 1973 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=375–392 |doi=10.1016/0300-9629(73)90490-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bioacoustics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinmann|first1=S.

They can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertucci|first1=F.|last2=Ruppé|first2=L.|last3=Wassenbergh|first3=S.

Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., [[Salvelinus|char]] and [[gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]) to the [[abyssal zone|abyssal]] and even [[hadal zone|hadal]] depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., [[gulper]]s and [[anglerfish]]), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean. With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[FishBase]] |url=http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |title=FishBase |date=August 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823230232/http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |archivedate=23 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3970477 | pmid=24591588 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1322003111 | volume=111 | issue=12 | title=Marine fish may be biochemically constrained from inhabiting the deepest ocean depths | year=2014 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=4461–5 | last1 = Yancey | first1 = PH | last2 = Gerringer | first2 = ME | last3 = Drazen | first3 = JC | last4 = Rowden | first4 = AA | last5 = Jamieson | first5 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially [[fish (food)|as food]]. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in [[wild fisheries]] (see fishing) or [[Fish farm|farm]] them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see [[aquaculture]]). They are also caught by [[Recreational fishing|recreational fishers]], kept as pets, raised by [[Fishkeeping|fishkeepers]], and exhibited in public [[aquarium|aquaria]]. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as [[deity|deities]], religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.

==Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of fish}}
[[File:Dunkleosteus BW.jpg|thumb|''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' was a gigantic, {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} long [[prehistoric fish]] of class Placodermi.|alt=Drawing of animal with large mouth, long tail, very small dorsal fins, and pectoral fins that attach towards the bottom of the body, resembling lizard legs in scale and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |title=Monster fish crushed opposition with strongest bite ever |publisher=[[Smh.com.au]] |date=30 November 2006 |accessdate=26 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402143409/http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |archivedate=2 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fish do not represent a [[monophyletic]] group, and therefore the "evolution of fish" is not studied as a single event.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lecointre &amp; H. Le Guyader, 2007, ''The Tree of Life: A Phylogenetic Classification'', Harvard University Press Reference Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small, jawless, armored fish known as [[ostracoderm]]s. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in [[Placodermi]] fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a [[Fish jaw|jawed mouth]]. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.

Fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like [[sea squirt]], whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have [[Neoteny|kept the larval form into adulthood]] (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.

===Taxonomy===
Fish are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group: that is, any [[clade]] containing all fish also contains the [[tetrapod]]s, which are not fish. For this reason, groups such as the "Class Pisces" seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications.
[[File:Leedsi&amp;Liopl DB.jpg|thumb|[[Leedsichthys]] (left), of the subclass Actinopterygii, is the largest known fish, with estimates in 2005 putting its maximum size at {{convert|16|m}}.]]

Traditional classification divides fish into three [[extant taxon|extant]] [[class (biology)|classes]], and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree, sometimes as their own classes:&lt;ref name="Romer, A 1977"&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S. Parsons. 1977. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benton, M. J. (1998) The quality of the fossil record of vertebrates. Pp. 269–303, in Donovan, S. K. and Paul, C. R. C. (eds), The adequacy of the fossil record, Fig. 2. Wiley, New York, 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fish)
** Subclass [[Cyclostomata]] ([[hagfish]] and [[lamprey]]s)
** Subclass [[Ostracodermi]] (armoured jawless fish) †
* Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]])
** Subclass [[Holocephali]] ([[chimaera]]s and extinct relatives)
* Class [[Placodermi]] (armoured fish) †
* Class [[Acanthodii]] ("spiny sharks", sometimes classified under bony fishes)†
* Class [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish)
** Subclass [[Actinopterygii]] (ray finned fishes)
** Subclass [[Sarcopterygii]] (fleshy finned fishes, ancestors of tetrapods)

The above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non-specialist and general works. Many of the above groups are paraphyletic, in that they have given rise to successive groups: Agnathans are ancestral to Chondrichthyes, who again have given rise to Acanthodiians, the ancestors of Osteichthyes. With the arrival of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], the fishes has been split up into a more detailed scheme, with the following major groups:
* Class Myxini ([[hagfish]])
* Class [[Pteraspidomorphi]] † (early jawless fish)
* Class [[Thelodonti]] †
* Class [[Anaspida]] †
* Class [[Hyperoartia|Petromyzontida or Hyperoartia]]
** Petromyzontidae ([[lamprey]]s)
* Class [[Conodont]]a (conodonts) †
* Class [[Cephalaspidomorphi]] † (early jawless fish)
** (unranked) [[Galeaspida]] †
** (unranked) [[Pituriaspida]] †
** (unranked) [[Osteostraci]] †
* Infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]] (jawed vertebrates)
** Class [[Placodermi]] † (armoured fish)
** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Class [[Acanthodii]] † (spiny sharks)
** Superclass [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish)
*** Class [[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned fish)
**** Subclass [[Chondrostei]]
***** Order [[Acipenseriformes]] ([[sturgeon]]s and [[paddlefish]]es)
***** Order [[Polypteriformes]] ([[reedfish]]es and [[bichir]]s).
**** Subclass [[Neopterygii]]
***** Infraclass [[Holostei]] ([[gar]]s and [[bowfin]]s)
***** Infraclass [[Teleostei]] (many orders of common fish)
*** Class [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fish)
**** Subclass [[Actinistia]] ([[coelacanth]]s)
**** Subclass Dipnoi ([[lungfish]])

† – indicates extinct taxon&lt;br /&gt;Some palaeontologists contend that because [[Conodonta]] are [[chordate]]s, they are primitive fish. For a fuller treatment of this taxonomy, see the [[vertebrate]] article.

The position of [[hagfish]] in the phylum Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group, the [[Cyclostomata]], that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.&lt;ref&gt;Shigehiro Kuraku, Daisuke Hoshiyama, Kazutaka Katoh, Hiroshi Suga, Takashi Miyata (1999) ''Monophyly of Lampreys and Hagfishes Supported by Nuclear DNA–Coded Genes'' J Mol Evol (1999) 49:729–735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mallatt, J. Sullivan (1998) ''28S and 18S rDNA sequences support the monophyly of lampreys and hagfishes'' Molecular Biology and Evolution V 15, Issue 12, pp 1706–1718&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species. There are almost 28,000 known [[extant taxon|extant]] species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 [[Chondrichthyes|sharks, rays, and chimeras]] and about 108 hagfish and lampreys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are [[Cyprinidae]], [[Gobiidae]], [[Cichlidae]], [[Characidae]], [[Loricariidae]], [[Balitoridae]], [[Serranidae]], [[Labridae]], and [[Scorpaenidae]]. About 64 families are [[monotypic]], containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fish" most precisely describes any non-[[tetrapod]] [[craniate]] (i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone) that has [[gill]]s throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike groupings such as birds or [[mammal]]s, fish are not a single [[clade]] but a [[paraphyletic]] collection of [[taxon|taxa]], including [[hagfish]]es, [[lamprey]]s, [[Chondrichthyes|sharks and rays]], [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], [[coelacanth]]s, and [[lungfish]].&lt;ref name="publishing3"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treeoflife&gt;Tree of life web project – [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 Chordates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224172716/http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 |date=24 February 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of [[tetrapod]]s (such as [[mammal]]s, birds, [[Lissamphibia|amphibians]], etc.) than of other fish such as [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] or sharks, so the [[last common ancestor]] of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern [[systematics|systematic biology]], the use of the term "fish" as a biological group must be avoided.

Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s commonly referred to as "fish" are not fish in the sense given above; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction – sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seals]], whales, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name="integrated"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cleveland P. Hickman, Jr. |author2=Larry S. Roberts |author3=Allan L. Larson |title=Integrated Principles of Zoology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Co |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-07-290961-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the definition above, all mammals, including [[cetacean]]s like whales and dolphins, are not fish. In some contexts, especially in [[aquaculture]], the true fish are referred to as '''finfish''' (or '''fin fish''') to distinguish them from these other animals.

[[File:leafydragon.jpg|thumb|A relative of the seahorses, the [[leafy seadragon]]'s appendages allow it to camouflage (in the form of [[crypsis]]) with the surrounding [[seaweed]].|alt=Photo of fish with many narrow, straight appendages. Some are end in points, and others are longer, ending in two or three approximately flat, triangular flaps, each with a dark spot.]]

A typical fish is [[ectothermic]], has a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamlined]] body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with [[scale (zoology)|scales]], and lays eggs.

Each criterion has exceptions. [[Tuna]], [[swordfish]], and some species of [[shark]]s show [[Warm-blooded#Temperature control in cold-blooded animals|some warm-blooded adaptations]]—they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature.&lt;ref name="publishing3"/&gt; Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as [[tuna]], [[salmon]], and [[Carangidae|jacks]] that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to species such as [[eel]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]] that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. [[Lungfish]] have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, [[gourami]]s have a structure called the [[labyrinth organ]] that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as ''[[Corydoras]]'' extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=53–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as [[seahorse]]s, [[pufferfish]], [[anglerfish]], and [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulpers]]. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in [[moray eel]]s), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as [[Placoid scale|placoid]] (typical of sharks and rays), [[Scale (zoology)#Cosmoid scales|cosmoid]] (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), [[ganoid]] (various fossil fish but also living [[gar]]s and [[bichir]]s), [[Fish scale#Leptoid scales|cycloid]], and [[ctenoid]] (these last two are found on most [[bony fish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin, K.L.M. |title=Beach-Spawning Fishes: Reproduction in an Endangered Ecosystem |year=2014 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1482207972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mudskipper]]s feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Periophthalmus|species=barbarus|year=2006|month=November|id=12803}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single, [[undescribed species]] of ''[[Phreatobius]]'', has been called a true "land fish" as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged [[leaf litter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/species.php?species_id=646 |title=Cat-eLog: Heptapteridae: ''Phreatobius'': ''Phreatobius'' sp.

Fish range in size from the huge {{convert|16|m|adj=on}} [[whale shark]] to the tiny {{convert|8|mm|1|adj=on}} [[stout infantfish]].

Fish [[species]] diversity is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and [[freshwater]] ecosystems. [[Coral reef]]s in the [[Indo-Pacific]] constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large [[river basin]]s of [[tropical rainforest]]s, especially the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], [[Congo Basin|Congo]], and [[Mekong]] basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit [[Neotropic]]al freshwaters alone, such that [[Neotropical fish]]es represent about 10% of all [[vertebrate]] species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as [[Cantão State Park]], can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://central2.to.gov.br/arquivo/24/199 Estudo das Espécies Ícticas do Parque Estadual do Cantão] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160450/http://central2.to.gov.br/arquivo/24/199 |date=6 July 2011 }}, fish species survey of Cantão (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiration===
{{See also|Aquatic respiration}}

====Gills====
Most fish exchange gases using [[gill]]s on either side of the [[pharynx]]. Gills consist of threadlike structures called [[Protein filament|filaments]]. Each filament contains a [[capillary]] network that provides a large [[surface area]] for exchanging [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing [[countercurrent exchange]]. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like [[shark]]s and [[lamprey]]s, possess multiple gill openings. However, [[bony fish]] have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]].

Juvenile [[bichir]]s have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share with larval [[amphibian]]s.

====Air breathing====
[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|[[Tuna]] gills inside the head. The fish head is oriented snout-downwards, with the view looking towards the mouth.|alt=Photo of fish head split in half longitudinally with gill filaments crossing from top to bottom]]
Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods. [[Amphibious fish]] such as the [[mudskipper]] can live and move about on land for up to several days,{{doubtful|date=December 2014}} or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of [[anguillidae|anguillid eels]] may absorb oxygen directly. The [[buccal cavity]] of the [[electric eel]] may breathe air. Catfish of the families [[Loricariidae]], [[Callichthyidae]], and [[Scoloplacidae]] absorb air through their digestive tracts.&lt;ref name="Armbruster1998"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |title=Modifications of the Digestive Tract for Holding Air in Loricariid and Scoloplacid Catfishes |journal=[[Copeia]] |year=1998 |issue=3 |pages=663–675 |doi=10.2307/1447796 |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2009 |volume=1998 |last1=Armbruster |first1=Jonathan W. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326130527/http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy-all |jstor=1447796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lungfish]], with the exception of the [[Australian lungfish]], and [[bichir]]s have paired lungs similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. [[Gar]] and [[bowfin]] have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. [[Cypriniformes|Loaches]], [[Erythrinidae|trahiras]], and many [[catfish]] breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as [[gourami]]s and [[betta]]s) have a [[labyrinth (organ)|labyrinth organ]] above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]], [[Luciocephalidae|pikeheads]], and the [[Clariidae]] catfish family.

Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and [[cichlid]]s, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of [[aestivation]] (summertime hibernation) until water returns.

Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the [[African lungfish]], ''must'' breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish ''[[Hypostomus plecostomus]]'', only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.&lt;ref name="Armbruster1998"/&gt;

===Circulation===
[[File:Didactic model of a fish heart--FMVZ USP-09.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a fish heart]]
Fish have a [[circulatory system|closed-loop circulatory system]]. The [[heart]] pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.&lt;ref name="Setaro"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Setaro |first=John F. |year=1999 |title=Circulatory System |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part is the [[sinus venosus]], a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's [[vein]]s before allowing it to flow to the second part, the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]], which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, [[bulbus arteriosus]], a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the [[aorta]], through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.

===Digestion===
Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the [[esophagus]]. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called [[pyloric caeca]], which secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.

===Excretion===
As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as [[ammonia]]. Some of the wastes [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the gills. Blood wastes are [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] by the [[kidney]]s.

Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of [[osmosis]]. Their kidneys return water to the body. The reverse happens in [[freshwater fish]]: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.

===Scales===
{{Main|Fish scale}}
The scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth.

===Sensory and nervous system===
[[File:Fish brain.png|thumb|upright|Dorsal view of the brain of the [[rainbow trout]]|alt=Anatomical diagram showing the pairs of olfactory, telencephalon, and optic lobes, followed by the cerebellum and the mylencephalon]]

====Central nervous system====
Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably [[Mormyridae|mormyrids]] and [[shark]]s, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the [[olfactory bulb|olfactory lobes]], a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the [[nostril]]s via the two [[olfactory nerve]]s.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed [[telencephalon]], the structural equivalent to the [[cerebrum]] in [[amniote|higher vertebrates]]. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with [[olfaction]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; Together these structures form the forebrain.

Connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the [[diencephalon]] (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with [[hormone]]s and [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The [[pineal body]] lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains [[circadian]] rhythms, and controls color changes.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The [[midbrain]] (or mesencephalon) contains the two [[Midbrain#Corpora quadrigemina|optic lobes]]. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as [[rainbow trout]] and [[cichlid]]s.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The hindbrain (or [[metencephalon]]) is particularly involved in swimming and balance.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain" /&gt; Hagfish and [[lamprey]]s have relatively small cerebellae, while the [[mormyrid]] cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their [[electric fish|electrical sense]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The brain stem (or [[myelencephalon]]) is the brain's posterior.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; As well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[osmoregulation]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

====Sense organs====
Most fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see [[vision in fishes]]). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the [[lateral line system]], which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey.&lt;ref name="Encarta 99"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orr |first=James |year=1999 |title=Fish |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99 |isbn=978-0-8114-2346-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]], organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, J.S., and W.G.R. Crampton. 2005. Electroreception and electrogenesis. pp. 431–472 in The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. D.H. Evans and J.B. Claiborne (eds.). CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fish, like the South American electric fishes [[Gymnotiformes]], can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.

Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sciences |first=Journal of Undergraduate Life |url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |title=Appropriate maze methodology to study learning in fish |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hn2YJET6?url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vision=====
{{main|Vision in fishes}}
[[Visual system|Vision]] is an important [[sensory system]] for most species of fish. Fish eyes are similar to those of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrate]]s like [[bird vision|birds]] and mammals, but have a more [[spherical]] [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. Their [[retina]]s generally have both [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] (for [[scotopic vision|scotopic]] and [[photopic vision]]), and most species have [[colour vision]]. Some fish can see [[ultraviolet]] and some can see [[polarized light]]. Amongst [[jawless fish]], the [[lamprey]] has well-developed eyes, while the [[hagfish]] has only primitive [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil A. Campbell |last2=Reece |first2=Jane B. |authorlink2=Jane Reece |year=2005 |title=''Biology'' |edition=Seventh |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish vision shows [[adaptation]] to their visual environment, for example [[deep sea fish]]es have eyes suited to the dark environment.

=====Hearing=====
{{see also|Sensory systems in fish#Hearing}}
[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Fish sense sound using their [[lateral line]]s and their [[otolith|ears]].

====Capacity for pain====
{{Further|Pain in fish}}
Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have [[pain]] and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, [[Batrachoididae|toadfish]] grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.&lt;ref&gt;Dunayer, Joan, "Fish: Sensitivity Beyond the Captor's Grasp," The Animals' Agenda, July/August 1991, pp. 12–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Scottish scientists at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with [[pain]] in other animals. [[Bee]] [[venom]] and [[acetic acid]] injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm |title=Fish do feel pain, scientists say |work=BBC News |date=30 April 2003 |accessdate=4 January 2010 |first=Alex |last=Kirby |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215121355/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grandin183"&gt;{{cite book |title=Animals in Translation |last=Grandin |first=Temple |authorlink=Temple Grandin |author2=Johnson, Catherine |year=2005 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7432-4769-6 |pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.&lt;ref name="grandin183"/&gt;

Professor James D. Rose of the [[University of Wyoming]]  claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess "conscious awareness, particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/RoseC.pdf |title=Rose, J.D. 2003.

Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a [[neocortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose |first=James D. |url=http://www.coloradotu.org/do-fish-feel-pain/ |title=Do Fish Feel Pain? |year=2002 |accessdate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120104558/http://www.coloradotu.org/do-fish-feel-pain/ |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, animal behaviorist [[Temple Grandin]] argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because "different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions."&lt;ref name="grandin183"/&gt;

Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible [[suffering]] of fish caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British [[RSPCA]] now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1037515,00.html |title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscular system===
{{Main|Fish locomotion}}
[[File:Swim bladder.jpg|thumb|Swim bladder of a rudd (''[[Scardinius erythrophthalmus]]'')|alt=Photo of white bladder that consists of a rectangular section and a banana-shaped section connected by a much thinner element]]

Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a [[swim bladder]] that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.

====Endothermy====
Although most fish are exclusively [[ectothermic]], there are exceptions. The only known bony fishes (infraclass [[Teleostei]]) that exhibit [[Warm-blooded|endothermy]] are in the suborder [[Scombroidei]] – which includes the [[billfish]]es, tunas, and the [[butterfly kingfish]], a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] species of mackerel&lt;ref name="Block1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Block |first1=BA |last2=Finnerty |first2=JR |year=1993 |title=Endothermy in fishes: a phylogenetic analysis of constraints, predispositions, and selection pressures |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226138605 |format=PDF |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=283–302 |doi=10.1007/BF00002518}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and also the [[Lampris guttatus|opah]]. The opah, a [[lampriform]], was demonstrated in 2015 to utilize "whole-body endothermy", generating heat with its swimming muscles to warm its body while countercurrent exchange (as in respiration) minimizes heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wegner |first=Nicholas C. |last2=Snodgrass |first2=Owyn E. |last3=Dewar |first3=Heidi |last4=Hyde |first4=John R. |date=2015-05-15 |title=Whole-body endothermy in a mesopelagic fish, the opah, Lampris guttatus |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6236/786 |journal=Science |volume=348 |issue=6236 |pages=786–789 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa8902 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=25977549}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to actively hunt prey such as squid and swim for long distances due to the ability to warm its entire body, including its heart,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://swfsc.noaa.gov/news.aspx?ParentMenuId=39&amp;id=20466 |title=Warm Blood Makes Opah an Agile Predator |date=2015-05-12 |website=Southwest Fisheries Science Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120000911/https://swfsc.noaa.gov/news.aspx?ParentMenuId=39&amp;id=20466 |archive-date=2018-01-20 |dead-url=no |access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a trait typically found in only mammals and birds (in the form of [[homeothermy]]).&lt;!-- Mentioned in Wegner 2015 --&gt; In the cartilaginous fishes (class [[Chondrichthyes]]), sharks of the families [[Lamnidae]] (porbeagle, mackerel, salmon, and great white sharks) and [[Alopiidae]] (thresher sharks) exhibit endothermy. The degree of endothermy varies from the billfishes, which warm only their eyes and brain, to the [[bluefin tuna]] and the [[porbeagle shark]], which maintain body temperatures in excess of {{convert|20|C}} above ambient water temperatures.&lt;ref name="Block1993" /&gt;

Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central [[nervous system]] processing, and higher rates of [[digestion]].

{{Anchor|Reproductive method}}

===Reproductive system===
{{Further|Fish reproduction|Spawn (biology)}}

[[File:Torskens indre organer.jpg|thumb|[[Organ (anatomy)|Organs]]: 1. [[Liver]], 2. [[Gas bladder]], 3. [[Roe]], 4. Pyloric caeca, 5. [[Stomach]], 6. [[Intestine]]]]
Fish reproductive organs include [[testicle]]s and [[ovary|ovaries]]. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt; There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.

In terms of [[spermatogonia]] distribution, the structure of [[teleost]]s testes has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the [[seminiferous tubule]]s, while in [[wiktionary:atherinomorph|atherinomorph]] fish they are confined to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic [[spermatogenesis]] in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guimaraes-Cruz, Rodrigo J. |author2=Santos, José E. dos |author3=Santos, Gilmar B. |title=Gonadal structure and gametogenesis of ''Loricaria lentiginosa'' Isbrücker (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes) |journal=Rev.

Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the [[oocyte]]s are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then enter the [[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostium]], then through the [[oviduct]] and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed [[ovum|ova]] into the [[coelom]] from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018 |title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the São Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil |last=Brito |first=M.F.G. |author2=Bazzoli, N. |journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia |volume=55 |issue=5 |year=2003 |doi=10.1590/S0102-09352003000500018 |issn=0102-0935 |pages=624–633 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135717/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in [[lungfish]], [[sturgeon]], and [[bowfin]]. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"/&gt; Secondary gymnovaries are found in [[salmonid]]s and a few other teleosts.

[[Oogonia]] development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes. Changes in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Postovulatory [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have [[endocrine]] function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the [[apoptosis]] of follicular cells. A degenerative process called [[follicular atresia]] reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Some fish, like the [[California sheephead]], are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in [[hamlet (fish)|hamlets]], have them simultaneously.

Over 97% of all known fish are [[oviparous]],&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Peter Scott: ''Livebearing Fishes'', p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. {{ISBN|1-56465-193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include [[salmon]], [[goldfish]], [[cichlid]]s, [[tuna]], and [[eel]]s. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic]] fins known as [[clasper]]s.

Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of {{convert|1|mm}}.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fishegg A.Slotwinski TAFI.jpg|thumb|An example of [[zooplankton]]|alt=Photo of semi-transparent creature with a darker, yolk-like central structure and other approximately round internal elements]] --&gt;
The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[Ichthyoplankton|larva]]e. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.

In [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the [[yolk]]. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.

Some species of fish are [[viviparous]]. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placental mammals|mammals]] connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the [[Embiotocidae|surf-perches]], [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], and [[lemon shark]]. Some viviparous fish exhibit [[oophagy]], in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the [[halfbeak]] ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner"&gt;Meisner, A &amp; Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae)" ''Journal of Morphology'' 234, pp. 295–317, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intrauterine cannibalism]] is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the [[grey nurse shark]], but has also been reported for ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner" /&gt;

[[Fishkeeping|Aquarists]] commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as [[livebearer]]s.

== Acoustic communication in fish ==
Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bioacoustics"/&gt;
The sounds emitted can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. Fish can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;

===Stridulatory sound producing mechanisms===
[[File:French grunts - Haemulon flavolineatum.jpg|thumb|French grunts - Haemulon flavolineatum]]
There are some species of fish that can produce sounds by rubbing or grinding their bones together. These noises produced by bone-on-bone interactions are known as 'stridulatory sounds'.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

An example of this is seen in ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum]]'', a species commonly referred to as the 'French grunt fish', as it produces a grunting noise by grinding its teeth together.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;
This behaviour is most pronounced when the ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum|H. flavolineatum]]'' is in distress situations.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt; The grunts produced by this species of fishes generate a frequency of approximately 700&amp;nbsp;Hz, and last approximately 47 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt; The ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum|H. flavolineatum]]'' does not emit sounds with frequencies greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, and does not detect sounds that have frequencies greater than 1050&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

In a study conducted by Oliveira et al. (2014), the longsnout seahorse, ''[[Hippocampus reidi]]'', was recorded producing two different categories of sounds; ‘clicks’ and ‘growls’. The sounds emitted by the ''[[Hippocampus reidi|H. reidi]]'' are accomplished by rubbing their coronet bone across the grooved section of their neurocranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colson|first1=D.

===Non-stridulatory sound producing mechanisms===
[[File:C(flipped).jpg|thumb|{{center|Oyster toadfish}}]]
Some fish species create noise by engaging specialized muscles that contract and cause swimbladder vibrations.

[[Oyster toadfish]] produce loud grunting sounds by contracting muscles located along the sides of their swim bladder, known as sonic muscles&lt;ref name="Experimental"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=L.

==Diseases==
{{Main|Fish diseases and parasites}}
Like other animals, fish suffer from diseases and parasites. To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses. ''Non-specific'' defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that traps and inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s. If [[pathogen]]s breach these defenses, fish can develop an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers [[white blood cells]] that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an [[immune response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[vaccine]]s have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example [[furunculosis]] vaccines in farmed [[salmon]] and [[koi herpes virus]] in [[koi]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

Some species use [[cleaner fish]] to remove external parasites. The best known of these are the [[Bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]s of the genus ''Labroides'' found on [[coral reef]]s in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. These small fish maintain so-called "cleaning stations" where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, ''[[Orange chromide|Etroplus maculatus]]'', the cleaner, and the much larger ''Etroplus suratensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyman |first1=Richard L. |last2=Ward |first2=Jack A. |year=1972 |title=A Cleaning Symbiosis between the Cichlid Fishes Etroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis.

===Immune system===
Immune organs vary by type of fish.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Zapata, A. Chiba and A. Vara. ''Cells and tissues of the immune system of fish.'' In: The Fish Immune System: Organism, Pathogen and Environment. Fish Immunology Series. (eds. G. Iwama and T.Nakanishi,), New York, Academic Press, 1996, pp. 1–55.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[jawless fish]] (lampreys and hagfish), true [[lymph]]oid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of [[lymphoid tissue]] within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[plasma cells]] are produced in the anterior kidney (or [[pronephros]]) and some areas of the gut (where [[granulocytes]] mature.) They resemble primitive [[bone marrow]] in hagfish.
[[Cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to [[Chondrichthyes]]; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the [[Leydig's organ]] within the walls of their esophagus, and a [[spiral valve]] in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable [[thymus]] and a well-developed [[spleen]] (their most important immune organ) where various [[lymphocyte]]s, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.
[[Chondrostean]] fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the [[meninges]] (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, [[reticular cell]]s and a small number of [[macrophage]]s. The chondrostean kidney is an important [[hemopoietic]] organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.

Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or [[teleostei]]) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;D.P. Anderson. ''Fish Immunology''. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc. Ltd., 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chilmonczyk |first=S. |title=''The thymus in fish: development and possible function in the immune response'' |journal=[[Annual Review of Fish Diseases]] |volume=2 |year=1992 |pages=181–200 |doi=10.1016/0959-8030(92)90063-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=J.D. |last2=Zapata |first2=A.G. |year=1998 |title=''Lymphocyte development in fish and amphibians'' |journal=Immunological Reviews |volume=166 |pages=199–220 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01264.x|pmid=9914914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the [[zebrafish]]. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) [[T cell]]s accumulate while waiting to encounter an [[antigen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kucher |title=''Development of the zebrafish lymphatic system requires VegFc signalling'' |publisher=[[Current Biology]] |volume=16 |year=2006 |pages=1244–1248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B and T lymphocytes bearing [[immunoglobulin]]s and [[T cell receptor]]s, respectively, are found in all jawed fishes. Indeed, the [[adaptive immune system]] as a whole [[adaptive immune system#Evolution|evolved]] in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flajnik | first1 = M.

However, freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies. For example, the [[Devil's Hole pupfish]] occupies only a single {{convert|3|by|6|m|0}} pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overfishing===
[[File:Whale shark Georgia aquarium.jpg|thumb|[[Whale shark]]s, the largest species of fish, are classified as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].|alt=Photo of shark in profile surrounded by other, much smaller fish in bright sunlight]]
{{Main|Overfishing}}

Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm |title=Call to halt cod 'over-fishing' |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=5 January 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117142906/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm |archivedate=17 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm |title=Tuna groups tackle overfishing |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=26 January 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121111204/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm |archivedate=21 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing eventually causes [[Population dynamics of fisheries|population]] (known as [[Fish stock|stock]]) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such '''commercial extinction''' does not mean that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.

One well-studied example of fishery collapse is the [[Pacific sardine]] ''Sadinops sagax caerulues'' fishery off the California coast. From a 1937 peak of {{convert|790000|LT}} the catch steadily declined to only {{convert|24000|LT}} in 1968, after which the fishery was no longer economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tension between [[fisheries science]] and the [[fishing industry]] is that the two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the [[commercial fishing|fishing industry]] is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm |title=UK 'must shield fishing industry' |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=3 November 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130055349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm |archivedate=30 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm |title=EU fish quota deal hammered out |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=21 December 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061226234953/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm |archivedate=26 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html |title=Ocean study predicts the collapse of all seafood fisheries by 2050 |accessdate=13 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315014325/http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html |archivedate=15 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm |title=Atlantic bluefin tuna could soon be commercially extinct |accessdate=18 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430205610/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm |archivedate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitat destruction===
{{See also|Environmental impact of fishing}}

A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including [[water pollution]], the building of dams, removal of water for use by humans, and the introduction of [[invasive species|exotic]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the [[pallid sturgeon]], a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126220804/http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |archivedate=26 November 2005 |url=http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |title=Threatened and Endangered Species: Pallid Sturgeon ''Scaphirhynchus'' Fact Sheet |accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic species===
Introduction of [[invasive species|non-native]] species has occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of [[Nile perch]] into [[Lake Victoria]] in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 [[Endemism|endemic]] [[cichlid]] species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,,1541613,00.html |title=The little fish fight back |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Laura |last=Spinney |date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carp]], [[Channidae|snakeheads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html |title=Stop That Fish! |accessdate=26 August 2007 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=3 July 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103055232/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tilapia]], [[perch|European perch]], [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[sea lamprey]]s are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.

==Importance to humans==

===Economic importance===
{{Main|Fishing industry|Aquaculture|Fish farming}}
[[File:Community fish-farming ponds in the rural town of Masi Manimba, DRC (7609946524).jpg|alt=A row of square artificial ponds, with trees on either side|thumb|These fish-farming ponds were created as a [[cooperative]] project in a rural village.]]

Throughout history, humans have utilized [[Fish as food|fish as a food source]]. Historically and today, most fish [[protein]] has come by means of catching wild fish. However, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalding |first1=Mark |title=Sustainable Ancient Aquaculture |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/11/sustainable-ancient-aquaculture/ |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=13 August 2015 |date=11 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518210243/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/11/sustainable-ancient-aquaculture/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein is estimated to be provided by fish.&lt;ref name="Helfman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Helfman |first1=Gene S. |title=Fish Conservation: A Guide to Understanding and Restoring Global Aquatic Biodiversity and Fishery Resources |date=2007 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1597267601 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That proportion is considerably elevated in some [[developing nation]]s and regions heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.

Catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as [[fishing]], while the organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a [[fishery]]. Fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people.&lt;ref name="Helfman" /&gt; The annual yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf |website=fao.org |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828131307/http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with popular species including [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], and [[salmon]]. However, the term fishery is broadly applied, and includes more organisms than just fish, such as [[Mollusca|mollusks]] and [[crustacean]]s, which are often called "fish" when used as food.

===Recreation===
{{Main|Fishkeeping|Recreational fishing|Angling}}
Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in [[cave art]], being raised as [[ornamental fish]] in ponds, and displayed in [[aquarium]]s in homes, offices, or public settings.

''Recreational fishing'' is fishing for pleasure or competition; it can be contrasted with [[commercial fishing]], which is fishing for profit. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a [[fishing rod|rod]], [[fishing reel|reel]], [[fishing line|line]], [[fish hook|hook]]s and any one of a wide range of [[bait (luring substance)|baits]]. Angling is a method of fishing, specifically the practice of catching fish by means of an "angle" (hook). Anglers must select the right hook, [[cast net|cast]] accurately, and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather conditions, species, fish response, time of the day, and other factors.

=== Culture ===
{{main|Fish in culture}}

Fish feature prominently in art and literature, in movies such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and books such as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''. Large fish, particularly sharks, have frequently been the subject of [[Horror film|horror movies]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], most notably the novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'', which spawned a series of films of the [[Jaws (film)|same name]] that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as ''[[Shark Tale]]'' and ''[[Snakehead Terror]]''. Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''; however, contrary to popular belief, the [[red-bellied piranha]] is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zollinger |first1=Sue Anne |title=Piranha–Ferocious Fighter or Scavenging Softie? |url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/piranhaferocious-fighter-scavenging-softie/ |website=A Moment of Science |publisher=Indiana Public Media |accessdate=1 November 2015 |date=3 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017010303/http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/piranhaferocious-fighter-scavenging-softie/ |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends of half-human, half-fish [[mermaid]]s have featured in folklore, including the stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

==Terminology==
===Fish or fishes===
Though often used interchangeably, in biology these words have different meanings. ''Fish'' is used as a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. ''Fishes'' is used to describe different species or species groups.&lt;ref name="Pauly2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pauly |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Pauly |title=Fish(es) |encyclopedia=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC&amp;pg=PA77 |date=13 May 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-45181-9 |page=77 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208060837/https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC&amp;pg=PA77 |archivedate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph S. Nelson|Nelson, Joseph S]] and Paetz, Martin Joseph (1992) [http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf ''The Fishes of Alberta''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085249/http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf |date=7 April 2014 }} page 400, University of Alberta. {{ISBN|9780888642363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="publishing5"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.

===True fish and finfish=== &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[True fish]], [[Fin-fish]] and [[Finfish]] redirect here --&gt;
* In biology, the term ''fish'' is most strictly used to describe any animal with a [[Vertebral column|backbone]] that has [[gill]]s throughout life and has limbs, if any, in the shape of [[fin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fishes of the World |last=Nelson |first=Joseph S. |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-25031-9 |pages=2|title-link=Fishes of the World }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s with common names ending in "fish" are not fish in this [[Fish#Definition|sense]]; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction—sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seal]]s, whales, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name="integrated" /&gt;
* In fisheries, the term ''fish'' is used as a collective term, and includes [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and any [[aquatic animal]] which is harvested.&lt;ref name="fao glossary"&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp ''Fisheries glossary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129213844/http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp |date=29 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The strict biological definition of a fish, above, is sometimes called a ''true fish''. True fish are also referred to as ''finfish'' or ''fin fish'' to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.

===Shoal or school===
{{Main|Shoaling and schooling}}
[[File:School of Pterocaesio chrysozona in Papua New Guinea 1.jpg|thumb|These [[goldband fusilier]]s are [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] because their swimming is synchronised.|alt=Photo of thousands of fish separated from each other by distances of {{convert|2|in}} or less]]

A random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an ''aggregation''. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a ''shoal'' or a ''school'' depending on the degree of organisation. A ''shoal'' is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. ''Schools'' of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helfman |first=G. |last2=Collette |first2=B. |last3=Facey |first3=D. |year=1997 |title=The Diversity of Fishes |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |page=375 |isbn=978-0-86542-256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* Cichlids congregating at [[Lek (mating arena)|lekking]] sites form an ''aggregation''.
* Many minnows and characins form ''shoals''.
* Anchovies, herrings and silversides are classic examples of ''schooling'' fish.

While the words "school" and "shoal" have different meanings within biology, the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat the words as [[synonym]]s. Thus speakers of [[British English]] commonly use "shoal" to describe any grouping of fish, and speakers of [[American English]] commonly use "school" just as loosely.&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher T. J. and Parish J. K. (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363 "Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001403/https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363 |date=5 April 2017 }} In: Pitcher T.

'''Flower constancy''' or '''pollinator constancy''' is defined as the tendency of individual [[pollinators]] to exclusively visit certain [[flower]] species or morphs within a species, bypassing other available flower species that could potentially be more rewarding (i.e. contain more [[nectar]]).&lt;ref name="RAINE2006"&gt;Raine, N.E., T. C. Ings, A. Dornhaus, N. Saleh, and [[Lars Chittka|L. Chittka]]. 2006. Adaptation, genetic drift, pleiotropy, and history in the evolution of bee foraging behavior. Advances in the study of Behavior, 36: 305-354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chittka1999"&gt;[[Lars Chittka|Chittka, L.]], J.D. Thomson, and N.M. Waser. 1999. Flower constancy, insect psychology, and plant evolution. Naturwissenschaften, 86: 361-177. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waser1986"&gt;Waser, N.M. 1986. Flower constancy: definition, cause and measurement. The American Naturalist, 127(5): 596-603.&lt;/ref&gt; Flower constancy is different from other types of insect specialization such as innate preferences for certain colors or flower types, or the tendency of pollinators to visit the most rewarding and abundant flowers.&lt;ref name = "Waser1986"/&gt; 

Flower constancy has been observed for [[insect]] pollinators: especially [[honeybees]] (''Apis mellifera''),&lt;ref name = "Hill1996"&gt;Hill, P.S.M., P.H. Wells, and H. Wells. 1997. Spontaneous flower constancy and learning in honey bees as a function of colour. Animal Behavior, 54: 615-627.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bumblebees]] (''Bombus terrestris''),&lt;ref name = "Stout1998"&gt;Stout, J.C., J.A. Allen, and D. Goulson. 1998. The influence of relative plant density and floral morphological complexity on the behaviour of bumblebees. Oecologia, 117: 543-550. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chittka1997"&gt;[[Lars Chittka|Chittka, L.]], A. Gumbert, and J. Kunze. 1997. Foraging dynamics of bumble bees: correlates of movement within and between plant species. Behavioral Ecology, 8(3): 239-249.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[butterflies]] (''Thymelicus flavus'').&lt;ref name="Goulson1997"&gt;Goulson, D., J. Ollerton and C. Sluman. 1997. Foraging strategies in the small skipper butterfly, ''Thymelicus flavus'': when to switch? Animal Behavior, 53: 1009-1016. &lt;/ref&gt; For example, honeybees have demonstrated a preference for certain flower types and constantly return even if other more rewarding flowers are available. This is shown for example in experiments where honeybees remain flower constant and do not attempt to feed on other available flowers that exhibit an alternative color to their preferred flower type.&lt;ref name = "Hill1996"/&gt;

==Flower constancy as an adaptive behavior ==

Flower constancy favors flower pollination, that is, pollinators that are flower constant are more likely to transfer pollen to other conspecific plants.&lt;ref name="Harder2001"&gt;Harder, L. D., N.M. Williams, C.Y. Jordan, and W.A. Nelson. "The effects of Floral design and display on pollinator economics and pollen dispersal". 297-317.  Editors, [[Lars Chittka|L. Chittka]] and J.D. Thomson. Cognitive Ecology of Pollination: Animal Behavior and Floral Evolution. 2001. Cambridge University Press &lt;/ref&gt; Also, flower constancy prevents the loss of pollen during interspecific flights and pollinators from clogging stigmas with pollen of other flower species.&lt;ref name = "Chittka1999" /&gt; Flower constancy can be enhanced when the flowers are more dissimilar, for example in their coloration.&lt;ref name="kooi"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/plb.12328| title = Competition for pollinators and intra-communal spectral dissimilarity of flowers| journal = Plant Biology| pages = | year = 2015| last1 = Van Der Kooi | first1 = C. J.| last2 = Pen | first2 = I.| last3 = Staal | first3 = M.| last4 = Stavenga | first4 = D. G.| last5 = Elzenga | first5 = J. T. M.| url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Casper_Van_Der_Kooi/publication/273158762_Competition_for_pollinators_and_intracommunal_spectral_dissimilarity_of_flowers/links/553122910cf2f2a588ace06c.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;ev=pub_int_prw_xdl&amp;msrp=156o8z3LbHGvSYKAR%2BxM7a0%2BD7zBXCIlIRZA4sCK%2FwDY4dQUizWow4itk77Rb0zcqcye6%2BGxNrJpPjT%2F6rYpOE0YD5myTyQp7ORfnfI5DfU%3D_aoupfL8XxKQD0uLWnjpkK5W0d3LW8onR1q4bPYB94Oj3S4rNfG9H3VEZaoDog5H1K3yCHsSHJ6P3kIO1KHSbvQ%3D%3D&amp;inViewer=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When, in a community of flowering plants, the flowers are all similarly colored, the constancy is often lower because different species are more difficult to distinguish, whereas constancy tends to be higher when the flowers are distinctly differently colored.&lt;ref name=kooi /&gt; 

Flower constancy benefits flower pollination but, arguably, constancy is not so obviously [[Adaptation|adaptive]] for pollinators. Individuals that show constant behavior ignore other flowers that could potentially provide more nectar (reward) than their preferred type. As a result, flower constancy seems to contradict optimal [[foraging]] models, which assume that animals will move minimal distances between food resources and so will feed on a mixture of these to maximize their energy intake per unit time.&lt;ref name = "Chittka1999" /&gt;  As a result of this apparent contradiction, many hypotheses have been proposed to explain flower constancy in insects to determine the adaptability of flower constancy. One of the most popular explanations is that insects that are flower constant have limited memory space and can only focus on one flower type at a time.

== Memory limitation as an explanation for flower constancy ==

Insects, as with other animals, have short-term memory (STM) or "working memory" where information is stored temporarily for a few second or minutes. Additionally, insects have long-term memory (LTM) or "reference memory", which stores information for hours or more. One of the most widespread explanations for flower constancy is that insects can only identify and handle one flower type or species at a time.&lt;ref name = "Waser1986"/&gt; Conversely, there are others that argue that insects, for example bees, can store large amounts of information (location of nest, flower patches, and existence of surrounding landmarks) in their LTM or reference memory.&lt;ref name = "Chittka1999"/&gt; 

==Other hypotheses that might explain flower constancy==
===Learning Investment Hypothesis===
The learning investment hypothesis refers to the ability of an insect to learn a motor skill to handle and obtain nectar from a flower type or species. Learning these motor skills could require substantial investment and switching to other flower types or species could be inefficient and consequently non-adaptive. Concentrating and feeding on one particular flower type increases the insect’s efficiency to obtain nectar from that flower type with respect to other flower types that are available.&lt;ref name = "Chittka1999"/&gt; 

===Costly Information Hypothesis===
The costly information hypothesis explains flower constancy based on the fact that insects stay constant and feed on a one flower type because they know they are obtaining a reliable reward: nectar. The insect therefore does not venture to feed on other flower types because it cannot predict the amount of nectar in other flowers and could essentially waste foraging time probing other flowers that could possibly contain less nectar.&lt;ref name = "Chittka1999"/&gt;

===Resource-Partitioning Hypothesis===
In social foragers, flower constancy could benefit the colony in that foragers avoid competition with other foragers by specializing on a specific flower type or species. In this case, individual insects, for example bees, become flower constant to avoid competition and thus increase foraging efficiency.&lt;ref name = "Chittka1999"/&gt;

'''Forensic statistics''' is the application of [[Statistical model|probability models]] and [[Statistics|statistical techniques]] to scientific evidence, such as [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]],&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~gill/forensic.statistics.pdf|title=Forensic Statistics: Ready for Consumption?|first=Richard|last=Gill|publisher=Mathematical Institute, Leiden University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law. In contrast to "everyday" statistics, to not engender bias or unduly draw conclusions, forensic statisticians report likelihoods as [[Likelihood function|likelihood ratios]] (LR). This ratio of probabilities is then used by [[jury|juries]] or [[judge]]s to draw inferences or conclusions and decide legal matters.&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt; Jurors and judges rely on the strength of a DNA match, given by statistics, to make conclusions and determine guilt or innocence in legal matters.&lt;ref name="Perlin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perlin |first1=Mark |title=Inclusion probability for DNA mixtures is a subjective one-sided match statistic unrelated to identification information |journal=Journal of Pathology Informatics |date=2015 |volume=6 |issue=59 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4639950/ |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In forensic science, the DNA evidence received for [[DNA profiling]] often contains a mixture of more than one person’s DNA. DNA profiles are generated using a set procedure, however, the interpretation of a DNA profile becomes more complicated when the sample contains a mixture of DNA. Regardless of the number of contributors to the forensic sample, statistics and probabilities must be used to provide weight to the evidence and to describe what the results of the DNA evidence mean. In a single-source DNA profile, the statistic used is termed a random match probability (RMP). RMPs can also be used in certain situations to describe the results of the interpretation of a [[DNA profiling|DNA mixture]]. &lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |pages=445-529 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other statistical tools to describe DNA mixture profiles include likelihood ratios (LR) and combined probability of inclusion (CPI), also known as random man not excluded (RMNE).&lt;ref name="Butler2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Interpretation |date=2015 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=San Diego, CA |pages=213-333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer programs have been implemented with forensic DNA statistics for assessing the biological relationships between two or more people. Forensic science uses several approaches for DNA statistics with computer programs such as; match probability, exclusion probability, likelihood  ratios, Bayesian approaches, and paternity and kinship testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On Statistical Analysis Of Forensic DNA: Theory, Methods And Computer Programs|last = Fung|first = Wing Kam|date = 2006|journal = Forensic Science International|doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.06.025|pmid = |access-date =|volume=162|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the precise origin of this term remains unclear, it is apparent that the term was used in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valentin | first1 = J | year = 1980 | title = Exclusions and attributions of paternity: practical experiences of forensic genetics and statistics | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 420–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first forensic statistics conferences were two held in 1991 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken C. G. G., Taroni F. (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qvLJXYQ5wEC&amp;pg=PR26&amp;lpg=PR26&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RmrRyl5DOu&amp;sig=F0kgZ3FoAzbVtqHt3ls6bgxzno4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_ZDzUfX4H8GMkwWCjIGIDg&amp;ved=0CIMBEOgBMAw4Hg#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''Statistics and the Evaluation of Evidence for Forensic Scientists''], John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Random Match Probability ==

Random match probabilities (RMP) are used to estimate and express the rarity of a DNA profile. RMP can be defined as the probability that someone else in the population, chosen at random, would have the same genotype as the genotype of the contributor of the forensic evidence. RMP is calculated using the [[genotype frequencies]] at all the loci, or how common or rare the alleles of a genotype are. The genotype frequencies are multiplied across all loci, using the [[product rule]], to calculate the RMP. This statistic gives weight to the evidence either for or against a particular suspect being a contributor to the DNA mixture sample.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt;

RMP can only be used as a statistic to describe the DNA profile if it is from a single source or if the analyst is able to differentiate between the peaks on the [[electropherogram]] from the major and minor contributors of a mixture.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; Since the interpretation of DNA mixtures with more than two contributors is very difficult for analysts to do without computer software, RMP becomes difficult to calculate with a mixture of more than two people.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt; If the major and minor contributor peaks can not be differentiated, there are other statistical methods that may be used. 

If the DNA mixture contains a ratio of 4:1 of major to minor contributors, a modified random match probability (mRMP) may be able to be used as a statistical tool. For calculation of mRMP, the analyst must first deduce a major and minor contributor and their genotypes based on the peak heights given in the electropherogram. Computer software is often used in labs conducting DNA analysis in order to more accurately calculate the mRMP, since calculations for each of the most probable genotypes at each locus become tedious and inefficient for the analyst to do by hand.&lt;ref name="Perlin"/&gt;

== Likelihood Ratio ==

Sometimes it can be very difficult to determine the number of contributors in a DNA mixture. If the peaks are easily distinguished and the number of contributors is able to be determined, a likelihood ratio (LR) is used. LRs consider probabilities of events happening and rely on alternative pairs of hypotheses against which the evidence is assessed.&lt;ref name="FSS"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a likelihood ratio? |url=https://www.isfg.org/files/ISFG2007_Statistics_Gill_LR.pdf |website=International Society of Forensic Genetics |publisher=Forensic Science Service Ltd. 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alternative pairs of hypotheses in forensic cases are the prosecutor’s hypothesis and the defense hypothesis. In forensic biology cases, the hypotheses often state that the DNA came from a particular person or the DNA came from an unknown person.&lt;ref name="Perlin"/&gt; For example, the prosecution may hypothesize the DNA sample contains DNA from the victim and the suspect, while the defense may hypothesize that the sample contains DNA from the victim and an unknown person. The probabilities of the hypotheses are expressed as a ratio, with the prosecutor’s hypothesis being in the numerator.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; The ratio then expresses the likelihood of both of the events in relation to each other. For the hypotheses where the mixture contains the suspect, the probability is 1, because one can distinguish the peaks and easily tell if the suspect can be excluded as a contributor at each locus based on his/her genotype. The probability of 1 assumes the suspect can not be excluded as a contributor. To determine the probabilities of the unknowns, all genotype possibilities must be determined for that locus.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; 

Once the calculation of the likelihood ratio is made, the number calculated is turned into a statement to provide meaning to the statistic. For the previous example, if the LR calculated is x, then the LR means that the probability of the evidence is x times more likely if the sample contains the victim and the suspect than if it contains the victim and an unknown person.&lt;ref name="FSS"/&gt; Likelihood ratio can also be defined as 1/RMP.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;   

== Combined Probability of Inclusion ==

Combined probability of inclusion (CPI) is a common statistic used when the analyst can not differentiate between the peaks from a major and minor contributor to a sample and the number of contributors can not be determined.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; CPI is also commonly known as random man not excluded (RMNE).&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; This statistical calculation is done by adding all the frequencies of observed alleles and then squaring the value, which yields the value for probability of inclusion (PI). These values are then multiplied across all loci, resulting in the value for CPI.&lt;ref name="Perlin"/&gt; The value is squared so that all the possible combinations of genotypes are included in the calculation.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt; 

Once the calculation is done, a statement is made about the meaning of this calculation and what it means. For example, if the CPI calculated is 0.5, this means that the probability of someone chosen at random in the population not being excluded as a contributor to the DNA mixture is 0.5. 

CPI relates to the evidence (the DNA mixture) and it is not dependent on the profile of any suspect. Therefore, CPI is a statistical tool that can be used to provide weight or strength to evidence when no other information about the crime is known.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; This is advantageous in situations where the genotypes in the DNA mixture can not be distinguished from one another. However, this statistic is not very discriminating and is not as powerful of a tool as likelihood ratios and random match probabilities can be when some information about the DNA mixture, such as the number of contributors or the genotypes of each contributor, can be distinguished. Another limitation to CPI is that it is not usable as a tool for the interpretation of a DNA mixture.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt;

== Blood Stains ==
Blood stains are an important part of forensic statistics, as the analysis of blood drop collisions may help to picture the event that had previously gone on. Commonly blood stains are an elliptical shape, because of this blood stains are usually easy to determine the blood droplets angle through the formula “''α = arcsin d/a''”. In this formula 'a' and 'd' are simply estimations of the axis of the ellipse. From these calculations, a visualization of the event causing the stains is able to be drawn, and alongside further information such as the velocity of the entity that caused such stains.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Determining The Area Of Convergence In Bloodstain Pattern Analysis: A Probabilistic Approach|last = Camana|first = Francesco|date = 2013|journal = Forensic Science International|doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.04.019|pmid = |access-date =|volume=231|pages=131–136|arxiv =1210.6106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forest degradation''' is a process in which the biological wealth of a forest area is permanently diminished by some factor or by a combination of factors. "This does not involve a reduction of the forest area, but rather a quality decrease in its condition."The forest is still there, but with less number of trees, or less species of trees, plants or animals, or some of them affected by plagues. This degradation makes the forest less valuable and may lead to [[deforestation]]. Forest degradation is a type of the more general issue of [[land degradation]].

== Interpretations of the term ==

Deforestation is much worse than forest degradation, but it is clear and visible. On the contrary, forest degradation may start and go on without showing clear effects. It is difficult to measure and even the very term is controversial. In a paper&lt;ref name="Lanly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lanly|first1=Jean-Paul|date=2003|title=DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION FACTORS|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/article/wfc/xii/ms12a-e.htm|journal=Proceedings of the XII World Forestry Congress|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to the XII World Forestry Congress, 2003, Jean-Paul Lanly states:  "The situation is even less satisfactory regarding forest degradation due in particular to the imprecision and multiple, and often subjective, interpretations of the term". In 2009 Lund&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Robert|last2=Pacheco|first2=Pablo|last3=Montero|first3=Juan Carlos|title=El contexto de la deforestación y degradación de los bosques en Bolivia|date=2014|publisher=CIFOR|location=Bolivia|isbn=978-602-1504-29-1|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-100.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  identified more than 50 definitions of forest degradation.

Previously to this August 2017 editing, the Wikipedia page Forest degradation was redirected to [[Secondary forest]], a forest which has re-grown after a timber harvest. This is a confusion: a secondary forest may be perfectly healthy, and a [[primary forest]] may be suffering degradation.

The term "permanently" also poses some difficulties: a forest affected by a mild seasonal [[drought]] may experience a loss of its biological wealth, but if it is seasonally reversed, then it is not considered degradation. On the contrary, a severe prolonged drought may seriously degrade a forest and make human intervention advisable to limit damages.

== Difficulties which hamper the assessment of degradation ==

According to Lanly,&lt;ref name = "Lanly" /&gt; there are 3 difficulties:

* the different choices of the initial state of reference or baseline;
* the chosen criteria: health, biodiversity, production capacity; and
* the opinion on the evolution prospects: will the final result of the process be desirable or undesirable?

For mapping forest degradation in Bolivia, Müller et al.&lt;ref name="Müller" /&gt; consider areas where only between 30% and 70% of the original forest cover remains. If less than 30% remains, the area is considered as deforested, and if more than 70% remains, the forest is considered intact.

The Dominican Center for Agricultural and Forest Development&lt;ref name="Ovalles"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ovalles|first1=P.|title=Causas de la deforestación y degradación de bosques en la República Dominicana|url=http://www.cedaf.org.do/REDD/causas.pdf|website=CEDAF|publisher=CEDAF|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following causes of forest degradation:
* Excessive extraction of forest products like timber, charcoal or resin.
* Road building: after it has been built, the road favours soil erosion.
* Open mining: the area where extraction takes place is, of course, completely deforested, but also the surrounding zone suffers a degradation of its fauna and flora. 
* Expansion of urban areas.

Davidar et al.&lt;ref name="Davidar"/&gt; add another:

*  Livestock grazing: goats or sheep eat tree seedlings, thus slowing natural forest regeneration.

Earth Eclipse,&lt;ref name="Eclipse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eclipse|first1=Earth|title=What is Forest Degradation?|url=http://www.eartheclipse.com/environment/causes-of-forest-degradation.html|website=Earth Eclipse|publisher=Earth Eclipse|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a platform of environment research articles, adds the following causes:

* Forest fragmentation: a large forest is broken up in smaller woods, which destroys the habitat of large animals.
* Land pollution
* Soil erosion (''see image above'') and sedimentation

Finally Chakravarty et al.,&lt;ref name="InTech"/&gt; as another cause, point at:
* Excessive or unrespectful tourism

== Remedies to forest degradation ==

Generally, any [[Deforestation#Control|measure to prevent deforestation]] will also reduce forest degradation. Specifically for degradation, Greenpeace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenpeace|first1=-|title=Solutions to Deforestation|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/forests/solutions-to-deforestation|website=Greenpeace|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes:

* Attaining a responsible forest products industry
* [[Sustainable forest management]]

Curbing emissions of sulfur dioxide (to combat acid rain) would also reduce forest degradation for this cause. If a coal-fired power plant uses low-quality coal (with a high sulfur contents), this may be alleviated by [[flue-gas desulfurization]].

== Initiatives against forest degradation ==

* [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+) is an international voluntary climate change mitigation approach to curb deforestation and forest degradation. This mechanism makes part of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) since 2005.
* The [[United Nations REDD Programme|United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (or UN-REDD Programme) is a collaborative programme created in 2008 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP). It should not be confused with "REDD+. The UN-REDD Programme supports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PROGRAMME|first1=UN-REDD|title=About the UN-REDD Programme|url=http://www.un-redd.org/|website=UN-REDD|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; its partner countries (more than 60) through direct funding and technical support to national REDD+ programmes and technical capacity enhancing.

'''Frailty''' is a common geriatric syndrome that embodies an elevated risk of catastrophic declines in health and function among [[old age|older adult]]s. Frailty is a condition associated with [[ageing]], and it has been recognized for centuries.  As described by Shakespeare in ''As You Like It'', "the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon, with spectacles on nose and pouch on side, his youthful hose well sav’d, a world too wide, for his shrunk shank…". The shrunk shank is a result of loss of muscle with aging. It is also a marker of a more widespread syndrome of frailty, with associated weakness, slowing, decreased energy, lower activity, and, when severe, unintended weight loss.

As a population ages, a central focus of geriatricians and public health practitioners is to understand, and then beneficially intervene on, the factors and processes that put elders at such risk, especially the increased vulnerability to stressors (e.g. extremes of heat and cold, infection, injury, or even changes in medication) that characterizes many older adults.&lt;ref name="Fried_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fried LP, Tangen CM, Walston J, Newman, AB, Hirsch, C, Gottdiener, J, Seeman, T, Tracy, R, Kop, WJ, Burke, G, McBurnie, MA |title=Frailty in older adults: evidence for a phenotype |journal=The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |date=Mar 2001 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=M146-56 |pmid=11253156 |doi=10.1093/gerona/56.3.m146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome. Estimates of frailty's prevalence in older populations may vary according to a number of factors, including the setting in which the prevalence is being estimated – e.g., nursing home (higher prevalence) vs. community (lower prevalence), and the operational definition used for defining frailty. Using the widely used frailty phenotype framework proposed by Fried et al. (2001),&lt;ref name="Fried_2001" /&gt; prevalence estimates of 7–16% have been reported in non-institutionalized, community-dwelling older adults.

The occurrence of frailty increases incrementally with advancing age, and is more common in older women than men, and among those of lower socio-economic status.  Frail older adults are at high risk for major adverse health outcomes, including disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and mortality.

Epidemiologic research to date has led to the identification of a number of risk factors for frailty, including: (a) chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, depression, and cognitive impairment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fried LP |author2=Ferrucci L |author3=Darer J |author4=Williamson JD |author5=Anderson G |title=Untangling the concepts of disability, frailty, and comorbidity: implications for improved targeting and care |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |date=March 2004 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=255–63 |pmid=15031310}}&lt;/ref&gt; (b) physiologic impairments, such as activation of inflammation and coagulation systems,&lt;ref name="Walston 2333–2341"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walston |first1=J |last2=McBurnie |first2=MA |last3=Newman |first3=A |last4=Tracy |first4=RP |last5=Kop |first5=WJ |last6=Hirsch |first6=CH |last7=Gottdiener |first7=J |last8=Fried |first8=LP|author9= Cardiovascular Health Study |title=Frailty and activation of the inflammation and coagulation systems with and without clinical comorbidities: results from the Cardiovascular Health Study |journal=Arch Intern Med |date=Nov 2002 |volume=162 |issue=20 |pages=2333–2341 |pmid=12418947 |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.20.2333}} &lt;!--|accessdate=15 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

 Advances about potentially modifiable risk factors for frailty now offer the basis for translational research effort aimed at prevention and treatment of frailty in older adults. A recent systematic review found that exercise interventions can increase muscle strength and improve physical function; however, results are inconsistent in frail older adults living in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cruz-Jentoft |first=Alfonso J. |last2=Landi |first2=Francesco |last3=Schneider |first3=Stéphane M. |last4=Zúñiga |first4=Clemente |last5=Arai |first5=Hidenori |last6=Boirie |first6=Yves |last7=Chen |first7=Liang-Kung |last8=Fielding |first8=Roger A. |last9=Martin |first9=Finbarr C. |date=2014-11-01 |title=Prevalence of and interventions for sarcopenia in ageing adults: a systematic review.

==Theoretical understanding==
Recent work on frailty has sought to characterize both the underlying changes in the body and the manifestations that make frailty recognizable.  It is well-agreed upon that declines in physiologic reserves and resilience is the essence of being frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Varadhan |first=R |author2=Seplaki CL |author3=Xue QL |author4=Bandeen-Roche K|author4-link=Karen Bandeen-Roche |author5=Fried LP |title=Stimulus-response paradigm for characterizing the loss of resilience in homeostatic regulation associated with frailty |journal=Mech Ageing Dev. |date=Nov 2008 |volume=129 |issue=11 |pages=666–70 |doi=10.1016/j.mad.2008.09.013 |pmid=18938195 |pmc=2650618}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, scientists agree that the risk of frailty increases with age and with the incidence of diseases. Beyond that, there is now strong evidence to support the theory that the development of frailty involves declines in energy production, energy utilization and repair systems in the body, resulting in declines in the function of many different physiological systems.  This decline in multiple systems affects the normal complex adaptive behavior that is essential to health &lt;ref name="Fried 1049–57"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fried |first=LP |author2=Xue QL |author3=Cappola AR |author4=Ferrucci L |author5=Chaves P |author6=Varadhan R |author7=Guralnik JM |author8=Leng SX |author9=Semba RD |author10=Walston JD |author11=Blaum CS |author12=Bandeen-Roche K|author12-link=Karen Bandeen-Roche |title=Nonlinear multisystem physiological dysregulation associated with frailty in older women: implications for etiology and treatment |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |date=Oct 2009 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=1049–57 |pmid=19567825 |doi=10.1093/gerona/glp076 |pmc=2737590}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and eventually results in frailty typically manifesting as a syndrome of a constellation of weakness, slowness, reduced activity, low energy and unintended weight loss.&lt;ref name="Bandeen-Roche 2006 262–6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bandeen-Roche |first=K |authorlink=Karen Bandeen-Roche|author2=Xue QL |author3=Ferrucci L |author4=Walston J |author5=Guralnik JM |author6=Chaves P |author7=Zeger SL |author8=Fried LP |title=Phenotype of frailty: characterization in the women's health and aging studies |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |date=Mar 2006 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=262–6 |pmid=16567375}} &lt;!--|accessdate=16 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When most severe, i.e. when 3 or more of these manifestations are present, the individual is at a high risk of death.

==Assessment of geriatric frailty==
The syndrome of geriatric frailty is hypothesized to reflect impairments in the regulation of multiple physiologic systems, embodying a lack of resilience to physiologic challenges and thus elevated risk for a range of deleterious endpoints.  Generally speaking, the empirical assessment of geriatric frailty in individuals seeks ultimately to capture this or related features, though distinct approaches to such assessment have been developed in the literature (see de Vries et al., 2011 for a comprehensive review).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Vries |first1=NM |last2=Staal |first2=JB |last3=van Ravensberg |first3=CD |last4=Hobbelen |first4=JS |last5=Olde Rikkert |first5=MG |last6=Nijhuis-van der Sanden |first6=MW |title=Outcome instruments to measure frailty: a systematic review |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |date=Jan 2011 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=104–114 |pmid=20850567 |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2010.09.001}} &lt;!--|accessdate=16 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Two key approaches are discussed below:

===Linda Fried / Johns Hopkins Frailty Criteria===
A popular approach to the assessment of geriatric frailty encompasses the assessment of five dimensions that are hypothesized to reflect systems whose impaired regulation underlies the syndrome.  These five dimensions are: 
* unintentional weight loss, 
* exhaustion, 
* muscle weakness, 
* slowness while walking, and 
* low levels of activity.&lt;ref name="Fried_2001" /&gt;
Corresponding to these dimensions are five specific criteria indicating adverse functioning, which are implemented using a combination of self-reported and performance-based measures.  Those who meet at least three of the criteria are defined as “frail”, while those not matching any of the five criteria are defined as “robust”.  Additional work on the construct is done by [[Karen Bandeen-Roche|Bandeen-Roche]] et al. (2006),&lt;ref name="Bandeen-Roche 2006 262–6" /&gt; though some of the exact criteria and measures differ (see Table 1 in the paper for this contrast).  Other studies in the literature have also adopted the general approach of [[Linda P. Fried]] et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="Fried_2001" /&gt; though, again, the exact criteria and their particular measures may vary.  This assessment approach was developed and refined by Fried and colleagues at the Johns Hopkins University’s [http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-on-aging-and-health/ Center on Aging and Health].  This Center is home to [http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-on-aging-and-health/oaic/ Johns Hopkins Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center], which focuses on frailty research.

===Rockwood Frailty Index===
Another notable approach to the assessment of geriatric frailty (if not also to some degree its conceptualization) is that of Rockwood and Mitnitski (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rockwood |first=K |author2=Mitnitski A |title=Frailty in relation to the accumulation of deficits |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |date=Jul 2007 |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=722–7 |pmid=17634318 |doi=10.1093/gerona/62.7.722}} &lt;!--|accessdate=16 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in which frailty is viewed in terms of the number of health "deficits" that are manifest in the individual, leading to a continuous measure of frailty (see Rockwood, Andrew, and Mitnitski (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rockwood |first=K |author2=Andrew M |author3=Mitnitski A |title=A comparison of two approaches to measuring frailty in elderly people |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |date=Jul 2007 |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=738–43 |pmid=17634321}} &lt;!--|accessdate=16 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for a contrast of the two approaches).  This approach was developed by Dr. Rockwood and colleagues at Dalhousie University.

===Four domains of frailty===
A four domains of frailty model was proposed in response to an article in the BMJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soong |first1=J |title=Re: Functional assessment in older people |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4681/rr/645724 |publisher=BMJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conceptualisation could be viewed as blending the phenotypic and index models.  Researchers tested this model for signal in routinely collected hospital data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soong |first1=J |last2=Poots |first2=AJ |last3=Scott |first3=S |last4=Donald |first4=K |last5=Woodcock |first5=T |last6=Lovett |first6=D |last7=Bell |first7=D |title=Quantifying the prevalence of frailty in English hospitals |journal=[[BMJ Open]] |date=21 October 2015 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e008456 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008456}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then used this signal in the development of a frailty model, finding even predictive capability across 3 outcomes of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soong |first1=J |last2=Poots |first2=A J |last3=Scott |first3=S |last4=Donald |first4=K |last5=Bell |first5=D |title=Developing and validating a risk prediction model for acute care based on frailty syndromes |journal=BMJ Open |date=21 October 2015 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e008457 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008457}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SHARE Frailty Index===
The SHARE-Frailty Index (SHARE-FI) was originally developed by Romero-Ortuno (2010) (https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2318-10-57) and researchers as part of the Survey of Healthy Ageing and Retirement in Europe. It consists of five domains of the frailty phenotype:
•Fatigue
•Loss of appetite
•Grip strength
•Functional difficulties
•Physical activity

The SHARE-FI calculator is freely available to use online. 
The calculator classifies individuals as 1) frail; 2) pre-frail; and 3) non-frail / robust. 
The SHARE-FI has good clinical utility as it provides relatively quick assessment of frailty in often time-poor healthcare settings.

It has been suggested that the biological underpinnings of frailty are multifactorial, involving dysregulation across many physiological systems.&lt;ref name="Fried 1049–57" /&gt;  A proinflammatory state,&lt;ref name="Walston 2333–2341" /&gt; sarcopenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferrucci |first=Luigi |author2=Penninx BW |author3=Volpato S |title=Change in muscle strength explains accelerated decline of physical function in older women with high interleukin-6 serum levels. |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |year=2002 |volume=50 |pages=1947–54 |doi=10.1046/j.1532-5415.2002.50605.x |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; anemia,&lt;ref name="Chaves 2005 729–35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy 67–78" /&gt; relative deficiencies in anabolic hormones (androgens and growth hormone)&lt;ref name="Cappola 243–8" /&gt; and excess exposure to catabolic hormones (cortisol),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Varadhan |first=Ravi |author2=Walston J |author3=Cappola AR |author4=Carlson MC |author5=Wand GS |author6=Fried LP |title=Higher Levels and Blunted Diurnal Variation of Cortisol in Frail Older Women. |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |year=2008 |volume=63 |pages=190–195 |doi=10.1093/gerona/63.2.190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  insulin resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barzilay |first=JI |author2=Blaum C |author3=Moore T |title=Insulin resistance and inflammation as precursors of frailty: the Cardiovascular Health Study. |journal=Arch Intern Med |year=2007 |volume=167 |pages=635–641 |doi=10.1001/archinte.167.7.635 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  glucose levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zaslavsky |first=O |author2=Walker R |author3=Crane PK |title=Glucose levels and Risk of Frailty. |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |year=2016 |volume=71 |pages=1223–1229. |doi=10.1093/gerona/glw024}}&lt;/ref&gt; compromised altered immune function,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=George C |author2=Talor MV |author3=Rose NR |title=Thyroid autoantibodies are associated with a reduced prevalence of frailty in community-dwelling older women. |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |year=2010 |volume=95 |pages=1161–8. |doi=10.1210/jc.2009-1991 |display-authors=etal|pmc=2841533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yao |first=X |author2=Li H |author3=Leng SX. |title=Inflammation and immune system alterations in frailty. |journal=Clin Geriatr Med. |year=2011 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=79–87 |pmid=21093724 |doi=10.1016/j.cger.2010.08.002 |pmc=3011971}}&lt;/ref&gt; micronutrient deficiencies  and oxidative stress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Semba |first=Richard D. |author2=Ferrucci L |author3=Sun K |author4=Walston J |author5=Varadhan R |author6=Guralnik JM |author7=Fried LP. |title=Oxidative stress and severe walking disability among older women. |journal=Am J Med |date=Dec 2007 |volume=120 |issue=12 |pages=1084–9 |pmid=18060930 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2007.07.028 |pmc=2423489}}&lt;/ref&gt; are each individually associated with a higher likelihood of frailty. Additional findings show that the risk of frailty increases with the number of dysregulated physiological systems in a nonlinear pattern, independent of chronic diseases and chronologic age, suggesting synergistic effects of individual abnormalities that on their own may be relatively mild.&lt;ref name="Fried 1049–57" /&gt; The clinical implication of this finding is that interventions that affect multiple systems may yield greater, synergistic benefits in prevention and treatment of frailty than interventions that affect only one system.

Associations between specific disease states are also associated with and frailty have also been observed, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency and other diseases in which inflammation is prominent. To the extent that dysregulation across several physiologic systems underlie the pathogenesis of the frailty, specific disease states are likely concurrent manifestations of the underlying impaired physiologic function and regulation. It is possible that clinically measurable disease states can manifest themselves or be captured prior to the onset of frailty. No single disease state is necessary and sufficient for the pathogenesis of frailty, since many individuals with chronic diseases are not frail. Therefore, rather than being dependent on the presence of measurable diseases, frailty is an expression of a critical mass of physiologic impairments.

==Components==

===Sarcopenia===

[[Sarcopenia]] (from the Greek meaning "poverty of flesh")  refers to loss of muscle mass and low muscle function (strength or performance)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cruz-Jentoft |first=Alfonso J. |last2=Baeyens |first2=Jean Pierre |last3=Bauer |first3=Jürgen M. |last4=Boirie |first4=Yves |last5=Cederholm |first5=Tommy |last6=Landi |first6=Francesco |last7=Martin |first7=Finbarr C. |last8=Michel |first8=Jean-Pierre |last9=Rolland |first9=Yves |date=2017-01-19 |title=Sarcopenia: European consensus on definition and diagnosis |journal=Age and Ageing |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=412–423 |doi=10.1093/ageing/afq034 |issn=0002-0729 |pmc=2886201 |pmid=20392703}}&lt;/ref&gt; that occurs as a result of old age. It is characterized first by a decrease in muscle mass, which causes weakness and frailty. However, this loss of muscle mass may be caused by different cellular mechanisms than those that cause [[muscle atrophy]]. For example, during sarcopenia, there is a replacement of [[muscle fibres]] with [[fat]] and an increase in [[fibrosis]].

===Osteoporosis===
[[File:OsteoCutout.png|thumb|upright|Osteoporosis causes a hunched-over appearance in some people.]]
[[Osteoporosis]] is an age-related disease of [[bone]] that leads to an increased risk of [[bone fracture|fracture]]. In osteoporosis the [[bone mineral density]] (BMD) is reduced, bone microarchitecture is disrupted, and the amount and variety of proteins in bone is altered. Osteoporosis is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 [[standard deviation]]s below peak bone mass (20-year-old healthy female average) as measured by [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|DXA]]; the term "established osteoporosis" includes the presence of a [[fragility fracture]].&lt;ref name="WHO1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author=WHO |title=Assessment of fracture risk and its application to screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Report of a WHO Study Group |journal=World Health Organization technical report series |volume=843 |issue= |pages=1–129 |year=1994 |pmid=7941614 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osteoporosis is most common in women after [[menopause]], when it is called ''postmenopausal osteoporosis'', but may also develop in men, and may occur in anyone in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] diseases or as a result of medications, specifically [[glucocorticoid]]s, when the disease is called steroid- or [[glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis]] (SIOP or GIOP). Given its influence in the risk of fragility fracture, osteoporosis may significantly affect [[life expectancy]] and [[quality of life]].

===Muscle weakness===
[[Muscle weakness]], also known as muscle fatigue, (or "lack of strength") refers to the inability to exert force with one's skeletal [[muscle]]s. Weakness often follows [[muscle atrophy]] and a decrease in activity, such as after a long bout of bedrest as a result of an illness. There is also a gradual onset of muscle weakness as a result of sarcopenia - the age-related loss of skeletal muscle.

[[File:Bathtub balance seat.jpg|thumb|left|Muscle weakness makes it difficult to perform everyday activities, like getting into a bathtub.]]
A test of strength is often used during a [[diagnosis]] of a muscular disorder before the [[etiology]] can be identified. Such etiology depends on the type of muscle weakness, which can be true or perceived as well as variable topically. True weakness is substantial, while perceived rather is a sensation of having to put more effort to do the same task.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selmanholman.com/SHAweb_tools.htm Muscle Weakness Coding Checklist by Jun Mapili, PT, MAEd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214636/http://www.selmanholman.com/SHAweb_tools.htm |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, various topic locations for muscle weakness are central, neural and peripheral. Central muscle weakness is an overall exhaustion of the whole body, while peripheral weakness is an exhaustion of individual muscles. Neural weakness is somewhere between.

==Surgical outcomes==
Frail elderly people are at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care.  Frailty more than doubles the risk of morbidity and mortality from surgery and cardiovascular conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid24291279"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Afilalo J, Alexander KP, Mack MJ, Maurer MS, Green P, Allen LA, Popma JJ, Ferrucci L, Forman DE |title=Frailty assessment in the cardiovascular care of older adults |journal=[[Journal of the American College of Cardiology]] |volume=63 |issue=8 |year=2014 |pages=747–762 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2013.09.070 |pmid=24291279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories.&lt;ref name="Frailty"&gt;{{cite journal

The most widely used frailty scale consists of five items:&lt;ref name="Fried_2001" /&gt;
*unintentional weight loss &gt;4.5&amp;nbsp;kg in the past year
*&lt;20th population centile for grip strength
*self-reported exhaustion
*low physical activity such that persons would only rarely undertake a short walk
*slowed walking speed, defined as lowest population quartile on 4 minute walking test. 
A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5.  Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes.&lt;ref name="Frailty" /&gt;  Frail elderly patients (score of 4 or 5) have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.

'''Guizhou University''' ({{zh|c=贵州大学}};  [[Pinyin]]: Guìzhōu Dàxué), known as '''Guida''' (贵大 Guì Dà, English abbreviation '''GZU'''), is a provincial research university located in suburban [[Guiyang]], capital of [[Guizhou]], [[China]]. Founded in 1902, it is the flagship institution of higher learning in Guizhou province. With over 30,000 students, Guida is one of the largest universities in southwest China.

The university was selected to participate in [[Project 211]], a government initiative which provided significant funding to elevate the research standards and faculty hiring resources of rising universities across China. In 2017, the university was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]] as a [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines which the government seeks to elevate to "world-class" status.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The predecessor of the modern Guizhou University was known as the Guizhou Institute of Higher Learning (贵州大学堂), which was founded in 1902. The institute evolved into the Provincial Guizhou University (省立贵州大学), National Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering (国立贵州农工学院), and finally National Guizhou University (国立贵州大学).

In 1997, the Guizhou Agricultural College, Guizhou Institute of Arts, and Guizhou Agricultural Cadre-Training School were merged into NGU to form Guizhou University.

In 2004, the Guizhou University of Technology merged into Guizhou University to complete the current Guizhou University. In 2005, the University was invited as a member of [[Project 211]] by the Ministry of Education.

Guizhou University established a sister school relationship with the Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina; the latter offers a Chinese language program for the fifteen American students every year.

== Disciplines==
The university consists of 39 colleges and offers programs of study in 11 academic divisions leading to associate, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees. These include:
*Agriculture
*Administration 
*Economics
*Education
*Engineering
*History
*Law
*Liberal arts
*Medicine 
*Philosophy
*Sciences

==International cooperation and Peace Corps involvement==
In 1989 Guizhou Agricultural College, then a separate university, began hosting VSO teachers in the Foreign Language Department. The following year, Guizhou University began hosting foreign teachers from the AISH programme in Australia and visiting teacher programmes in both New Zealand and the University of Alabama. Simultaneously, VSO teachers from the UK and the Netherlands were recruited to work in other Guiyang institutes of higher education including the school of fashion and the catering college, both experiencing booms concurrent with Guiyang's emergence from relative obscurity. These teachers taught in both the undergraduate and post-graduate programmes at each institution. 

In 2005, eight years after Gui Nong (Guizhou Agricultural College) was merged with Gui Da (Guizhou University), Guizhou University began hosting [[Peace Corps|United States Peace Corps]] Volunteers. The volunteers teach at both the undergraduate and graduate level in the School of Foreign Languages.

== Campus ==
Guizhou University has nine campuses situated in different locations around the city of Guiyang. The administrative center is located on the North Campus on the [[Huaxi River]], [[Huaxi District]] of Guiyang.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11744">[[File:Helium flash.svg|thumbnail|right|Fusion of helium in the core of low mass stars.]]
A '''helium flash''' is a very brief [[thermal runaway]] [[nuclear fusion]] of large quantities of [[helium]] into [[carbon]] through the [[triple-alpha process]] in the core of low mass [[star]]s (between 0.8 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}) and 2.0 {{Solar mass}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter9.pdf Chapter 9: Post-main sequence evolution through helium burning]&lt;/ref&gt;) during their [[red giant]] phase (the [[Sun]] is predicted to experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the [[main sequence]]). A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur on the surface of [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[white dwarf]] stars.

Low mass stars do not produce enough [[gravity|gravitational]] pressure to initiate normal helium fusion. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into [[degenerate matter]], supported against [[gravitational collapse]] by [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] pressure rather than [[ideal gas law|thermal pressure]]. This increases the density and temperature of the core until it reaches approximately 100 million [[kelvin]], which is hot enough to cause helium fusion (or "helium burning") in the core.

However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that changes in temperature do not produce a change of volume of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure. In main sequence stars, [[hydrostatic equilibrium|thermal expansion]] regulates the core temperature, but in degenerate cores this does not occur. Helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but briefly emits energy at a rate comparable to the entire [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

In the case of normal low mass stars, the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand, however, consuming as much energy as the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers. Thus the helium flash is mostly undetectable to observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models. After the core's expansion and cooling, the star's surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10,000 years until it is roughly 2% of its former radius and luminosity. It is estimated that the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40% of the star mass and that 6% of the core is converted into carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html |title= The End Of The Sun |first= David |last= Taylor |website= North Western }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red giants==
[[File:White Dwarf Resurrection.jpg|thumb|[[Sakurai's Object]] is a [[white dwarf]] undergoing a helium flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Dwarf Resurrection|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1531a/|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the [[red giant]] phase of [[stellar evolution]] in stars with less than 2.0 {{Solar mass}} the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen ceases in the core as it is depleted, leaving a helium-rich core. While fusion of hydrogen continues in the star’s shell causing a continuation of the accumulation of helium ash in the core, making the core denser, the temperature still is unable to reach the level required for helium fusion, as happens in more massive stars. Thus the thermal pressure from fusion is no longer sufficient to counter the gravitational collapse and create the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] found in most stars. This causes the star to start contracting and increasing in temperature until it eventually becomes compressed enough for the helium core to become [[degenerate matter]]. This degeneracy pressure is finally sufficient to stop further collapse of the most central material but the rest of the core continues to contract and the temperature continues to rise until it reaches a point ({{val|p=≈|1|e=8|ul=K}}) at which the helium can ignite and start to fuse.&lt;ref name=Hansen2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Stellar Interiors - Physical Principles, Structure, and Evolution|last=Hansen|first=Carl J.|last2=Kawaler|first2=Steven D.|last3=Trimble|first3=Virginia|isbn=978-0387200897 |date=2004|edition=2|publisher=Springer|pages=62–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seeds2012&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Astronomy|last=Seeds|first=Michael A.|last2=Backman|first2=Dana E.|pages=249–51|date=2012|edition=12|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1133103769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karttunen2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamental Astronomy|isbn=978-3540341437|edition=5|page=249|editor-first=Hannu|editor-last=Karttunen|editor2-first=Pekka|editor2-last=Kröger|editor3-first=Heikki|editor3-last=Oja|editor4-first=Markku|editor4-last=Poutanen|editor5-first=Karl Johan|editor5-last=Donner|publisher=Springer|date=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive nature of the helium flash arises from its taking place in degenerate matter. Once the temperature reaches 100 million–200 million [[kelvin]] and helium fusion begins using the [[triple-alpha process]], the temperature rapidly increases, further raising the helium fusion rate and, because degenerate matter is a good [[Thermal conduction|conductor of heat]], widening the reaction region.

However, since degeneracy pressure (which is purely a function of density) is dominating thermal pressure (proportional to the product of density and temperature), the total pressure is only weakly dependent on temperature.  Thus, the dramatic increase in temperature only causes a slight increase in pressure, so there is no stabilizing cooling expansion of the core.

This runaway reaction quickly climbs to about 100 billion times the star's normal energy production (for a few seconds) until the temperature increases to the point that thermal pressure again becomes dominant, eliminating the degeneracy. The core can then expand and cool down and a stable burning of helium will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 317| pages = 724–732| last = Deupree| first = R. G.|author2=R. K.

A star with mass greater than about 2.25 {{Solar mass}} starts to burn helium without its core becoming degenerate, and so does not exhibit this type of helium flash. In a very low-mass star (less than about 0.5 {{Solar mass}}), the core is never hot enough to ignite helium. The degenerate helium core will keep on contracting, and finally becomes a [[White dwarf#Stars with very low mass|helium white dwarf]].

The helium flash is not directly observable on the surface by electromagnetic radiation. The flash occurs in the core deep inside the star, and the net effect will be that all released energy is absorbed by the entire core, leaving the degenerate state to become nondegenerate. Earlier computations indicated that a nondisruptive mass loss would be possible in some cases,&lt;ref name="Deupree1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Deupree|first1= R.

==Binary white dwarfs==

When hydrogen gas is accreted onto a ''white dwarf'' from a binary companion star, the hydrogen can fuse to form helium for a narrow range of accretion rates, but most systems develop a layer of hydrogen over the degenerate white dwarf interior. This hydrogen can build up to form a shell near the surface of the star. When the mass of hydrogen becomes sufficiently large, runaway fusion causes a [[nova]]. In a few binary systems where the hydrogen fuses on the surface, the mass of helium built up can burn in an unstable helium flash. In certain binary systems the companion star may have lost most of its hydrogen and donate helium-rich material to the compact star. Note that similar flashes occur on [[X-ray burster|neutron stars]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=={{Anchor|shell helium flash}}Shell helium flash==

'''Shell helium flashes''' are a somewhat analogous but much less violent, nonrunaway helium ignition event, taking place in the absence of degenerate matter. They occur periodically in [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars in a shell outside the core. This is late in the life of a star in its giant phase. The star has burnt most of the helium available in the core, which is now composed of carbon and oxygen. Helium fusion continues in a thin shell around this core, but then turns off as helium becomes depleted. This allows hydrogen fusion to start in a layer above the helium layer. After enough additional helium accumulates, helium fusion is reignited, leading to a thermal pulse which eventually causes the star to expand and brighten temporarily (the pulse in luminosity is delayed because it takes a number of years for the energy from restarted helium fusion to reach the surface&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt;). Such pulses may last a few hundred years, and are thought to occur periodically every 10,000 to 100,000 years.&lt;ref name = "Wood"&gt;{{Cite journal

After the flash, helium fusion continues at an exponentially decaying rate for about 40% of the cycle as the helium shell is consumed.&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt; Thermal pulses may cause a star to shed circumstellar shells of gas and dust.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''Historical ecology''' is a research program that focuses on the interactions between [[human]]s and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, C. L. (1987). Historical ecology. In ''Regional dynamics: Burgundian landscapes in historical perspective'', eds. C. L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt, pp. 237-264. New York:Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Scholl, Michael D., D. Seth Murray and Carole L. Crumley

&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to ''and'' shape the environment, continuously contributing to [[landscape]] transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.&lt;ref name="Balee1"&gt;Balée, W. (1998). "Historical ecology: Premises and postulates". In W. Balée (Ed.), Advances in Historical Ecology, (pp 13-29). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piecing together landscapes requires a sometimes difficult union between [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, close attention to geographic and temporal scales, a knowledge of the range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings in a way that is useful to researchers in many fields.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, Carole L.

1994. Historical Ecology:a Multidimensional Ecological Orientation. In Historical Ecology: Cultural Knowledge and Changing Landscapes, ed. C.L. Crumley, pp. 1-16. Santa Fe: School  of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from [[geography]], [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, [[ethnography|ethnographic interviews]], and landscape reconstructions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==History==
The discipline has several sites of origins by researchers who shared a common interest in the problem of ecology and history, but with a diversity of approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.]] used the term in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1964 | title = General and historical ecology | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 14 | issue = 7| pages = 33–35 | doi=10.2307/1293234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to describe a methodology that had been in long development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1944 | title = Analysis and Mexican archaeology: an attempt to apply the method | url = | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 | doi=10.2307/275110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deevey wished to bring together the practices of "general ecology" which was studied in an experimental laboratory, with a "historical ecology" which relied on  evidence collected through fieldwork. For example, Deevey used [[radiocarbon dating]] to reconcile biologists’ successions of plants and animals with the sequences of [[material culture]] and sites discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1969 | title = Coaxing history to conduct experiments | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 40–43 | doi=10.2307/1294629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, members of the history department at the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]] organized a lecture series entitled "Historical Ecology: Essays on Environment and Social Change"&lt;ref&gt;Bilsky, L. J., ed. (1980) ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''. Port Washington, NY: Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors noted the public’s concerns with pollution and dwindling natural resources, and they began a dialogue between researchers with specialties which spanned the social sciences. The papers highlighted the importance of understanding social and political structures,  personal identities, perceptions of nature, and the multiplicity of solutions for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;Moneyhon, C. H. (1980). Introduction. In ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''.ed. L. J. Bilsky, pp. 3-8. Port Washington, NY, Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of historical ecology as a coherent discipline was driven by a number of long-term research projects in historical ecology of tropical, temperate and arctic environments:

E.S. Deevey's Historical Ecology of the Maya Project (1973-1984) was carried out by archaeologists and biologists who combined data from lake sediments, settlement patterns, and material from excavations in the central [[Petén District]] of [[Guatemala]] to refute the hypotheses that a collapse of Mayan urban areas was instigated by faltering food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = D. | last2 = Rice | first2 = P. | year = 1984 | title = Lessons from the Maya | url = | journal = Latin American Research Review | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 7–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carole L. Crumley's Burgundian Landscape Project (1974–present) is carried out by a multidisciplinary research team aimed at identifying the multiple factors which have contributed to the long-term durability of the agricultural economy of [[Burgundy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;Carole L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt (1987) ''Regional Dynamics: Burgundian Landscapes in Historical Perspective''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas H. McGovern's Inuit-Norse Project (1976–present) uses archaeology, environmental reconstruction, and textual analysis to examine the changing ecology of Nordic colonizers and indigenous peoples in [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faeroes]], and [[Shetland]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, T. 1981.

Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the approaches to historical ecology have been expanded to include coastal and marine environments:

Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Project (1984–present) examines [[Massachusetts]], USA cod fishing in the 17th through 19th centuries through historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Bolster | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Alexander | first3 = K.E. | last4 = Leavenworth | first4 = W.B. | last5 = Cooper | first5 = A.B. | last6 = McKenzie | first6 = M.G. | year = 2005 | title = The history of ocean resources: modeling cod biomass using historical records | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0078:thoorm]2.0.co;2 | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida Keys Coral Reef Eco-region Project (1990–present) researchers at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] are examining archival records including natural history descriptions, maps and charts, family and personal papers, and state and colonial records in order to understand the impact of over-fishing and habitat loss in the [[Florida Keys]], USA which contains the third largest coral reef in the world.

Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology (2008–present) seeks to collect relevant historical data on fishing, whaling, and trade of the furs of aquatic animals in order form a baseline for environmental restorations of the [[California]], USA coast.&lt;ref&gt;Selbie, Hugo (2008) Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology Phase 1: Historical Sources Survey Report.

==Relations with other disciplines==

[[File:Idaho Falls Idaho Temple 2.jpeg|thumb|Manmade nature: In [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]], these waterfalls replaced naturally occurring ones]]
Historical ecology is interdisciplinary in principle; at the same time, it borrows heavily from the rich intellectual history of [[environmental anthropology]]. Western scholars have known since the time of [[Plato]] that the history of environmental changes cannot be separated from human history. Several ideas have been used to describe human interaction with the environment, the first of which is the concept of the [[Great Chain of Being]], or inherent design in nature. In this, all forms of life are ordered, with Humanity as the highest being, due to its knowledge and ability to modify nature. This lends to the concept of another nature, a manmade nature, which involves design or modification by humans, as opposed to design inherent in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, C. (1956). Changing ideas of the habitable world. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's role in changing the phase of the Earth (pp 73). Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in environmental transformation continued to increase in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting in a series of new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was [[environmental determinism]], developed by geographer [[Friedrich Ratzel]]. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of [[Franz Boas]] which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. [[Julian Steward]]'s [[cultural ecology]] is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.

Anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]] introduced the field of ecological anthropology in a deliberate attempt to move away from cultural ecology. Studies in ecological anthropology borrow heavily from the natural sciences, in particular, the concept of the ecosystem from [[systems ecology]]. In this approach, also called systems theory, ecosystems are seen as self-regulating, and as returning to a state of equilibrium. This theory views human populations as static and as acting in harmony with the environment.&lt;ref name="balee2"&gt;Balée, W. (2006). "The research program of historical ecology". Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 35, pp5.1-5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revisions of anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and others are especially pertinent to the development of historical ecology. These revisions and related critiques of environmental anthropology undertook to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and cultures, rather than continuing to view populations as static. These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the need to consider the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]].

==Landscapes in historical ecology==

In historical ecology, the [[landscape]] is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment.  The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. G. (2000). Landscape, ecology and ecosystems management. Retrieved March 15, 2008, from Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky Web site: http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for76/for76.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology revises the notion of the [[ecosystem]] and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers "landscape transformation" to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; The use of "landscape" instead of "ecosystem" as the core unit of analysis lies at the heart of historical ecology.

[[File:Carl O. Sauer.jpg|thumb|left|Geographer Carl O. Sauer]]
Various individuals and schools of thought have informed the idea of the landscape as historical ecologists conceive of it. The Old English words ''landskift'', ''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'' refer to environments that have been altered by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, W.'', 1981 Beyond the View - our changing landscapes''. Inkata Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.B., 1986, "The vernacular landscape", in Penning-Rowsell, E.C. &amp; D. Lowenthal, ''Landscape Meanings and Values'', Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = P.E. | year = 1934 | title = The terminology of regional description | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 78–79 | doi=10.1080/00045603409357125}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this etymology demonstrates, landscapes have been conceived of as related to human culture since at least the 5th century CE. Cultural and historical geographers have had a more recent influence. They adopted this idea from nineteenth-century German architects, gardeners, and landscape painters in Europe, Australia, and North America.&lt;ref name=Olwig&gt;Olwig, K (2002). ''Landscape, nature, and the body politic''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes are not only physical objects, but also "forms of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Carol. 1991. ''On Site: Architectural Preoccupations.'' Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes have cultural meanings, for example, the sacredness in many cultures of burial grounds. This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

The idea of the cultural landscape is directly attributed to American geographer [[Carl Sauer]]. Sauer's theories developed as a critique of environmental determinism, which was a popular theory in the early twentieth century. Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper "The Morphology of Landscape" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain. In this, the term landscape is used in a geographical sense to mean an arbitrarily selected section of reality; morphology means the conceptual and methodological processes for altering it. Hence to Sauer, wherever humans lived and impacted the environment, landscapes with determinate histories resulted.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenzer | first1 = M. S. | year = 1985 | title = Milieu and the 'intellectual landscape': Carl O. Sauer's undergraduate heritage | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 258–270 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1985.tb00085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as [[landscape ecology]]. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize that this is not always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = M. G. | year = 2005 | title = Landscape ecology in North America: Past, present and future | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = 8| pages = 1967–1974 | doi=10.1890/04-0890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances as an integral part of the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as [[palimpsest]]s, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.

Historical ecologists recognize that landscapes undergo continuous alteration over time and these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes that there is a primary and a secondary succession that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts.  Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous [[slash-and-burn]] horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.

Historical ecology challenges the very notion of a pristine landscape, such as virgin rainforests.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denevan | first1 = William | year = 1992 | title = The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492 | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 369–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Sluyter, Andrew (2002) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Colonialism_and_landscape.html?id=XA6R9UG2WxQC ''Colonialism and Landscape: Postcolonial Theory and Applications'']. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

Human alterations have occurred in different phases, including the period prior to [[industrialization]]. These changes have been studied through the archeological record of modern humans and their history. The evidence that classless societies, like [[foragers]] and trekkers, were able to change a landscape was a breakthrough in historical ecology and anthropology as a whole.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. 1969 (1925). "The morphology of landscape." In J. Leighly (Ed.), ''Land and Life'' (pp 312-343). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human-mediated disturbance==

[[File:Dalbek P1210001.JPG|thumb|Man-made irrigation canal]]
''Homo sapiens'' have interacted with the environment throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through secondary effects. These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

Both destructive and at times constructive, [[anthropogenic fire]] is the most immediately visible human-mediated disturbance, and without it, many landscapes would become denatured.&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, S. J. (1998). "Forged in fire: History, land, and anthropogenic fire". In W. Balée (Ed.), ''Advances in Historical Ecology'', (pp 64-103). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have practiced [[controlled burn]]s of forests globally for thousands of years, shaping landscapes in order to better fit their needs. They burned vegetation and forests to create space for crops, sometimes resulting in higher levels of species diversity. Today, in the absence of indigenous populations who once practiced controlled burns (most notably in [[North America]] and [[Australia]]), naturally ignited wildfires have increased. In addition, there has been destabilization of "ecosystem after ecosystem, and there is good documentation to suggest fire exclusion by Europeans has led to floral and faunal extinctions."&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

[[Invasive species|Biological invasions]] and the spread of [[pathogen]]s and [[disease]]s are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.

Other mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances include [[water management]] and [[soil management]]. In [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] Europe, these have been recognized as ways of landscape alteration since the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Cicero]] noted that through fertilization, irrigation, and other activities, humans had essentially created a second world.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; At present, [[fertilization]] yields larger, more productive harvests of crops, but also has had adverse effects on many landscapes, such as decreasing the diversity of plant species and adding pollutants to soils.

===Anthropogenic fire===

Anthropogenic fire is a mechanism of human-mediated disturbance, defined within historical ecology as a means of altering the landscape in a way that better suits human needs.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt; The most common form of anthropogenic fire is controlled burns, or broadcast burning, which people have employed for thousands of years.  Forest fires and burning tend to carry negative connotations, yet controlled burns can have a favorable impact on landscape diversity, formation, and protection.

Broadcast burning alters the biota of a landscape. The immediate effect of a forest fire is a decrease in diversity. This negative impact associated with broadcast burning, however, is only temporary. Cycles of burning will allow the landscape to gradually increase in diversity. The time required for this change is dependent on the intensity, frequency, timing, and size of the controlled burns. After a few cycles, however, diversity increases. The adaptation to fire has shaped many of Earth's landscapes.

[[File:SwiddenFire6.jpg|thumb|A swidden fire, an example of a controlled burn]]
In addition to fostering diversity, controlled burns have helped change landscapes. These changes can range from grasslands to woodlands, from prairies or forest-steppes, to scrubland to forest. Whatever the case, these transformations increase diversity and engender landscapes more suitable to human needs, creating patches rich in utilitarian and natural resources.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt;

In addition to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease the risk of wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped to fireproof landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt;

Of all of the mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire has become one of great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about in the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt; Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.

===Biological invasions===
[[File:Lymantria dispar MHNT Chenille.jpg|thumb|''Lymantria dispar'']]
Biological invasions are composed of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread at a faster rate when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.

Invasive species can be transported intentionally or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas from where they are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It is important to note that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; Humans have on their migrations through the ages taken along plants of agricultural and medicinal value, so that the modern distribution of such favored species is a clear mapping of the routes they have traveled and the places they have settled.

One example of an invasive species that has had a significant impact on the landscape is the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar''). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate [[Eurasia]]; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an [[entomologist]] in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, P.C. and A.M. Liebhold. "Gypsy Moth." pp. 238-241 in: D. Simberloff and M. Rejmanek, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions'', University of California Press, Berkeley, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the medium of introduction, biological invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote about the benefits of biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.

===Epidemic disease===
[[File:San tribesman.jpg|thumb|A San Tribesman: Those living in dry climates have fewer intestinal parasites.]]
A clear relationship between nature and people is expressed through human disease. Infectious disease can thus be seen as another example of human-mediated disturbance as humans are [[Host (biology)|hosts]] for infectious diseases. Historically, evidence of epidemic diseases is associated with the beginnings of agriculture and sedentary communities. Previously, human populations were too small and mobile for most infections to become established as [[chronic diseases]]. Permanent settlements, due to agriculture, allowed for more inter-community interaction, enabling infections to develop as specifically human pathogens.&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"&gt;Newson, L.A. (1998) "A historical-ecological perspective on epidemic disease." In W. Balee (Ed.). ''Advances in historical ecology'' (pp 42-63). New York: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in [[pathogenic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"/&gt;

===Transformation of waterways===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Amazonia5.jpg |thumb|Satellite view of anthropogenic transformation of [[Amazon basin]] waterways near the city of Manaus, Brazil along the north bank of the Negro River, 11 miles (18 km) above its confluence with the Amazon]] --&gt;

Historical ecologists postulate that landscape transformations have occurred throughout history, even before the dawn of [[western culture|western civilization]]. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil [[erosion]] and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. [[Landscape]]s, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. (1992). ''So shall you reap''. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple other adjustments done for [[agricultural]] or transportation usage.

The evidence for past and present agricultural use of [[wetlands]] in [[Mesoamerica]] suggests an evolutionary sequence of landscape and [[waterway]] alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Surian | first1 = N. | last2 = Rinaldi | first2 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Morphological response to river engineering and management in alluvial channels in Italy | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 307–326 | doi=10.1016/s0169-555x(02)00219-2| bibcode = 2003Geomo..50..307S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pre-Columbian]], indigenous agriculturalists developed capabilities with which to raise crops under a wide range of ecological conditions, giving rise to a multiplicity of altered, cultivated landscapes. The effects of waterway transformation were particularly evident in Mesoamerica, where agricultural practices ranged from swiddening to multicropped hydraulically transformed wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, T. M. &amp; Turner, B. L. II. (1992). "Landscapes of a cultivation in Mesoamerica on the eve of the conquest." ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 82 (3), 402-425. {{jstor|2563353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manaus]], the largest city on the Amazon, as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the muddy Amazon River and the dark Rio Negro]]

Historical ecologists view the [[Amazon basin]] landscape as cultural and embodying social labor. The [[Amazon River]] has been altered by the local population for crop growth and water transportation. Previous research failed to account for human interaction with the Amazon landscape. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that the landscape has been manipulated by its [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] population over time. The continual, natural shifting of rivers, however, often masked the human disturbances in the course of rivers. As a result, the indigenous populations in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] are often overlooked for their ability to alter the land and the river.&lt;ref name=Raffles&gt;Raffles, H. The Amazon: a natural landscape?
http://www.india-seminar.com/2000/486/486%20raffles.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[waterway]] transformation has been successfully identified in the Amazon landscape. Clark Erickson observes that pre-Hispanic [[savanna]] peoples of the [[Bolivia]]n Amazon built an [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] landscape through the construction of raised fields, large settlement mounds, and earthen causeways. Erickson, on the basis of location, form, patterning, associations and ethnographic analogy, identified a particular form of earthwork, the zigzag structure, as fish [[weir]]s in the savanna of [[Baures]], Bolivia. The artificial zigzag structures were raised from the adjacent savanna and served as a means to harvest the fish who used them to migrate and spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = C. L. | year = 2000 | title = An artificial landscape-scale fishery in the Bolivian Amazon | url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/%7Ecerickso/fishweir/articles/Nature1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 190–193 | bibcode = 2000Natur.408..190E | doi = 10.1038/35041555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence of waterway transformation is found in [[Igarapé]] [[Guariba]] in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British [[naturalists]] [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close to the town of Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long across fields thick with tall [[papyrus]] grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape in this part of the northern Brazilian state of [[Amapá]] was dramatically transformed.&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

In general, with an increase in global population growth, comes an increase in the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of waterways. The [[Sumer]]ians had created extensive irrigations by 4000 BC. As the population increased in the 3,000 years of agriculture, the ditches and canals increased in number. By the early 1900s, ditching, dredging, and diking had become common practice. This led to an increase in [[erosion]] which impacted the landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, A. H. (1983, April). "Wetland agriculture in Pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]." ''Geographical Review'', 73 (2), 166-181 {{jstor|214642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activities have affected the natural role of rivers and its communal value. These changes in waterways have impacted the floodplains, natural tidal patterns, and the surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, B. &amp; Smith, T. (2007, October 15). "Reviving a river." Retrieved March 28, 2008, from Massachusetts Wetlands Restoration Program Web site: http://www.mass.gov/czm/coastlines/2006/ebbflow/river.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of understanding such transformation is it provides a more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, as well as other [[ecological]] settings, as places where [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] populations have dealt with the forces of [[nature]]. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], not a [[society]]. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of both [[waterways]] and [[landscapes]].&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

===Soil management===

[[Soil management]], or direct human interaction with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have both positive and negative effects on local [[biodiversity]]. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in [[topsoil]]. Salinization of the [[Euphrates River]] has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;Erickson, C. &amp; Balée, W. (2006). In time and complexity in historical ecology: Studies in the neotropical lowlands (pp 7-12). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.

The case of soil management in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) is a classic example of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or [[Terra preta]], are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils.&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt; Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of [[charcoal]] in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Terra preta web site. School of geosciences and geography (Universität Bayreuth). Retrieved on April 5, 2008, from {{cite web |url=http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170240/http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |archivedate=2005-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed [[slash-and-char]]. In contrast to the commonly known [[slash-and-burn]] technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.&lt;ref name=sington&gt;Sington, D. (Director) (2002). Horizon: The secret of El Dorado [Videotape]. BBC Horizon Series. London: Dox Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DirkvdM santa fe scorched.jpg|thumb|Scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture]]
Interest in and the study of Amazon dark earths was advanced with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | year = 2006 | title = Putting the Carbon back: Black is the new green | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = | pages = 624–626 | doi=10.1038/442624a | pmid=16900176| bibcode = 2006Natur.442..624M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forests are well known for having greater biodiversity than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‘forest islands’ in multiple locations can be considered a positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Fairhead, J. &amp; Leach, M. (1996). ''Misreading the African landscape: Society and ecology in a forest-savanna mosaic.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. Earth works and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas.&lt;ref name=sington/&gt;  The forest islands in the Bolivian Amazon not only increase the local plant species diversity, but also enhance subsistence possibilities for the local people.

==Applied historical ecology==

Historical ecology involves an understanding of multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, and the impact of human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines.   Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = Historical contingencies in the coevolution of environment and livelihood: contributions to the debate on Amazon Black Earth | url = http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/875/14Exemplary(A).pdf | format = PDF | journal = Geoderma | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 307–331 | doi=10.1016/s0016-7061(02)00270-7 | bibcode=2003Geode.111..307G}}&lt;/ref&gt; much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.

Historical ecology can also aid in the goals of other fields of study. [[Conservation biology]] recognizes different types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. [[Restoration ecology]] restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, not limited to the original inhabitants of an area.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.L., Gibbs, J.P. (2006) ''Fundamentals of Conservation Biology''. 3rd ed. (pp 252-276). Malden, Massachusetts, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-3545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.

A tropical forest in particular needs to be studied extensively because it is a highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples.  The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current land managers in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robichaud | first1 = W. G. | last2 = Sinclair | first2 = A. R.E. | last3 = Odarkor-Lanquaye | first3 = N. | last4 = Klinkenberg | first4 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Stable Forest Cover Under Increasing Populations of Swidden Cultivators in Central Laos: the Roles of Intrinsic Culture and Extrinsic Wildlife Trade | url = http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss1/art33/ | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 14 | issue = 1| page = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land managers no longer automatically eliminate the use of swidden fires, but rather the number of swidden fires that are set for government-sponsored agricultural purposes.

The San Francisco Estuary Institute also uses historical ecology to study human impacts on the California landscape to guide environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;Grossinger, R.M., Striplen, C.J., Brewster, E., Beller, E.E., Askevold, R. 2007. "Historical landscape ecology of an urbanized California valley: wetlands and woodlands in the Santa Clara Valley." ''Landscape Ecology''. :103-120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = A. | last2 = Grossinger | first2 = R.M. | last3 = Davis | first3 = F.W. | year = 2011 | title = Shifting Baselines in a California Oak Savanna: Nineteenth Century Data to Inform Restoration Scenarios | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = 101| pages = 88–101 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the wetlands of Elkhorn Slough near [[Monterey, California]], sought to enhance conservation and restoration activities. By using historical data such as maps, charts, and aerial photographs, researchers were able to trace habitat change to built structures that had negatively altered the tidal flow into the estuaries dating from the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyke | first1 = E.V. | last2 = Wasson | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Historical Ecology of a Central California Estuary: 150 Years of Habitat Change | url = http://www.elkhornslough.org | journal = Estuaries | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 173–189 | doi=10.1007/bf02732853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study further suggested using techniques that "imitate the complex structure of natural tidal wetlands and maintain connectivity with intact wetland habitats as well as with adjoining subtidal and upland habitats."

An '''initial sound table''' is a table, list or chart which shows the initial sound letter of a word together with its picture (pictured words). The initial sound table can assist students to recognise initial sounds and to get [[Reading (process)|first reading]] and writing skills. In 1658 [[John Amos Comenius]] created an initial sound table in [[Orbis Pictus]] (a picture book intended for children).

''Alternative names:'' initial sound list, initial sound chart, initial sound [[alphabet]], alphabet chart, alphabet picture chart

== Writing to read ==
In the German-speaking countries, language experience is often based on children's writing of stories that involves [[Whole language|invented spelling]]s (e.g. with the help of an "initial sound table" picturing words that start with a specific sound). The Swiss teacher Jürgen Reichen ([[progressive education]]) founded this "writing to read" method&amp;nbsp;1982. The method combines two basic features of in favour of "[[phonics]]" (unduly equated with "[[direct instruction]]", stepwise teaching, etc.). According to this approach children should be encouraged to "write
words as they pronounce them" with the help of an "initial sound list" of pictured words.
Constructing words in this way is supposed to help them to understand the basic relationship
between spoken and written language.

[[Johann Amos Comenius]] already added 1658 an initial-sound-table to his „[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]“.

== Initial sound keyboard ==
There are software for children which has a multimedial ''initial sound keyboard'' for text input ([[virtual keyboard]]). Several hardware [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] for kids also have ''initial sound pictures'' on its keys. With ''initial sound [[label|stickers]]'' and a standard computer keyboard you can create your own initial sound keyboard.app0l

== Initial sound examples ==
There are [[initial sound]]s, [[medial sound]]s and [[final sound]]s.

'''Mass wasting''', also known as '''slope movement''' or '''mass movement''', is the [[geomorphology|geomorphic]] process by which [[soil]], [[sand]], [[regolith]], and [[rock (geology)|rock]] move downslope typically as a solid, continuous or discontinuous mass, largely under the force of [[gravity]], but frequently with characteristics of a flow as in [[debris flow]]s and [[mudflow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/368257/mass-movement Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Types of mass wasting include [[Downhill creep|creep]], slides, flows, topples, and falls, each with its own characteristic features, and taking place over timescales from seconds to hundreds of years. Mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], and Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

When the gravitational force acting on a slope exceeds its resisting force, slope failure (mass wasting) occurs. The slope material's strength and [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] and the amount of [[internal friction]] between material help maintain the slope's stability and are known collectively as the slope's [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]]. The steepest angle that a cohesionless slope can maintain without losing its stability is known as its [[angle of repose]]. When a slope made of loose material possesses this angle, its shear strength perfectly counterbalances the force of gravity acting upon it.

Mass wasting may occur at a very slow rate, particularly in areas that are very dry or those areas that receive sufficient rainfall such that vegetation has stabilized the surface. It may also occur at very high speed, such as in [[rockslide]]s or [[landslides]], with disastrous consequences, both immediate and delayed, e.g., resulting from the formation of [[landslide dam]]s.

Factors that change the potential of mass wasting include: change in slope angle, weakening of material by [[weathering]], increased water content; changes in [[vegetation]] cover, and overloading.

Volcano flanks can become over-steep resulting in instability and mass wasting. This is now a recognised part of the growth of all active volcanoes. It is seen on submarine as well as surface volcanoes: [[Loihi]] in the Hawaiian volcanic chain and [[Kick 'em Jenny]] in the Caribbean volcanic arc are two submarine volcanoes that are known to undergo mass wasting. The failure of the northern flank of [[Mount St Helens]] in 1980 showed how rapidly volcanic flanks can deform and fail.

==The importance of water in mass wasting==
Water can increase or decrease the stability of a slope depending on the amount present.  Small amounts of water can strengthen soils because the surface tension of water increases soil cohesion.  This allows the soil to resist erosion better than if it were dry.  If too much water is present the water may act to increase the pore pressure, reducing friction, and accelerating the erosion process and resulting in different types of mass wasting (i.e. mudflows, landslides, etc.).  A good example of this is to think of a [[sand castle]].  Water must be mixed with sand in order for the castle to keep its shape.  If too much water is added the sand washes away, if not enough water is added the sand falls and cannot keep its shape. Water also increases the mass of the soil, this is important because an increase in mass means that there will be an increase in velocity if mass wasting is triggered.
Saturated water, however, eases the process of mass wasting in that the rock and soil debris are easily washed down-slope.

==Types of mass wasting==
Based on how the soil, regolith or rock moves downslope as a whole, mass movements can be broadly classified as creeps and landslides.

===Creeps===
[[Soil creep]] is a slow and long term mass movement. The combination of small movements of soil or rock in different directions over time are directed by gravity gradually downslope. The steeper the slope, the faster the creep. The creep makes trees and shrubs curve to maintain their perpendicularity, and they can trigger landslides if they lose their root footing. The surface soil can migrate under the influence of cycles of freezing and thawing, or hot and cold temperatures, inching its way towards the bottom of the slope forming [[terracettes]].  

===Landslides===
A [[landslide]], also called a landslip, is a slow or rapid movement of a large mass of earth and rocks down a hill or a mountainside. Little or no flowage of the materials occurs on a given slope until heavy rain and resultant lubrication by the same rainwater facilitate the movement of the materials, causing a landslide to occur. 

In particular, if the main feature of the movement is a slide along a planar or curved surface, the landslide is termed slump, earth slide, debris slide or rock slide, depending on the prevailing material.

Movement of soil and regolith that more resembles fluid behavior is called a flow. These include [[avalanche]]s, [[mudflow]]s, [[debris flow]]s, [[earth flow]], [[lahars]] and [[sturzstrom]]s. Water, air and ice are often involved in enabling fluid-like motion of the material.

A fall, including [[rockfall]] and debris fall, occurs where regolith cascades down a slope, but is not of sufficient volume or viscosity to behave as a flow. Falls are promoted in rocks which are characterized by the presence of vertical cracks. Falls can also result from undercutting by running water as well as by waves. They usually occur at very steep slopes such as a cliff face. The rock material may be loosened by earthquakes, rain, plant-root wedging, and expanding ice, among other things. The accumulation of rock material that has fallen and resides at the base of the structure is known as [[Scree|talus]].

==Triggers of mass wasting==
Soil and regolith remain on a hillslope only while the gravitational forces are unable to overcome the frictional forces keeping the material in place (see [[slope stability]]). Some factors that reduce the frictional resistance relative to the downslope forces, and thus can trigger slope movement, can include:
* [[earthquake]]s
* increased overburden from structures
* increased soil moisture
* reduction of roots holding the soil to bedrock
* undercutting of the slope by [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] or erosion
* weathering by [[frost heave]] or chemical dissolution
* [[bioturbation]]

==Reducing the impacts of mass wasting==
* [[Afforestation]]
* Re-Afforestation
* [[Terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] steps on slopes or, more generally, re-modeling its shape
* [[Slope stabilization]]

The '''memory cell''' is the fundamental building block of [[computer memory]]. The memory cell is an [[electronic circuit]] that stores one [[bit]] of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.

Over the history of computing many different memory cell architectures have been used including [[core memory]] and [[bubble memory]], but the most common ones used are flip-flops and capacitors.

The SRAM, static ram memory cell is a type of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] circuit, usually implemented using [[field effect transistor|FET]]s. These require very low power to keep the stored value when not being accessed.

A second type, DRAM is based around a capacitor. Charging and discharging this capacitor can store a '1' or a '0' in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor will slowly leak away, and must be refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power, but can achieve greater storage densities.

== Description ==
The memory cell is the fundamental building block of memory. It can be implemented using different technologies, such as [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]], [[MOSFET|MOS]], and other [[semiconductor devices]]. It can also be built from [[magnetic]] material such as [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] cores or magnetic bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D.

It stores one bit of binary information that can be accessed by reading the cell and it must be set to store a 1 and reset to store a 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=William|title=An engineering approach to digital design|date=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=0-13-277699-5|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logic circuits without memory cells or feedback paths are called [[Combinational logic|combinational]],  their outputs values depend only on the current value of their input values. They do not have memory. 
But memory is a key element of [[digital systems]]. In computers, it allows to store both programs and data and memory cells are also used for temporary storage of the output of combinational circuits to be used later by digital systems.
Logic circuits that use memory cells are called [[Sequential logic|sequential circuits]]. Its output depends not only on the present value of its inputs, but also on the circuits previous state, as determined by the values stored on is memory cells. 
These circuits require a timing generator or clock for their operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Microelectronic Circuits|date=1987|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc.|isbn=0-03-007328-6|page=883|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer memory used in most contemporary [[computer systems]] is built mainly out of DRAM cells, since the layout is much smaller than SRAM, it can be more densely packed yielding cheaper memory with greater capacity. Since the DRAM memory cell stores its value as the charge of a capacitor, and there are current leakage issues, its value must be constantly rewriten. this is one of the reasons that make DRAM cells slower than the larger SRAM (Static RAM) cells, which has its value always available. That is the reason why SRAM memory is used for on-[[Integrated circuit|chip]] [[CPU cache|cache]] included in modern [[microprocessor]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Question Technique : le cache, comment ça marche ?|url=http://www.pcworld.fr/materiel/actualites,lqt-cache-cpu-memoire-cache-sram,547751,1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330034345/http://www.pcworld.fr/materiel/actualites,lqt-cache-cpu-memoire-cache-sram,547751,1.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-03-30|website=PC World Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
The following schematics detail the three most used implementations for memory cells : 
* The Dynamic Random Access Memory cell (DRAM)
* The Static Random Access Memory cell (SRAM) 
* Flip flops like the J/K shown below.

==Operation==

===DRAM memory cell===
[[Image:MT4C1024-HD.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of the MT4C1024 integrating one-[[mebibit]] of [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] memory cells.]]

====Storage====
:The storage element of the [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] memory cell is the [[capacitor]] labeled (4) in the diagram above. The charge stored in the capacitor degrades over time, so its value must be refreshed (read and rewritten) periodically. The [[MOSFET|nMOS]] transistor (3) acts as a gate to allow reading or writing when open or storing when closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=SrP3aWed-esC&amp;pg=PA355#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Memory Systems: Cache, DRAM, Disk|last=Jacob|first=Bruce|last2=Ng|first2=Spencer|last3=Wang|first3=David|date=28 July 2010|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=|isbn=9780080553849|location=|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reading====

:For reading the Word line drives a logic 1 (voltage high) into the gate of the [[MOSFET|nMOS]] transistor (3) which makes it conductive and the charge stored at the capacitor (4) is then transferred to the bit line. The bit line will have a [[parasitic capacitance]] (5) that will drain part of the charge and slow the reading process. The capacitance of the bit line will determine the needed size of the storage capacitor (4). It is a trade-off. If the storage capacitor is too small, the voltage of the bit line would take too much time to raise or not even rise above the threshold needed by the amplifiers at the end of the bit line. Since the reading process degrades the charge in the storage capacitor (4) its value is rewritten after each read.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=z-WTTkQEVfwC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Dynamic RAM: Technology Advancements|last=Siddiqi|first=Muzaffer A.|date=19 December 2012|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781439893739|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Writing====

:The writing process is the easiest, the desired value logic 1 (high voltage) or logic 0 (low voltage) is driven into the bit line. The word line activates the [[MOSFET|nMOS]] transistor (3) connecting it to the storage capacitor (4). The only issue is to keep it open enough time to ensure that the capacitor is fully charged or discharged before turning off the nMOS transistor (3).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===SRAM memory cell===
[[File:SRAM Cell Inverter Loop.png|thumb|SRAM memory cell depicting Inverter Loop as gates]]
====Storage====
:The  working principle of [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] memory cell can be easier to understand if the transistors M1 through M4 are drawn as [[logic gate]]s. That way it is clear that at its heart, the cell storage is built by using two cross-coupled [[inverter]]s. This simple loop creates a bi-stable circuit. A logic 1 at the input of the first inverter turns into a 0 at its output, and it is fed into the second inverter which transforms that logic 0 back to a logic 1 feeding back the same value to the input of the first inverter. That creates a stable state that does not change over time. Similarly the other stable state of the circuit is to have a logic 0 at the input of the first inverter. After been inverted twice it will also feedback the same value.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=8pfLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Nonvolatile Memory Design: Magnetic, Resistive, and Phase Change|last=Li|first=Hai|last2=Chen|first2=Yiran|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781439807460|location=|pages=6, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
: Therefore there are only two stable states that the circuit can be in:
:* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Q&lt;/math&gt;  = 0  and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \overline{Q}&lt;/math&gt; = 1
:* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Q&lt;/math&gt;  = 1  and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \overline{Q}&lt;/math&gt; = 0

====Reading====

:To read the contents of the memory cell stored in the loop, the transistors M5 and M6 must be turned on. when they receive voltage to their gates from the word line (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle WL&lt;/math&gt;), they become conductive and so the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Q&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \overline{Q}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;values get transmitted to the bit line (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle BL&lt;/math&gt;) and to its complement (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \overline{BL}&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally this values get amplified at the end of the bit lines.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Writing====

:The writing process is similar, the difference is that now the new value that will be stored in the memory cell is driven into the bit line (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle BL&lt;/math&gt;) and the inverted one into its complement (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \overline{BL}&lt;/math&gt;). Next transistors M5 and M6 are open by driving a logic one (voltage high) into the word line (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle WL&lt;/math&gt;). This effectively connects the bit lines to the by-stable inverter loop. There are two possible cases:
:# If the value of the loop is the same as the new value driven, there is no change.
:# If the value of the loop is different from the new value driven there are two conflicting values, in order for the voltage in the bit lines to overwrite the output of the inverters, the size of the M5 and M6 transistors must be larger than that of the M1-M4 transistors. This allow more current to flow through first ones and therefore tips the voltage in the direction of the new value, at some point the loop will then amplify this intermediate value to full rail.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Flip flop===
{{Main|Flip-flop (electronics)}}

The [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] has many different implementations, its storage element is usually a Latch consisting of a [[NAND gate]] loop or a [[NOR gate]] loop with additional gates used to implement clocking. Its value is always available for reading as an output. The value remains stored until it is changed through the set or reset process.

They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.

=== Land Grant Pioneer ===
In 1860, Williams became acting [[lieutenant governor]]&lt;ref name="josephrwilliams"&gt;"[http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/williams.htm Joseph R. Williams Biographical Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916212607/http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/williams.htm |date=September 16, 2006 }}".

This gave the college a four-year curriculum and the power to grant master's degrees. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution.&lt;ref name="sesquicentennial"/&gt; The college changed its name to '''State Agricultural College''', and its first class graduated in the same year. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had begun, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony.  The first alumni enlisted to the [[Union Army]]. Williams died, and the following year, [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the First [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model.  Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 1863, the state designated the college its land-grant institution making Michigan State University one of the nation's first land-grant college.&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{Citation | title = The National Schools of Science | magazine = The Nation | page = 409 | date = November 21, 1867 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&amp;f=false | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160624102647/https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&amp;f=false | archivedate = June 24, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a "Women Course" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African-American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Whitney. | title=East Lansing: Collegeville Revisited (Images of America) | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2002 | isbn=0-7385-2045-4 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later the college changed its name to '''Michigan Agricultural College''' (M.A.C.).

=== Big Ten University ===
During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it changed its name to '''Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science''' (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, [[John A. Hannah]], became president of the College.

After World War II, he began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Heineman, Kenneth J. | title=Campus Wars: The Peace Movement at American State Universities in the Vietnam Era | location=New York | publisher=New York University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-8147-3512-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now [[Oakland University]], with [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]]. Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the [[University of Chicago]] resigned from the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1946. Hannah lobbied to take its place, gaining admission in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Big 10 Now – Spartans Admitted|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=May 21, 1949|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as '''Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kuhn, Madison. | title=Michigan State: The First Hundred Years, 1855–1955 | location=East Lansing | publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=1955 | isbn=0-87013-222-9 | page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years afterward, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees. The State of Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/ |title=Michigan.gov |publisher=Michigan.gov |date= |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115192040/http://www.michigan.gov/ |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the University to drop the words "Agriculture and Applied Science" from its name. Since 1964, the institution has been '''Michigan State University'''.

=== Oakland University ===
In 1957, the donation of {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} in Pontiac Township, Oakland County, Michigan prompted creation of Michigan State University – Oakland.  That campus became the independent school, [[Oakland University]], in 1970.&lt;ref name="Oakland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&amp;sid=19|title=Oakland's History|publisher=Oakland University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716202800/http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&amp;sid=19|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Leadership Initiative, 2012 and Beyond ===
Since the end of the Hannah era in 1969, Michigan State shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, president [[Lou Anna Simon]] called for MSU to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by 2012. Her plans included creating a new [[residential college]] and increased grants awarded from the [[National Institutes of Health]] past the US$100 million mark. While there are over 100 [[Land-grant universities]] in the United States, she stated she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, Bob.

In 2016, a police report was filed alleging that in 2000, [[USA Gymnastics]] team doctor and MSU sports physician [[Larry Nassar]] (also a professor in the College of Osteopathic Medicine) had sexually assaulted a minor named [[Rachael Denhollander]] under the guise of medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wehpkiflXMs|title=Watch: Nassar victim Rachael Denhollander speaks out|first=|last=USA TODAY Sports|date=January 24, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegation led to the arrest and eventual conviction of Nassar.

=== Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center ===
The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center doubles as a 4-star hotel and a business-friendly conference center. It is on the northwest corner of Michigan State University's campus, across from the [[Brody Complex]], on Harrison Road just south of Michigan Avenue. The hotel's 160 rooms and suites can accommodate anyone staying in East Lansing for a business conference, sporting event or an on-campus visit. Besides a lodging facility, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center is a "learning laboratory for the 300–400 students each year that are enrolled in The School of Hospitality Business and other majors." The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center strives to facilitate education by hosting conferences and seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kelloggcenter.com/about/history.html |title=Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132424/http://www.kelloggcenter.com/about/history.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan State University is a participant in the [[Big Ten Academic Alliance]]. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014–2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/library/reciprocal-borrowing/introduction |title=Reciprocal Library Borrowing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/purchasing-and-licensing |title=Purchasing and Licensing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course sharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/SharedCourses.aspx|title=Sharing Access to Courses|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional development]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/Leadership.aspx|title=Leadership Development|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[study abroad]] and international collaborations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/GlobalCollaborations.aspx|title=Global Collaborations|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.

=== Endowment ===
MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) [[financial endowment|endowment]] started in 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate [[R.E. Olds]] helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rodriguez, Michael | title=R.E. Olds and Industrial Lansing | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=0-7385-3272-X | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools (of the time), with barely over $100 million in endowment funds.

This changed dramatically in the 2000s (decade), when the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of [[fiscal year]] 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school.&lt;ref&gt;Seguin, Rick. "[http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html Endowment surges in growth, rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902172725/http://www.newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html |date=September 2, 2006 }}".

Established in 1967, [[James Madison College]] is a smaller component residential college featuring multidisciplinary programs in the social sciences, founded on a model of liberal education.  James Madison College is housed in Case Hall. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are [[tenure]] track faculty.

'''Minusheet perfusion culture system''' is used for advanced [[cell culture]] experiments in combination with [[Subculture (biology)#Adherent cells|adherent cells]] and to generate specialized tissues in combination with selected [[biomaterial]]s, special tissue carriers and compatible [[perfusion]] culture containers.

The technical development of the Minusheet perfusion culture system was driven by the idea to create under [[in vitro]] conditions an environment resembling as near as possible the situation of specialized tissues found within the [[organism]]. Basis of this invention is therefore individually selected biomaterials for optimal cell adhesion mounted in Minusheet tissue carriers. Moreover, to always offer fresh [[nutrition]] including respiratory gas and to simulate a tissue-specific fluid environment, the tissue carriers can be inserted into compatible perfusion culture containers. As a result, a variety of publications illustrates that tissues generated by this innovative approach exhibit an excellent and stable quality. Thus, on the one hand the system provides a highly adaptable basis for the culture of adherent cells and the generation of specialized tissues. On the other hand the Minusheet perfusion culture system is bridging a methodical gap between the conventional static 24 well culture plate and modern perfusion culture technology.

==Crucial generation of specialized tissues==
Specialized tissues in culture are urgently needed in [[regenerative medicine]], [[tissue engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], biomaterial research and advanced [[toxicity]] testing of newly developed [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]]. However, it is often observed that raised tissues do not exhibit expected functional features. Instead [[Cellular differentiation|dedifferentiation]] is observed [1-4]. These cell biological alterations arise after isolation of cells and proceed during static culture in a dish due to suboptimal fluid environment and minor adhesion on biomaterials. Further uncontrolled supply with nutrition and respiratory gas, an overshoot of [[metabolite]]s and paracrine factors or missing [[Rheometry|rheological]] stress can increase the degree of dedifferentiation. In consequence, regarding an optimal generation of specialized tissues a powerful strategy has to exclude as much as possible harmful parameters, while factors supporting the process of tissue development must be intensified [5].

==Selected biomaterials promote development within a tissue carrier==
Under natural conditions a prerequisite for an optimal tissue development is a cell-specific interaction with the extracellular matrix, while under in vitro conditions a substitute for the extracellular matrix has to be selected. However, the crucial problem is that a [[biomaterial]] can influence the development of functional features within a maturing tissue in a good and in a bad sense. In consequence, the suitability of a decellularized extracellular matrix, newly developed synthetic polymers, biodegradable scaffolds, ceramics or metal alloys cannot be predicted but must be tested. 
To meet parameters positively influencing cell adhesion and communication, the technical concept is based on a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1). By the help of this tool cell adhesion and development of tissue can be tested with individually selected biomaterials. These experiments can be performed first under static (Fig. 2) and then under dynamic (Fig. 3) culture conditions [6]. In both cases a Minusheet tissue carrier prevents damage but supports development of contained cells or tissues during experimentation.  
[[File:Minusheet Figure 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 1|Figure 1: Mounting of a Minusheet tissue carrier. (a) First an individual biomaterial measuring 13 mm in diameter is selected. (b) For mounting the biomaterial is placed in the base part of a tissue carrier. (c) After pressing down a tension ring the mounted tissue carrier can be used for cell seeding. For improved provision with medium a tissue carrier rests with protrusions at the bottom of a dish.]]
To stay compatible with a conventional 24 well culture plate a selected biomaterial must be punched in a diameter of 13&amp;nbsp;mm. In this format many materials are also commercially available. Further materials can be applied in form of filters, foils, nets, fleeces and scaffolds (Fig. 1a). For an easy handling and to prevent damage during development the selected specimens are placed in the base part of a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1b). Pressing down a [[tension ring]] the biomaterial is held in position (Fig. 1c). After mounting a tissue carrier is enveloped in a bag and sterilized.

==Cell seeding on a tissue carrier==
For cell seeding the mounted tissue carrier is transferred by a forceps in a 24 well culture plate (Fig. 2). To concentrate cells on top of a tissue carrier culture medium is added to a level so that the selected biomaterial is just wetted. Then an [[wikt:Special:Search/aliquot|aliquot]] of cells is transferred by a pipette to the surface of the mounted biomaterial.
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 2|Figure 2: Minusheet tissue carriers including different biomaterials within a 24 well culture plate. Cell seeding is performed in static environment of this dish.]]

A standard culture protocol with a tissue carrier can be initiated by seeding cells onto the upper side. When a tissue carrier is turned, cells can also be seeded on the other side so that co-culture experiments with two different cell types become possible.
Not only single cells but also a thin slice of tissue can be mounted between two pieces of a woven net within a Minusheet tissue carrier. Further flexible materials such as [[collagen]] sheets can be used in a tissue carrier like the skin of a drum. Last but not least excellent results were obtained by mounting a polyester fleece as an artificial [[interstitium]] for spatial [[parenchyma]] development [5,6,8]. It is obvious that for each specialized tissue very individual spatial environments within a tissue carrier can be created.

==Compatible perfusion culture containers==
It has been shown that the static environment within a 24 well culture plate leads to a decrease of nutrition and hormones, an uncontrollable increase of [[metabolite]]s and an overshoot of [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine]] factors during time. Due to these reasons a Minusheet tissue carrier with adherent cells is used only for the short period of cell seeding in a 24 well culture plate.
In consequence, after adhesion of cells the tissue carrier is transferred to a perfusion culture container to offer a dynamic fluid environment. To meet the individual requirements of specialized tissues a variety of perfusion culture containers was constructed (Fig. 3).
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 3|Figure 3: Variety of perfusion culture containers for insertion of Minusheet tissue carriers.]]
 
Each of the perfusion culture containers has at least one inlet and one outlet for the transport of culture medium. A basic version of a container allows the simple bathing of cells respectively growing tissues under continuous medium transport (Fig. 4a). In a gradient container the tissue carrier is placed between the base and the lid so that both sides can be provided with individual media mimicking a typical environment for [[epithelia]] (Fig. 4b). A further culture container is made of a transparent lid and base allowing the microscopic observation during tissue development (Fig. 4c).
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 4.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 4|Figure 4: Use of a Minusheet tissue carrier in perfusion culture containers. (a) A standard perfusion culture container holds six tissue carriers to provide them with always fresh medium. (b) In a gradient perfusion culture container an epithelium is exposed to different fluids at the luminal and basal side. (c) In a microscope container a transparent lid and base allow observation of developing tissue during perfusion culture.]]

In addition, a perfusion culture container can exhibit a flexible [[silicone]] lid. Applying force to this lid by an eccentric rotor simulates a mechanical load as required in [[cartilage]] and [[bone]] [[tissue engineering]]. Shaped tissues such as an [[Ear|auricle]] or different forms of cartilage can be generated with individual scaffolds in a special tissue engineering container. Finally, spatial extension of [[tubule]]s derived from renal stem/progenitor cells is obtained within a perfusion container filled with an artificial interstitium made of polyester fleece. Finally, all of these containers are machined out of a special polycarbonate ([[Makrolon]]®) so that all of them can be [[autoclave]]d for multiple uses.

==Performance of perfusion culture experiments==
To maintain the necessary temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C within a perfusion culture container, a heating plate (MEDAX-Nagel, Kiel, Germany) and a cover lid (not shown) are used during performance of culture experiments over weeks (Fig. 5, 7). The transport of [[culture medium]] is best accomplished using a slowly rotating [[peristaltic pump]] (ISMATEC, IPC N8, Wertheim, Germany). It is able to deliver adjustable and exact pump rates between 0.1 and 5 ml per hour.
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 5.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 5|Figure 5: Perfusion culture set-up is working on a laboratory table. A thermo plate maintains the desired temperature of 37°C. During culture a peristaltic pump transports the medium for example with 1.25 ml/h from a storage bottle (left side) to the waste bottle (right side).]]

On the passage from the storage bottle through the perfusion culture container medium is transported along a mounted tissue carrier to provide contained cells. The exact geometrical placement of the tissue carrier within a perfusion culture container guarantees during transport of medium provision with always fresh nutrition and respiratory gas from all sides. At the same time it prevents an unphysiological accumulation of metabolic products and an overshoot of paracrine factors. To maintain for the whole culture period this controlled environment, the metabolized medium is collected in a separate waste bottle. In consequence, medium is not recirculated.

==Stabilization of pH during perfusion culture==
Normally cell culture experiments are performed in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator. Also perfusion culture experiments can be performed in such an atmosphere. However, a much better solution is the performance of perfusion culture experiments under atmospheric air on a laboratory table, since it facilitates the complete handling. However, in this case the culture medium has to be adjusted to atmospheric air.
Keeping media in a 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere within an incubator always a relatively high amount of NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is contained to maintain a constant pH between 7.2 and 7.4. If such a formulated medium is used for perfusion culture outside a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator, the pH will shift from the physiological range to much more alkaline values due to the low content of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0.3%) in atmospheric air.
For that reason any medium used for perfusion culture outside a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator has to be stabilized by reducing the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration and/or by adding biological buffers such as HEPES (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) or BUFFER ALL (Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie, München, Germany). The necessary amount can be easily determined by admixing increasing amounts of biological buffer solution to an aliquot of medium. Then the medium must equilibrate over night on a thermo plate at 37&amp;nbsp;°C under atmospheric air. For example, application of 50&amp;nbsp;mmol/l HEPES or an equivalent of BUFFER ALL (ca. 1%) to IMDM (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, GIBCO/Invitrogen) will maintain a constant pH of 7.4 throughout long term perfusion culture under atmospheric air on a laboratory table.

==Availability of oxygen in medium==
To obtain in a perfusion culture experiment a high saturation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a selected medium such as IMDM has to be transported through a gas permeable silicone tube. The use of a silicone tube provides a large surface for [[gas exchange]] by diffusion due to a thin wall (1&amp;nbsp;mm), the small inner diameter (1&amp;nbsp;mm) and its extended length (1 m). For example, analysis of IMDM (3024&amp;nbsp;mg/l NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 50&amp;nbsp;mmol/l HEPES) equilibrated against atmospheric air during a standard perfusion culture experiment shows constant partial pressures of at least 160 mmHg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [7].

==Modulation of oxygen content==
It has been shown that growing cells and tissues have very individual [[oxygen]] requirements. Due to this reason it is important that the content of oxygen can be adapted in individual perfusion culture experiments. The technical solution is a gas exchanger module containing a gas inlet and outlet (Fig. 6a). Further a spiral with a long thin-walled silicon tube for medium transport is mounted inside the module. Since the tube is highly gas-permeable, it guarantees optimal diffusion of gases between culture medium and internal atmosphere of the gas exchange module. In consequence, the desired gas atmosphere can be adjusted by a constant flow of a specific gas mixture through the module. This way the content of oxygen or any other gases can be modulated in the medium by diffusion. Applying this simple protocol it became possible to decrease the oxygen partial pressure within the transported medium during long term culture experiments under absolutely sterile conditions [7].
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 6.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 6|Figure 6: Gas exchange and gas expander module for perfusion culture. (a) A gas exchange module is used, when adaption of respiratory gas in perfusion culture has to be performed. By a gas inlet and outlet the desired gas composition is transported to a spiral of silicone tube containing the culture medium. Between the wall of the silicone tube gas is exchanged. (b) A gas expander module is used for the elimination of gas bubbles during transport of culture medium. Medium with gas bubbles is entering at the inlet and has to pass a barrier. Here the medium expands and bubbles are separated. Finally medium is leaving the container bubble-free but gas-saturated.]]

==Elimination of harmful gas bubbles==
Performing perfusion culture experiments it always has to be considered that gas bubbles are forming during slow transport of culture medium. They arise during suction of medium in the storage bottle, during transport within the tube, during distribution within the culture container and during elimination on the way to the waste bottle. Due to unknown reasons gas bubbles accumulate especially at material transitions between tubes, connectors and perfusion containers. First these gas bubbles are so small that they cannot be observed with the human eye, but during ongoing transport of culture medium they increase in size and are able to form an [[embolus]] that massively impedes medium flow. Within a culture container gas bubbles are leading to a regional shortage of medium supply and are causing breaks in the fluid continuum so that massive [[fluid pressure]] changes result. In a gradient perfusion culture container, where two media are transported at exactly the same speed, embolic effects can lead to pressure differences destroying in turn the contained epithelial barrier [5,9].

To avoid the concentration of gas bubbles within a perfusion culture experiment, a gas expander module was developed (Fig. 6b). This module removes gas bubbles from the medium during transport.  When medium is entering the gas expander module, it rises within a small reservoir and expands before it drops down a barrier. During this process gas bubbles are separated from the medium at the top of the gas expander module. In consequence, medium leaving the container is oxygen-saturated but free of gas bubbles [8,9].

To provide the luminal and basal side of the contained epithelium with nutrition and respiratory gas, two channels of a peristaltic pump transport a red and a clear medium at exactly the same rate of 1.25 ml/h from a storage bottle (left side) to the waste bottle (right side). For elimination of gas bubbles during transport of medium a gas expander module is placed before the gradient container.]]

==Broad spectrum of applications==
In the last years numerous papers were published dealing with the Minusheet perfusion culture system. The wide spectrum illustrates that the modular system was applied to generate specialized tissues in excellent cell biological quality used in tissue engineering, [[biomaterial]] research and advanced pharmaceutical [[drug toxicity]] testing. A complete list of these applications is found in the data bank ‘Proceedings in perfusion culture’ (see 'External links').
   
As demonstrated by numerous patents (DE 39 23 279, DE 42 00 446, DE 42 08 805, DE 44 43 902, DE 19530 556, DE 196 48 876 C2, DE 199 52 847 B4, US 5 190 878, US 5 316 945, US 5 665 599, J 2847669, DE 10 2005 002 938, PA 10 2004 054 125.6, PA 10 2005 001 747.9, patents pending) Will W. Minuth has invented the presented Minusheet perfusion culture system.

Numerous pilot experiments with the Minusheet perfusion culture system were performed in the last years by Lucia Denk and Will W. Minuth. The experimental work is presently focusing on the creation of an artificial polyester interstitium to repair injured renal parenchyma.

In 1992 the Minusheet perfusion culture system received the Philip Morris research award ‘Challenge of the Future’ in [[Munich]], Germany. The award was handed over by [[Henry Kissinger]], Hans Joachim Friedrichs and [[Paul Müller (biologist)|Paul Müller]].

To introduce the Minusheet perfusion culture system on the market, Katharina Lorenz-Minuth founded non-profit orientated Minucells and Minutissue Vertriebs GmbH (D-93077 Bad Abbach/Germany).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7611">The '''National Association of Teachers of Singing''' ('''NATS''') is a professional organization for [[Voice teacher|singing teachers]], and it is the largest association of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;NATS web site&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 6,500 members,&lt;ref&gt;NATS web site&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from the [[United States]].  Additional members are from [[Canada]] and over twenty-five other countries around the world including: Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siri navigates her way to Hobart|url = http://at.perthnow.com.au/link/c307140d4d63a0fc9a4208adde57fbba?domain=perthnow.com.au|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.

Driven by its mission statement and Code of Ethics, NATS offers a variety of lifelong learning experiences to its members, such as workshops, intern programs, master classes, and conferences, all beginning at the local chapter level and progressing to state, regional, and national events.

NATS also supports the growth and enrichment of its members through the publication of the [[Journal of Singing]], a scholarly journal with articles on all aspects of singing and the teaching of singing, written by distinguished scholars in their fields.  Originally titled the ''NATS Bulletin'', it has been published since the formation of the organization in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NATS was founded in 1944 in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an outgrowth of the development of the [[Music Teachers National Association]] (MTNA) in the early years of the twentieth century, a group of singing teachers incorporated the association in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] on November 27, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The first annual meeting of the new organization was held on January 7, 1908 at [[Steinway Hall]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917 it changed its name to the [[New York Singing Teachers' Association]] (NYSTA).&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 the [[Los Angeles]] Guild of Teachers of Singing was chartered, and two years later it published a Code of Ethics that was later embraced by the national organization.&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Chicago]] Council of Teachers of Singing was organized in 1930.

These local organizations began the process of becoming a national organization in the early 1940s.  During the 1944 MTNA Convention, members of the various groups met on Thursday, March 23, 1944, at the Netherland Plaza Hotel in [[Cincinnati]] to create the National Association of Teachers of Singing.&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent historical highlights are given on the organization's web site.&lt;ref&gt;Section "Who is NATS?" www.nats.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The association has a national office in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and is governed by a national Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;Names of current board members is listed on the NATS web site, www.nats.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Members belong to one of 14 national Regions, depending upon which state they reside in:
* Cal-Western Region
* Central Region
* Eastern Region
* Great Lakes Region
* Intermountain Region
* Mid-Atlantic Region
* Mid-South Region
* New England Region
* North Central Region
* Northwestern Region
* Southeastern Region
* Southern Region
* Texoma Region
* West Central Region
A Regional Governor serves as the head of each national region.  Individual states and localities also have independent chapters, with State Governors and chapter presidents leading them.

Members are invited to attend a National Conference (convention) every two years, sponsored by a different city and Region each time.  Recent conventions include:
* 2016, [[Chicago, Illinois]]
* 2014, [[Boston, Massachusetts]]
* 2012, [[Orlando, Florida]]
* 2010, [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]
* 2008, [[Nashville, Tennessee]]
* 2006, [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]
* 2004, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]
* 2002, [[San Diego, California]]
The 2018 National Conference will be held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

The National organization also provides several National Workshops each year for [[voice teacher|teachers]] to learn new ideas and teaching strategies&lt;ref&gt;Current National workshops are listed at http://www.nats.org/programs/national-workshops.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many Regional, state, and chapter meetings held at regular times throughout the year.  These are usually a workshop on a specific topic or a variety of topics, and some include masterclasses and student auditions/competitions.

==Mission statement==
"To encourage the highest standards of the vocal art and of ethical principles in the teaching of singing; and to promote vocal education and research at all levels, both for the enrichment of the general public and for the professional advancement of the talented."

==Code of Ethics==
NATS members are charged with honoring a national Code of Ethics.  This list of proper behaviors for voice teachers was established to encourage honesty and professional standards.  The current Code, written in 2006, is divided into three sections:&lt;ref&gt;The complete text is given at: http://www.nats.org/who-is-nats/code-of-ethics.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* I. Personal Ethical Standards
* II. Ethical Standards Relating to Students
* III. Ethical Standards Relating to Colleagues

==Competition==

Students of NATS members have access to one of the organization's most widely recognized activities: Student Auditions. They also have the opportunity, along with members, to compete at a national level through the National Association of Teachers of Singing Artist Awards (NATSAA). The national Artist Award program began in 1955 as the Singer of the Year Scholarship Auditions.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

The NATSAA competition is designed to assist singers prepared to launch a professional career, and to that end substantial monetary and performance prizes are offered. The competition takes place every other year, in conjunction with NATS Conferences. Preliminary competitions are held regionally, and semifinals/finals take place at the NATS Conference. 
Throughout its history the purpose of this [NATSAA] competition has been to select, through a series of elimination rounds on the district, regional, and national levels, singers whose artistry indicates that they are ready for a professional career and to encourage them toward that goal with a cash prize and the opportunity for performance engagements.

The '''normalized difference vegetation index''' ('''NDVI''') is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze [[remote sensing]] measurements, typically, but not necessarily, from a [[artificial satellite|space platform]], and assess whether the target being observed contains live green vegetation or not.

The exploration of outer space started in earnest with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957. This was the first man-made [[satellite]] orbiting the [[Earth]]. Subsequent successful launches, both in the Soviet Union (e.g., the Sputnik and [[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]] programs), and in the U.S. (e.g., the [[Explorer program]]), quickly led to the design and operation of dedicated [[Weather satellite|meteorological satellites]]. These are orbiting platforms embarking instruments specially designed to observe the Earth's atmosphere and surface with a view to improve [[weather forecasting]]. Starting in 1960, the [[TIROS]] series of satellites embarked television cameras and radiometers. This was later (1964 onwards) followed by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus]] satellites and the family of [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer]] instruments on board the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) platforms. The latter measures the reflectance of the planet in red and near-infrared bands, as well as in the thermal infrared. In parallel, NASA developed the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS), which became the precursor to the [[Landsat program]]. These early sensors had minimal spectral resolution, but tended to include bands in the red and near-infrared, which are useful to distinguish vegetation and clouds, amongst other targets.

With the launch of the first ERTS satellite – which was soon to be renamed [[Landsat 1]] – on July 23, 1972 with its MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) NASA funded a number of investigations to determine its capabilities for Earth remote sensing.  One of those early studies was directed toward examining the spring vegetation green-up and subsequent summer and fall dry-down (the so-called “vernal advancement and retrogradation”) throughout the north to south expanse of the [[Great Plains]] region of the central U.S.  This region covered a wide range of latitudes from the southern tip of [[Texas]] to the U.S.-Canada border, which resulted in a wide range of solar zenith angles at the time of the satellite observations.

The researchers for this Great Plains study (PhD student Donald Deering and his advisor Dr. Robert Hass) found that their ability to correlate, or quantify, the biophysical characteristics of the rangeland vegetation of this region from the satellite spectral signals was confounded by these differences in solar zenith angle across this strong latitudinal gradient.  With the assistance of a resident mathematician (Dr. John Schell), they studied solutions to this dilemma and subsequently developed the ratio of the difference of the red and infrared radiances over their sum as a means to adjust for or “normalize” the effects of the solar zenith angle.  Originally, they called this ratio the “Vegetation Index” (and another variant, the square-root transformation of the difference-sum ratio, the “Transformed Vegetation Index”); but as several other remote sensing researchers were identifying the simple red/infrared ratio and other spectral ratios as the “vegetation index,” they eventually began to identify the difference/sum ratio formulation as the normalized difference vegetation index.  The earliest reported use of NDVI in the Great Plains study was in 1973 by Rouse et al.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, J.W, Haas, R.H., Scheel, J.A., and Deering, D.W. (1974) 'Monitoring Vegetation Systems in the Great Plains with ERTS.' ''Proceedings, 3rd Earth Resource Technology Satellite (ERTS) Symposium'', vol. 1, p. 48-62. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740022592.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (Dr. John Rouse was the Director of the Remote Sensing Center of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] where the Great Plains study was conducted).  However, they were preceded in formulating a normalized difference spectral index by Kriegler et al. in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Kriegler, F.J., Malila, W.A., Nalepka, R.F., and Richardson, W. (1969) 'Preprocessing transformations and their effects on multispectral recognition.' ''Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment,'' p. 97-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the launch of ERTS-1 (Landsat-1), Compton Tucker of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] produced a series of early scientific journal articles describing uses of the NDVI.

Thus, NDVI was one of the most successful of many attempts to simply and quickly identify vegetated areas and their "condition," and it remains the most well-known and used index to detect live green plant canopies in multispectral remote sensing data. Once the feasibility to detect vegetation had been demonstrated, users tended to also use the NDVI to quantify the photosynthetic capacity of plant canopies. This, however, can be a rather more complex undertaking if not done properly, as is discussed below.

==Rationale==
[[Image:Par action spectrum.gif|thumb|Typical PAR action spectrum, shown beside absorption spectra for chlorophyll-A, chlorophyll-B, and carotenoids]]
Live green plants absorb solar radiation in the [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (PAR) spectral region, which they use as a source of energy in the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Leaf cells have also evolved to re-emit solar radiation in the near-infrared spectral region (which carries approximately half of the total incoming solar energy), because the photon energy at wavelengths longer than about 700 nanometers is too large to synthesize organic molecules. A strong absorption at these wavelengths would only result in overheating the plant and possibly damaging the tissues. Hence, live green plants appear relatively dark in the PAR and relatively bright in the near-infrared.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, David M. (1980) ''Biophysical Ecology'', Springer-Verlag, New York, 611 p.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, clouds and snow tend to be rather bright in the red (as well as other visible wavelengths) and quite dark in the near-infrared.
The pigment in plant leaves, chlorophyll, strongly absorbs visible light (from 0.4 to 0.7&amp;nbsp;µm) for use in photosynthesis. The cell structure of the leaves, on the other hand, strongly reflects near-infrared light (from 0.7 to 1.1&amp;nbsp;µm). The more leaves a plant has, the more these wavelengths of light are affected, respectively.
Since early instruments of Earth Observation, such as [[NASA]]'s ERTS and [[NOAA]]'s AVHRR, acquired data in visible and near-infrared, it was natural to exploit the strong differences in plant reflectance to determine their spatial distribution in these satellite images.

The NDVI is calculated from these individual measurements as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NDVI}=\frac{(\mbox{NIR}-\mbox{Red})}{(\mbox{NIR}+\mbox{Red})}&lt;/math&gt;

where red and NIR stand for the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the red (visible) and near-infrared regions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|title=Measuring Vegetation}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spectral reflectances are themselves ratios of the reflected over the incoming radiation in each spectral band individually, hence they take on values between 0.0 and 1.0. By design, the NDVI itself thus varies between -1.0 and +1.0.  It should be noted that NDVI is functionally, but not linearly, equivalent to the simple infrared/red ratio (NIR/VIS).  The advantage of NDVI over a simple infrared/red ratio is therefore generally limited to any possible linearity of its functional relationship with vegetation properties (e.g. biomass).  The simple ratio (unlike NDVI) is always positive, which may have practical advantages, but it also has a mathematically infinite range (0 to infinity), which can be a practical disadvantage as compared to NDVI.  Also in this regard, note that the VIS term in the numerator of NDVI only scales the result, thereby creating negative values. NDVI is functionally ''and linearly'' equivalent to the ratio NIR / (NIR+VIS), which ranges from 0 to 1 and is thus never negative nor limitless in range.&lt;ref&gt;Crippen, R.E. (1990)  'Calculating the vegetation index faster,'  ''Remote Sensing of Environment'', '''34''',  71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the most important concept in the understanding of the NDVI algebraic formula is that, despite its name, it is a transformation of a spectral ratio (NIR/VIS), and it has no functional relationship to a spectral difference (NIR-VIS).

In general, if there is much more reflected radiation in near-infrared wavelengths than in visible wavelengths, then the vegetation in that pixel is likely to be dense and may contain some type of forest. Subsequent work has shown that the NDVI is directly related to the photosynthetic capacity and hence energy absorption of plant canopies.&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, P. J. (1985) 'Canopy reflectance, photosynthesis, and transpiration',  ''International Journal of Remote Sensing'', '''6''', 1335-1372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myneni, R. B., F. G. Hall, P.J. Sellers, and A.L. Marshak (1995) 'The interpretation of spectral vegetation indexes', ''IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'', '''33''', 481-486.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the index admits to go from -1 to 1, even in more densely populated [[Urban area|urban areas]] the value of normal NDVI is positive, although closer to zero. Negative values are more likely to be disturbed in the atmosphere and some specific [[Material|materials]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sistemas.uepg.br/producao/pro-reitorias/propesp/pesquisa/pibic/arquivos/bolsista/relatorio_final/relatorio/16005703@uepg.br/2017/relatorio_final.pdf|title=Urban Climate: surface temperature and NDVI an analysis of influences in Ponta Grossa-PR|last=Kubaski|first=Kauan Mateus|date=|website=|publisher=[[State University of Ponta Grossa|UEPG]] (Pro-rector of Research and Post-graduation-PROPESP)|language=pt-br|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/72Kk9SpH6|archive-date=September 10, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance and limitations==
[[File:NDVI 2017-09-10.png|left|thumb|The surrounding fields and water bodies like the dam to the northeast help to mask with high values in [[Ponta Grossa]], [[southern Brazil]]]]
It can be seen from its mathematical definition that the NDVI of an area containing a dense vegetation canopy will tend to positive values (say 0.3 to 0.8) while clouds and snow fields will be characterized by negative values of this index. Other targets on Earth visible from space include

* free standing water (e.g., oceans, seas, lakes and rivers) which have a rather low reflectance in both spectral bands (at least away from shores) and thus result in very low positive or even slightly negative NDVI values,
* soils which generally exhibit a near-infrared spectral reflectance somewhat larger than the red, and thus tend to also generate rather small positive NDVI values (say 0.1 to 0.2).

In addition to the simplicity of the algorithm and its capacity to broadly distinguish vegetated areas from other surface types, the NDVI also has the advantage of compressing the size of the data to be manipulated by a factor 2 (or more), since it replaces the two spectral bands by a single new field (eventually coded on 8 bits instead of the 10 or more bits of the original data).

The NDVI has been widely used in applications for which it was not originally designed. Using the NDVI for quantitative assessments (as opposed to qualitative surveys as indicated above) raises a number of issues that may seriously limit the actual usefulness of this index if they are not properly addressed.{{cn|date=July 2016}} The following subsections review some of these issues.

* Mathematically, the sum and the difference of the two spectral channels contain the same information as the original data, but the difference alone (or the normalized difference) carries only part of the initial information. Whether the missing information is relevant or valuable is for the user to judge, but it is important to understand that an NDVI product carries only a fraction of the information available in the original spectral reflectance data.
*[[File:NDVI.jpg|thumb|Generated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the satellite images]]Users of NDVI have tended to estimate a large number of vegetation properties from the value of this index. Typical examples include the [[Leaf Area Index]], [[biomass]], chlorophyll concentration in leaves, plant productivity, fractional vegetation cover, accumulated rainfall, etc. Such relations are often derived by correlating space-derived NDVI values with ground-measured values of these variables. This approach raises further issues related to the spatial scale associated with the measurements, as satellite sensors always measure radiation quantities for areas substantially larger than those sampled by field instruments. Furthermore, it is of course illogical to claim that all these relations hold at once, because that would imply that all of these environmental properties would be directly and unequivocally related between themselves.
* The reflectance measurements should be relative to the same area and be acquired simultaneously. This may not be easy to achieve with instruments that acquire different spectral channels through different cameras or focal planes. Mis-registration of the spectral images may lead to substantial errors and unusable results.

Also, the calculation of the NDVI value turns out to be sensitive to a number of perturbing factors including

* Atmospheric effects: The actual composition of the atmosphere (in particular with respect to water vapor and aerosols) can significantly affect the measurements made in space. Hence, the latter may be misinterpreted if these effects are not properly taken into account (as is the case when the NDVI is calculated directly on the basis of raw measurements).
* Clouds: Deep (optically thick) clouds may be quite noticeable in satellite imagery and yield characteristic NDVI values that ease their screening. However, thin clouds (such as the ubiquitous cirrus), or small clouds with typical linear dimensions smaller than the diameter of the area actually sampled by the sensors, can significantly contaminate the measurements. Similarly, cloud shadows in areas that appear clear can affect NDVI values and lead to misinterpretations.  These considerations are minimized by forming composite images from daily or near-daily images.&lt;ref&gt;Holben, B. N. (1986)'Characteristics of Maximum-Value Composite Images from Temporal AVHRR Data','' International Journal of Remote Sensing'', '''7(11)''',  1417-1434.&lt;/ref&gt;  Composite NDVI images have led to a large number of new vegetation applications where the NDVI or photosynthetic capacity varies over time.
* Soil effects: Soils tend to darken when wet, so that their reflectance is a direct function of water content. If the spectral response to moistening is not exactly the same in the two spectral bands, the NDVI of an area can appear to change as a result of soil moisture changes (precipitation or evaporation) and not because of vegetation changes.
* Anisotropic effects: All surfaces (whether natural or man-made) reflect light differently in different directions, and this form of anisotropy is generally spectrally dependent, even if the general tendency may be similar in these two spectral bands. As a result, the value of NDVI may depend on the particular anisotropy of the target and on the angular geometry of illumination and observation at the time of the measurements, and hence on the position of the target of interest within the swath of the instrument or the time of passage of the satellite over the site. This is particularly crucial in analyzing AVHRR data since the orbit of the NOAA platforms tended to drift in time. At the same time, the use of composite NDVI images minimizes these considerations and has led to global time series NDVI data sets spanning more than 25 years.
* Spectral effects: Since each sensor has its own characteristics and performances, in particular with respect to the position, width and shape of the spectral bands, a single formula like NDVI yields different results when applied to the measurements acquired by different instruments.

For these reasons, the NDVI should be used with great caution. In any quantitative application that necessitates a given level of accuracy, all the perturbing factors that could result in errors or uncertainties of that order of magnitude should be explicitly taken into account; this may require extensive processing based on ancillary data and other sources of information.  More recent versions of NDVI datasets have attempted to account for these complicating factors through processing.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

A number of derivatives and alternatives to NDVI have been proposed in the scientific literature to address these limitations, including the Perpendicular Vegetation Index,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, A. J. and C. L. Wiegand (1977) 'Distinguishing vegetation from soil background information', ''Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing'', '''43''', 1541-1552.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index]],&lt;ref&gt;Huete, A. R. (1988)'A soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)', ''Remote Sensing of Environment'', '''25''', 53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Y. J. and D. Tanre (1992) 'Atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) for EOS-MODIS', in  'Proc. IEEE Int. Geosci. and Remote Sensing Symp. '92'', IEEE, New York, 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Environment Monitoring Index.&lt;ref&gt;Pinty, B. and M. M. Verstraete (1992) 'GEMI: A non-linear index to monitor global vegetation from satellites', ''Vegetatio'', '''101''', 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these attempted to include intrinsic correction(s) for one or more perturbing factors. It is not until the mid-1990s, however, that a new generation of algorithms were proposed to estimate directly the biogeophysical variables of interest (e.g., the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation or [[FAPAR]]), taking advantage of the enhanced performance and characteristics of modern sensors (in particular their multispectral and multiangular capabilities) to take all the perturbing factors into account.  In spite of many possible perturbing factors upon the NDVI, it remains a valuable quantitative vegetation monitoring tool when the photosynthetic capacity of the land surface needs to be studied at the appropriate spatial scale for various phenomena.

In [[architecture]], the [[latin]] term '''''opus''''' ("work) is a word that generically indicates various techniques of constructing [[buildings]] that were in use in [[ancient Rome]]. Usually the word ''opus'' is not used alone in building descriptions, but is paired with specific attributes (''incertum'', ''latericium'', etc.), whose purpose is to show precisely the building technique that was used (i.e. ''[[opus incertum]]'', ''[[opus latericium]]'', ''[[opus reticulatum]]'', ''[[opus mixtum]]'', etcetera).

'''Pickup artists''' ('''PUA''') – also known as '''pick-up artists''', '''seduction community''', or '''pickup community''' – is a movement of men whose goal is [[seduction]] and [[sexual selection|sexual success]] with and access to women. Members of the community are often referred to as pickup artists (PUA). The community exists through Internet [[newsletter]]s and [[weblog]]s, marketing (e.g. [[banner ad]]s, seminars, one-on-one coaching), forums and groups, as well as over a hundred local clubs, known as "lairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/winging-it/2007/01/28/1169919210771.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Winging it |author= |date=29 January 2007 |work=The Age  |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The modern seduction movement dates to 1970, with the publication of ''How To Pick Up Girls!'' by [[Eric Weber (director)|Eric Weber]], credited as the first modern pickup artist.{{sfn|Strauss|2005|page=430}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Weber | first=Eric | title=How to Pick Up Girls!: Discover Exactly how to Meet Beautiful Women.

|publisher=Symphony Press, Incorporated | year=1970 | isbn=978-0-91409400-5 |pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one self-described "picker-upper of women" preceding Weber was rational emotive psychotherapist [[Albert Ellis]], who wrote ''The Art of Erotic Seduction'', a how-to guide for men that encouraged them to meet women through the "pickup", with Roger Conway in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Albert|last2=Conway|first2=Roger|title=The art of erotic seduction|date=1967|publisher=Lyle Stuart|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis claimed he had been practicing seducing female strangers since he overcame his fear of approaching them through "in-vivo desensitization" in Bronx Botanical Garden in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Albert|last2=Joffe-Ellis|first2=Debbie|title=All out! : an autobiography|date=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=9781591024521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s and 1980s saw independent authors and teachers, but no organized community.

The seduction community itself originated with [[Ross Jeffries]] and his students. In the late 1980s, Jeffries taught workshops, promoted a collection of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP) techniques called "speed seduction" (SS), and published a short book of his techniques, ''How to Get the Women You Desire into Bed''.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"&gt;{{cite news|title=He Aims!

In 1994, Lewis De Payne, then a student of Jeffries, founded the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.* hierarchy|alt]].seduction.fast (ASF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastseduction.com/asf-faq.shtml|title=alt.seduction.fast FAQ and history|author=Jay Valens|date=3 March 2002|accessdate=16 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524223047/http://www.fastseduction.com/asf-faq.shtml|archivedate=24 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which marked the birth of the community per se.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots" /&gt; This then spawned a network of other Internet discussion forums, email lists, blogs, and sites where seduction techniques could be exchanged.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.08.06/nlp-0606.html |title=Working Overtime on the Seduction Line |author=Bill Forman |date=8 February 2006 |work=Metroactive |publisher=Metro Publishing Inc |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original alt.seduction.fast became overwhelmed with [[spam (electronic)|spam]], and a group called "Learn the Skills Corporation" developed a moderated alternative known as "Moderated ASF" (commonly "mASF").{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During the same period, in the late 1990s, Clifford Lee began his ''Cliff's List Seduction Letter'' as a central independent voice of the community.&lt;ref name="Toronto Sun"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2008/12/31/7891486.html |title=Disgraced doctor is T.O's seduction guru |author=Jenny Yuen |date=13 April 2008 |work=Toronto Sun |publisher=Sun Media |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other seduction teachers emerged with competing methods, and became known within this community as "seduction gurus" or "gurus".&lt;ref name="Sex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/071405/news2.html |title=Seduction for Dummies |author=Kristian Gravenor |date=14 July 2005 |work=Montreal Mirror |publisher=Communications Gratte-Ciel Ltée |accessdate=26 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716235052/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/071405/news2.html |archivedate=16 July 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful seduction/pick up book was a manual by [[Tariq Nasheed]] (also known as King Flex) entitled ''The Art Of Mackin'', which was released in 2000. Tariq Nasheed went on to write several other seduction/dating books such as ''The Mack Within: The Holy Book Of Game''  and ''The Elite Way:10 Rules Men Must Know In Order To Deal With Women''.

The community was brought to greater mainstream awareness with the 1999 drama film ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', in which [[Tom Cruise]] portrayed a charismatic yet embittered and emotionally troubled pickup guru who was loosely modeled on Ross Jeffries.&lt;ref&gt;Konow, David (January/February 2000). "PTA Meeting: An Interview with Paul Thomas Anderson". ''Creative Screenwriting''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, journalist [[Neil Strauss]] wrote ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]]'', an exposé of the seduction community. ''The Game'' reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List]], and made known pickup and seduction techniques to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-04-09/news/cock-and-awe-st-louis-pickup-artists-rule-the-roost/3 |title=Cock and Awe |author=Aimee Levitt |date=9 April 2008 |work=Riverfront Times |publisher= |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community was further publicized with the television show ''[[The Pick-up Artist (TV series)|The Pick Up Artist]]'' (2007–2008) on [[VH1]].

Within the community, ''seduction lairs'' are underground meeting groups for men devoted to the study of [[seduction]] as it is taught in the seduction community. Lairs first began as study groups soon after Ross Jeffries released his first products and began teaching sometime in the early 90s.&lt;ref name="eyeweekly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/features/article/22843 |title=Portrait of a Pickup Artist |author=Alex Molotkow |date=2 April 2008 |work=Eye Weekly |publisher=Star Media Group |accessdate=26 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207223645/http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/features/article/22843 |archivedate=7 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of lairs now exist worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallaspua.com/lairs.htm |title=Lair List |author= |date= |work=Lair List |publisher=Dallas PUA Society |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "lair" typically involves two elements: an online forum and group meetings. These elements are used as resources for men who want to learn to become well-versed in how to successfully attract women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5jofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=adAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5923,3535197&amp;dq=seduction-community+lairs&amp;hl=en |title=From Chump to Pickup Artist via 'The Community' |author=Neil Strauss |date=25 January 2004 |work= |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==
Supporters of this community typically believe that the conventional dating advice for men is flawed. For example, they reject the notion that men should attempt to woo women by spending money on them (e.g. buying drinks, presents, jewelry), calling it ''[[supplication]]''.

Many members of the seduction community work on their "game" (seduction skills) by improving their understanding of psychology, their confidence and self-esteem (termed "inner game"), and their social skills and physical appearance (physical fitness, fashion sense, grooming) ("outer game"). Many members of the community believe that one's "game" is refined through regular practice,&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20050829_111329_111329 |title=Q&amp;A with Author Neil Strauss |author=George Lianne |date=29 August 2005 |work=Maclean's |publisher=Kenneth Whyte |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619125551/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20050829_111329_111329 |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the idea that the abilities needed to interact in this way with women can be improved.

The seduction community has a unique set of [[acronym]]s and [[jargon]] for describing male–female dynamics and social interaction.&lt;ref name="Sex" /&gt;  For example, "average frustrated chump" (AFC) is a term coined by Ross Jeffries to describe males who are typically clueless and incompetent with women.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots" /&gt; "Alpha-Male Of the Group" (AMOG) is a reference to a competing male, who is usually either befriended by the PUA, or, if necessary, ridiculed.

The community claims that these concepts derive from scientific disciplines, such as the concept of [[social proof]] from the psychology of [[Social influence|influence]], and various concepts from [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] (such as the term "[[Alpha (biology)|alpha male]]").

== Pickup artist==
A pickup artist (commonly abbreviated PUA) is a person who practices finding, attracting, and [[seduction|seducing]] sexual partners. Such a person purportedly abides by a certain system deemed effective by that community in their attempts to seduce partners.

The use of ''pickup'' in this context, [[slang]] for making a casual acquaintance with a stranger in anticipation of sexual relations, was popularized by the 1970 book ''How to Pick Up Girls'' by Eric Weber,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | edition = 1st | title = How to Pick Up Girls | first = Eric | last = Weber | publisher = Symphony Press | place = Tenafly, NJ, USA | year = 1970}},&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''Pick-Up Times'', a short-lived 1970s magazine, and the 1987 semi-autobiographical romantic comedy ''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pick-up Artist]]'', written and directed by [[James Toback]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss (2005), pp. 124, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works of pickup artist culture include [[Neil Strauss]]'s book, ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]]'', and the 2007 [[VH1]] [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Pickup Artist (TV series)|The Pickup Artist]]'', starring the pickup artist [[Erik von Markovik|Mystery]]. The pickup artist [[Roosh V]] has self-published 14 books describing techniques for seducing women.&lt;ref name="citypaper"&gt;Jule Banville, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/08/12/blogger-stud-living-in-dads-basement-writing-second-book-on-how-to-get-laid/ "Blogger Stud Living in Dad’s Basement, Writing Second Book on How to Get Laid"], "Washington City Paper", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', such books are the "cash cow" of the pickup industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lu |first=Peter |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/09/20/greatest_pickup_artists_of_their_generation/ |title=Simple Pickup: Are these the greatest pickup artists of all time? |publisher=Salon.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term pickup artist is also associated with the seduction community, a [[heterosexual]] male [[subculture]] which strives to improve sexual and romantic abilities with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-game-and-real-social-dynamics-is-the-seduction-community-pushing-the-idea-that-no-just-means-not-8463333.html|title=The Game and Real Social dynamics: Is the seduction community pushing the idea that ‘no’ just means ‘not yet’?|last=Bloodworth|first=James|date=2013-01-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Routines and gambits are developed to stimulate purported "attraction switches", often combined with techniques derived from an alleged form of hypnosis called [[neuro-linguistic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/relationships/6987982/Pick-up-artists-online-seduction-and-dating-tips.html |title=Pick-up artists, online seduction and dating tips |author=Tom Chivers |date=14 January 2010 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location = UK | accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members aim to improve their seductive capabilities through the development of various lifestyles. The culture surrounding pickup has spawned an entire industry servicing those who want to improve their social and seduction skills with consultations and in-field training.&lt;ref&gt;Mountford, J.

Pickup artists receive mixed to negative responses from the press and general public, with many regarding both the practice and theory as immoral, sexist and ineffective. In 2014, following widely supported public petitions, U.S.-based PUA speaker and instructor [[Julien Blanc]] was denied entry to both the United Kingdom and Australia after he published YouTube videos explaining and demonstrating behaviors such as grabbing women by the throat, and forcing their heads towards his crotch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Gail|title='Dating coach' Julien Blanc kicked out of Australia for crude 'pick-up' schtick|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/10/dating-coach-julien-blanc-kicked-out-of-australia-for-his-controversial-tactics/|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=Washington Post|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julien Blanc: UK denies visa to 'pick-up artist'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30119100|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=BBC News|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Megan|title=Is This the Most Hated Man in the World?|url=http://time.com/3578387/julien-blanc-feminism-real-social-dynamics/|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=Time|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup artists have also been parodied, as in the March 2011 ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]''. [[BBC Radio 1]] debated [[Neil Strauss]]' ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'' on many shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = The BBC | title = Radio 1 | location = UK |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gq42l}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup is often divided into different styles, referred to as "outer game", "inner game", "direct game", and "indirect game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist|title=My Life as a Pickup Artist|date=28 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140127012818/http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist|archivedate=27 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Petra Boynton has stated that there is "no evidence of effectiveness" for any claims of pickup artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/6987982/Pick-up-artists-online-seduction-and-dating-tips.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Tom | last=Chivers | title=Pick-up artists, online seduction and dating tips | date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by Nathan Oesch of the [[University of Oxford]] Department of Experimental Psychology, however, confirmed attraction and seduction principles, as described in Strauss' books on the subject, do have a factual basis in social, physiological and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name="epjournal.net"&gt;Oesch, Nathan, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130404041916/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/EP10899909.pdf The Dating Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Emerging Science of Human Courtship]", ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]'', 2012. 10(5): 899-909&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite primarily being a male movement, there are also female pick-up artists who use similar techniques to seduce men.&lt;ref name="femaleartist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/it-happened-to-me-i-was-a-female-pick-up-artist|title=It Happened To Me: I'm A Female Pick-Up Artist Who Studied Under Neil Strauss and Mystery|date=November 21, 2012|author=Leigh, Arden|work=xoJane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==

There are a variety of PUA "schools of thought" which promote numerous different methods. These range from approaches that are very indirect, and which stress starting with casual conversation before building into a flirt, to methods in which attraction is communicated very openly and directly. Most PUAs acknowledge the distinction between so-called "inner game" and "outer game", where the former relates to techniques directed towards increasing one's self-confidence and mindset, whilst the latter are about actual interaction with real people. Inner game may involve taking greater care in one's looks and presentation, identifying and neutralising self-defeating mental habits (also known as "limiting beliefs"), and developing mental routines to build confidence. Outer game involves actual interaction with individuals and groups of people, from body language to conversation. The pick-up artist may frequent a self-help group and converse with MRA's (men's rights activists), incels (involuntary celibates), and other PUA's to discuss seduction tips.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.avclub.com/the-matrix-couldn-t-dream-up-the-internet-of-2018-1822353087&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', [[Neil Strauss]] documents various practices that occur in the seduction community.  Members of the community believe in achieving success with women through putatively scientific and [[Empiricism|empirical]] means, rather than by relying on good looks or intuitive instinct, or by following societal courtship conventions. The practice of going out with the purpose of meeting women is known as "sarging", a term coined by [[Ross Jeffries]], after his cat "Sarge". A pickup artist can "sarge" alone, or with a [[Wingman (social)|wingman]].&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/pickup-artists-the-girliest-of-men/59578/ |title=Pickup Artists: The Girliest of Men |author=Megan McArdle |date=12 July 2010|work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffries employed [[Neuro-linguistic_programming]] techniques for the purposes of seduction, although Strauss claims in ''The Game'' that NLP was quickly rendered obsolete by the rise of techniques based on social dynamics, particularly [[Erik von Markovik]]'s "Mystery Method". The Mystery Method describes seduction as a linear process involving three stages (establishing attraction, building comfort, and seduction) each of which involves a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Erik von Markovik, "The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed", St Martin's Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Negging]]", one of von Markovik's most famous and controversial techniques, has been described as the practice of giving a woman a backhanded compliment such as "nice nails – are they real?", to weaken her confidence and therefore render her more vulnerable to seduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/cockblocked-by-redistribution|title = Cockblocked by Redistribution: A Pick-up Artist in Denmark|last = Baker|first = Katie J.M.|date = Fall 2013|work = Dissent Magazine|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that depriving a woman of obsequious validation and attention will influence her to seek it from the man who negs her.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap, S. G. "[http://thepointmag.com/2010/examined-life/love-in-the-age-of-the-pickup-artist Love in the Age of the Pickup Artist]", ''The Point'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss refers to negs as "disqualifiers" in his book [[Rules of the Game]], emphasizing that the primary purpose of using a neg is not to put a woman down, but for a man to disqualify himself as a potential suitor, thereby allowing for interaction to start on less loaded terms. [[Conor Friedersdorf]] lambasted the use of negging by pick-up artists, but admitted that, based on his observations, negging did appear to be effective at generating attraction from some women.&lt;ref name="Some I Insult, Some I Let Go"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/07/dating-and-deception/198480/ Dating and Deception]", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/07/-the-neg-contd/198419/ "The Neg" Cont'd]", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 24 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[http://theamericanscene.com/2009/08/08/stop-negging-them-on#comment Stop Negging Them On!]", ''The American Scene'', 8 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pawning" is trading or discarding an unwanted woman as proof of the PUA's own social value, and "going caveman" is escalating physical contact while reducing verbal contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/world/elliot-rodger-and-the-creepy-world-of-the-pickup-artist-20140528-zrqg1.html|title = Elliot Rodger and the creepy world of the pick-up artist|last = Koziol|first = Michael|date = 28 May 2014|work = Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One constellation of PUA techniques, called "Last Minute Resistance" tactics (LMR tactics), is designed to convince a woman to have sex after she has indicated that she doesn't want to. This includes tactics from those which are mutually beneficial – such as being okay with the woman being on her period – to "callous manipulation" and rape.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201206/interview-pickup-artist-chaser-clarisse-thorn|title = Interview with Pickup Artist Chaser Clarisse Thorn|last = Kaufman|first = Scott Barry|date = 1 June 2012|work = Psychology Today|accessdate = 9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaching and opening ===
Pickup artists generally assume the mindset that men should lead and initiate contacts and plans in general in order to be more attractive, and that women will not generally initiate contact although they want men to, requiring men to begin any interaction by ''approaching'' them, but many have also cultivated a sensitivity to direct and indirect signals of [[Proteans|possible sexual interest]].

Members of the seduction community often practice approaching and opening repetitively; some have done thousands of approaches. Strauss describes a pickup artist who did 125 approaches in one day.&lt;ref name=TheGame298&gt;Strauss, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Mystery Method"&lt;ref&gt;Erik von Markovik, "The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed", St Martin's Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; encourages approaching groups of strangers, starting indirect conversations, and giving attention to all members of the group without initiating conversation with the "target" until attraction has been established.

Feminist [[BDSM]] writer and activist Clarisse Thorn, author of ''Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser|Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser: Long Interviews with Hideous Men'', criticizes the PUA community as frequently "absurd and sexist", "pushy and problematic" and encouraging adversarial gender roles. However, she also argues that PUA tactics are worth understanding because they are not unique to the PUA community, but instead represent society-wide beliefs and patterns and strategies of human sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other dating coaches, such as Sebastian Harris, publicly speak against the misogynistic tendencies of the seduction community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalseducer.com/dear-woman-hater/|title=Dear Woman Hater|last=Harris|first=Sebastian|date=1 May 2016|website=Global Seducer|publisher=Sebastian Harris|access-date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UCLA Center for the Study of Women]] argues that PUA culture is misogynist, and exists on a continuum of sexist behaviours and attitudes that includes rape and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5tw6h8nk|title = From Misogyny to Murder: Everyday Sexism and Femicide in Cross-Cultural Context|last = Rodríguez|first = Gilda|date = December 2010|journal = CSW Update|accessdate = 9 June 2014|doi = |publisher = UCLA Center for the Study of Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional [[dating coach]], radio personality and [[self help]] book author [[Alan Roger Currie (American author)|Alan Roger Currie]] has frequently criticized the seduction community and many of the misleading and manipulative tactics espoused by many of the more popular pickup artists.  Currie is specifically critical of men giving women the misleading impression that they are interested in engaging in a long-term, emotionally profound, monogamous romantic relationship when those men know in reality that they are really seeking to engage in some form of short-term, non-monogamous, [[casual sex]] with these same women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/modeone/2012/07/13/pros-cons-of-approaching-women-directly-vs-indirectly | title=The Pros and Cons of approaching women using 'direct game' vs. 'indirect game'| website=[[BlogTalkRadio]] | publisher=Mode One Multimedia, Inc. | host=Upfront &amp; Straightforward | date=12 July 2012 | time=| access-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Response to the seduction community has been varied; it has been called [[misogyny|misogynistic]], and a review of ''The Game'' in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' characterized the community as "a puerile cult of sexual conquest", and calls its tactics "sinister" and "pathetic".&lt;ref name="Ganahl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,1577189,00.html |title=Girls, if you see this man, run a mile |author=Rafael Behr |date=25 September 2005 |work=The Observer |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the review, "if women in the book are sometimes treated as a commodity, they come out looking better than the men, who can be downright loathsome—and show themselves eventually to be pretty sad, dysfunctional characters".

[[Feminists]] tend to be critical of the seduction community. [[Beatrix Campbell]] has stated that ''The Game'' "sexually objectifies women", arguing that "Nowhere from its description do you get a sense of men being helped to be human in an easy and agreeable way...it's not about having any rapport or relationship... the only thing that will help them in relationships is [[empathy]] and liking women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Andrew |url=http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/news/article308631.ece |title=Passing on 'foolproof' pick-up tips.

According to an article in ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', some feminists believe that pickup "isn't just cheesy; it's offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Dave |url=http://eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.13.05/arts/artsweek.html |title=Get laid, get fucked |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626123314/http://eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.13.05/arts/artsweek.html |archivedate=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article cites a proposal put forward by a feministblogs.org writer as an alternative to the formula used by expert PUAs: "Shake my hand. [Say] 'Hi, my name is ...' Treat me like a human being. Avoid seeing women as conquests and men as competition."

An article in the ''[[Houston Press]]'' claimed that the seduction community "isn't the lechfest it might sound like". The article quotes the webmaster of confidentup.com defending the community: "It's no more [[deception|deceptive]] than [[push-up bra]]s or [[Stiletto heel|heels]] or going to the gym to work out...This isn't just a game of words and seduction, it's an overall life improvement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Malisow |title=Keeping Score |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2005-06-02/news/keeping-score/2 |work=[[Houston Press]] |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss says, "I really think all of these routines and manipulations are just a way for a guy to get his foot in the door so that if a woman connects with him, she can still choose him," and that seduction techniques "can be used for good or evil!"&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dark arts"/&gt; He argues that "women are incredibly intuitive—the creepy guys with bad intentions don't do nearly as well as the guys who love and respect women".&lt;ref name="Ganahl"/&gt;

Several writers describe observing men in the seduction community first-hand. Some women recount experiences with men they believed to be pickup artists who tried to "pick them up", and some men recount trying out pickup techniques. Catherine Townsend, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', describes a negative experience with a man she believed was a pickup artist and used a lot of "negs" on her: "The problem is that some guys clearly don't know when to quit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Townsend |first=Catherine |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article354165.ece |title=Sleeping Around |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205064115/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article354165.ece |archivedate=5 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[San Francisco Magazine]]'' recounts the experience the blogger "Dolly", who is the author of the popular sex blog ''The Truth about Cocks and Dolls'', had with the seduction community. According to the article, Dolly was:

But after she met more, including two from San Francisco, she wrote a letter to the ''Village Voice'' defending them, in response to the paper’s negative article on the subject in March. “PUAs try to create a fun, positive, and exciting experience for the woman,” Dolly wrote. “The credo many follow is ‘Leave her better than you found her.’ What’s so bad about that? That they want to get laid, too? Guess what? Guys have always wanted sex and will continue to want sex.

After spending three days immersed in a Mystery Method Corp (now Love Systems) seminar, [[Gene Weingarten]] expressed his uneasiness about "a step by step tutorial for men in how to pick up women, make them comfortable in your presence, and bed them, ideally within seven hours of your first meeting" and wondered aloud, "Is there something inherently wrong with the notion of seduction as a classroom-taught skill, complete with a long hierarchy of 'lines' that work, seemingly spontaneous topics of conversation that are anything but spontaneous, tricks for seeming 'vulnerable', and tips on how to behave so as to deliver subtle but effective nonverbal inducements to intimacy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/community/groups/index.html?plckForumPage=ForumDiscussion&amp;plckDiscussionId=Cat:a70e3396-6663-4a8d-ba19-e44939d3c44fForum:a8bc6fd8-cf9f-43ca-99a4-05fdb4342697Discussion:86aaac5a-5b7f-4a26-9cb9-03b94121ca42 |title=The Gene Pool: Sex and Deceit |author=Gene Weingarten |date=5 March 2008 |work=The Washington Post |publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an article for the ''Times Online'', [[Hugo Rifkind]] participated in a seminar by Neil Strauss. Rifkind describes initially struggling with seduction techniques, eventually learning to attract women's interest, and then feeling guilty. Rifkind writes, "After a little more practice, my 'game' is improving dramatically. I can open with fluency, and there's an injection of confidence which comes from knowing exactly what you are going to say next." When he attracts a woman's attention, "she is—quite honestly—looking at me like I'm the most fascinating person she's ever met. As a human being and, perhaps more crucially, as somebody with a girlfriend, I feel like absolute scum."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Commercialization ==
The media attention and rapid growth of the seduction community has led to commercialization and competition.  Teachers of seduction tactics sell workshops, books, [[e-books]], [[DVDs]], and CDs over the internet.  In ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', Strauss describes the competition between seduction gurus.  In The Journal, teaching of these seduction methods is shown by way of 50+ examples.

==Academic research==
An academic paper on the community, published in 2012 by Eric C. Hendriks in the journal ''[[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore|Cultural Analysis]]'', details the value system guiding successful members of the seduction community based on an international study including participant observation of bootcamp and "lair" meetings in Germany. The article argues that the values of successful practitioners of the "Venusian arts" are informed by an intertwining of "hedonistic goals and diffused forms of [[Inner-worldly asceticism|innerworldly asceticism]]". According to Hendricks, the hedonistic goal of sexual satisfaction interacts in a complex fashion with a set of "disciplinarian and ascetic values", and the author stresses that these disciplinarian and ascetic values are central to the value system of performant practitioners, even though the marketing of seduction gurus often promises an easy, effortless "quick fix".&lt;ref name="socrates.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~culturalanalysis/volume11/vol11_Hendriks.html|title=Cultural Analysis, Volume 11, 2012: Ascetic Hedonism / Eric C. Hendriks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Nathan Oesch of the [[University of Oxford]] Department of Experimental Psychology confirmed attraction and seduction principles, as described in Strauss' books on the subject, do have a factual basis in social, physiological and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="epjournal.net"/&gt;

Andrew King's cultural history of the pickup artist in the journal ''Sexuality &amp; Culture'' argues that, as a genre, the growth of PUA philosophy parallels the rise of feminism in academic and popular culture—and in some ways can be seen as a critique of its limitations, particularly the idea of gender egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Andrew Stephen |title=Feminism’s Flip Side: A Cultural History of the Pickup Artist |journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture |date=2 November 2017 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=299–315 |doi=10.1007/s12119-017-9468-0 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-017-9468-0 |accessdate=26 June 2018 |language=en |issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">A '''rare species''' is a group of [[organisms]] that are very uncommon, scarce, or infrequently encountered. This designation may be applied to either a plant or animal [[taxon]], and is distinct from the term ''[[endangered species|endangered]]'' or ''[[threatened species|threatened]].'' Designation of a rare species may be made by an official body, such as a national government, state, or province. The term more commonly appears without reference to specific criteria. The [[IUCN]] does not normally make such designations, but may use the term in scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/assessment-process|title=Assessment Process|website=www.iucnredlist.org|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rarity rests on a specific species being represented by a small number of organisms worldwide, usually fewer than 10,000. However, a species having a very narrow [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] range or [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitat]] also influences the concept.&lt;ref&gt;R.MacNally and G.W.Brown, ''[[Reptile]]s and Habitat Fragmentation in the Box-ironbush Forests of Central Victoria, [[Australia]]: Predicting Compositional Change and Faunal Nested-ness'', [[Oecologia]] 128:116-125 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prendergast|first=J.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature uses the term "rare" as a designation for species found in isolated geographical locations. They are not endangered but classified as "at risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/rare-species|title=Rare Species - Dictionary definition of Rare Species {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/node/29228|title=IUCN - A brief history|date=2017-10-06|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A species may be endangered or vulnerable, but not considered rare if it has a large, dispersed population. Rare species are generally considered threatened because a [[small population size]] is more likely to not recover from [[Environmental disaster|ecological disasters]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Rare species are species with small populations. Many move into the endangered or vulnerable category if the negative factors affecting them continue to operate. Examples of rare species include the [[Himalayan brown bear]], [[Fennec fox]], [[Wild Asiatic buffalo]] and [[Hornbill]].

A rare plant's legal status can be observed through the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]'s Plants Database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37014">A 20th-century [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|system of plant taxonomy]], the '''Reveal system''' (see also the Thorne &amp; Reveal system{{sfn|Reveal|2011}}{{sfn|Thorne|Reveal|2007}}) of plant classification was drawn up by the American botanist [[J.L. Reveal|James Reveal]] (1941-2015). The system was published online in 1997 in ten parts{{sfn|Reveal|1997}} as lecture notes comparing the major systems in use at that time.{{sfn|Reveal|1998}} Subsequently, Reveal became an author with the consensus [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG) on the [[APG II system|APG II 2003]]{{sfn|APG II|2003}} and [[APG III system|APG III 2009]]{{sfn|APG III|2009}}{{sfn|Chase|Reveal|2009}} processes. Although this largely supplanted the earlier and competing systems, he collaborated with [[Robert F Thorne|Robert Thorne]] on his system (2007),{{sfn|Thorne|Reveal|2007}} and subsequently continued to develop his own system.{{sfn|Reveal|2011}}{{sfn|Reveal|2012}}

The '''Rhodes-Livingstone Institute (RLI)''' was the first local anthropological research facility in Africa; it was founded in 1938 under the initial directorship of [[Godfrey Wilson]]. Designed to allow for easier study of the local cultures of [[Northern Rhodesia]], now [[Zambia]], it became the base of operations for a number of leading anthropologists of the time.

The RLI anthropologists have been lauded by some as liberal, anti-racists, furthering the cause of African independence. Among the participating anthropologists at the RLI, In addition to Wilson, were [[Monica Wilson|Monica Hunter Wilson]], [[Max Gluckman]], [[J. Desmond Clark]], [[Elizabeth Colson]], E.L. Epstein, [[J. Clyde Mitchell]], and William Watson.

Others have called attention to what they regard as misguidedness on the part of the RLI anthropologists, stemming from the fact that they were embedded in the colonial system and blind to its reality as a component in dialectic study.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, James. 1999, ''Expectations of Modernity'', Berkeley, LA, London.

''Current Anthropology''. 12(4/5): 419-445&lt;/ref&gt; For more favorable and well-supported accounts, compare the deep and detailed study by Lyn Schumaker (2001) and the shorter chapter by Richard Brown (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, Lyn. 2001, ''Africanizing Anthropology: Fieldwork, Networks, and the Making of Cultural Knowledge In Central Africa''.

'''Risk analysis''' is a technique used to identify and assess factors that may jeopardize the success of a [[project]] or achieving a goal.

This technique also helps to define preventive measures to reduce the probability of these factors from occurring and identify countermeasures to successfully deal with these constraints when they develop to avert possible negative effects on the competitiveness of the company.

One of the more popular methods to perform a risk analysis in the computer field is called [[facilitated risk analysis process]] (FRAP).

==Facilitated risk analysis process==
FRAP analyzes one system, application or segment of business processes at a time.

FRAP assumes that additional efforts to develop precisely quantified risks are not cost effective because:
* such estimates are time consuming
* risk documentation becomes too voluminous for practical use
* specific loss estimates are generally not needed to determine if controls are needed.
* without assumptions there is little risk analysis

After identifying and categorizing risks, a team identifies the controls that could mitigate the risk. The decision for what controls are needed lies with the business manager. The team's conclusions as to what risks exists and what controls needed are documented along with a related action plan for control implementation.

Three of the most important [[risks]] a software company faces are: unexpected changes in revenue, unexpected changes in costs from those budgeted and the amount of specialization of the software planned. Risks that affect revenues can be: unanticipated competition, privacy, intellectual property right problems, and unit sales that are less than forecast. Unexpected development costs also create risk that can be in the form of more rework than anticipated, security holes, and privacy invasions.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Messerschmitt, D. G.  |author2=C. Szyperski |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Marketplace Issues in Software Planning and Design|journal=IEEE Software|volume=21|issue=3|date=May–June 2004|pages=62–70|doi=10.1109/MS.2004.1293074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrow specialization of software with a large amount of research and development expenditures can lead to both business and technological risks since specialization does not necessarily lead to lower unit costs of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rao, P.M. |author2=J. A. Klein |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Growing importance of marketing strategies for the software industry|journal=Industrial marketing management|volume=23|issue=1|date=February 1994|pages=29–37|doi=10.1016/0019-8501(94)90024-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the decrease in the potential customer base, specialization risk can be significant for a software firm. After probabilities of scenarios have been calculated with risk analysis, the process of [[risk management]] can be applied to help manage the risk.

Methods like [[applied information economics]] add to and improve on risk analysis methods by introducing procedures to adjust subjective probabilities, compute the value of additional information and to use the results in part of a larger [[Investment management|portfolio management]] problem.

'''StatsDirect''' is a [[List of statistical packages|statistical software package]] designed for biomedical, public health, and general health science uses. The second generation of the software was reviewed in general medical&lt;ref name="Freemantle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freemantle|first=Nick|title=CD: StatsDirect---Statistical Software for Medical Research in the 21st Century|journal=BMJ|date=16 December 2000|volume=321|issue=7275|pages=1536|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7275.1536}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public health journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipp|first=Alastair|title=Stats Direct|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=1 September 2002|volume=24|issue=3|pages=242|doi=10.1093/pubmed/24.3.242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and use ==
StatsDirect's interface is menu driven and has editors for spreadsheet-like data and reports. The function library includes common medical statistical methdods that can be extended by users via an [[XML]]-based description that can embed calls to native StatsDirect numerical libraries, [[R (programming language)|R]] scripts, or algorithms in any of the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] languages (such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.Net]], [[J Sharp|J#]], or [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]).&lt;ref name="SDTech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsdirect.com/sd3technology.aspx|title=StatsDirect Technologies|publisher=StatsDirect Ltd|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common statistical misconceptions are challenged by the interface. For example, users can perform a [[chi-square test]] on a two-by-two table, but they are asked whether the data are from a [[Cohort study|cohort (perspective)]] or [[Case-control study|case-control (retrospective)]] study before delivering the result. Both processes produce a chi-square test result but more emphasis is put on the appropriate statistic for the inference, which is the odds ratio for retrospective studies and relative risk for prospective studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Cole|title=Statistical Testing in Practice with StatsDirect|year=2013|url=http://www.coledavis.org/book.html|isbn=978-1605944500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Professor Iain Buchan of the [[University of Manchester]] wrote a doctoral thesis on the foundational work and is credited as creator of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchan|first=Iain Edward|title=The Development of a Statistical Computer Software Resource for Medical Research (MD Thesis)|url=http://www.statsdirect.com/thesis/md.pdf|publisher=University of Liverpool|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchan said he wished to address the problem of clinicians lacking the statistical knowledge to select and interpret statistical functions correctly, and often misusing software written by and for statisticians as a result.

The software debuted in 1989 as Arcus, then Arcus ProStat in 1993, both written for the DOS platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adler|first=Eric|title=Arcus Pro-Stat 3 (Short Reviews)|journal=Personal Computer World|date=March 1994|pages=306|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/690/Personal-Computer-World-March-1994/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arcus Quickstat for Windows followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sachdev|first=Harshi|title=Arcus Quickstat (Multimedia Review)|journal=Indian Pediatrics|date=October 1999|volume=36|issue=10|pages=1075–1076|url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/oct99-16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, an expanded version, StatsDirect, was released for Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref name="Freemantle"/&gt; In 2013, the third generation of this software was released, written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] for the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] platform.&lt;ref name="SDTech"/&gt;

StatsDirect reports embed the metadata necessary to replay calculations, which may be needed if the original data is ever updated. The reproducible report technology follows the [[Research Objects|research object]] approach for replaying in "eLabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bechhofer, Sean; Buchan, Iain; De Roure, David; Missier, Paolo; Ainsworth, John; Bhagat, Jiten; Couch, Philip; Cruickshank, Don; Delderfield, Mark; Dunlop, Ian; Gamble, Matthew; Michaelides, Danius; Owen, Stuart; Newman, David; Sufi, Shoaib; Goble, Carole|title=Why linked data is not enough for scientists|journal=Future Generation Computer Systems|volume=29|issue=2|pages=599–611|doi=10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stiftung Lesen''' (Reading [[(nonprofit organisation)|Foundation]]) is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Mainz]], Germany under the patronage of [[Joachim Gauck]]. Stiftung Lesen acts as a stakeholder for reading promotion on a national and international level. It contributes to reading promotion and [[reading education]] through programmes, scientific research, and political recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EURead|title=The social context of the foundation's work|url=http://www.euread.com/organisations/details/stiftung_lesen/|website=www.euread.com|publisher=Stiftung Lesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To create a basis for the development of reading skills, and to enhance the overall level of literacy, Stiftung Lesen established adequate and accessible programmes for every member of society – regardless of financial, cultural or social background.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Empirische Lese(r)forschung: Institutionen, Verfahren und Ergebnisse |last=Neufeld |first=Johannes |year=2007 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |isbn=978-3-638-74877-3 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006 Stiftung Lesen established its own Institute for Research on Reading and Media in order to align its projects with the latest scientific findings. The institute is tasked with conducting scientific research on the use of media, reading and reading socialisation, the supervision and evaluation of the foundation’s projects and the organisation of conferences on topics concerning [[literacy]] and media research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maas|first1=Jörg F.|last2=Ehmig|first2=Simone C.|last3=Seelmann|first3=Carolin|chapter=Digital Media's Potential for Reading Promotion|title=Prepare for Life!

== Objective ==
Stiftung Lesen acts as an advocate for reading and media competency in Germany to ensure that every child and adult in Germany develops crucial reading and media skills, and enjoys reading. Stiftung Lesen’s initiatives and programmes as well as pilot and research projects complement and build on each other. The programmes support early infant development in the family and nurseries when the basis of reading competency is laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EURead|title=The social context of the foundation's work|url=http://www.euread.com/organisations/details/stiftung_lesen/|website=www.euread.com|publisher=Stiftung Lesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Older children and teenagers are reached through projects in- and outside school, covering their future development. In addition to the children benefitting directly, actors chaperoning the children’s development such as parents, childcare workers, teachers, booksellers and librarians are integrated in the programmes. To promote its activities the foundation has partnered with such well-known organizations as ''[[Die Zeit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">{{short description|The sixth of 17 Sustainable Development Goals calling for clean water and sanitation for all people by 2030}}
'''Sustainable Development Goal 6''' ('''SDG6''' or '''SDG 6'''), one of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and [[sanitation]] for all people. The official wording is: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal has eight targets to be achieved by at least 2030. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven "indicators."     

SDG6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  For example, improving sanitation also helps make cities more sustainable (Goal 11). Sanitation improvements can lead to more jobs (Goal 8) which would also lead to economic growth (Goal 8).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  SDG6 progress improves [[health]] (Goal 3) and [[social justice]] (Goal 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targets==

SDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020 and one has no target year.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators for SDG6.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]:&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt; 

# By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]] for all
# By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] for all and end [[open defecation]], paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
# By 2030, improve water quality by reducing [[Water pollution|pollution]], eliminating dumping and minimizing release of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]] and materials, halving the proportion of untreated [[wastewater]] and substantially increasing [[Reclaimed water|recycling and safe reuse]] globally

Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption supports education and employment, both of which are the foundation of alleviating poverty. Therefore, toilets at school and at the work place are included in the second target ("achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all"). Equitable sanitation and hygiene solutions address the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.

Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. Preserving natural sources of water is very important so as to achieve universal access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]]. Therefore, one target aims to reduce [[water pollution]] by eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and untreated [[wastewater]]. The potential for recycling and safe [[Reclaimed water|reuse of wastewater]] is also mentioned.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt;

==Indicators==
[[File:Pit latrines in Zambia (3233256285).jpg|thumb|Unimproved sanitation example: [[pit latrine]] without slab in [[Lusaka]], Zambia]]
The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]] services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The current statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The JMP is a joint program of [[UNICEF]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and compiles data to monitor SDG6 progress. 

The definition of safely managed sanitation service is: "Use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite."&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Links with other SDGs==
The SDGs are all interlinked. [[WASH]] experts have stated that without progress on Goal 6, the other goals and targets cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="IPSnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/10/opinion-sanitation-water-hygiene-for-all-cannot-wait-for-2030/|title=Opinion: “Sanitation, Water &amp; Hygiene For All” Cannot Wait for 2030|last1=Rao Gupta|first1=Geeta|date=October 2015|website=Inter Press|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/beyond-the-sdgs-how-to-deliver-water-and-sanitation-to-everyone-everywhere-86975|title=Beyond the SDGs: How to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhere|last1=Batty|first1=Margaret|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, accomplishing the other SDGs will require assuring clean water and sanitation for all as stated in SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=SuSanA|first=|date=2017|website=|publisher=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sanitation systems with a [[Reuse of excreta|resource recovery]] and reuse focus are getting increased attention and can contribute to achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20170919145350-bovq7|title=The rise of the sanitation economy: how business can help solve a global crisis|last=Paranipe|first=Nitin|date=14 November 2017|website=Thomson Reuters Foundation News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Kim|last2=Dickin|first2=Sarah|last3=Rosemarin|first3=Arno|date=2016-12-08|title=Towards "Sustainable" Sanitation: Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Areas|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1289|doi=10.3390/su8121289}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving Goal 12 ([[sustainable consumption]] and [[sustainable production|production]]) and Goal 2 (end hunger). 

Ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal 11 ([[sustainable cities]] and communities), Goal 1 (no poverty) and Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Organizations==

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) works on sanitation issues as a global network of 9000 individuals and 300 partner organizations. Global organizations such as [[Oxfam]], [[UNICEF]], [[WaterAid]] and many small NGOs as well as universities, research centres, private enterprises, government-owned entities etc. are all part of SuSanA and are dedicated to achieving SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the population. This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko,, Tan, Tay Keong,, Flynn, Patricia M.,|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">In [[systems engineering]], the '''system usability scale''' ('''SUS''') is a simple, ten-item attitude [[Likert scale]] giving a global view of subjective assessments of [[usability]]. It was developed by John Brooke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  author = Brooke, J. | year = 1996| chapter= SUS: a "quick and dirty" usability scale | editors =P. W. Jordan, B. Thomas, B. A. Weerdmeester, &amp; A. L. McClelland | title=Usability Evaluation in Industry | publisher = London: Taylor and Francis| url = http://www.usabilitynet.org/trump/documents/Suschapt.doc }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1986 as a tool to be used in [[usability engineering]] of [[electronic office]] systems.

The usability of a system, as defined by the ISO standard [[ISO 9241]] Part 11, can be measured only by taking into account the context of use of the system—i.e., who is using the system, what they are using it for, and the environment in which they are using it. Furthermore, measurements of usability have several different aspects:

* effectiveness (can users successfully achieve their objectives)
* efficiency (how much effort and resource is expended in achieving those objectives)
* satisfaction (was the experience satisfactory)

Measures of effectiveness and efficiency are also context specific. Effectiveness in using a system for controlling a continuous industrial process would generally be measured in very different terms to, say, effectiveness in using a text editor. Thus, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question "is system A more usable than system B", because the measures of effectiveness and efficiency may be very different. However, it can be argued that given a sufficiently high-level definition of ''subjective'' assessments of usability, comparisons can be made between systems.

SUS has generally been seen as providing this type of high-level subjective view of usability and is thus often used in carrying out comparisons of usability between systems. Because it yields a single score on a scale of 0–100, it can be used to compare even systems that are outwardly dissimilar. This one-dimensional aspect of the SUS is both a benefit and a drawback, because the questionnaire is necessarily quite general. 
Recently, Lewis and Sauro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis, J.R.  |author2=Sauro, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2009 | title = The factor structure of the system usability scale | publisher = international conference (HCII 2009), San Diego CA, USA | url=http://www.measuringusability.com/papers/Lewis_Sauro_HCII2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested a two-factor orthogonal structure, which practitioners may use to score the SUS on independent Usability and Learnability dimensions. At the same time, Borsci, Federici and Lauriola&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Borsci, S., Federici,S., &amp; Lauriola, M. | year = 2009 | title = On the dimensionality of the System Usability Scale: a test of alternative measurement models | journal = Cognitive processing | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 193–197 | doi = 10.1007/s10339-009-0268-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an independent analysis confirm the two factors structure of SUS, also showing that those factors (Usability and Learnability) are correlated.

The SUS has been widely used in the evaluation of a range of systems. Bangor, Kortum and Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bangor, Aaron, Kortum, Philip T. and Miller, James T. | year= 2008 | title= An Empirical Evaluation of the System Usability Scale | journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 574–594 | doi=10.1080/10447310802205776}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used the scale extensively over a ten-year period and have produced normative data that allow SUS ratings to be positioned relative to other systems. They propose an extension to SUS to provide an adjective rating that correlates with a given score.  Based on a review of hundreds of usability studies, Sauro and Lewis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  author = Sauro, J., &amp; Lewis, J. R | year = 2012 | title = Quantifying the user experience: Practical statistics for user research | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann, Waltham MA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a curved grading scale for mean SUS scores.

'''Transport finance''' is the subject that explores how [[transport]] networks are paid for.    

The timing of the money required to finance transport is a principal issue.  Many projects are "[[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]]", that is infrastructure, which lasts many years, is expected to be paid out of ongoing cash flow.  Other projects are financed with [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] raised in [[capital market]]s. Bonds must be secured with an expected future cash flow.  

The cash flow, required for either pay-as-you-go or for bonds, must be raised.  Common sources are [[user fee]]s, such as [[gas tax]]es, and [[Toll road|toll]]s.  Other sources are [[revenue|general revenue]].  This issue is related to who bears the burden: users or the general public.  Even if users bear the burden, that class must be subdivided, e.g. users during peak times or off-peak, freight or passenger traffic, urban or rural users, residents or non-residents (many toll plazas are located on the state line to maximize revenue from non-residents).

A third issue concerns the [[full cost]]s of transportation.  There are monetary costs, which are financed with money, as considered above, but there are also non-monetary costs (sometimes called [[hidden cost]]s), which are paid for by people's time, by clean air, by peace and quiet, etc.  See the discussion of [[externalities]] for a fuller explication of non-monetary costs.
