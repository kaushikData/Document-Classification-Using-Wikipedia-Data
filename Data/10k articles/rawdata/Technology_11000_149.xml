      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3553">[[Image:Tachometer 2011 honda civic.jpg|thumb|right|An auto tachometer has a sweep of about 240-250 degrees and typically uses an air core gauge.]]
An '''air core gauge''' is a specific type of [[rotary actuator]] in an analog display gauge that allows an indicator to rotate a full 360 degrees.  It is used in gauges and displays, most commonly automotive instrument clusters.  

A typical automotive application is shown at the right.  The air core gauge is a type of "air-core motor".  It may be considered a "gauge movement" or "pointer indication device".&lt;ref name="Simco" &gt;[http://www.simcoltd.com/specialty-oem/micro-air-core/  Simco meter movements]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
There are four common types of rotary actuators:&lt;ref name=fourtypes&gt;[http://howto.globalvicinity.com/gv_wiki.php?wi=309&amp;co=1&amp;vi=1 Comparing Gauge Movements]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical gauges, in which the needle is attached directly to the value being measured; for example, a mechanical [[pressure gauge]]
* Analog volt meters or d'Arsonval movements, which consist of a coil and a [[permanent magnet]]
* [[Stepper motor]]s, which move in one-notch increments or steps
* Air-core motors, as described below.

== Construction and operation ==
The air core gauge consists of two independent, perpendicular coils surrounding a hollow chamber.  A needle shaft protrudes into the chamber, where a permanent magnet is affixed to the shaft. When [[electric current|current]] flows through the perpendicular coils, their [[magnetic fields]] superimpose and the  magnet is free to align with the combined fields. 

[[Image:Air core actuator pcb mounting honda.jpg|thumb|right|Back side of an auto instrument cluster showing four mounting terminals for an air core gauge.]] 
A typical air core gauge has four terminals, two for each coil, as shown. The two coils are identified as the [[sine]] coil and the [[cosine]] coil.

=== Theory ===
The direction &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of the overall magnetic field is approximately:
: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{x}{y} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are the coils' sine and cosine currents respectively. The permanent magnet aligns itself with that field, eventually settling near &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, by proportioning the current through each coil, the needle can reach all 360° of rotation.&lt;ref name=fourtypes /&gt;

=== Example ===
If the sin coil current is 29 mA and the cos current is 50 mA:

The coil current ratio is 0.58, and arctan 0.58 = 30 degrees.

== Drivers ==
Air core gauges require special electronics to properly drive the coils.  Some driver [[integrated circuit]]s have a serial input data port and two pair of output lines.  One pair of the output lines drives the sin coil and one pair drives the cos coil.

The input data defines:
* The quadrant to which the actuator will point.  This defines the [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] of the [[voltage]] to the sin coil and the cos coil.
* The desired number of degrees within the quadrant.

Some typical driver ICs include:
*  On Semiconductor CS4172 16 pin dual inline package (DISCONTINUED)
*  On Semiconductor CS4192 surface mount package  (DISCONTINUED)
*  On Semiconductor CS8190 DIP and SOIC surface mount packages
*  Melexis MLX10407
*  Melexis MLX10420

The '''App Store''' is a [[digital distribution]] platform, developed and maintained by [[Apple Inc.]], for [[mobile app]]s on its [[iOS]] operating system. The store allows users to browse and download apps developed with Apple's [[iOS SDK|iOS software development kit]]. Apps can be downloaded on the [[iPhone]] smartphone, the [[iPod Touch]] handheld computer, or the [[iPad]] tablet computer, and some can be transferred to the [[Apple Watch]] smartwatch or 4th-generation or newer [[Apple TV]]s as extensions of iPhone apps.

The App Store was opened on July 10, 2008, with an initial 500 applications available. {{As of|2017|}}, the store features over 2.1 million apps.

Developers have multiple options for monetizing their applications, ranging from free, free with in-app purchases, and paid. However, App Store has been criticized for a lackluster development environment, prompting the company in June 2016 to announce a "renewed focus and energy" on the store. Major changes introduced in the following months include ads in search results, a new app subscription model, and the ability for developers to respond to customer reviews. Additionally, Apple began a process to remove old apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current app guidelines, with app research firms noticing significant numbers of app removals from the store. Furthermore, with the release of [[iOS 11]] in September 2017, App Store received a complete design overhaul, bringing a greater focus on editorial content and daily highlights, as well as a design similar in style to several of Apple's built-in iOS apps.

After the success of Apple's App Store and the launch of [[list of mobile software distribution platforms|similar services]] by its competitors, the term "app store" has been adopted to refer to any similar service for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sinead |last=Carew |title=In app store war, BlackBerry, Google hold own |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-pluggedin-idUSTRE53L5DK20090422 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roy |last=Furchgott |title=Nokia’s App Store Launches With a Hiccup |url=https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/nokias-app-store-launches-with-a-hiccup/ |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 29, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Priya |last=Ganapati |title=BlackBerry App Store Gets a Name |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/03/blackberry-app/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Apple applied for a U.S. [[trademark]] on the term "App Store" in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Larry |last=Dignan |title=Apple's App Store and a little trademark history |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-app-store-and-a-little-trademark-history/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was tentatively approved in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Pachal |title=How Apple Can Trademark 'App Store' |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2382968,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, U.S. District Judge [[Phyllis Hamilton]], who was presiding over Apple's case against [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], said she would "probably" deny Apple's motion to stop Amazon from using the "App Store" name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Lowensohn |title=Judge likely to deny Apple's 'Appstore' complaint |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/judge-likely-to-deny-apples-appstore-complaint/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Joel |last1=Rosenblatt |first2=Karen |last2=Gullo |title=Apple Bid to Bar Amazon ‘Appstore’ Will ‘Likely’ Be Denied |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-22/apple-bid-to-bar-amazon-appstore-will-likely-be-denied.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624211650/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-22/apple-bid-to-bar-amazon-appstore-will-likely-be-denied.html |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=June 22, 2011 |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Dan |last1=Levine |first2=Poornima |last2=Gupta |title=Apple may have tough road in Amazon lawsuit |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-amazon-idUSTRE75L79Y20110622 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Apple was denied preliminary injunction against [[Amazon Appstore|Amazon's Appstore]] by a federal judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Foresman |title=Apple denied preliminary injunction against Amazon’s "Appstore" |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/apples-preliminary-injunction-against-amazons-appstore-denied/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''app'' has become a popular [[buzzword]]; in January 2011, ''app'' was awarded the honor of being 2010's "Word of the Year" by the [[American Dialect Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=“App” voted 2010 word of the year by the American Dialect Society (UPDATED) |url=http://www.americandialect.org/app-voted-2010-word-of-the-year-by-the-american-dialect-society-updated |publisher=[[American Dialect Society]] |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cody |last=Fink |title=App Is 2010’s Word Of The Year |url=https://www.macstories.net/news/app-is-2010s-word-of-the-year/ |website=MacStories |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "App" has been used as shorthand for "[[Application software|application]]" since at least the mid-1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oracle gets NC religion |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/oracle-gets-nc-religion/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=February 27, 1996 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in product names since at least 2006, for example [[G Suite|then-named Google Apps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Launches Hosted Communications Services |url=http://googlepress.blogspot.no/2006/08/google-launches-hosted-communications_28.html |website=News from Google |publisher=[[Google]] |date=August 28, 2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Apple informed developers that they could begin using appstore.com for links to their apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Owen |last=Thomas |title=Apple Does Not Want You To Visit Appstore.com |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-appstore-message-2013-2 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple Debuts New AppStore.com Vanity URLs For Developers During Super Bowl |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/03/apple-debuts-new-vanity-urls-for-app-store-developers-during-super-bowl-domain-name-land-grab-to-follow/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Foresman |title=Apple debuts new AppStore.com URLs during Super Bowl 47 |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/02/apple-debuts-new-appstore-com-urls-during-super-bowl-47/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June at its [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|developer conference]], Apple announced an upcoming "Kids" section in App Store, a new section featuring apps categorized by age range, and the section was launched alongside the release of [[iOS 7]] in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Introducing Apple’s New "Kids" App Store |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/22/introducing-apples-new-kids-app-store/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 22, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Guarino |title=App Store makes it easier for parents to find apps for their children with new Kids Category in iOS 7 |url=https://9to5mac.com/2013/09/19/app-store-makes-it-easier-for-parents-to-find-apps-for-their-children-with-new-kids-category-in-ios-7/ |website=9to5Mac |date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, due to pressure from the [[European Commission]], Apple updated App Store so that all apps that have no charge to download are labeled "Get" instead of the previous "Free", due to many "free" apps' inclusions of paid [[Microtransaction|in-app purchases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple Relabels "Free" Download Buttons On iTunes And Mac App Store To "Get" Following Pressure from EC |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/apple-relabels-free-download-buttons-on-itunes-and-mac-app-store-to-get-following-pressure-from-ec/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Replaces 'Free' Purchase Button Labeling With 'Get' in App Store |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/19/apple-replaces-free-button-with-get/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Brian |title=Why App Store apps are now labeled 'Get' instead of 'Free' |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/20/apple-switches-free-get-app-store/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 20, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, reports surfaced that documentation for a new [[beta test|beta]] for the then-upcoming release of [[IOS 10#10.3|iOS 10.3]] detailed that Apple would let developers respond to customer reviews in the App Store, marking a significant change from the previous limitation, which prevented developers from communicating with users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple will finally let developers respond to App Store reviews |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/apple-will-finally-let-developers-respond-to-app-store-reviews/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 24, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Mayo |title=Apple will let developers reply to reviews in the App Store soon, for iOS and Mac apps |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/24/apple-will-let-developers-reply-to-reviews-in-the-app-store-soon-for-ios-and-mac-apps/ |website=9to5Mac |date=January 24, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functionality was officially enabled on March 27, 2017 when iOS 10.3 was released to users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 10.3 With Find My AirPods, APFS, App Store Review Tweaks and More |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/27/apple-releases-ios-10-3/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=March 27, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further details were also released about reviews for users, including that they will be able to rate and review apps in the apps themselves rather than being redirected to the App Store, and that they can mark other users' reviews as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful".&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Developers can finally respond to App Store reviews – here’s how it works |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/developers-can-finally-respond-to-app-store-reviews-heres-how-it-works/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=March 28, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple published a document describing proper ways to respond for developers, including being timely, clear and concise, prioritize certain forms of reviews (low-star ratings, certain countries or recent reviews) through filtering in [[iTunes Connect]], and that developer responses go through an approval process before being published.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt; Developers are also forbidden from manipulating or incenting feedback.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt; Developer responses are listed in the App Store as a line underneath the respective user's review,&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt; and users receive a notification/email upon a response from the respective developer, with the option to update their review.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Apple details new App Store ratings and review responses on iOS 10.3 for developers |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/03/27/apple-details-new-app-store-ratings-and-review-responses-on-ios-10-3-for-developers/ |website=9to5Mac |date=March 27, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, App Store submissions containing pricing details, such as "free", in the name started getting rejected. Developers had previously been advised in developer guides in [[iTunes Connect]] and App Store overview pages that they should refrain from the practice, though apps were still approved. Starting in March, some (though not all) apps with "free" in their titles were being rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Novet |title=Apple now rejects App Store submissions when the name includes the price |url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/28/apple-now-rejects-app-store-submissions-when-the-name-includes-the-price/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=March 28, 2017 |accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Rejecting Apps With Pricing Info Like 'Free' in App Title |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/28/apple-rejecting-apps-with-free-in-title/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=March 28, 2017 |accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Search Ads Advanced" is a new name given to the older method, in which developers have to pay whenever users tap on their apps in search results, along with unlimited monthly budgets. At launch, the Basic program is only available in the U.S., with international rollout expected "sometime next year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple introduces a new pay-per-install ad product called Search Ads Basic |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/apple-introduces-a-new-pay-per-install-ad-product-called-search-ads-basic/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=December 5, 2017 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Adds New 'Search Ads Basic' Ad Option for Developers |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/05/apple-search-ads-basic-option/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 5, 2017 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple also offers an iTunes Affiliate Program, which lets people refer others to apps and other iTunes content, along with in-app purchases, for a percentage of sales. The commission rate for in-app purchases was reduced from 7% to 2.5% in May 2017, while affiliate rates for paid apps, music, movies, books, and TV shows remained at 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple confirms reduced App Store affiliate commission rates apply to in-app purchases |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/08/apple-confirms-reduced-app-store-affiliate-commission-rates-apply-to-in-app-purchases |website=AppleInsider |date=May 8, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Apple clarifies iTunes affiliate changes: apps stay at 7% &amp; in-app purchases fall to 2.5% |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/07/apple-clarifies-itunes-affiliate-changes-apps-stay-at-7-in-app-purchases-fall-to-2-5/ |website=9to5Mac |date=May 7, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

App Store received a major design overhaul with the release of [[iOS 11]]. The new design features a greater focus on editorial content and daily highlights, and introduces a "cleaner and more consistent and colorful look" similar to several of Apple's built-in iOS apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=James |last1=Vincent |first2=Nick |last2=Statt |title=Apple unveils redesigned App Store with an all-new way to find apps and games |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15741096/apple-app-store-games-redesign-announcement-wwdc-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mitchel |last=Broussard |title=Apple Reveals Redesigned App Store for iOS 11 With Design Similar to Apple Music |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/05/apple-redesigning-app-store/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple introduces a completely redesigned App Store |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-a-completely-redesigned-app-store/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to September 2017, Apple offered a way for users to manage their iOS app purchases through the [[iTunes]] computer software. In September, version 12.7 of iTunes was released, removing the App Store section in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Apple starts cutting the bloat from iTunes by removing iOS App Store |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16298988/apple-itunes-desktop-update-removes-app-store |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 12, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jake |last=Smith |title=Apple's iTunes removes iOS App Store from desktop version |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-removes-ios-app-store-from-desktop-versions-of-itunes/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 13, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following month, iTunes 12.6.3 was also released, retaining the App Store, with ''9to5Mac'' noting that the secondary release was positioned by Apple as "necessary for some businesses performing internal app deployments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Mayo |title=Apple still offers an iTunes version with App Store, Ringtones and other features removed in ‘focused’ iTunes 12.7 |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/10/09/apple-itunes-apps-focused-removed-stopgap/ |website=9to5Mac |date=October 9, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple Quietly Releases iTunes 12.6.3 With Built-In App Store |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/09/apple-itunes-with-app-store-included/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 9, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2018, Apple announced that the App Store had a record-breaking holiday season according to a new press release. During the week starting on Christmas Eve, a record number of customers made App Store purchases, spending more than $890 million in that seven-day period. On New Year's Day 2018 alone, customers made $300 million in purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/app-store-kicks-off-2018-with-record-breaking-holiday-season/|title=App Store kicks off 2018 with record-breaking holiday season|work=Apple Newsroom|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and monetization==
===iOS SDK===
{{Main|iOS SDK}} 
The iOS SDK ([[Software Development Kit]]) allows for the development of [[mobile app]]s on iOS.

While originally developing [[iPhone]] prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-[[CEO]] [[Steve Jobs]] did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing them to make [[web application]]s for the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]].&lt;ref name="No native apps"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jobs’ original vision for the iPhone: No third-party native apps |url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/10/21/jobs-original-vision-for-the-iphone-no-third-party-native-apps/ |website=9to5Mac |date=October 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider,&lt;ref name="No native apps" /&gt; with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Geoff |last=Duncan |title=Apple confirms iPhone SDK coming next year |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/apple-confirms-iphone-sdk-coming-next-year/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steve Jobs confirms native iPhone SDK by February |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/07/10/17/steve_jobs_confirms_native_iphone_sdk_by_february |website=AppleInsider |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Dalrymple |title=Apple unveils iPhone SDK |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1132400/iphonesdk.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Block |authorlink=Ryan Block |title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers have a few options for monetizing their applications. The "Free Model" enables free apps, increasing likelihood of engagement. The "Freemium Model" makes the app download free, but users are offered optional additional features in-app that require payments. The "Subscription Model" enables ongoing monetization through renewable transactions. The "Paid Model" makes the app itself a paid download and offers no additional features. The "Paymium Model" enables paid app downloads and paid in-app content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choosing a Business Model |url=https://developer.apple.com/app-store/business-models/ |website=Apple Developer |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-app subscriptions were originally introduced for magazines, newspapers and music apps in February 2011, giving developers 70% of revenue earned and Apple 30%.

==Application ratings==
Apple rates applications worldwide based on their content, and determines the age group for which each is appropriate. According to the [[iOS version history|iPhone OS 3.0]] launch event, the iPhone will allow blocking of objectionable apps in the iPhone's settings. The following are the ratings that Apple has detailed:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Rating
! Description
|-
| style="background:green; color:white;"|'''4+'''
| Contains no objectionable material. This rating has three sub-classifications:
* Made for Ages 5 and Under - This app is suitable for children aged 5 and under, but people aged 6 and over can also use this app.
* Made for Ages 6 to 8 - This app is suitable for children aged 6 to 8, but people aged 9 and over can also use this app.
* Made for Ages 9 to 11 - This app is suitable for children aged 9 to 11, but people aged 12 and over can also use this app.
|-
| style="background:lime;"|'''9+'''
| May contain mild or infrequent occurrences of cartoon, fantasy or realistic violence, and mild or infrequent mature, suggestive, or horror-themed content which may not be suitable for children under the age of 9. This rating has one sub-classification:
* Made for Ages 9 to 11 - This app is suitable for children aged 9 to 11, but people aged 12 and over can also use this app.
|-
| style="background:yellow;" | '''12+'''
| May contain frequent or intense cartoon, fantasy or realistic violence, mild or infrequent mature or suggestive themes, mild or infrequent bad language, and simulated gambling which may not be suitable for children under the age of 12.
|-
|style="background:red; color:white;" |'''17+'''
| May contain frequent and intense offensive language, excessive cartoon, fantasy, or realistic violence, frequent and intense mature, horror, suggestive themes, sexual content, nudity, alcohol, and drugs, or a combination of any of these factors which are '''unsuitable''' for persons under 17 years of age. This includes apps with unrestricted web access. '''No one aged 16 and under is allowed to purchase an app rated 17+.'''
|-
|style="background:black; color:red;" |'''No Rating'''
| These apps cannot be purchased on the App Store.
|}

==App approval process==
{{Main|Approval of iOS apps}}
Applications are subject to approval by Apple, as outlined in the SDK agreement, for basic reliability testing and other analysis. Applications may still be distributed "ad-hoc" if they are rejected, by the author manually submitting a request to Apple to license the application to individual iPhones, although Apple may withdraw the ability for authors to do this at a later date.

{{As of|2013}}, Apple employed mostly [[static program analysis|static analysis]] for their app review process, which means that dynamic code reassembly techniques could defeat the review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=John |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/081913-jekyll-test-attack-sneaks-through-272947.html |title="Jekyll" test attack sneaks through Apple App Store, wreaks havoc on iOS |publisher=Network World |date=August 18, 2013 |accessdate=June 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195850/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/081913-jekyll-test-attack-sneaks-through-272947.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot |first=David |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/518096/remotely-assembled-malware-blows-past-apples-screening-process/ |title=Remotely Assembled Malware Blows Past Apple’s Screening Process &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, [[Boyfriend Maker]], a [[dating sim]] game, was removed due to "reports of references to violent sexual acts and paedophilia" deemed inappropriate to Boyfriend Maker's age rating of 4+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emily |last=Gera |title=Boyfriend Maker gets pulled from App Store for references to paedophilia |url=https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/26/3692230/boyfriend-maker-gets-pulled-from-app-store-for-references-to |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 26, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised version called Boyfriend Plus was approved by Apple in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |title=Bizarre Boyfriend Maker Is Back On The App Store, Slightly Declawed |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/04/bizarre-boyfriend-maker-is-back-on-the-app-store-slightly-declawed/ |website=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Univision Communications]] |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, HiddenApps was approved and appeared in App Store.

In November 2014, Apple removed the [[marijuana]] social networking app [[MassRoots]], with the reason given that it "encourage[d] excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal substances.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Huddleston Jr. |title=Apple’s ban on marijuana social networking app goes up in smoke |url=http://fortune.com/2015/02/13/apple-marijuana-social-network/ |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=February 13, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, MassRoots was reintroduced into the store after Apple changed its enforcement guidelines to allow cannabis social apps in the 23 states where it is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Banned weed app returns to the Apple store with new location restrictions |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/13/8032867/massroots-back-in-app-store |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=February 13, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, it was discovered that "hundreds" of apps submitted and approved on App Store were using [[XcodeGhost]], a [[Malware|malicious]] version of the [[Xcode]] development software.

In June 2017, a [[scam]]ming trend was discovered on the store, in which developers make apps built on non-existent services, attach in-app purchase subscriptions to the opening dialogue, then buy App Store search advertising space to get the app into the higher rankings. In one instance, an app by the name of "Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN" would require payments of $99.99 for a seven-day subscription after a short trial.

In addition, Apple has removed software licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) from App Store, due to text in Apple's Terms of Service agreement imposing [[digital rights management]] and proprietary legal terms incompatible with the terms of the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brett |last=Smith |title=More about the App Store GPL Enforcement |url=http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store-gpl-enforcement |website=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Murphy |title=Apple Pulls VLC Player from App Store Due to GPL |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2375476,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=January 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large-scale app removals===
On September 1, 2016, Apple announced that starting September 7, it would be removing old apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current review guidelines. Developers will be warned and given 30 days to update their apps, but apps that crash on startup will be removed immediately. Additionally, app names registered by developers cannot exceed 50 characters, in an attempt to stop developers from inserting long descriptions or irrelevant terms in app names to improve the app's ranking in App Store search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Juli Clover |title=Apple to Clean Up App Store, Eliminate Outdated and Non-Functional Apps |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/01/apple-cleaning-up-app-store/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Welch |title=Apple will start removing abandoned apps from the App Store this month |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12755260/apple-removing-abandoned-iphone-apps |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; App intelligence firm Sensor Tower revealed in November 2016 that Apple, as promised from its September announcement of removing old apps, had removed 47,300 apps from App Store in October 2016, a 238 percent increase of its prior number of average monthly app removals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple’s big App Store purge is now underway |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/apples-big-app-store-purge-is-now-underway/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 15, 2016 |accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Removed 47,300 Outdated iOS Apps From App Store in October of 2016 |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/15/apple-app-store-purge-october-2016/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 15, 2016 |accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, ''[[TechCrunch]]'' reported that Apple had turned its app removal focus on apps copying functionality from other, popular apps. An example cited included "if a popular game like ''[[Flappy Bird]]'' or ''Red Ball'' hits the charts, there will be hundreds or thousands of clones within weeks that attempt to capitalize on the initial wave of popularity". The report also noted removals of music apps serving [[pirated]] tracks. The publication wrote that, since the initial September app removals began, Apple had removed "multiple hundreds of thousands" of apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Panzarino |title=Apple goes after clones and spam on the App Store |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Apple ramping up App Store cleaning efforts, has already removed ‘hundreds of thousands’ of apps |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/21/apple-ramping-up-app-store-cleaning-efforts-has-already-removed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-apps/ |website=9to5Mac |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, a new report from ''TechCrunch'' stated that Apple had begun enforcing new restrictions on the use of "commercialized template or app generation services". Originally introduced as part of Apple's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|2017 developer conference]], new App Store guidelines allow the company to ban apps making use of templates or commercial app services. This affected many small businesses, with ''TechCrunch''{{'}}s report citing that "local retailers, restaurants, small fitness studios, nonprofits, churches and other organizations" benefit from using templates or app services due to minimal costs. Developers had received notice from Apple with a January 1, 2018 deadline to change their respective apps. The news caught the attention of Congress, with Congressman [[Ted Lieu]] writing a letter to Apple at the beginning of December, asking it to reconsider, writing that "It is my understanding that many small businesses, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house", and that the new rules cast "too wide a net", specifically "invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store’s integrity". Additionally, the news of stricter enforcement caused significant criticism from app development firms; one company told ''TechCrunch'' that it chose to close down its business following the news, saying that "The 4.2.6 [rule enforcement] was just a final drop that made us move on a bit faster with that decision [to close]", and another company told the publication that "There was no way in June [when the guidelines changed] that we would have said, ‘that’s going to target our apps' ... Apple had told us you aren’t being targeted by this from a quality standpoint. So being hit now under the umbrella of spam is shocking to every quality developer out there and all the good actors". Furthermore, the latter company stated that "there’s only so much you can do with apps that perform the same utility – ordering food". A third company said that "Rule 4.2.6 is a concrete illustration of the danger of Apple’s dominant position", and a fourth said that "They’ve wiped out pretty much an entire industry. Not just DIY tools like AppMakr, but also development suites like Titanium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple’s widened ban on templated apps is wiping small businesses from the App Store |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/apples-widened-ban-on-templated-apps-is-wiping-small-businesses-from-the-app-store/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=December 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Report: Apple cracking down on template applications, giving developers January 1 deadline |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/08/app-store-template-applications/ |website=9to5Mac |date=December 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the year, Apple updated the guideline to clarify that companies and organizations are allowed to use template apps, but only as long as they directly publish their app on their own; it remained a violation of the rule for commercial app services to publish apps for the respective clients.&lt;ref name="tc-templates"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple revises its controversial guidelines on template-based apps |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/apple-revises-its-controversial-guidelines-on-template-based-apps/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Updates App Store Guidelines to Relax Restrictive Rules on Template Apps |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/20/app-store-guidelines-updated-template-apps/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Censorship by the Chinese government ===
In January 2017, Apple complied with a request from the Chinese government to remove the Chinese version of ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} app. This followed the government's efforts in 2012 to block the ''Times''{{'}} website after stories of hidden wealth among family members of then-leader of China, [[Wen Jiabao]], were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Apple removes New York Times app from China’s app store at government’s request |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/5/14175556/new-york-times-china-app-removed-apple |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, an Apple spokesperson told the media that "we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations", though would not specify which regulations, and added that "As a result the app must be taken down off the China app store.

Following Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]]'s appearance at China's [[World Internet Conference]] in December 2017, in which Cook stated that Apple and China share a vision of "developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits", free speech and human rights activists criticized Cook and the company. Maya Wang at [[Human Rights Watch]] told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that "Cook’s appearance lends credibility to a state that aggressively censors the internet, throws people in jail for being critical about social ills, and is building artificial intelligence systems that monitors everyone and targets dissent. ...

'''Automated Truck Loading Systems - ATLS''' has been commonly used in the material handling industry to refer to the [[automation]] of loading or unloading trucks and trailers with product either on or without [[pallet]]s, [[slip Sheet|slip sheet]]s, racks, [[Containerization|containers]], using several different types of [[automated guided vehicle]] systems (AGV) or [[engineering|engineered]] [[conveyor belt]] systems that are integrated into [[vehicle]]s, automating the [[shipping|shipping / receiving]] and [[logistics]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Inventory Accuracy: People, Processes, &amp; Technology |author= David J. Piasecki|year=2003|publisher=OPS PUBLISHING|isbn=0-9727631-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conveyor systems are commonly referred to as
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*Roller beds
*Slip chains
*T-Bars
*Live Floors
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
*Roller Tracks
*Belt Floors
*Trailer Skates
*Skate &amp; Tracks
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
*Slat Floors
*Chain Floors
*Cable Floors
*Powered Cargo Rollers
{{col-end}}

Some of these systems are used to handle [[bulk material handling|bulk]] products such as [[Waste|garbage]], [[agriculture]] products, recycled [[tire]]s, [[cotton]], bark or [[sawdust]]. Manufacturing industries such as automotive, food &amp; beverage, paper, consumer products, appliance manufacturers and uses ATLS systems for incoming materials and outgoing product to increase throughput and streamline production. The transportation industry relies heavily on ATLS material handling systems to rapidly move product via land, sea, and air.

Next to solutions for palletised goods, Ancra Systems developed a custommade trailer unloading system for the automatic unloading of loose loaded parcels. The major advantages of this solution:

* Increased trailer loading capacity with 200% to 300% (no wheeled containers needed)
* Trailer unloading time reduced to 25 minutes, which results in better trailer utilization
* Reduced manpower
* Increased ergonomics for workforce
* Fewer docks needed (due to higher trailer loading capacity)
* Maximizing sorting machines utilization
* No forklifts needed, which means safer working environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancra.nl|title=Automatic truck loading solutions - ANCRA SYSTEMS - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATLS vehicle loading technologies significantly reduce the manpower required on the shipping and receiving docks, eliminate product damage, accidents, and ergonomic injuries related to lift-truck operation. Generally, products can be loaded quicker and product density is increased resulting in more payload per shipment which reduces shipping cost, using a loading automation system. Loading automation is often the key component to achieve complete plant automation.

A '''blast wall''' is a barrier designed to protect vulnerable buildings or other structures and the people inside them from the effects of a nearby [[explosion]], whether caused by [[industrial accident]], military action or [[terrorism]].

== Effectiveness ==
Research by [[Cranfield University]] [[Defence College of Management and Technology|Defence Academy]], building on earlier work, has shown that blast walls have the following properties:
* A non-deforming upright wall will significantly reduce the peak blast [[overpressure]] and impulse in an area between 4 and 6 wall heights behind it
* Similar protection occurs at greater distances behind the wall, but to a diminishing extent
* Blast walls perform best if the explosion is relatively close to the front of the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civ.uth.gr/cost-c26/documents/6th%20meeting_Timisoara/presentations/WG3/10.Smith%20-%20Blast%20walls.pdf |title=THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BLAST WALLS |last1=Smith |first1=Peter |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.civ.uth.gr/ |publisher=Department of Civil Engineering, University of Thessaly |accessdate=6 November 2014}} (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Canopied" walls (with a top section overhanging the front face) show some improved blast protection over plane walls
* A 90-degree canopy is more effective than a 45-degree one&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Walls containing sand or water work well, and cause little damage if they fail
* A wall has to stay intact long enough to "interact" with the blast in order to have any effect&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

The '''Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music (BC-CCM)''' located at [[Brooklyn College]] of the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) was one of the first [[computer music]] centers at a public university in the [[United States]].  The BC-CCM is a community of artists and researchers that began in the 1970s.

The mission of the BC-CCM is to explore the creative possibilities of technology in relation to the creation of [[music]], [[sound art]], [[sound design]], and [[multimedia]] arts.  Courses cover techniques of [[music composition]] with [[Digital data|digital]] tools and instruments, theories and implementation of [[sound processing]] and [[sound synthesis]], design and creation of new digital music and multimedia performance instruments, audio production, history and aesthetics of [[experimental music]] and sound art, and creative collaboration.  The BC-CCM also sponsors residencies of visiting composers and media creators.

== History ==
The Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music began when composer [[Robert Starer]], then a member of the faculty of the [[Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College]], proposed the idea of creating an [[electronic music]] studio at Brooklyn College in the mid-1970s.  The idea took root, and [[Jacob Druckman]] and [[Noah Creshevsky]] were the studio’s first Co-Directors. In those early days the equipment consisted largely of [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] [[analog synthesizers]]. [[Charles Dodge (composer)|Charles Dodge]] took over as Director in 1978, and he was responsible for having the studios designated as a center within [[Brooklyn College]], the Center for Computer Music (CCM).

[[Charles Dodge (composer)|Charles Dodge]] was a pivotal figure in the history of the center.  Dodge, originally from [[Iowa]], had done a bachelor's degree at the [[University of Iowa]] and then earned his MA and doctorate (DMA) in Music Composition at [[Columbia University]].  While at Columbia, Dodge was very active at the [[Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center]].  In particular, Dodge was one of the leading innovators in the emerging field of computer music composition (as opposed to analog electronic composition, the norm in the field through the 1970s).  Dodge created some of the first meritorious works in the field of computer music, including Earth’s Magnetic Field (1970), which mapped [[magnetic field]] data to musical sounds, Speech Songs, a 1974 work that used analysis and resynthesis of human voices, and Any Resemblance is Purely Coincidental (1980), which combines live piano performance with a digitally-manipulated recording of [[Enrico Caruso]] singing the aria "[[Vesti la giubba]]".

During Dodge’s years as Professor of Composition and Director of the Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music (BC-CCM), Dodge had the CCM designated as a center within Brooklyn College in 1978, and brought it to a world-class standing in the field of computer music.  Dodge secured an initial donation of equipment from [[Bell Laboratories]], and then proceeded to acquire large grants to fund BC-CCM work. The facilities received funding through grants from the United States Office of Education, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the City University of New York Faculty Research and Award Program, and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and through donations from private individuals.

Under Dodge’s leadership and with the efforts of numerous students, guests and artistic partners, the BC-CCM came to national prominence.  At that time the USA was leading the world in the field of computer music, and so this made the BC-CCM one of the world’s most highly regarded centers.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  During these years, the BC-CCM presented summer workshops, which were attended by musicians from around the world, and hosted residencies for many composers of national and international stature, including [[John Cage]], [[Lejaren Hiller]], [[Laurie Spiegel]], and Judy Klein, [[Larry Austin]], the [[Fylkingen]] Group from Stockholm, EMS Sweden, [[Robert Dick]], [[Bob Ostertag]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Jon Appleton]], [[Noah Creshevsky]], [[James C. Mobberley]], [[Jean Claude Risset]], [[Lars Gunnar Bodin]], Sten Hanson, and directors of IMEB Françoise Barriere and Christian Clozier.  This helped attract outstanding students, some of whom are now leaders in the field today, including Curtis Bahn (faculty, [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]), Matthew Suttor (faculty, [[Yale]]), Jason Stanyek (faculty, [[NYU]]), and Madelyne Byrne (faculty, [[Palomar College]]).

In the early 1990s after Charles Dodge stepped down as Director of the BC-CCM [[Noah Creshevsky]] assumed the directorship, with [[George Brunner (composer)|George Brunner]] as Technical Director.   It was at this time that the CCM began to host an International Electro-Acoustic Music Festival and concert series, offering performances of music, video, film, and live electronic works by artists from around the world.  When Noah Creshevsky retired in 2000, George Brunner took over as Acting Director until [[Amnon Wolman]] was named Director in 2003. Douglas Cohen generously served as Acting Director while Wolman was on an extended leave, and [[Douglas Geers]] joined the faculty as Director of the BC-CCM in fall of 2009.

Current faculty include composer [[Douglas Geers]], Director; composer-producer [[George Brunner (composer)|George Brunner]], Director of Music Technology; composer Doug Cohen, Associate Director;  guitarist/composer [[David Grubbs]]; media artist [[John J.A. Jannone]]; audio producer Miguel Macias; and computer scientist Elizabeth Sklar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61930">'''California pottery''' includes industrial, commercial, and decorative [[pottery]] produced in the [[Northern California]] and [[Southern California]] regions of the U.S. state of [[California]].  Production includes [[brick]], [[Sanitary sewer|sewer pipe]], [[Architectural terracotta|architectural terra cotta]], [[tile]], garden ware, [[tableware]], [[kitchenware]], [[art ware]], [[figurine]]s, [[giftware]], and [[industrial ceramic|ceramics for industrial use]].  [[Ceramic]]s include [[terra cotta]], [[earthenware]], [[porcelain]], and [[stoneware]] products.

[[File:Freeman leidy bird.jpg|thumb|''Ceramic Originals'' by Freeman-Leidy, [[Crane (bird)|crane]] [[figurine]].]]
Key milestones in the history of California pottery include: the arrival of Spanish settlers, the advent of Statehood and subsequent population growth, the [[arts and crafts movement]], [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]] era and the post-WWII onslaught of low-priced imports leading to a steep decline in the number of California potteries. California potters large and small have left a legacy of tableware design, collectibles, art, and architecture.

== History ==
Tile has been a favorite building material in California since the early Spanish settled the area and brought with them the tradition of using brightly-colored tiles in architecture. Helen Stiles, author of numerous books on the history of pottery, noted that [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Mexico|Mexican]], and  [[China|Chinese]] design of the 17th and 18th centuries all influenced the decoration of tile and other pottery in California.&lt;ref name=stiles&gt;{{cite book|last=Stiles|first=Helen E.|title=Pottery in the United States|year=1941|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc.|location=New York|pages= 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As people moved into California after statehood in 1848, the demand for ceramic products grew exponentially. Buildings needed roofs, floors, and sewer pipes.  The ceramic industry grew as the demand increased.  The "Golden Era in tile making"&lt;ref name= catile02 /&gt; and [[art pottery]], influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], was around 1910. Architect [[Julia Morgan]] used tiles to adorn her buildings including the [[Hearst Castle]] in the 1920s.

The most active period for the production of household ceramics including tableware, kitchenware, giftware, and [[art ware]] was from the 1930s through the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  The major area of U.S. household ceramics production was in the [[Los Angeles basin]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Around Los Angeles there were over 300 producers of figurines. Next in size was the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area, followed by [[East Liverpool, Ohio|East Liverpool]], and a few in the middle west such as [[Ceramic Arts Studio]], [[Red Wing Pottery]]  and [[Haeger Potteries]].&lt;ref name=ci1044&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Brave New Label Figurines, Made in U.S.A.|journal=Ceramic Industry|date=October 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period around [[World War II]] saw the greatest growth for the U.S. ceramic industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} With imports cut off from European and Asian markets, small family-owned and larger potteries stepped in to fill the need for ceramic giftware and tableware throughout the United States. By 1948, "the peak year for the industry, over eight hundred ceramic concerns were in operation throughout California." &lt;ref name=chipmanCP /&gt;
With sunlight year round, an abundance of raw materials, and relatively inexpensive natural gas, California became competitive with centers of ceramic production such as the "Pottery Capital of the World" [[East Liverpool, Ohio]] and [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], [[England]].

In the 1950s, favorable trade agreements toward Asian countries contributed to a flood of competitively priced ceramic wares entering the [[United States]] market. Only a fraction of California potteries survived this competition through the early 1960s.  Today, only a few are still in business.

=== "Big Five" California potteries ===
The "Big Five"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Colored Pottery, California Manufacturers Lead the World in Beauty of Design and Coloring|journal=California Magazine of Pacific Business|date=September 1937|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; California potteries, from the 1930s to the 1960s in reference to the range of products and output, were [[Vernon Kilns]], [[Bauer Pottery|J.A. Bauer Pottery]], [[Metlox Pottery|Metlox Potteries]], [[Pacific Pottery|Pacific Clay Products]], and [[Gladding, McBean|Gladding, McBean &amp; Co]].  All of the "Big Five" potteries operated production facilities in the [[Los Angeles Basin]].  Gladding, McBean &amp; Co. grew from one factory manufacturing sewer pipe and architectural terra cotta in Lincoln, California to factories throughout California and the [[Pacific Northwest]].  Vernon Kilns closed in 1958, J.A. Bauer in 1962, and Metlox in 1988. The former Gladding, McBean &amp; Co.'s Franciscan tableware and tile factory in Los Angeles was bought by [[Wedgwood]] from the Interpace corporation in 1979.  Wedgwood closed the Franciscan Ceramics plant in 1984, moving production of the Franciscan tableware brands to England.  The former Gladding, McBean &amp; Co.'s Lincoln factory was purchased by Pacific Coast Building Products in 1976 and continues to produce sewer pipe, architectural terra cotta, and terra cotta garden ware. Pacific Clay Products discontinued manufacturing tableware, art ware, and figurines in 1942.  Pacific Clay Products continues to manufacture sewer pipe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">A '''cutting balloon''' is an [[angioplasty]] device invented by Barath ''et al.'' used in [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]s. It has a special balloon tip with small blades, that are activated when the balloon is inflated. This procedure is different from Rotoblation (Percutaneous Transluminal Rotational '''[[Atherectomy]]''' or PCRA) whereby a [[diamond]] tipped device spins at high revolutions to cut away calcific (chalky) [[atheroma]] usually prior to [[coronary stent]]ing. Boston Scientific's Flextome is the most widely used cutting balloon.

The [[Philippines|Philippines']] '''Department of Energy''' ({{lang-fil|Kagawaran ng Enerhiya|}}, abbreviated as '''DOE''') is the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|executive department]] of the [[Philippine Government]] responsible for preparing, integrating, manipulating, organizing, coordinating, supervising and controlling all plans, programs, projects and activities of the Government relative to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution and conservation.

==History==
The Department of Energy was created by then President Marcos as he issued Presidential Decree No. 1206 which created the Ministry of Energy and attached the National Power Corporation and Philippine National Oil Company to this new agency. The Ministry and its two bureaus (Bureau of Energy Development and Bureau of Energy Utilization) remained intact but was downgraded into a mere Office of Energy Affairs--headed by Wenceslao de la Paz and reporting to then Deputy Executive Secretary for Energy Catalino Macaraig, Jr. based in Malacanang--during the regime of President Corazon Aquino. During the regime of President Fidel V. Ramos, the Department was created due to [http://www.doe.gov.ph/popup/RA%207638.pdf Republic Act No. 7638] otherwise known as the ''Department of Energy Act of 1992''.

The Department was vested additional powers and functions under pertinent energy and power-related legislations, such as Republic Act (RA) No. 9136 or the "Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001", RA No. 9367 or "Biofuels Act of 2006", and RA No. 9513 or "Renewable Energy Act of 2008.

==Organization==
The Department is headed by the Secretary of Energy who is assisted by three Undersecretaries and three Assistant Secretaries. Under the Department are the Administrative Service, Financial Service, Information Technology and Management Service, Legal Service and Energy Research Testing and Laboratory Service. 

The Department is composed of the following bureaus: 
*Energy Resource Development Bureau,
*Energy Utilization Management Bureau,
*Energy Policy and Planning Bureau,
*Oil Industry Management Bureau,
*Electric Power Industry Management Bureau, and
*Renewable Energy Management Bureau.

The following units, agencies and corporations are attached to the Department:
*National Biofuels Board (NBB)
*[[National Power Corporation]] (NPC/Napocor)
*[[National Transmission Corporation]] (TransCo)
*[[National Electrification Administration]] (NEA)
*[[Philippine National Oil Company]] (PNOC)
*Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM Corp.)

===Philippine Energy Plan 2009–2030===

Due to the rapid growth of the country's population&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=rp&amp;v=24&lt;/ref&gt; and the interrelated growing of the country's demand for energy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe.gov.ph/efficiency/energy_outlook.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Energy (DOE) introduced its [[Philippine]] Energy Plan 2009–2030.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe.gov.ph/PEP/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan for the period 2009–2030 mentions three broad policy thrusts based on the concept of enabling better energy choices for a better quality of life.

On April 28, 2010, Director Jesus Tamang&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philippinechamber.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=846:doe-presents-philippine-energy-plan&amp;catid=31:energy&amp;Itemid=78&lt;/ref&gt; of the Energy Policy and Planning Bureau explained that keeping the self-sufficiency level on nearly 60% will be challenging, but he also stated that a way to counter-streer this massive population growth was the country's future investments in new projects that are targeted in the plan.

The DOE's proposal consists of these following three principles that will have an important impact within the next 20 years on the country’s energy future:

====Ensure energy security====
* Accelerate the exploration and development of oil, gas and coal resources
* Intensify development and utilization of renewable and environment-friendly alternative energy resources and technologies
* Enhance energy efficiency and conservation
* Put in place long-term reliable power supply
* Improve transmission and distribution systems
* Secure vital energy infrastructure and facilities
* Maintain a competitive energy investment climate

====Pursue effective implementation of energy sector reforms====
* Monitor the implementation of, and if necessary, recommend amendments to, existing energy laws
* Promote an efficient, competitive, transparent and reliable energy sector
* Advocate the passage of new and necessary laws

====Implement social mobilization and cross-sector monitoring mechanisms====
* Expand reach through information, education and communication
* Establish cross-sector monitoring mechanism in cooperation with other national government agencies, academe, local government units, non-government organizations and other local and international organizations
* Promote good governance

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5440">A '''dielectric resonator antenna''' (DRA) is a radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] mostly used at [[microwave]] frequencies and higher, that consists of a block of [[ceramic]] material of various shapes, the [[dielectric resonator]], mounted on a metal surface, a [[ground plane]].  Radio waves are introduced into the inside of the resonator material from the [[transmitter]] circuit and bounce back and forth between the resonator walls, forming [[standing waves]].  The walls of the resonator are partially transparent to radio waves, allowing the radio power to radiate into space.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite book

An advantage of dielectric resonator antennas is they lack metal parts, which become lossy at high frequencies, dissipating energy.   So these antennas can have lower losses and be more efficient than metal antennas at high microwave and [[millimeter wave]] frequencies.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;  Dielectric waveguide antennas are used in some compact portable wireless devices, and military millimeter-wave radar equipment.  The antenna was first proposed by Robert Richtmyer in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Robert|last1=Richtmeyer|title=Dielectric Resonators,|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=10|pages=391|year=1939|doi=10.1063/1.1707320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982, Long et al. did the first design and test of dielectric resonator antennas considering a leaky waveguide model assuming magnetic conductor model of the dielectric surface .&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=S.|last1=Long|first2=M.|last2=McAllister|first3=L.|last3=Shen|title=The Resonant Cylindrical Dielectric Resonator Antenna,|journal=IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation|volume=31|pages=406–412|year=1983|doi=10.1109/tap.1983.1143080}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An antenna like effect is achieved by periodic swing of electrons from its capacitive element to the ground plane which behaves like an inductor. The authors further argued that the operation of a dielectric antenna resembles the antenna conceived by [[Guglielmo_Marconi|Marconi]], the only difference is that inductive element is replaced by the dielectric material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Theory Leads to Gigahertz Antenna on Chip|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/wireless/gigahertz-antenna-on-a-chip |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Dielectric resonator antennas offer the following attractive features:

* The dimension of a DRA is of the order of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_0} {\sqrt{\epsilon_r}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; is the free-space wavelength and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Relative static permittivity|dielectric constant]] of the resonator material. Thus, by choosing a high value of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r\approx10-100&lt;/math&gt;), the size of the DRA can be significantly reduced.
* There is no inherent conductor loss in dielectric resonators. This leads to high radiation efficiency of the antenna. This feature is especially attractive for millimeter (mm)-wave antennas, where the loss in metal fabricated antennas can be high.
* DRAs offer simple coupling schemes to nearly all transmission lines used at microwave and mm-wave frequencies. This makes them suitable for integration into different planar technologies. The coupling between a DRA and the planar transmission line can be easily controlled by varying the position of the DRA with respect to the line. The performance of DRA can therefore be easily optimized experimentally.
* The operating bandwidth of a DRA can be varied over a wide range by suitably choosing resonator parameters. For example, the bandwidth of the lower order modes of a DRA can be easily varied from a fraction of a percent to about 20% or more by the suitable choice of the dielectric constant of the material and/or by strategic shaping of the DRA element.
*Use of multiple modes radiating identically has also been successfully addressed.
* Each mode of a DRA has a unique internal and associated external field distribution. Therefore, different radiation characteristics can be obtained by exciting different modes of a DRA.

Energy [[crop]]s of this sort can be used in conventional power stations or specialised electricity generation units, reducing the amount of [[fossil fuel]]-derived [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.]]

An '''energy crop''' is a [[plant]] grown as a low-cost and low-maintenance [[harvest]] used to make [[biofuel]]s, such as [[bioethanol]], or combusted for its [[energy content]] to generate electricity or heat. Energy [[crop]]s are generally categorized as woody or [[herbaceous]] plants; many of the latter are grasses of the family ''[[Graminaceae]]''.

Commercial energy crops are typically densely planted, high-yielding crop species which are processed to bio-fuel and burnt to generate power. Woody crops such as [[Salix|willow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Types==

===By state===

====Solid biomass====
[[File:Public Footpath Through Elephant Grass - geograph.org.uk - 291522.jpg|thumb|Elephant grass (''[[Miscanthus sinensis]]'') is an experimental energy crop]]

Energy generated by burning plants grown for the purpose, often after the dry matter is [[Pelletizing|pelletized]]. Energy crops are used for firing power plants, either alone or co-fired with other fuels. Alternatively they may be used for heat or [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) production.

To cover the increasing requirements of woody biomass, [[short rotation coppice]] (SRC) were applied to agricultural sites. Within this cropping systems fast growing tree species like [[willow]]s and [[Populus|poplars]] are planted in growing cycles of three to five years. The cultivation of this cultures is dependent on wet soil conditions and could be an alternative for moist field sieds. However, an influence on local water conditions could not be excluded. This indicates that an establishment should exclude the vicinity to vulnerable [[wetland]] ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartwich|first=Jens|year=2017|title=Assessment of the regional suitability of short rotation coppice in Germany (PDF Download Available)|url=http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.2.17825.20326|journal=Doctoral Thesis.

====Gas biomass (methane)====
[[Anaerobic digesters]] or biogas plants can be directly supplemented with energy crops once they have been ensiled into [[silage]]. The fastest growing sector of German biofarming has been in the area of "Renewable Energy Crops" on nearly {{convert|500,000|ha|acre|abbr=in}} of land (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Use of BioMass|url=http://www.theenvironmentalist.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy crops can also be grown to boost gas yields where feedstocks have a low energy content, such as manures and spoiled grain. It is estimated that the energy yield presently of bioenergy crops converted via silage to methane is about {{convert|2|GWh/km²|BTU/sqmi|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Small mixed cropping enterprises with animals can use a portion of their acreage to grow and convert energy crops and sustain the entire farms energy requirements with about one fifth of the acreage. In Europe and especially Germany, however, this rapid growth has occurred only with substantial government support, as in the German bonus system for [[renewable energy]]. Similar developments of integrating crop farming and bioenergy production via silage-methane have been almost entirely overlooked in N. America, where political and structural issues and a huge continued push to centralize energy production has overshadowed positive developments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Liquid biomass====

===== Biodiesel =====
[[File:Kerala coconut.jpg|thumb|Coconuts sun-dried in [[Kozhikode]], [[Kerala]] for making copra, the dried meat, or kernel, of the [[coconut]]. [[Coconut oil]] extracted from it has made copra an important agricultural commodity for many coconut-producing countries. It also yields coconut cake which is mainly used as [[fodder|feed]] for livestock.]]
[[File:Bequer-B100-SOJA-SOYBEAM.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Pure biodiesel (B-100), made from soybeans]]
European production of [[biodiesel]] from energy crops has grown steadily in the last decade, principally focused on [[rapeseed]] used for oil and energy. Production of oil/biodiesel from rape covers more than 12,000&amp;nbsp;km² in Germany alone, and has doubled in the past 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Umer|title=Bio Mass Energy|url=http://biomassenergyintroduction.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- "in the past 15 years" is basically meaningless without a citation date--&gt; Typical yield of oil as pure biodiesel may be is {{convert|100,000|L/km²|USgal/sqmi impgal/sqmi|abbr=on}} or more, making biodiesel crops economically attractive, provided sustainable [[crop rotation]]s exist that are nutrient-balanced and preventative of the spread of disease such as [[clubroot]]. Biodiesel yield of soybeans is significantly lower than that of rape.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===== Bioethanol =====
Energy crops for [[biobutanol]] are [[grasses]]. Two leading non-food crops for the production of [[cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic bioethanol]] are [[switchgrass]] and [[giant miscanthus]].
There has been a preoccupation with cellulosic bioethanol in America as the agricultural structure supporting biomethane is absent in many regions, with no credits or bonus system in place.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Consequently, a lot of private money and investor hopes are being pinned on marketable and patentable innovations in enzyme hydrolysis and the like.

[[Bioethanol]] also refers to the technology of using principally corn (maize seed) to make ethanol directly through fermentation, a process that under certain field and process conditions can consume as much energy as is the energy value of the ethanol it produces, therefore being non-sustainable. New developments in converting grain stillage (referred to as distillers grain stillage or DGS) into biogas energy looks promising as a means to improve the poor energy ratio of this type of bioethanol process.

===By dedication===
{{Main article|Food vs fuel}}

Dedicated energy crops are non-[[food]] energy crops as [[giant miscanthus]], [[switchgrass]], [[jatropha]], [[fungi]], and [[algae]]. Dedicated energy crops are promising cellulose sources that can be [[sustainability|sustainably produced]] in many regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007). [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/53174530/Industrial-Biotechnology-Is-Revolutionizing-the-Production-of-Ethanol ''Industrial Biotechnology Is Revolutionizing the Production of Ethanol Transportation Fuel''] pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[green waste]] byproducts of food and non-food energy crops can be used to produce various biofuels.

'''Finlaycolor''' was an early [[color photography]] process.

In ''[[Uncle Tungsten]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncle Tungsten|author=[[Oliver Sacks]]|year=2001|isbn=0-375-40448-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Sacks]] reminisces:{{cquote|The most exciting way of getting instant color was by a process called Finlaycolor, in which, in effect, three color-separation negatives were taken simultaneously by using a grid ruled with microscopic red, green and violet lines. One then made a positive, a [[lantern slide]] from this negative, and brought it into exact alignment with the grid. This was tricky, delicate, but when one had them in perfect register, the previously black-and-white slide would burst into full color. Since the screen, with its microscopic lines, simply appeared grey, one saw, when it was juxtaposed with the slide, the most magical, unexpected creation of color, where seemingly there had been none before. (The ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' originally used Finlaycolor, and one could see the fine lines on these if one looked with a [[magnifying glass]].)}}

The '''flatrod system''' ({{lang-de|italic=yes|Kunstgestänge, Stangenkunst, Stangenwerk,}} or ''Stangenleitung''; {{lang-sv|italic=yes|Konstgång}} or ''Stånggång'') was an invention of the [[mining industry]] that enabled the mechanical movement generated by a water wheel (German: ''Kunstrad'') to be transferred over short distances.&lt;ref name="Quelle 1"&gt;''Bergmännisches Wörterbuch.'' Bey Johann Christoph Stößel, Chemnitz 1778&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented in the 16th century and by the 18th century was being used to transmit power up to four kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;''Stronger Than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel'' Terry S. Reynolds 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Flatrod systems were widely used in the [[Harz]] and [[Ore Mountains]] of Germany as well as in [[Cornwall]], [[England]] and [[Bergslagen]] in [[Sweden]].

A replica of a flatrod system may be seen in [[Bad Kösen]] in Germany on the River [[Saale]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaues-band.de/saale/index.htm?badkoesen.htm Blaues Band durch Sachsen-Anhalt: Bad Kösen]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a replica water wheel, used to drive flatrods, in [[Clausthal-Zellerfeld]] in the [[Upper Harz]], formerly the biggest mining region in Europe.

== Fundamentals ==
[[File:Sördalens konstgång 2012.webm|thumb|thumbtime=8|Function (video) of the flatrod system in Sördalen, [[Sweden]].]]
The flatrod system dates to the period before the invention of the [[steam engine]] and [[electricity]]. Using flatrods it was possible to operate [[man engine]]s and pumping systems, even though the water wheel in question had a rotary, not a reciprocal, motion. So that the rods could be made to move in a reciprocal fashion, a change of direction had to be achieved by means of specially shaped components.&lt;ref name="Quelle 3"&gt;Franz Adolf Fürer: ''Salzbergbau und Salinenkunde.'' Druck und Verlag von Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn, Braunschweig 1900&lt;/ref&gt; The components of the system that were mounted in the [[shaft mining|mining shaft]] were called shaft rods (''Schachtgestänge'') or pump rods (''Hubgestänge''). Systems mounted in [[drift mines]] were called drift rods (''Streckengestänge'').&lt;ref&gt;''Bericht vom Bergbau.'' Bey Siegfried Leberecht Crusius, Leipzig 1772&lt;/ref&gt;

The flatrods (''Feldgestänge'') themselves were used to transfer power over greater distances between the main engine and the pump rods.&lt;ref name="Quelle 3" /&gt; Iron collars (''Kunstringe'') were fitted onto the wheel axles, connecting pipes (''Ansetzröhren'') and metal sleeves (''Ansteckkielen'') as well as certain parts of the wooden flatrods. The actual rods (''Kunststangen'') were long squared timbers that transmitted the power horizontally or at an incline. They had articulated iron joints (''Kunstschlösser'' or ''Stangenschlösser'') that were designed such that they could be interleaved into one another and secured with bolts or screws.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Friedrich Richter: ''Neuestes Berg-und Hütten-Lexikon.'' Erster Band,  Kleefeldsche Buchhandlung, Leipzig 1805&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifting rods ==
[[File:Man engine animation.gif|thumb|Flatrod system in operation]]
The lifting rod system ran vertically up the [[shaft mining|mineshaft]], either to transfer power to the individual sets of shaft pumps (when they were known as pump rods) or, in the case of man engines, to operate the man engine rods. In some cases the lifting rod system performed both duties. It consisted of roughly 19 to 20 centimetre thick squared spruce timbers. The poles were dovetailed at the ends and sides and were fixed to one another with correspondingly mortised wooden joints (''Holzlaschen''). These joints were tightly bound to the ends of the lifting rods with iron collars. In addition the iron collars were prevented from slipping by bolts inserted through them. At set distances there were also hooks on the sides that were used to hang the piston rods (''Kolbenstangen''). So that the horizontal movement of the flat rods could be turned into a vertical movement, a rotating cross-shaped lever (''Kunstkreuz'') was fitted to the lifting rods.  Connexion to the cross lever was achieved using a crank (''Kunstschloss''). To balance the load it was usual to have two lifting rods.&lt;ref name="Quelle 3" /&gt;

== Flatrods ==

[[File:Schacht am Carler Teich.jpg|thumb|Replica of the flatrod system at the Carler Teich, Clausthal-Zellerfeld]]
The purpose of the flatrods was to transfer the power of the motive engine over greater distances to the pump rods in the shaft. This was necessary if the motive engine could not be mounted above or immediately next to the mine shaft. A flatrod system had the disadvantage that there were additional efficiency losses due to the greater masses that had to be moved. The reciprocal motion in the joints (''Schlösser'') of the interconnected flatrods lead to lifting losses of from 25 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name="Quelle 2"&gt;Joh. Jos. Prechtl (ed.): ''Technologische Encyklopädie oder alphabetisches Handbuch der Technologie, der technischen Chemie und des Maschinenwesens.'' Fünfter Band, Verlag der J. G. Gotta'schen Buchhandlung, Stuttgart, 1834&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the construction of flatrods required additional timber. This was very maintenance-intensive due to the effects of weathering and it needed additional staff to inspect and maintain the flatrods.

The flatrods consisted of several wooden rods, fitted with iron hinges. At the ends of the rods, on either side, were so-called ''Kunstschlösser''. These were cut to fit in such a way that one rod could be mortised into another. This was necessary so that the flatrods could not slide apart as a result of to-and-fro or up-and-down motion.&lt;ref name="Quelle 1" /&gt;

There were two types of flatrod: flatrods with rollers and flatrods with oscillating cranks (''Schwingen''). The former were laid on rollers. The rollers consisted of round timbers about eight to ten inches thick, that were firmly set into the ground on their underside and fixed in place with braces. In order to minimise friction, the rod was fitted with a drag rail (''Schleppschiene'') in the area of the individual rollers that was made of beechwood and long enough to for the entire stroke length.&lt;ref name="Quelle 2" /&gt;
&lt;!--

Das Feldgestänge mit Schwingen besteht aus einer großen Schwinge, dem sogenannten Wagbaum, aus mehreren kleinen Schwingen, den Feldstangen, und den sogenannten Löcken mit Straßbäumen. In der Mitte der Hauptschwinge befindet sich ein durchlaufender Zapfen, auf dem sie sich im Pfoteisen bewegt. An den beiden Enden der Hauptschwinge sind mehrere Löcher eingebracht, in denen mit eisernen Ringen befestigte Augeisen eingefügt sind. In jedem Augeisen sind bis zu drei Augen, in die auf der einen Seite die Korbstange und auf der anderen Seite die Feldstange eingehängt werden. Um den Hub variabel zu machen, werden extra mehrere Augen angebracht. Um den Hub länger oder kürzer zu machen, wird die Korbstange entsprechend eingehängt. Die Schwingarme der kleineren Schwingen dienen dazu, das Feldgestänge entsprechend anzupassen. Diese Anpassung ist erforderlich, da das Feldgestänge ansonsten aufgrund seiner Länge leicht brechen würde. Die sogenannten Löcke sind erhöhte Unterlagen für die Schwingen. Sie werden alle 2 bis 3 [[Klafter]] aufgestellt und haben am oberen Ende krumme Stangen - die sogenannten Stecklinge. Die Löcke werden mit Spreizen und Unterlageklötzen so versehen, dass das Gestänge höhenmäßig so angepasst wird, damit die Feldstangen sich in gerader Linie bewegen können. Sämtliche Zapfen an den Schwingen sind so angepasst, dass sie von beiden gleichweit entfernt sind.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Stegmayer: ''Handbuch der Bergbaukunst für Jedermann.'' Verlag von J. L. Kober, Prag 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bewegungsrichtungsumkehr ==
[[Bild:kunstgestaenge.png|miniatur|Prinzipskizze der Bewegungsrichtungsumkehr]]
[[Bild:Kunstrad.jpg|miniatur|Rekonstruktion eines Kunstrades mit 11,5m Durchmesser, [[Clausthal-Zellerfeld]]]]
Bei der Umkehrung der Bewegung von der Drehbewegung in die horizontale oder vertikale Bewegung, aber auch von der horizontale Bewegung in die vertikale Bewegung, bediente man sich speziell geformter Gestängeteile: zum einen dem '''Krummzapfen''' und zum anderen dem '''Kunstkreuz'''.

Der Krummzapfen ist ein unter einem rechten Winkel gebogenes Gestängeteil, das als Fortsetzung des Wellenzapfens dient. Seine Aufgabe ist es, die Drehbewegung des [[Wasserrad]]es in eine horizontale oder vertikale Bewegung umzuformen.&lt;ref&gt; Carl von Scheuchenstuel: ''IDIOTICON der österreichischen Berg- und Hüttensprache.'' k. k. Hofbuchhändler Wilhelm Braumüller, Wien 1856&lt;/ref&gt; An dem Krummzapfen befand sich die sogenannte Korb- oder Bläuelstange. Mit dem ''krummen Zapfen'' wurde die Rotationsbewegung des Kunstrades auf das Feldgestänge oder das Schachtgestänge übertragen, das daraufhin Pendelbewegungen ausführt. Die Funktionsweise des Krummzapfens ist sehr ähnlich mit der Funktion einer heutigen [[Kurbelwelle]] und die Bläuelstange mit der Funktion eines [[Pleuel]]s zu vergleichen.

Das Kunstkreuz, auch ''Bruchzwinge'', ''Kunstwinkel'' oder einfach nur ''Kreuz'' genannt, besteht aus einem starken hölzernen Winkelhebel. Das Kunstkreuz wurde entweder direkt an der Korbstange des Krummzapfens angeschlossen oder über ein Feldgestänge damit verbunden. Es gab drei verschiedene Arten von Kunstkreuzen. Je nach Konstruktion bezeichnete man sie als ganze Kunstkreuze, halbe Kunstkreuze oder Viertelskreuze. Das ganze Kunstkreuz ist ein Kreuz mit vier Armen. Von diesen Armen werden jeweils zwei sich gegenüberstehende Arme an das Schachtgestänge und die beiden anderen Arme an das Feldgestänge angeschlossen. Das halbe Kreuz ist ein Kreuz mit drei Armen. Zwei Arme liegen dabei horizontal, der dritte steht aufrecht. An die beiden horizontalen Arme wurde das Schachtgestänge und an den dritten Arm die Korbstange angeschlossen. Beim Viertelkreuz wird ein Arm an das Gestänge und ein Arm an die Bläuelstange angeschlossen.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Veith: ''Deutsches Bergwörterbuch mit Belegen.'' Verlag von Wilhelm Gottlieb Korn, Breslau 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

Die Verwendung von Kunstkreuzen war zur Kraftumlenkung aus verschiedenen Gründen unentbehrlich. Selbst wenn das Kunstrad direkt über dem Kunstschacht montiert war, entstand durch das direkte Anhängen der Schachtgestänge an den Krummzapfen eine sehr hohe Belastung der sogenannten Kurbelwarzen. Auch war die [[Reibung]] bei der Direktmontage wesentlich größer. Außerdem erzeugten die Schachtstangen nie eine ganz "saubere" senkrechte Bewegung, sondern pendelten seitlich etwas hin und her.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Heinrich Moritz Poppe: ''Encyclopädie des gesammten Maschinenwesens, oder vollständiger Unterricht in der praktischen Mechanik und Maschinenlehre.'' Dritter Theil, bey Georg Voß, Leipzig 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flow Cups''' are designed to accurately measure the [[viscosity]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/viscosity&lt;/ref&gt; of paints, inks, varnishes and similar products.

The process of flow through an [[Orifice plate|orifice]] can often be used as a relative measurement and classification of viscosity.

This measured [[Viscosity#Kinematic viscosity .7F.27.22.60UNIQ--postMath-00000012-QINU.60.22.27.7F|kinematic viscosity]] is generally expressed in seconds of flow time which can be converted into centistokes (cSt) using a [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation#Viscosity|viscosity calculator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byk.com/fileadmin/BYK/downloads/support-downloads/instruments/theory/physical-properties/en/Intro_Viscosity.pdf Viscosity]. BYK-Gardner GmbH&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow cups are manufactured using high grade aluminium alloy with stainless steel orifices (where indicated), Flow Cups are available with a range of [[ISO/IEC 17025|UKAS / ISO 17025]] certified standard oils to confirm the flow cup is measuring within specification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4358">[[File:ILSC in progress.jpg|thumb|right|An ILSC scan in progress]]'''Intelligent laser speckle classification''', or '''ILSC''', is a scanning method used to discriminate between various micro-textural structures, such as the [[cellular component]]s in human skin.&lt;ref name=Photonics&gt;{{cite web|title=Noninvasive Imaging Method Promising for Skin Assessment|url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=56111|publisher=Photonics|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or discriminates sub-surface characteristics of any material (e.g. industrial, pharmaceutical, etc.)

==Basic concept==
An ILSC scanner is composed mainly of two instruments: A [[laser]] and a modified [[Charge-coupled device#Color cameras|CCD camera]]. [[File:ILSC Diagram.png|thumb|right|Diagram of an ILSC scan]] Light from the laser interacts uniquely with various micro-textural structures, creating a specific laser speckle effect (or ''signature''). This signature can then be read by the incorporated camera, which utilizes [[Bayesian inference]] and inbuilt libraries of micro-textures to create a "laser speckle image" of the target.&lt;ref name="K University"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laser Doppler, speckle and related techniques for blood perfusion mapping and imaging|url=http://home.lu.lv/~ozoma/Ma%ECistri-2013/Diagnostika_un_terapija/terap/Asins-pluusmas-meeriisanai-dazi-info/PM_R35.pdf|publisher=Kingston University|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the method is comparative, it may also be used to differentiate very small changes in micro-structural objects, for example, a change in cell size. This ability to generate "comparative" laser speckle images is again due to the interactions between the laser and the cellular objects.&lt;ref&gt;Orun, A.B,  E. Goodyer, H.Seker, G. Smith, V.Uslan And D. Chauhan, "Optimized parametric skin modelling
 for diagnosis of skin abnormalities by combining light back-scatter and laser speckle imaging", Skin Research
 and Technology,  2014; 1-13. doi:10.1111/srt.12142
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The concept has been found to be very effective in analyzing human skin for issues caused by ageing, especially in the lower layers of the [[epidermis]], such as the [[Stratum basale|basal layer]], and has also been found to be less invasive than other methods, such as [[confocal microscopy]].&lt;ref name="DM University"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orun|first1=Ahmet|title=An improvement of skin aging assessment by non-invasive laser speckle effect: A comparative texture analysis|url=http://www.tech.dmu.ac.uk/~eg/ref/IEEE_BHI2014_Orun_Seker_203.pdf|publisher=De Montfort University|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The potential application areas of ILSC are as follows :

'''- Skin analysis:''' it is possible to make an automated parametric discrimination between the two different conditions of skin (e.g. normal or effected by a disease)that are invisible to human eye. This would be particularly very useful for early diagnosis of the systemic diseases where the skin does not yet exhibits their visual effects by the surface changes [3]

'''- Pharmaceutical inspection :'''ILSC is also used for pharmaceitical product inspection as the laser light (with an ideal wavelength) can penetrate into the pharmaceutical (tablet) subsurface and scatters back by conveying the subsurface material characteristics to be identified and analysed by ILSC technique &lt;ref&gt;5. Orun, A. and G.Smith, "Micro-Structural Analysis of Tablet Surface Layers by Intelligent Laser Speckle Classification (ILSC) Technique: an Application in the Study of both Surface Defects and Subsurface Granule Structures",Journal of Pharmaceutical Innovation, (2017)DOI 10.1007/s12247-017-9290-0&lt;/ref&gt; 
#
'''- Industrial material identification :''' Depending on laser-material surface interaction, ILSC can identify and discriminate the different materials that are used in industrial production areas (e.g. metal, wood, plastic, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;6. Orun, A. and A. Alkis, "Material identification by surface reflection analysis in combination with bundle adjustment technique", Pattern Recognition Letters,24(2003)&lt;/ref&gt; to make the production process in fully automated form by eliminating the most of environmental undesired lightening effects.

The group was formed in December 1998, out of interested parties from two previously-existing organizations, the [[Farmingdale, New York|Farmingdale]] Linux and Associated Technologies Club and the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] Local Linux Users Group. It meets monthly on the second Tuesday of each month on the [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]] Lab Woodbury Campus, in the Woodbury Auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;http://lilug.org/wiki/GeneralMeetingDirections&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special Interest Groups ==
Lilug has two special interest groups, one for developers and one for security.&lt;ref&gt;http://lilug.org/wiki/Lilug&lt;/ref&gt; The SIGs are usually smaller events with a more discussion-oriented approach.

== Notable speakers ==
* [[Eric S. Raymond]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osnews.com/story/21192&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mushon Zer-Aviv of the [[ShiftSpace]] project

Loitering munitions fit in the niche between [[cruise missile]]s and [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle]]s (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles in that they are designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.

Loitering weapons first emerged in the 1980s for use in the [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] (SEAD) role against [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield systems that fit in a backpack.

Loitering munitions have proliferated into use by at least 14 countries, with several different types in use as of 2017. The rising proliferation and the ability to use some systems as [[lethal autonomous weapon]]s coupled with ethical concerns over such use have led to research and discussion by [[International humanitarian law]] scholars and activists.

==History==
=== First development and terminology ===
[[File:Northrop AGM-136A Tacit Rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] [[AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow]] on display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.]]

Initially, loitering munitions were not referred to as such but rather as suicide UAVs or loitering missiles. Different sources point at different projects as originating the weapon category. The early 1980s initial Israeli [[Delilah (missile)|Delilah]] variants&lt;ref name="www.iaf.org.il IAF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/20090614_loitering_weapons.html Loitering Weapons are making a Comeback], Defense Update, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or the failed US [[AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow]] program&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/188865/Ethical%20Autonomy%20Working%20Paper_021015_v02.pdf An Introduction to Autonomy in Weapon Systems], pages 13-14, By: Paul Scharre and Michael C. Horowitz, CNAS Working paper, Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/1988/October%201988/1088uav.pdf Canan, James W. "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles." Air Force Magazine (1988).], page 87&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned by some sources. Alternatively, the late 1980s [[IAI Harpy]] which was widely exported is considered by some as the first loitering munition system.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DB7xDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=Harpy+UAV&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Harpy%20UAV&amp;f=false Drone Strike!: UCAVs and Aerial Warfare in the 21st Century]'', By Bill Yenne, {{ISBN|9781580072526}}, pages 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paris Air Show 2007-06-24 n25.jpg|thumb|[[IAI Harpy]] first-generation loitering munition for SEAD role]]

Early projects did not use the "loitering munition" nomenclature which emerged at a much later date, and used existing terminology at the time. For instance the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow was described as follows in a 1988 ''[[Air Force Magazine]]'' article: {{Quote|text=the Tacit Rainbow unmanned jet aircraft being developed by Northrop to loiter on high and then swoop down on enemy radars could be called a UAV, a cruise missile, or even a standoff weapon. But it is most definitely not an RPV.|source=[http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/1988/October%201988/1088uav.pdf Canan, James W. "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles." ''Air Force Magazine'' (1988)], page 87}}

=== Initial role in suppression of enemy air defense===
[[File:Syrian SAM.jpg|thumb|Part of a Syrian [[SA-6]] overlooking the Beqaa Valley, in early 1982]]
The response to the first generation of fixed installation [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) such as [[SA-2]] and [[SA-3]] was the development of the [[anti-radiation missile]] such as [[AGM-45 Shrike]] and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The [[Soviet]] counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as [[SA-6]] with intermittent use of [[radar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Modern Radar|first=Edward K.|last=Reedy|editor-first1=Jerry L.|editor-last1=Eaves|editor-first2=Edward K.|editor-last2=Reedy|date=1 January 1987|publisher=Springer US|pages=681–699|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-1971-9_22|chapter = Radar ECCM Considerations and Techniques|isbn = 978-1-4612-9170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value [[Wild Weasel]] fighters. In 1982 [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]] various means including [[UAV]]s and air-launched [[ADM-141 TALD|Samson decoys]] were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaf.org.il/625-19927-he/IAF.aspx Six Days in June (Hebrew)], IAF bulletin, issue 145, June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-SAM-Effectiveness.html Surface to Air Missile Effectiveness in Past Conflicts], Technical Report APA-TR-2010-1001, Dr Carlo Kopp, AFAIAA, SMIEEE, PEng, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, a number of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, integrated anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated the use of a drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/4760/meet-israels-suicide-squad-of-self-sacrificing-drones Meet Israel's 'Suicide Squad' of Self-Sacrificing Drones], August 2016, The Drive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a552529.pdf ADAPTIVE DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION FOR ANALYSIS OF HARPY SWARM ATTACK], Brandon J.

===Evolution into additional roles===
[[Image:NLOS-LS missile test launch from truck.jpg|thumb|[[XM501 Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System|XM501]] US prototype capable of launching LAM (loitering attack munition)]]

Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles beyond the initial SEAD role ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/20110914_fire-shadow-afghanistan.html British Army Sets to Deploy Fire Shadow Loitering Weapons to Afghanistan by Early 2012] Defense Update, September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; down to tactical, very short-range battlefield use such as the [[AeroVironment Switchblade]] which is deployed at the [[platoon]] level and fits in a backpack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2011/July/Pages/MilitaryInvestigatesKillerDronesThatCanFitinRucksacks.aspx Military Investigates Killer Drones That Can Fit in Rucksacks] National Defense, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/war-is-boring/a-tiny-missile-that-waits-overhead-silent-patient-and-deadly-6f5a0093cab0 A Tiny Missile That Waits Overhead—Silent, Patient and Deadly, WarIsBoring], January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2016/10/03/AeroVironment-producing-Switchblade-missiles-for-Army/1391475510902/ AeroVironment producing Switchblade missiles for Army] UPI, October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/features/du-1-07/armedUAVs_8.htm Loitering Autonomous Weapons], Defense Update, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A documented use of loitering munitions was in [[2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes]] in which an [[IAI Harop]] was used against a bus functioning as a troop transport.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/05/israeli-made-kamikaze-drone-spotted-in-nagorno-karabakh-conflict/ Israeli-made kamikaze drone spotted in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict], ''Washington Post'', April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Delilah missile side.jpg|thumb|Air-launched Delilah loitering munition, controlled by backseat [[Weapon systems officer|WSO]]]]

Loitering munitions may be as simple as an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) with attached explosives that is sent on a potential ''kamikaze'' mission, and may even be constructed with off the shelf commercial [[quadcopter]]s with strapped on explosives.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a23350/isis-using-kamikaze-drones-in-iraq/ ISIS Using Kamikaze Drones in Iraq], ''Popular Mechanics'', October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Purpose built munitions are more elaborate in flight and control capabilities, warhead size and design, and on-board sensors for locating targets.&lt;ref name="iClean"&gt;[http://www.dror-aero.com/ac/iclean/iclean_fr.pdf iClean – Loitering Attack UCAV], Artzi Dror, Technion Institute of Technology, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some loitering munitions use a human operator to locate targets whereas others, such as IAI Harop, can function autonomously searching and launching attacks without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/products/h/harop.html Israel Unveils Loitering Anti-Missile Drone], Defense Update, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/directory/harpy.htm Harpy Air Defense Suppression System], Defense Update, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some loitering munitions may return and be recovered by the operator if they are unused in an attack and have enough fuel; in particular this is characteristic of [[UAV]]s with a secondary suicide mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/20160216_rotem.html IAI's ROTEM – Tactical Multirotor Killer Drone], Defense Update, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems, such as [[Delilah (missile)|Delilah]]&lt;ref name="www.iaf.org.il IAF"&gt;[http://www.iaf.org.il/2158-28495-he/IAF.aspx The Secrets of Delialah (Hebrew)], IAF bulletin, issue 184, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/20090614_delilah-loitering-missile.html Delilah – The IAF Loitering Missile], Defense Update, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or IAI Harop,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; don't have a recovery option and are self-destructed in mission aborts.

Whereas some cruise missiles, such as [[Tomahawk (missile)|the block IV Tomahawk]], have the ability to loiter and have some sensory and remote control features,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-us-navy-has-big-plans-the-lethal-tomahawk-missile-16261?page=2 The U.S. Navy Has Big Plans for the Lethal Tomahawk Missile], The National Interest, Kris Osborn, 18th May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; their primary mission is typically strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and [[wings]] or [[lifting body]] design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Timothy, et al. "A multi-disciplinary survey of advanced subsonic tactical cruise missile configurations." 43rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely almost any [[UAV]] could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised explosive warhead.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However the primary use of a [[UAV]] or [[UCAV]] would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expendable mission use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rusi.org/sites/default/files/200808_op_unmanned_combat_air_vehicles.pdf|title=Franklin, Michael.

The primary mission of a loitering munition is reaching the suspected target area, target acquisition during a loitering phase, followed by a suicide strike, and the munition is optimized in this regard in terms of characteristics (e.g. very short engine life time, silence in strike phase, speed of strike dive, optimization toward loitering time instead of range/speed) and unit cost (appropriate for a one-off strike mission).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantis-press.com/php/download_paper.php?id=25855976|title=Liu, Xuancen, et al.

==Ethical and international humanitarian law concerns==
{{Main article|Lethal autonomous weapon#Ethical and legal issues}}

Loitering munitions that are capable of making autonomous attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may [[lock-on after launch]] or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern [[naval mine]]) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Denise.

'''Mud Gas Separator''' is commonly called a '''gas-buster''' or '''poor boy [[degasser]]'''. It captures and separates the large volumes of free gas within the [[drilling fluid]]. If there is a "kick" situation, this vessel separates the mud and the gas by allowing it to flow over baffle plates. The gas then is forced to flow through a line, venting to a [[Gas flare|flare]]. A "kick" situation happens when the [[Annulus (oil well)|annular]] [[Fluid statics|hydrostatic pressure]] in a drilling well temporarily (and usually relatively suddenly) falls below that of the formation, or [[Pore water pressure|pore]], pressure in a [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] section [[Downhole oil water separation technology|downhole]], and before control of the situation is lost.

It is always safe to design the mud/gas separator that will handle the maximum possible gas flow that can occur.&lt;ref&gt;Dilling Fluids Processing Handbook {{ISBN|0-7506-7775-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mud Equipment Manual {{ISBN|0-87201-614-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Mud/Gas Separators==
The principle of mud/gas separation for different types of vessels is the same.&lt;ref&gt;SPE Drilling Engineering, December 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* Closed bottom type
* Open bottom type
* Float type
The closed-bottom separator, as the name implies, is closed at the vessel bottom with the mud return line directed back to the mud tanks.
Commonly called the poor boy, the open-bottom [[mud gas separator]] is typically mounted on a mud tank or trip tank with the bottom of the separator body submerged in the mud.
Fluid level (mud leg) is maintained in a float-type mud gas separator by a float/valve configuration. The float opens and closes a valve on the mud return line to maintain the mud-leg level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aipusolidcontrol.com/html/products/gas-separator.html|title=Solids control Mud Gas Separators|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to pedestal or base type there are:
* Fixed type
* Elevating type

Poor boy degassers are usually named according to the vessel diameter. Types include:
* MGS800 
* MGS1000
* MGS1200
* MGS1400

The degasser type or configuration is typically customisable.

==Principle of operation==
The principle behind the '''mud gas separator''' is relatively simple. On the figure, the mud and gas mixture is fed at the inlet allowing it to impinge on a series of baffles designed to separate gas and mud. The free gas then is moved into the flare line to reduce the threat of toxic and hazardous gases and the mud then discharges to the [[shale shaker]] and to the tank.

A '''multileaf collimator''' ('''MLC''') is a device made up of individual "leaves" of a high atomic numbered material, usually [[tungsten]], that can move independently in and out of the path of a [[particle beam]] in order to block it.

MLCs are used on [[linear accelerator]]s to provide conformal shaping of [[radiotherapy]] treatment beams. Specifically, conformal radiotherapy and [[Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy]] (IMRT) can be delivered using MLCs.

The MLC has improved rapidly since its inception and the first use of leaves to shape structures in 1965 &lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, S., "Conformation radiotherapy: rotation techniques as applied to radiography and radiotherapy of cancer", ''Acta Radiol. Suppl. 242 (1965) 1–142''&lt;/ref&gt; to modern day operation and use. MLCs are now widely used and have become an integral part of any radiotherapy department. MLCs were primarily used for conformal radiotherapy, and have allowed the cost effective implementation of conformal treatment with significant time saving,&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, L.; Mohan, R.; Mageras, G.; Burman, C.; Leibel, S. and Fuks, Z., "Three dimensional conformal treatment planning with multileaf collimators", ''Int. J. Rad. Onc. Biol. Phys. 33 (1995) 1081–9''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helyer, S. J. and Heisig, S., "Multileaf collimation versus conventional shielding blocks: a time and motion study of beam shaping in radiotherapy", ''Rad. Onc. 37 (1995) 61–4''&lt;/ref&gt; and also have been adapted for use for IMRT treatments. For conformal radiotherapy the MLC allows conformal shaping of the linear accelerator (LINAC) beam to match the borders of the target tumour. For intensity modulated treatments the leaves of a MLC can be moved across the field to create IMRT distributions (MLCs really provide a [[fluence]] modulation rather than intensity modulation).

The MLC is an important tool for radiation therapy dose delivery. It was originally used as a surrogate for alloy block field shaping and is now widely used for IMRT. As with any tool used in radiotherapy the MLC must undergo commissioning and quality assurance. Additional commissioning measurements are completed to model a MLC for treatment planning. Various MLCs are provided by different vendors and they all have unique design features as determined by specifications of design,&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, J. M.; Smith, A. R. and Lally, B., "Characterization of a multi-leaf collimator system", ''Int. J. Rad. Onc. Biol. Phys. 25 (1993) 181–92''&lt;/ref&gt; and these differences are quite significant.

'''NJFX''', also known as '''New Jersey Fiber Exchange''', is a [[Wall Township, NJ]]-based data center operator.  The company offers [[Data center#Data Center Levels and Tiers|Tier 3]] [[data center]], [[meet-me room]] and [[colocation centre|colocation]] services from a 58 acre site adjacent to [[Tata Communications]]' [[Subsea (technology)|subsea]] [[cable landing station]].

==History==
NJFX was founded by Gil Santaliz, a telecommunications executive who in 2008 sold metro dark fiber provider 4Connections to Optimal Lightpath, a subsidiary of NY cable operator [[Cablevision]] (now Altice USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/orphan-articles/cablevisions-optimum-lightpath-buys-nj-fiber-provider/134195  |title=Cablevision's Optimum Lightpath Buys N.J. Fiber Provider |website=multichannel.com |date=2008-10-21 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tata Communications was a founding partner of NJFX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2016/11/tata-deploys-pop-at-new-jersey-fiber-exchange.html |title=Tata deploys PoP at New Jersey Fiber Exchange |website=lightwaveonline.com |date=2016-11-08 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJFX opened a [[meet-me room]] (MMR) within Tata Communication’s Wall, NJ subsea cable landing station (CLS).&lt;ref name=dcdynamics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/colo-cloud/njfx-to-open-data-center-at-new-jersey-cable-landing/94894.fullarticle|title=NJFX to open data center at New Jersey cable landing |website=datacenterdynamics.com |date=2015-09-29 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Tata's cables terminating in the cable landing station is the Seabras-1 undersea cable, which links North America and Brazil, with a landing point in [[Sao Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capacitymedia.com/Article/3421642/NJFX-launches-data-centre-with-access-to-Europe-and-South-America.html|title=NJFX launches data centre with access to Europe and South America |website=capacitymedia.com |date=2015-01-27 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tata's [[TGN Atlantic]] subsea cable also lands in Wall Township, connecting to [[Highbridge, Somerset|Highbridge]], [[Somerset]], [[United Kingdom]].  As the MMR operator, NJFX managed the network connections between its own customers and those of Tata Communication's CLS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecomreviewna.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1221:bringing-submarine-cable-landing-facilities-to-the-new-jersey-shore&amp;catid=64:march-april-2016&amp;Itemid=129|title=Bringing Submarine Cable Landing Facilities to the New Jersey Shore  |website=telecomreviewna.com |date=2016-03-01 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, NJFX announced they would be constructing a 64,000 sq ft Tier III data center adjacent to Tata's CLS, providing direct access to their European and South America subsea cables.&lt;ref name=dcdynamics/&gt;  Design would be done by Boston-based Bala Consulting Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transformingnetworkinfrastructure.com/topics/optical-networking/articles/410605-new-jersey-fiber-exchange-begins-construction-new-data.htm|title=New Jersey Fiber Exchange Begins Construction of New Data Center |publisher=transformingnetworkinfrastructure.com |date=2015-09-29 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, voice and data network provider [[Windstream]] announced it was extending its [[100 Gigabit Ethernet]] (100G) network from NJFX's presence at the CLS to [[Ashburn, Virginia]]'s Internet hub.&lt;ref name=fierce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/windstream-establishes-100g-express-route-red-hot-ashburn-va-market-njfx/2016-01-19 |title=Windstream establishes 100G express route in red-hot Ashburn, Va. market via NJFX |publisher=fiercetelecom.com |date=2016-01-19 |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the new data center came online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecomramblings.com/2016/09/industry-spotlight-gil-santaliz-njfxs-phase-2-launch/|title=Industry Spotlight: Gil Santaliz on NJFX’s "Tier 3 by the Subsea"|website=telecomramblings.com |date=2016-09-21 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, NJFX announced they were adding an additional data center on their campus.&lt;ref name=mission&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missioncriticalmagazine.com/articles/89008-njfx-to-expand-its-cable-landing-station-campus|title=  NJFX To Expand Its Cable Landing Station Campus |website=missioncriticalmagazine.com |date=2017-03-21|accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2211">[[file:CB_Base_Station.jpg|thumb|right| A [[Citizen's Band]] transceiver equipped with a noise blanker for the receiver, controlled by a button on the front panel (2nd from left)]]
In the [[Radio receiver design|design of radio receivers]], a '''noise blanker''' is a circuit intended to reduce the effect of certain kinds of radio noise on a received signal.

A noise blanker is a common feature on broadcast [[shortwave receiver]]s or [[communications receiver]]s and some types of two-way radio [[transceiver]]s.  The noise blanker is only effective on impulse-type noise such as from lightning or from automotive ignition systems, and cannot improve performance on wideband continuous background noise, or interfering signals on the same frequency.&lt;ref&gt; Cornell Drentea, ''Modern Communications Receiver Design and Technology'', Artech House, 2010, {{ISBN|1596933100}} pp. 316-319 &lt;/ref&gt;  In cases where there are strong signals on frequencies near to the desired frequency, a noise blanker circuit may be ineffective and may reduce the quality of the received signal. &lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Wilson (ed.),  ''The ARRL Operating Manual for Radio Amateurs'', American Radio Relay League, 2007,{{ISBN|0872591093}}, page 6-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Implementation ==
Typically this is a network in the [[intermediate frequency]] section of the receiver; when a pulse of noise passes through the IF amplifiers, it is usually of greater amplitude than the desired signal.  The noise blanker circuit momentarily reduces the gain of the IF stage during the impulse. More complex noise blankers may use a secondary IF stage and have adjustable threshold and timing characteristics so as to reduce the noise passed through to the audio stages of the receiver.

A noise blanker is best applied before any narrow-bandwidth filters in the signal path, so as not to introduce "ringing" and distortion in the filtered signal. Noise blankers are most useful with [[amplitude modulation]] or [[single sideband]] signals.  [[Frequency modulation]] receivers generally include a signal limiter stage which tends to reject noise pulses.

'''Nokia Internet Tablets''' is the name given to a range of [[Nokia]] mobile [[Internet appliance]]s products.  These tablets fall in the range between a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) and an [[Ultra-Mobile PC]] (UMPC), and slightly below [[Intel]]'s [[Mobile Internet device]] (MID).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nseries.com/index.html Nokia N-series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430035008/http://www.nseries.com/index.html |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early trials and predecessors ==
Nokia had plans for an [[Internet]] tablet since before 2000. An early model was test manufactured in 2001, the Nokia M510, which was running on [[EPOC (operating system)|EPOC]] and featuring an [[Opera (browser)|Opera]] browser, speakers and a 10-inch 800x600 screen, but it was not released because of fears that the market was not ready for it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitoday.fi/vimpaimet/2014/04/15/nokialla-oli-valmis-tabletti-13-vuotta-sitten--talta-se-naytti/20145333/66&lt;/ref&gt; The M510 was first leaked to the public in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.is.fi/digitoday/art-2000001833671.html|title=Nokia's dirty secret: The untold story of a production-ready tablet from 2001|date=2014-04-16|work=Ilta-Sanomat|access-date=2018-11-22|language=fi-FI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of Nokia's Internet tablets, Nokia unveiled two "media devices" in 2003-04 which were mobile phones but had a form factor similar to the Internet tablets that followed them. The first of this type of device was the [[Nokia 7700]] which was intended for mass production&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/10/28/nokias_7700_media_device_first/|title=Nokia's 7700 ‘media device’ – first shot in the PDA wars?|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ended up being canned in favor of the [[Nokia 7710]] which had a slightly more traditional form-factor and better specs.

== Maemo ==
{{main|Maemo (operating system)}}

Nokia Internet Tablets run the [[Debian]] [[Linux]]-based [[Maemo (operating system)|Maemo]], which draws much of its [[GUI]], [[software framework|frameworks]], and [[Library (computing)|libraries]] from the [[GNOME]] project. It uses the embedded-targeted [[Matchbox (window manager)|Matchbox]] as its [[window manager]] and uses [[Hildon]], a lightweight [[GTK]]-based toolkit designed for handheld devices, as its [[GUI]] and [[application framework]].

== Alternative distributions ==

Maemo can be replaced entirely by a number of other Linux distributions.

An '''oilseed press''' is a machine that lies at the center of [[vegetable oil]] extraction. This is due to the fact that this technology is designed to release oil from [[oilseeds]]. Multiple oilseed press layouts have been developed over time to complete this process, with each having its own distinct set of advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the products that are created by oilseed presses, namely oil and oilseed meal, possess great nutritive benefits for humans and livestock respectively. The oilseed press, being at the center of the oil-extraction process, is joined with various other pieces of equipment and procedures that form a pre- and post-extraction system.

== Oilseed press designs ==
Breaking it down to its simplest formulation, the process that oilseed presses carry out appears is quite simple. Oilseed presses essentially extrude or ‘press’ [[vegetable oil]] from oil-bearing seeds, which include [[soybean]], [[sunflower]], [[peanut]], [[safflower]], [[canola]], [[sesame]], [[Guizotia abyssinica|niger]], [[castor bean]], [[linseed]], [[Mustard plant|mustard]], [[coconut]], [[olive]], and [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="FAO 2010a"&gt;{{cite web|last1=FAO|title=Classification of Crops|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/documents/world_census_of_agriculture/appendix3_r7.pdf|publisher=FAO|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplicity of this procedure is shadowed by the diversity of oilseed press designs that perform it. As seen in Table 1, oilseed press designs can be placed into the three major classes of traditional, manual, and mechanical presses.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Axtell|first1=B|last2=Fairman|first2=R|title=Principles of Extraction|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5043e/x5043E03.htm|website=Minor Oil Crops|publisher=FAO|accessdate=1 November 2014|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Traditional presses include ghanis, water extraction systems, and other methods.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt; Aside from the ghani, these designs are generally low yielding and particularly labour intensive.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="(Head et al., 1995)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Head|first1=S|last2=Swetman|first2=A|last3=Hammonds|first3=T|last4=Gordon|first4=A|last5=Southwell|first5=K|last6=Harris|first6=R|title=Small Scale Vegetable Oil Extraction|url=http://collections.infocollections.org/ukedu/en/d/Jnr18se/1.html|website=Ukrainian Library for Schools|publisher=NRI|date=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, all the traditional forms mentioned operate on a batch system. This entails that only a given amount of oilseed can be processed at a given time and, when the oil has been extracted, the pressed oilseed must be cleaned out of the machine.&lt;ref name="Herkes et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herkes|first1=J|last2=Grubinger|first2=V|last3=Schumacher|first3=J|last4=Thompson|first4=J|title=Mechanical Extraction Processing Technology for Biodiesel|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/26911/mechanical-extraction-processing-technology-for- biodiesel#.VHNEG4vF-YL|website=eXtension|publisher=Extension|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these setbacks, traditional oilseed presses are basic in their design and are composed of easily obtainable or easy-to-manufacture equipment.&lt;ref name="(Head et al., 1995)" /&gt;

As for manual presses, cage style and [[ram press (food)|ram presses]] are the general layouts.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt; While cage presses operate on a tedious batch system,&lt;ref name="(Head et al., 1995)" /&gt; the operation of ram presses is continuous.&lt;ref name="(Head et al., 1995)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herkes et al., 2012" /&gt; The latter point about the ram press design is joined by multiple other advantages that are listed in Table 1. These advantages are especially attractive for developing nations.

The final major class of oilseed presses, the powered press, is dominated by the expeller. These presses also exhibit continuous operation.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="(Head et al., 1995)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herkes et al., 2012" /&gt; Furthermore, they are available in a great range of sizes that can process anywhere from a few kilograms per hour to multiple tons per hour.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt; These and other positive attributes (Table 1) are countered by how powered expellers require electricity or fossil fuels and how the components of expellers can wear quickly.&lt;ref name="(Head et al., 1995)" /&gt;

Note: *Pressure is a good indicator of pressing efficiency for oilseed presses.&lt;ref name="(Head et al., 1995)" /&gt;

== Nutritional value of products ==
No matter the design, the same end products are obtained from the operation of an oilseed press. After the oil is removed from the oilseed, an oilseed meal or cake remains.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurki|first1=A|last2=Bachmann|first2=J|last3=Hill|first3=H|title=Oilseed Processing for Small-Scale Producers|url=https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/viewhtml.php?id=102|website=National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service|publisher=National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service|accessdate=15 September 2014|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This valuable by-product is especially rich in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]].&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lardy|first1=G|title=Biodiesel Benefits for Cattle Producers|url=http://www.worc.org/userfiles/file/Biodiesel%20Benefits%20Report.pdf|publisher=Western Organization of Resource Councils|accessdate=30 September 2014|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oregon State University, 2004b"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oregon State University|title=Oilseed Meals|url=https://courses.ecampus.oregonstate.edu/ans312/three/oilseed_trans.htm|website=ANS 312|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[safflower]] and [[Helianthus|sunflower]] meal,&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt; most oilseed meals contain around 40% crude protein.&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oregon State University, 2004b" /&gt; Although this allows most oilseed meals to be readily applied as protein supplements for [[ruminants]] such as cattle,&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt; the truth is that many of these meals have undesirable [[amino acid]] ratios or exhibit poor digestibility which limits their use in [[Domestic pig|swine]] and [[Chicken|poultry]] diets.&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt;

Different oilseed species possess unique [[fatty acid]] profiles.&lt;ref name="EUFIC, 2014" /&gt;  This same principle applies to the oil contents of various oilseeds as well.

Decreased oil yield is detrimental in the perspective of oil production, yet is potentially beneficial for livestock producers since the leftover cake’s nutritive value is augmented.&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt;

== Oil extraction process ==
The actual extruding of vegetable oil from oilseeds by oilseed presses is preceded and followed by several other activities. The first step in the procedure is to have clean, dry seed. Removing material such as rocks, soil, chaff, leaves, sand, dust, and other foreign particles augments pressing efficiency, reduces wear, and decreases the chances of damage being done to the press.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt; Drying seed to around 10% prevents the press from being clogged&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt; and also prevents the spread of [[mold|mould]] during storage.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyman, 1992"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyman|first1=E|title=Local Agro-processing with Sustainable Technology: Sunflower Seed Oil in Tanzania|url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/6047IIED.pdf|publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=30 September 2014|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For seeds with hard seed coats such as sunflowers or groundnuts,&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt; dehusking or decortication is required.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt; This removal of the seed coats improves productivity and reduces bulk.&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt; In addition to decortication, preliminary milling for some oilseeds such as groundnuts is needed.&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt; Before the oilseed can be pressed, scorching or heating of the seed may also have to be conducted.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt; An example of this is how soybeans must be roasted to deactivate [[trypsin inhibitors]]&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oregon State University, 2004a" /&gt; that are anti-nutritional for swine and poultry.&lt;ref name="Lardy, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="N. Leja"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leja|first1=N|accessdate=2 October 2014|format=personal communication|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, warming seed before processing increases oil yield.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt; Although the best seed temperature for pressing is 38-71&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt; it is known that warming sunflower seed in the sun for just a half hour raises oil yields by 25%.&lt;ref name="Hyman, 1992" /&gt;

All of this leads up to that actual pressing of the oilseed, which is followed by more procedures that involve processing the oil. Clarification removes small contaminants and impurities in the oil by letting the oil sit for a period, which allows the particles to settle.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt; Further clarification can be done by heating the oil or filtering it through a fine cloth.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt;  Clarification extends the shelf-life of the oil from days to months.&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt;
 
Degumming, bleaching, neutralization, and deodorizing are all processes that follow clarification.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt; These procedures are often not applicable to developing nations due to their complexity&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt; and the fact that the flavours of unrefined oils are well accepted in these areas.&lt;ref name="Axtell &amp; Fairman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt; Whether these processes are applied or not, the oil must be stored in some way. Storage containers should be filled with oil to the top, completely clean, air and water tight, and opaque in colour.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt; Moreover, oil should be stored in a cool area away from light.&lt;ref name="Kurki et al., 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swetman, 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIDO, 1985" /&gt;

'''Overgrazing''' occurs when plants are exposed to intensive [[grazing]] for extended periods of time, or without sufficient recovery periods. It can be caused by either [[livestock]] in poorly managed [[agriculture|agricultural]] applications, [[game reserve]]s, or [[nature reserve]]s. It can also be caused by immobile, travel restricted populations of [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] or [[Introduced species|non-native]] [[Wildlife|wild animals]]. Cows are the main things that causes overgrazing and "overgrazing". However, "overgrazing" is a controversial concept, based on equilibrium system theory. 

It reduces the usefulness, [[primary productivity|productivity]], and [[biodiversity]] of the land and is one cause of [[desertification]] and [[erosion]]. Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of [[invasive species]] of [[invasive plant|non-native plants]] and of [[weed]]s. It is  caused by nomadic [[grazing|grazers]] in huge populations of travel [[herd]]s, such as the American bison of the Great Plains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laduke |first=Winona |date=1999 |title=All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life |url=http://zinelibrary.info/files/All_Our_Relations.pdf |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=South End Press |page=146 |isbn=0896085996 |access-date=30 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112803/http://zinelibrary.info/files/All_Our_Relations.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duke University"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |title=Bison Conservation: Saving an Ecologically and Culturally Keystone Species |last1=Duval |first1=Clay |publisher=Duke University |access-date=April 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308011257/http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or migratory [[Wildebeest]]s of the African [[savanna]]s,&lt;ref&gt;In [[Predator–prey equations|balance]] with, and accompanied by, prides of [[Keystone species#Predators|keystone predators]].&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic]] planned grazing.&lt;ref name="Forbes-AS"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/terrywaghorn/2012/12/20/holistic-land-management-key-to-global-stability/ "Holistic Land Management: Key to Global Stability"] by Terry Waghorn.

[[sustainable agriculture|Sustainable grassland production]] is based on [[grass]] and grassland management, [[land management]], animal management and livestock marketing. Grazing management, with [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[agroecology]] practices, is the foundation of grassland-based livestock production since it affects both animal and plant health and productivity. There are several new grazing models and management systems that attempt to reduce or eliminate overgrazing like [[Holistic management]]&lt;ref name=TED-Talk-Allan-Savory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savory|first1=Allan|title=How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI|website=youtube.com|publisher=TED|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YT-ASavory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savory|first1=Allan|title=Can sheep save the planet?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUMQVqtjUAQ|website=youtube.com|publisher=IWTOCHANNEL|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Permaculture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/forglvst/overgraz.htm West Virginia University Extension Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423103409/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/forglvst/overgraz.htm |date=2009-04-23 }} Overgrazing Can Hurt Environment, Your Pocketbook Ed Rayburn. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-AS" /&gt;

== Indicators ==
One indicator of overgrazing is that the animals run short of pasture. In some regions of the United States under continuous grazing, overgrazed pastures are predominated by short-grass species such as [[Poa|bluegrass]] and will be less than 2-3&amp;nbsp;inches tall in the grazed areas. In other parts of the world, overgrazed pasture is typically taller than sustainably grazed pasture, with grass heights typically over 1 meter and dominated by unpalatable species such as ''[[Aristida]]'' or ''[[Imperata]]''. In all cases, palatable tall grasses such as [[orchard grass]] are sparse or non-existent. In such cases of overgrazing, soil may be visible between plants in the stand, allowing erosion to occur, though in many circumstances overgrazed pastures have a greater sward cover than sustainably grazed pastures.

=== Rotational grazing ===
Under rotational grazing, overgrazed plants do not have enough time to recover to the proper height between grazing events. The animals resume grazing before the plants have restored carbohydrate reserves and grown back roots lost after the last [[defoliation]]. The result is the same as under continuous grazing: in some parts of the United States tall-growing species die and short-growing species that are more subject to drought injury predominate the pasture, while in most other parts of the world tall, drought tolerant, unpalatable species such as ''[[Imperata]]'' or ''[[Aristida]]'' come to dominate. As the sod thins, weeds encroach into the pasture in some parts of the [[United States]], whereas in most other parts of the worlds overgrazing can promote thick swards of native unpalatable grasses that hamper the spread of weeds.

Another indicator of overgrazing in some parts of [[North America]] is that livestock run out of pasture, and hay needs to be fed early in the fall. In contrast, most areas of the world do not experience the same climatic regime as the continental United States and hay feeding is rarely conducted.

Overgrazing is also indicated in livestock performance and condition. Cows having inadequate pasture immediately following their [[calf (animal)|calf]]'s [[weaning]] may have poor body condition the following season. This may reduce the health and vigor of cows and calves at [[Birth|calving]]. Also, cows in poor body condition do not cycle as soon after calving, which can result in delayed breeding. This can result in a long calving season. With good cow genetics, nutrition, ideal seasons and controlled breeding 55% to 75% of the calves should come in the first 21 days of the calving season. Poor weaning weights of calves can be caused by insufficient pasture, when cows give less milk and the calves need pasture to maintain weight gain.

==Ecological impacts==
{{see|land degradation}}
Overgrazing typically increases [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Overgrazing Overgrazing]. Encyclopedia of Earth. Sidney Draggan, topic ed.; Cutler J. Cleveland, ed., National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;  Reduction in soil depth, [[soil organic matter]] and soil fertility impair the land's future natural and agricultural productivity.  Soil fertility can sometimes be mitigated by applying the appropriate lime and [[organic fertilizer]]s. However, the loss of soil depth and organic matter takes centuries to correct. Their loss is critical in determining the soil's water-holding capacity and how well pasture plants do during dry weather.

[[Native plant]] [[grass]] species, both individual [[bunch grass]]es and in [[grassland]]s, are especially vulnerable.

== North America==
In the [[continental United States]], to prevent overgrazing, match the forage supplement to the herd's requirement.  This means that a buffer needs to be in the system to adjust for the fastest growth of forages.

Another potential buffer is to plant warm-season perennial grasses such as [[switchgrass]], which do not grow early in the season.  This reduces the area that the livestock can use early in the season, making it easier for them to keep up with the cool-season grasses.  The animals then use the warm-season grasses during the heat of the summer, and the cool-season grasses recover for fall grazing.

The grazing guidelines in the table are for rotationally grazed, cool-season forages.  When using continuous grazing, manage pasture height at one-half the recommended turn-in height for rotational grazing to optimize plant health. The growth habit of some forage species, such as [[alfalfa]], does not permit their survival under continuous grazing.  When managing for legumes in the stand, it is beneficial to use rotational grazing and graze the stand close and then give adequate rest to stimulate the legumes' growth.

==Economic theory==
{{main|Common land}}
Overgrazing is used as an example in the economic concept now known as the [[Tragedy of the Commons]] devised in a 1968 paper by [[Garrett Hardin]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243-1248. Also available [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf here] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt; This cited the work of a Victorian economist who used the over-grazing of common land as an example of behaviour. Hardin's example could only apply to unregulated use of land regarded as a common resource.

Normally, rights of use of Common land in England and Wales were, and still are, closely regulated, and available only to "commoners". If excessive use was made of common land, for example in overgrazing, a common would be "stinted", that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure; thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further. This important part of actual historic practice was absent from the economic model of Hardin.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jane Buck Cox - "No tragedy on the Commons" Journal of Environmental Ethics, Vol 7, Spring 1985 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt;
In reality the use of common land in England and Wales was a triumph of conserving a scarce resource using agreed custom and practice.

==Australia==
Overgrazing does not necessarily mean total [[denudation]] of the land. Overgrazing can also occur with native species. In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Australia]] the local government, in 2013, authorised the culling of 1455 [[kangaroos]] due to overgrazing.

The '''philosophy of information''' ('''PI''') is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies topics relevant to [[computer science]], [[information science]] and [[information technology]].

It includes:
# the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of [[information]], including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences
# the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi, [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf "What is the Philosophy of Information?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316090017/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf |date=2012-03-16 }}, ''Metaphilosophy'', 2002, (33), 1/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The philosophy of information (PI) has evolved from the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[logic of information]], [[cybernetics]], [[social theory]], [[ethics]] and the study of language and information.

===Logic of information===
The [[logic of information]], also known as the ''logical theory of information'', considers the information content of logical [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and expressions along the lines initially developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

===Cybernetics===
One source for the philosophy of information can be found in the technical work of [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Alan Turing]] (though his work has a wholly different origin and theoretical framework), [[William Ross Ashby]], [[Claude Shannon]], [[Warren Weaver]], and many other scientists working on computing and information theory back in the early 1950s. See the main article on [[Cybernetics]].

Some important work on information and communication was done by [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues.

===Study of language and information===
Later contributions to the field were made by [[Fred Dretske]], [[Jon Barwise]], [[Brian Cantwell Smith]], and others.

The [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI)]] was founded at Stanford University in 1983 by philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and psychologists, under the direction of [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] and [[Jon Barwise]].

===P.I.===
More recently this field has become known as the philosophy of information. The expression was coined in the 1990s by [[Luciano Floridi]], who has published prolifically in this area with the intention of elaborating a unified and coherent, conceptual frame for the whole subject.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Definitions of "information"==

The concept ''information'' has been defined by several theorists.

===Peirce===
[[Charles S. Peirce]]'s theory of information was embedded in his wider theory of symbolic communication he called the ''semeiotic'', now a major part of [[semiotics]]. For Peirce, information integrates the aspects of [[sign]]s and [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] separately covered by the concepts of [[denotation]] and [[extension (semantics)|extension]], on the one hand, and by [[connotation]] and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] on the other.

=== Shannon and Weaver ===
Claude E. Shannon, for his part, was very cautious: "The word 'information' has been given different meanings by various writers in the general field of information theory. It is likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible applications of this general field." (Shannon 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;180){{full citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Thus, following Shannon, Weaver supported a tripartite analysis of information in terms of (1) technical problems concerning the quantification of information and dealt with by Shannon's theory; (2) semantic problems relating to meaning and truth; and (3) what he called "influential" problems concerning the impact and effectiveness of information on human behaviour, which he thought had to play an equally important role. And these are only two early examples of the problems raised by any analysis of information.

A map of the main senses in which one may speak of information is provided by  [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/ the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article]. The previous paragraphs are based on it.

===Bateson===
[[Gregory Bateson]] defined information as "a difference that makes a difference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html Extract from "Steps to an Ecology of Mind"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204101244/http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html |date=2012-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on [[Donald M. MacKay]]: information is a distinction that makes a difference.&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophy of Information.
Luciano Floridi. Chapter 4. Oxford University Press, USA (March 8, 2011) ASIN: 0199232385 [https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Information-Luciano-Floridi/dp/0199232385]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floridi===
According to Luciano Floridi{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, four kinds of mutually compatible phenomena are commonly referred to as "information": 
*  Information about something (e.g. a train timetable)
*  Information as something (e.g. DNA, or fingerprints)
*  Information for something (e.g. algorithms or instructions)
*  Information in something (e.g. a pattern or a constraint).

The word "information" is commonly used so metaphorically or so abstractly that the meaning is unclear.

==Philosophical directions==

===Computing and philosophy===

Recent creative advances and efforts in [[computing]], such as [[semantic web]], [[ontology engineering]], [[knowledge engineering]], and modern [[artificial intelligence]] provide [[philosophy]] with fertile ideas, new and evolving subject matters, methodologies, and models for philosophical inquiry. While [[computer science]] brings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies, and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy, further major progress in [[computer science]] would only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and ontologies.

Classical topics in philosophy, namely, [[mind]], [[consciousness]], [[experience]], [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[truth]], [[morality]] and [[creativity]] are rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation in [[computer science]], e.g., in areas such as agent computing, [[software agents]], and intelligent mobile agent technologies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

According to Luciano Floridi "&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi, [http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/publications/pdf/oppi.pdf ''Open Problems in the Philosophy of Information''] ''Metaphilosophy'' 35.4, 554-582. Revised version of ''The Herbert A. Simon Lecture on Computing and Philosophy'' given at Carnegie Mellon University in 2001, with [https://web.archive.org/web/20020111085711/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/video/CAP/CMU2001/Floridi/index.html RealVideo]&lt;/ref&gt; one can think of several ways for applying computational methods towards philosophical matters:
# Conceptual experiments in silico: As an innovative extension of an ancient tradition of [[thought experiment]], a trend has begun in philosophy to apply computational [[Computer model|modeling]] schemes to questions in [[logic]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of biology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and so on.
# [[Pancomputationalism]]: On this view, computational and informational concepts are considered to be so powerful that given the right level of [[abstraction]], anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system, and any process could be simulated computationally. Then, however, pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions:
## how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems?
## what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be an [[Information system|informational system]] (or a computational system, if computation is the same as information processing)?

===Information and society===
Numerous philosophers and other thinkers have carried out philosophical studies of the social and cultural aspects of electronically mediated information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12037">In [[computer network|computer]] and [[telecommunications network]]s, '''presence information''' is a status indicator that conveys ability and willingness of a potential communication partner—for example a [[user (computing)|user]]—to [[communication|communicate]]. A user's [[client (computing)|client]] provides presence information (presence state) via a network connection to a [[presence service]], which is stored in what constitutes his personal availability record (called a [[presentity]]) and can be made available for distribution to other users (called ''watchers'') to convey his availability for communication. Presence information has wide application in many communication services and is one of the innovations driving the popularity of [[instant messaging]] or recent implementations of [[voice over IP]] clients.

==Presence state==
[[File:Example of Telecommunication Presence Information.png|thumb|Example of Presence Information]]A user client may publish a presence state to indicate its current communication status. This published state informs others that wish to contact the user of his availability and willingness to communicate. The most common use of presence today is to display an indicator icon on [[instant messaging]] clients, typically from a choice of graphic symbols with easy-to-convey meanings, and a list of corresponding text descriptions of each of the states. Even when technically not the same, the "on-hook" or "off-hook" state of called telephone is an analogy, as long as the caller receives a distinctive tone indicating unavailability or availability.

Common states on the user's availability are "free for chat", "busy", "away", "do not disturb", "out to lunch". Such states exist in many variations across different modern instant messaging clients. Current standards support a rich choice of additional presence attributes that can be used for presence information, such as user mood, location, or free text status.

The analogy with free/busy tone on [[PSTN]] is inexact, as the "on-hook" telephone status reflects the ability of the network to reach the recipient after the requester has initiated the conversation. The requester must commit to the connection method before discovering the recipient's availability state. Conversely, Presence shows the availability state before a conversation is initiated. A similar comparison might be the requester needing to know if the recipient is at work. The most straightforward way of checking if the recipient is available is to walk to the desk, which requires the commitment of the walk regardless of the outcome and usually requires some interaction if the recipient is at the desk. The requester can call first to save the walk, but now must commit to an interaction via phone. Presence gives the state of the recipient to the requester and the requester has the choice to interact with the recipient or use that information for non-interactive purposes (such as taking roll).

==MPOP and presence by observation==
Presence becomes interesting for communication systems when it spans a number of different communication channels. The idea that multiple communication devices can combine state, to provide an aggregated view of a user's presence has been termed Multiple Points of Presence (MPOP). MPOP becomes even more powerful when it is automatically inferred from passive observation of a user's actions. This idea is already familiar to instant messaging users who have their status set to "Away" (or equivalent) if their computer keyboard is inactive for some time. Extension to other devices could include whether the user's cell phone is on, whether they are logged into their computer, or perhaps checking their electronic calendar to see if they are in a meeting or on vacation. For example, if a user's calendar was marked as out of office and their cell phone was on, they might be considered in a "Roaming" state.

MPOP status can then be used to automatically direct incoming messages across all contributing devices. For example, "Out of office" might translate to a system directing all messages and calls to the user's cell phone. The status "Do not disturb" might automatically save all messages for later and send all phone calls to voicemail.

XMPP, discussed below, allows for MPOP by assigning each client a "resource" (a specific identifier) and a priority number for each resource. A message directed to the user's ID would go to the resource with highest priority, although messaging a specific resource is possible by using the form user@domain/resource.

==Privacy concerns==
Presence is highly sensitive information and in non-trivial systems a presentity may define limits to which its presence information may be revealed to different watchers. For example, a worker may only want colleagues to see detailed presence information during office hours. Basic versions of this idea are already common in instant messaging clients as a "Blocking" facility, where users can appear as unavailable to selected watchers.

==Commercial products==
Presence, particularly MPOP, requires collaboration between a number of electronic devices (for example IM client, home phone, cell phone, and electronic calendar) and the presence services each of them are connected with. To date, the most common and wide-scale implementations use closed systems, with a SPOP (Single Point of Presence, where a single device publishes state). Some vendors have upgraded their services to automatically log out connected clients when a new login request reaches the server from a newly connecting different device. For presence to universally work with MPOP support, multiple devices must be able to not only intercommunicate among each other, the status information must also be appropriately handled by all other interoperable, connected presence services and the MPOP scheme for their clients.

[[2.5G]] and, even more so, [[3G]] cell phone networks can support management and access of presence information services for mobile users cell phone handsets.

In the workplace, private messaging servers offer the possibility of MPOP within a company or work team.

==In the business community==
Presence information is a growing tool towards more effective and efficient communication within a business setting. Presence information allows you to instantly see who is available in your corporate network, giving more flexibility to set up short-term meetings and conference calls. The result is precise communication that all but eliminates the inefficiency of [[phone tag]] or email messaging. An example of the time-saving aspect of presence information is a driver with a GPS; he/she can be tracked and sent messages on upcoming traffic patterns that, in return, save time and money.

According to IDC surveys, employees "often feel that IM gives their workdays the kind of 'flow' that they feel when sitting directly among their colleagues, being able to ask questions of them, and getting the kind of quick responses that allow them to drive on to the next task". This phenomenon has been called the "Presence Effect"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to its predecessor the "[[water cooler]]" effect, whereby this level of flow was only thought to be achieved in person.

With presence information, privacy of the users can become an issue. For example, when an employee is on his/her day off they are still connected to the network and have greater ability to be tracked down. Therefore, a concern of presence information is to determine how far the companies want to go with staying connected.

==Presence standardization efforts==
There was, and still is, significant work done in several [[working group]]s on achieving a standardization for presence-related protocols.

In 1999, a group called the Instant Message and Presence Protocol (IMPP) working group (WG), was formed within the Internet Engineering Task Force organization (IETF) in order to develop protocols and data formats for simple presence and instant messaging services. Unfortunately, IMPP WG was not able to come to consensus on a single protocol for presence. Instead it issued a common profile for presence and instant messaging (CPP) which defined semantics for common services of presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services. Thus any two CPP-compatible presence protocol suites are automatically interoperable.

In 2001, the [[SIMPLE (instant messaging protocol)|SIMPLE]] working group was formed within IETF to develop a suite of CPP-compliant standards for presence and instant messaging applications over the Session Initiation Protocol ([[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]]). The SIMPLE activity specifies extensions to the SIP protocol which deal with a publish and subscribe mechanism for presence information and sending instant messages. These extensions include rich presence document formats, privacy control, "partial publications" and notifications, past and future presence, watcher information and more. Despite its name, SIMPLE is far from simple. It is described in about 30 documents on more than 1,000 pages. This is in addition to the complexity of the SIP protocol stack on which SIMPLE is based.

At the end of 2001, Nokia, Motorola, and Ericsson formed the Wireless Village (WV) initiative to define a set of universal specifications for mobile Instant Messaging and Presence Services (IMPS) and presence services for wireless networks. In October 2002, Wireless Village was consolidated into the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and a month later released the first version of
the [[XML]]-based [[OMA Instant Messaging and Presence Service]] (IMPS). IMPS defines a system architecture, syntax, and semantics for representation of presence information and a set of protocols for the four primary features: presence, IM, groups, and shared content. Presence is the key, enabling technology for the IMPS.

The XML-based [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] or Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol was designed and is currently maintained by the [[XMPP Standards Foundation]]. This [[instant messaging|IM]] protocol, which is a robust and widely extended protocol, is also the protocol used in the commercial implementation of [[Google Talk]] and [[Facebook Chat]]. In October 2004, the XMPP working group at [[IETF]] published the documents RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922 and RFC 3923, to standardize the core XMPP protocol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4381">In [[real-time computing]], the '''priority ceiling protocol''' is a synchronization protocol for [[resource (computer science)|shared resource]]s to avoid unbounded [[priority inversion]] and mutual [[deadlock]] due to wrong nesting of [[critical section]]s. In this protocol each resource is assigned a priority ceiling, which is a [[:wikt:priority|priority]] equal to the highest priority of any [[task (computers)|task]] which may lock the resource. The protocol works by temporarily raising the priorities of tasks in certain situations, thus it requires a [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] that supports [[dynamic priority scheduling]].&lt;ref&gt;

== ICPP versus OCPP ==
There are two variants of the protocol:  '''Original Ceiling Priority Protocol''' ('''OCPP''') and '''Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol''' ('''ICPP'''). The worst-case behaviour of the two ceiling schemes is identical from a scheduling view point. Both variants work by temporarily raising the priorities of tasks.&lt;ref name="informatik"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/teaching/ws08-09/v-emb-rt/lectures/lecture13-handout4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113091626/http://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/teaching/ws08-09/v-emb-rt/lectures/lecture13-handout4.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In OCPP, a task X's priority is raised when a higher-priority task Y tries to acquire a resource that X has locked. The task's priority is then raised to the priority ceiling of the resource, ensuring that task X quickly finishes its critical section, unlocking the resource. A task is only allowed to lock a resource if its dynamic priority is higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks. Otherwise the task becomes blocked, waiting for the resource.&lt;ref name="informatik"/&gt;

In ICPP, a task's priority is immediately raised when it locks a resource. The task's priority is set to the priority ceiling of the resource, thus no task that may lock the resource is able to get scheduled. This ensures the OCPP property that "A task can only lock a resource if its dynamic priority is higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks".&lt;ref name="informatik"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">The '''Radiation Safety Information Computational Center''' ('''RSICC''') is a [[United States Department of Energy | U.S. Department of Energy]] Specialized Information Analysis Center (SIAC) authorized to collect, analyze, maintain, and distribute computer software and data sets in the areas of [[radiation transport]] and [[Nuclear safety|safety]].  The RSICC is operated by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  The primary sponsors of the RSICC are the U.S. Department of Energy, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].

The center began as the Radiation Shielding Information Center (RSIC) in 1962, but was renamed to RSICC in August 1996 to better reflect the scope of computer code technology at the center (i.e., radiation transport and safety).

The RSICC staff maintain an online software catalog at their website, which site visitors may browse (though no search functionality is provided).  The software in the catalog cover a broad range of nuclear computational tools, providing in-depth coverage of radiation transport and safety topics for nuclear science and engineering, in support of modeling and simulation.  Registered users may request software from the repository.  With a few specific exceptions, a "cost recovery fee" is required to recoup the cost associated with RSICC operations before software requests are fulfilled.

The European counterpart to the RSICC is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s]] (OECD) [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] (NEA) Data Bank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">In [[fiberoptics|fiber optics]], a '''reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer''' ('''ROADM''') is a form of [[optical add-drop multiplexer]] that adds the ability to remotely switch traffic from a [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] (WDM) system at the [[wavelength]] layer. This is achieved through the use of a [[wavelength selective switching]] module. This allows individual or multiple wavelengths carrying data channels to be added and/or dropped from a transport [[optical fiber|fiber]] without the need to convert the signals on all of the WDM channels to electronic signals and back again to optical signals.

The main advantages of the ROADM are:
* The planning of entire bandwidth assignment need not be carried out during initial deployment of a system. The configuration can be done as and when required without affecting traffic already passing the ROADM.
* ROADM allows for remote configuration and reconfiguration.
* In ROADM, as it is not clear beforehand where a signal can be potentially routed, there is a necessity of power balancing of these signals. ROADMs allow for automatic power balancing.

ROADM functionality originally appeared in long-haul [[Wavelength-division multiplexing#Dense WDM|dense wavelength division multiplexing]] (DWDM) equipment, but by 2005, it began to appear in metro optical systems because of the need to build out major metropolitan networks in order to deal with the traffic driven by the increasing demand for [[packet (information technology)|packet]]-based services.

The switching or reconfiguration functions of a ROADM can be achieved using a variety of switching technologies including [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), [[liquid crystal]], [[thermo optic switch|thermo optic]] and beam-steering switches in planar [[waveguide]] circuits, and tunable [[optical filter]] technology.

Starting in 1946, [[American Airlines]] developed a number of automated airline booking systems known as '''Reservisor'''. Although somewhat successful, American's unhappiness with the Reservisor systems led them to develop the computerized [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] system used to this day.

==Before Reservisor==
[[C. R. Smith]] became president of American Airlines in 1934 and set an aggressive expansion policy. When AA had 85 planes in its fleet he stated "Any employee who can't see a day when we will have a thousand planes had better look for a job somewhere else."&lt;ref name=m100&gt;McKenney, pg. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Known as a hands-on manager, Smith pushed his vice presidents to drive out inefficiencies that might block their potential expansion.

Following Smith's lead, Marion Sadler, manager of customer support, and Bill Hogan, in charge of finance, concluded that the company was spending too much effort on keeping on top of accounting, and not enough on the problem of booking times.&lt;ref name=m100/&gt; They hired Charles Amman to study the problem. He broke the process down into three steps; finding if a seat was available, updating the seating inventory when they purchased a seat or canceled a booking, and finally recording the passenger data (name, address, etc.) after the sale.&lt;ref name=m100/&gt;

At the time, bookings were handled by a system known as "request and reply". Booking data for any particular flight, say Buffalo to Boston, would be handled by a single office. Here, each scheduled flight was represented by an [[index card]] known as a flight card. The offices were normally located at one of the airports involved, but were increasingly centralized at major airports or located at a telephone company switching office to ease the adding or removing of phone lines.

In order to book a ticket on a flight, a sales agent would call into the right booking office and request information on a particular flight. The booking agent would then walk over to a filing cabinet and retrieve the flight card. They would then return to the phone to tell the sales agent if there were any seats available. If there was an available seat, they simply checked off a box, informed the sales agent, and returned the card to the cabinet.

Problems occurred when the flights were close to full. In that case the booking agent would have to inform the sales agent that there were no seats, and the sales agent would then ask the customer if there were any other flights they might choose as an alternative. The booking agent would have to return to the cabinets each time to retrieve the flight cards; since there were many booking agents who might want to retrieve the cards, the agents couldn't take more than one at a time. During busy schedule periods, this process could stretch out the booking process indefinitely.&lt;ref name=m100/&gt;

Amman attacked this problem first. In 1939 he implemented a new system called "sell and report" that reduced the reporting needs by allowing any office to book seats without calling the central office until 75% of the seats were sold.&lt;ref name=m100/&gt; Each office had a board of future flights that consisted of a single hole representing a flight; when the flight reached 75% a large peg was inserted that the booking agents could see, sometimes using binoculars. Once the flight had been pegged, the agents reverted to the older centralized booking system. In an era where aircraft rarely flew with 75% of the seats filled, this system dramatically reduced the number of phone calls.

Although the "sell and report" system worked, it didn't solve the other problems that occurred when the flight had reached the 75% point. The problem of finding an alternate flight when the flight was filled also remained a major problem.

==Reservisor==
Amman suggested that an automated system for storing seat inventory be built, and in 1944 mocked up a system for a single flight and showed it to Smith. Smith was encouraged, and approved funding for building a real-world system.&lt;ref name=m102&gt;McKenney, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Amman approached a number of business machine vendors about building the system he referred to as the '''Reservisor''', but most proved uninterested. It was not until he showed the mock-up to the Teleregister Company of [[Stamford, Connecticut]] that he found a partner willing to work on the system. Teleregister had started as part of [[Western Union]], a division that sent [[stock market]] quotes across the country and presented them in "big board" form instead of a ticker. Their knowledge of remote signaling and electrical display made them a suitable partner for the Reservisor project.

The Reservisor was essentially an electromechanical version of the flight boards introduced for the "sell and report" system. The heart of the machine consisted of a large matrix with the rows representing the flights and the columns representing the next ten days. When a flight reached its limit, 75% at first but later increased, a relay was inserted into the board to short out the lines when they were energized.

Booking operators were equipped with terminals that looked like a smaller version of the control system, replacing the holes with lamps. They could query the flight status by selecting a flight and then energizing their board. Electricity flowed from their terminal through the selected flight, displaying the status for that flight for all ten days at once. The booking agent could then tell the sales agent the flight status without walking to the cabinet, as well as immediately offer alternatives if it was sold out. The flight card was only updated when the customer actually bought a seat.

The major advantage of this system over the older pegboard was that the signals could be operated remotely. This eliminated the need to have one very large room for bookings, and allowed the terminals to be installed remotely. The flight status could also easily be copied from machine to machine by installing a remote display at another booking office and then having operators copy the settings from one machine to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Elmer, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reservisor was installed in American's Boston reservation office in February 1946. After a one-year trial, they found that the office was handling 200 more passengers a day, with 20 fewer operators.&lt;ref name=m102/&gt; One downside was that the electrical relay contacts would get dirty and required constant cleaning. And although it did help solve the availability issues, this made the rest of the booking task - collecting passenger information and recording the sale - that much more of a problem that needed to be solved.

==Magnetronic Reservisor==
Encouraged by the Reservisor, but ultimately unhappy with the advantages it offered, Amman started examining a much more advanced system that handled not only the availability issues, but the actual seat inventory as well. At about this time, [[Howard Aiken]] had started work with the highly publicized [[Harvard Mark I]] computer, which used a [[drum memory]] for storage. American and Teleregister decided to make a drum-based system that allowed direct manipulation of the number of seats available.

Since the machine was now returning discrete information, instead of a simple on-off status, the terminals could no longer automatically display the overall status of a group of flights. Each flight had to be queried separately from the drum, and then light the lamp if it was filled. Amman spent a considerable amount of time studying the user interaction with the machine, trying to find an easy way for the operator to query the data for a group of flights.&lt;ref name=m100/&gt;

The trials included buttons, dials, rolls of paper tape, loops of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film and finally, the "destination plate". The plate consisted of a metal card with notches on the edge that engaged switches in the terminal, which energized lines back to the drum to retrieve information for all of the flights to that destination at once. A series of lights indicated which ones still had available seats. When a booking was made, a lever on the terminal subtracted one seat from the value stored on the drum, while another allowed it to be added back in the case of a cancellation.&lt;ref name=m100/&gt;

The resulting '''Magnetronic Reservisor''' was installed in American's [[La Guardia Airport]] booking office in 1952. The system was built with the ability to store information for up to 1,000 flights 10 days into the future, and took about 1.2 seconds per query. In 1956 a new version was installed at American's New York West Side Terminal with storage for 2,000 flights 31 days into the future, and improved access times to about half a second. The new system also recorded additional information every time a booking was made, including statistical information on the number of inquiries, bookings and cancellations on a per-operator and overall basis. To take full advantage of the new system, the entire office was re-arranged to include 362 telephone operators to interact directly with the public, 40 to handle travel agents and large business accounts, and another 140 to connect to other American ticket offices around the country. Calls averaged 45,000 a day, requiring a staff of 40 machine operators and supervisors.&lt;ref name=m104&gt;McKenney, pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

After installing the Magnetronic Reservisor, Teleregister produced a number of different versions for a variety of customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Teleregister/Teleregister.SpecialPurposeSystems.1956.102646324.pdf "Special Purpose Electronic Engineering... That Sets the Pace!"], Teleregister Corporation, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; A number of customers bought Magnetronic Reservisor systems, including [[Braniff International Airways]], [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]], [[Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad]] and [[New Haven Railroad]]. Modified versions, larger or smaller, were also sold as the [[United Airlines]]' "UNISEL", [[New York Central Railroad]]'s "Centronic", and a variety of warehousing and hotel room availability systems.

==Reserwriter==
The Magnetronic Reservisor largely solved the booking and availability problems, but this left the issue of recording passenger information after the sale was made. Working with [[IBM]], Amman built the '''Reserwriter''', which allowed operators to type passenger information onto a [[punched card]] for storage. The card was then processed into a [[paper tape]] form, and read to the ticketing offices over American's existing [[teletype]] network to automatically print tickets with complete routing information. The tapes could then be forwarded for processing at remote sites, including the Magnetronic Reservisor in New York, allowing remote offices to directly book and cancel flights while recording passenger information at the same time. By 1958, Reserwriters had been installed at most of American's larger offices.&lt;ref name=m104/&gt;

==SABRE==
In spite of the successes with the Reservisor and Reserwriter, the system as a whole was highly dependent on manual input. It was prone to errors as a result, and about 8 percent of all bookings contained errors. To add to the confusion, the full process of booking a flight, even a single-leg, required the input of 12 different people and took as long as 3 hours in total.

As if this were not bad enough, in 1952 American had ordered 30 [[Boeing 707]]s, their first jets. These aircraft increased seating from about 80 on the existing [[Douglas DC-7]] fleet to 112 on the new aircraft. Their speed was also much greater, allowing almost twice as many flights per aircraft per day. The result was that the aircraft could deliver passengers faster than their existing booking systems could sell tickets for them.

In 1953 C.R. Smith was on a flight from Los Angeles to New York when he struck up a conversation with another passenger and learned that he was also named Smith. The passenger was Blair Smith, an IBM sales executive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.umn.edu/107637 "Oral history interview with R. Blair Smith"], Charles Babbage Institute&lt;/ref&gt; C.R. arranged for Smith to visit the Magnetronic Reservisor office and suggest ways that IBM might be able to improve the system. Blair alerted IBM's president, [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]] that American would be interested in a major collaboration. IBM was at that time starting work on the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) system for the US Air Force, which had a large number of features in common with a booking system; remote communications with "offices", real-time updating, interactive user terminals, and storage of large amounts of information.

Low-level exploratory work continued for some time before IBM was able to offer a formal development contract on 18 September 1957. Development of the [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] system started, which many computer historians have suggested was one of the major milestones in the commercialization of computers. SABRE was not, however, the first computerized booking system, that honor goes to the little-known [[Trans-Canada Air Lines]] (today's [[Air Canada]]) system, [[ReserVec]].

'''Robert Frederick Christy''' (May 14, 1916 – October 3, 2012) was a Canadian-American [[theoretical physicist]] and later [[astrophysicist]] who was one of the last surviving people to have worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]]. He briefly served as acting president of [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech).

A graduate of the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) in the 1930s where he studied physics, he followed [[George Volkoff]], who was a year ahead of him, to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was accepted as a graduate student by [[Robert Oppenheimer]], the leading theoretical physicist in the United States at that time. Christy received his doctorate in 1941&lt;ref name="thesis-christy-1941"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/301826234/ |title=Cosmic-ray burst production and the spin of the mesotron |date=1941 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Christy |first=Robert F. |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=25395034}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the [[IIT Physics Department|physics department]] of [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].

In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project at the [[University of Chicago]], where he was recruited by [[Enrico Fermi]] to join the effort to build the first [[nuclear reactor]], having been recommended as a theory resource by Oppenheimer. When Oppenheimer formed the Manhattan Project's [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in 1943, Christy was one of the early recruits to join the Theory Group. Christy is generally credited with the insight that a solid sub-critical mass of plutonium could be explosively compressed into [[supercriticality]], a great simplification of earlier concepts of implosion requiring hollow shells. For this insight the solid-core plutonium model is often referred to as the "[[Pit (nuclear weapon)#Christy pits|Christy pit]]".

After the war, Christy briefly joined the University of Chicago Physics department before being recruited to join the Caltech faculty in 1946 when Oppenheimer decided it was not practical for him to resume his academic activities. He stayed at Caltech for his academic career, serving as Department Chair, Provost and Acting President. In 1960 Christy turned his attention to astrophysics, creating some of the first practical computation models of stellar operation.  For this work Christy was awarded the [[Eddington Medal]] of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1967. In the 1980s and 1990s Christy participated in the National Research Council's Committee on Dosimetry, an extended effort to better understand the actual radiation exposure due to the bombs dropped on Japan, and on the basis of that learning, better understand the medical risks of radiation exposure.

==Early life==
Robert Frederick Cohen was born in May 14, 1916 in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9594189/Robert-Christy.html  |title=Robert Christy |date=October 8, 2012 |accessdate=February 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Moise Jacques Cohen, an electrical engineer, and his wife Hattie Alberta née Mackay, a school teacher. He was named Robert after his maternal great uncle Robert Wood, and Frederick after Frederick Alexander Christy, the second husband of his maternal grandmother. He had an older brother, John, who was born in 1913. Moise changed the family surname to Christy by [[deed poll]] on August 31, 1918. On November 4, Moise was accidentally electrocuted at work.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=1–5}} Hattie died after [[goitre]] surgery in 1926. Christy and his brother were then cared for by Robert Wood, their grandmother Alberta Mackay, and their great aunt Maud Mackay.{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=9}}

Christy was educated at [[Magee Secondary School|Magee High School]], and graduated in 1932 with the highest examination score in the province of [[British Columbia]]. He was awarded the [[Governor General's Academic Medal]], and, importantly in view of his family's limited ability to pay, free tuition to attend the  [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC). At the award dinner he met the second-place winner, Dagmar Elizabeth von Lieven, whom he dated while at UBC.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=11–12, 16}} He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in mathematics and physics with first class honors in 1935, and his [[Master of Arts]] (MA) degree in 1937,&lt;ref name="Caltech"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caltech.edu/content/caltech-mourns-passing-robert-f-christy-1916–%C2%AD2012|title=Noted Physicist Robert F.

[[George Volkoff]], a friend of Christy who was a year ahead of him at UBC, was  accepted as a graduate student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], by [[Robert Oppenheimer]], who led the most active school of theoretical physics in the United States at that time. This inspired Christy to apply to the University of California as well. He was accepted, and was awarded a fellowship for his first year. At Berkeley he shared an apartment with Volkoff, [[Robert Cornog]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie|Ken McKenzie]] and McKenzie's wife Lynn McKenzie.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=24–25}} For his thesis, Oppenheimer had him look at [[mesotron]]s, subatomic particles called muons today that then recently been found in [[cosmic ray]]s. They were so-called because they were larger than [[electron]]s but smaller than [[proton]]s. With the help of [[Shuichi Kusaka]] he performed detailed calculations of the particle's [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. He published two papers on mesotrons with  Kusaka in the [[Physical Review]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=The Interaction of γ-Rays with Mesotrons  |last=Christy |first=R.

Christy could have graduated in 1940, but could not then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income.{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=32}} In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the [[IIT Physics Department|physics department]] at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT).{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=47–48}} In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944,{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=36–37}} and Peter Robert, born in 1946.{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=135}} IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the [[University of Chicago]].{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=47–48}} This brought him to the attention of [[Eugene Wigner]], who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=52}}

[[File:Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg|thumb|right|A model of a Christy pit]]
[[Enrico Fermi]] and his team from [[Columbia University]] arrived at the University of Chicago in January 1942 as part of an effort to concentrate the Manhattan Project's reactor work at the new [[Metallurgical Laboratory]].{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}} Fermi arranged with Wigner for Christy to join his group,{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=53}} which was building a [[nuclear reactor]], which Fermi called a "pile", in the [[squash (sport)|squash]] court under [[Stagg Field]] at the University of Chicago. Construction began on November 6, 1942, and Christy was present when [[Chicago Pile-1]] went [[Nuclear reactor physics#Criticality|critical]] on December 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fermi |first=E. | title=The Development of the First Chain Reaction Pile | journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] | year=1946 | volume=90 | pages=20–24 | jstor=3301034}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=56}}

In early 1943, Christy joined Oppenheimer's [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico,{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=70–71}} where he became an [[American citizen]] in 1943 or 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/05/local/la-me-robert-christy-20121006 |title=Robert F.

With his knowledge of reactors, Christy's assignment was to help [[Donald W. Kerst]]'s Water Boiler  group.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=77}} The Water Boiler was an [[aqueous homogeneous reactor]] intended as a laboratory instrument to test [[critical mass]] calculations and the effect of various [[neutron reflector|tamper]] materials. It was the first reactor to use [[enriched uranium]] as a fuel, and the first to use liquid fuel in the form of soluble [[uranium sulfate]] dissolved in water. Christy estimated that it would require {{convert|600|g}} of pure [[uranium-235]], a figure he subsequently revised to {{convert|575|g}}. When the reactor went critical on May 9, 1944 with {{convert|565|g}}, the accuracy of Christy's figures raised the laboratory's confidence in T Division's calculations.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=199–203}}

The discovery by [[Emilio Segrè]]'s group in April and May 1944 of high levels of [[plutonium-240]] in reactor-produced plutonium  meant that an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] was required, but studies indicated that this would be extremely difficult to achieve. {{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=228–229}} By August 1944, the calculations had been made of how an ideal spherical implosion would work; the problem was how to make it work in the real world where [[Jet (fluid)|jets]] and [[spall]]ing were a problem. Christy worked in [[Rudolf Peierls]]'s T-1 Group, which studied the theory of implosion. He suggested the possibility of using a solid plutonium core that would form a critical mass when compressed. This was an ultra-conservative design that solved the problem of jets by brute force.  It became known as the "[[Pit (nuclear weapon)#Christy pits|Christy pit]]" or "Christy gadget", "gadget" being the laboratory euphemism for a bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=307–308}} However the solid pit was intrinsically less efficient than a hollow pit, and it required a [[modulated neutron initiator]] to start the chain reaction.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=293}}  Christy worked with [[Klaus Fuchs]], Paul Stein and Hans Bethe to develop a suitable initiator design, which became known as an "urchin".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=317}} [[The Gadget]] used in the [[Trinity nuclear test]] and the [[Fat Man]] used in the [[atomic bombing of Nagasaki]] used Christy pits.&lt;ref name="Caltech"/&gt;

Later in life, Christy agreed to give a number of both [[oral history]] and video interviews in which he discussed his role in the Manhattan Project and latter interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/robert.christy/8 |title=Constructing the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechOH:OH_Christy_R |title= Interview with Robert F.

==Later life==
[[File:NASA-project-orion-artist.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's conception of the Project Orion spacecraft]]
After the war ended, Christy accepted an [[assistant professor]]ship at the University of Chicago, at a salary of $5,000 per annum, twice what he had been making before the war. He moved back to Chicago in February 1946, but suitable housing was hard to find in the immediate post-war period, and Christy and his family shared a mansion with [[Edward Teller]] and his family.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=134–135}}

Before the war, Oppenheimer had spent part of each year teaching at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). Christy was one of Oppenheimer's Berkeley students who made the trip down to [[Pasadena, California]], each year to continue studying with Oppenheimer.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=32–33}} After the war, Oppenheimer decided that with his additional responsibilities he could no longer continue this arrangement. The head of the  W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory   at Caltech, [[Charles Lauritsen]] therefore asked Oppenheimer for the name of a theoretical physicist that he would recommend as a replacement. Oppenheimer recommended Christy. [[William Alfred Fowler|Willy Fowler]] then approached Christy with an offer of a full-time position at Caltech at $5,400 per annum, and Christy accepted. He remained at Caltech for the rest of his academic career. The drawback to working at Caltech was that neither Lauritsen nor Fowler was a theoretical physicist, so a heavy workload fell on Christy. This was recognised by a pay raise to $10,000 per annum in 1954.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=135–138}}

Christy joined Oppenheimer, Lauritsen  and  [[Robert Bacher]], who joined the faculty at Caltech in 1949, in Project Vista, a detailed 1951 study on how Western Europe could be defended against the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Christy was distraught at the outcome of the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing]]. When he encountered Teller, who had testified against Oppenheimer, at Los Alamos in 1954, Christy publicly refused to shake Teller's hand. "I viewed Oppenheimer as a god", he later recalled, "and I was sure that he was not a treasonable person."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Asked about his relationship with Teller in 2006, Christy said:{{quote| I’ve seen him from time to time. Our relationship has remained cool. Since that time, I have disagreed with him in a number of areas. For example, the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. I have disagreed with him, but I have not argued with him publicly, because Teller operates at a much different level than I do. He’s a confidant of presidents; I’m not. As I say, I merely disagree privately, and that’s the way it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Physics in Perspective |first=Sara |last=Lippincott  |title=A Conversation with Robert F. Christy – Part II |date=December 2006 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=408–450 |doi=10.1007/s00016-006-0269-3|bibcode = 2006PhP.....8..408L }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1956, Christy was one of a number of scientists from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with [[Freeman Dyson]] on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], the design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web| last=Goldstein| first=David  | last2=Goldstein| first2=Judith | year=2013 | title=Robert F.

[[File:Heic1323a -1243686232.jpg|thumb|right|[[RS Puppis]], a [[Cepheid variable]] star. Christy explained why they pulsate.]]
During a sabbatical year at [[Princeton University]] in 1960, Christy began an investigation of [[Cepheid variable]]s and the smaller [[RR Lyrae variable]]s, classes of luminous [[variable stars]]. At the time it was a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the [[hydrodynamics]] of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]'s [[Eddington Medal]] for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Christy was appointed Vice President and [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of Caltech in 1970.{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=45}} Under Christy and President [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]] Caltech expanded its [[humanities]] and added [[economics]] to allow students to broaden their education. He had David Morrisroe appointed as Vice President for Financial Affairs, and they steered Caltech through the financially stringent 1970s. The first women were admitted as undergraduates in the 1970s.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=177–185}}

When [[Jenijoy La Belle]], who had been hired in 1969 but refused tenure in 1974, filed suit with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], Christy pressed for the case to be settled and La Belle to be given tenure. The EEOC ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle received tenure in 1979.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=177–185}}

In 1970 he became romantically involved with Inge-Juliana Sackman, a fellow physicist 26 years his junior.{{sfn|Christy|2013|pp=202–206}} He divorced Dagmar in early 1971,{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=45}}  and married Juliana on August 4, 1973.{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=227}} They had two daughters, Illia Juliana Lilly Christy, born in 1974, and Alexandra Roberta (Alexa) Christy, born in 1976.{{sfn|Christy|2013|p=236}}

Christy briefly became acting President of Caltech in 1977 when Brown left to become [[Secretary of Defense]]. Christy returned to teaching after [[Marvin L. Goldberger]] became President in 1978. He became Institute Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1983, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Christy died on October 3, 2012. He was survived by his wife Juliana, their two daughters, Illia and Alexa, and his two sons, Peter and Ted.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in [[Altadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|98298802|accessdate=February 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Ballooning''' was a training and test centre for [[British Army]] experiments with [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s and [[airship]]s.  It was established at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] in [[Kent]] in 1888.  The School moved to Stanhope Lines, [[Aldershot]] in 1890 when a balloon section and depot were formed as permanent units of the [[Royal Engineers]] establishment.  The School was sometimes known as the '''Balloon Factory'''.

==Origins==
In 1862 two [[Royal Engineers]] officers, who had seen [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] being [[History of military ballooning#Balloons in the American Civil War|used in]] the [[American Civil War]], drew the attention of the [[War Office]] to the potential use of [[Observation balloon|balloons for observation]]. These officers demonstrated balloons to the army, but it was only in 1878 that the War Office directed Captain [[James Templer (balloon aviator)|James Templer]], an army [[reservist]] and experienced balloonist, to set up a small unit of Royal Engineers which became known as the School of Ballooning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough |last=Pembery |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society - Farnborough Branch |location=Farnborough, Hampshire, England |pages=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of military ballooning#British ballooning}}

;At Woolwich
Initially the School was based at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. In 1878 the school constructed and flew a [[hydrogen]]-filled balloon of {{convert|10000|ft3|m3}} capacity. By 1879 the unit had 5 balloons. In 1880 military balloon training and demonstration took place at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]]. After a [[Walter Powell (politician)#Disappearance|tragic incident in 1881]] Templer concentrated on development of balloons rather than making ascents himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough |last=Pembery |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society - Farnborough Branch |location=Farnborough, Hampshire, England |pages=3–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;At Chatham
In 1882 the School moved to the [[Royal School of Military Engineering|School of Military Engineering]] at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] where they discovered that [[Goldbeater's skin]] was superior balloon fabric than the material they had used previously – in particular it was easier to stow for transport. Templer also took out a patent for the use of unmanned balloons for “[[Aerial photography|balloon photography]]” of the ground below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough |last=Pembery |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society - Farnborough Branch |location=Farnborough, Hampshire, England |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pictorial History of the RAF |last=Taylor |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Moyes, P J R  |year=1968 |publisher=Ian Allan Ltd |location=Shepperton, Surrey, England |pages=2 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

;At Aldershot
In 1890 the School moved to [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]] where a section of the Royal Engineers had been formed to use balloons operationally. The School of Ballooning was renamed the '''Balloon Factory''' in 1897. In 1899 the Factory increased production to supply balloons for use in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. The Factory began experiments with "dirigible balloons" ([[airship]]s) in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough |last=Pembery |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society - Farnborough Branch |location=Farnborough, Hampshire, England |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;At Farnborough
[[File:Nulli Secundus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Nulli Secundus'']]
The Aldershot site was found to be too enclosed so in 1904-1906 the Factory moved to a site at the edge of [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough Common]]. A {{convert|72|ft|m}} high [[airship hangar|airship shed]] was built at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough |last=Pembery |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society - Farnborough Branch |location=Farnborough, Hampshire, England |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Colonel [[John Capper]] took up command of the School of Ballooning. During his time in command, Capper contributed to the development of Britain's military airships and, with Cody, piloted the first successful British airship flight, that of the ''[[British Army Dirigible No 1|Nulli Secundus]]'' over [[London]] during 1907.&lt;ref name="REMHS"&gt;[http://www.remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_special.htm#null Royal Engineers Museum History Section - Aeronautics], ''Royal Engineers Museum and Library'', Retrieved 15 August 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627125151/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_special.htm#null |date=27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Franklin Cody|Samuel Cody]] experimented with man-lifting kites at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough |last=Pembery |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society - Farnborough Branch |location=Farnborough, Hampshire, England |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1906 he was appointed as Chief Instructor in Kiting.

In 1909-1911, part of the Factory was separated to form the [[Air Battalion Royal Engineers|Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers]]. In 1912 the Balloon Factory was renamed the [[Royal Aircraft Factory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough |last=Pembery |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society - Farnborough Branch |location=Farnborough, Hampshire, England |page=17 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

*1906 to 1909, Colonel [[John Capper|J E Capper]]
In 1909, the Balloon Factory was separated from the Balloon School.  Colonel Capper continued as commander of the Balloon School, and the civilian consultant engineer [[Mervyn O'Gorman]] was appointed superintendent of the Balloon Factory.  Several months later Major [[Sir Alexander Bannerman, 11th Baronet|Sir Alexander Bannerman]] took over the Balloon School from Colonel Capper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Charles Cyril |title=The Old Flying Days |origyear=1927 |year=1972 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |isbn=0-405-03783-X |pages=294|chapter=XXII}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sewing machine''' is a machine used to stitch [[fabric]] and other materials together with [[yarn|thread]]. Sewing machines were invented during the first [[Industrial Revolution]] to decrease the amount of manual [[sewing]] work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ismacs.net/sewing_machine_history.html | publisher = ISMACS | title = A brief history of the sewing machine}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the [[clothing industry]].

Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type. In a modern sewing machine the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles and [[thimbles]] and other such tools used in hand sewing, automating the process of stitching and saving time.

Industrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task.

== History ==

=== Invention ===

[[Charles Fredrick Wiesenthal]], a German-born engineer working in [[England]] was awarded the first British patent for a mechanical device to aid the art of sewing, in 1755. His invention consisted of a double pointed needle with an eye at one end.&lt;ref name="sewing"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indecohotels.com/sewingmachinebeginning.html |title=Sewing Machine Beginning |accessdate=2012-12-17|work=Sewing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint2.jpg|thumb|Newton Wilson's copy of Saint's sewing machine.]][[File:Thomas Saint's chain stitch.gif|thumb|Thomas Saint's chain stitch used on the first ever complete sewing machine design for leather work. An awl preceded the eye pointed needle to make a hole in preparation for the thread.]]
In 1790, the English inventor [[Thomas Saint]] invented the first sewing machine design, but he did not successfully advertise or market his invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moah.org/virtual/sewing.html Sewing Machines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His machine was meant to be used on [[leather]] and [[canvas]] material. It is likely that Saint had a working model but there is no evidence of one; he was a skilled [[cabinet maker]] and his device included many practically functional features: an overhanging arm, a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather), a vertical needle bar, and a looper.

His sewing machine used the [[chain stitch]] method, in which the machine uses a single thread to make simple stitches in the fabric. A [[stitching awl]] would pierce the material and a forked point rod would carry the thread through the hole where it would be hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, where the cycle would be repeated, locking the stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.husqvarnastudio.co.uk/history.htm|title=Sewing Machine History |accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint's machine was designed to aid the manufacture of various leather goods, including [[saddle]]s and [[bridle]]s, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing [[sail|ship sails]]. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it could become a practical proposition. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint's drawings in the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|London Patent Office]], made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the [[London Science Museum]].

In 1804, a sewing machine was built by the Englishmen Thomas Stone and James Henderson, and a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachersites.schoolworld.com/webpages/GHurst/files/the%20first%20sewing%20machine1.pdf|title=Who invented the first sewing machine?}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Austrian tailor, [[Josef Madersperger]], began developing his first sewing machine in 1807. He presented his first working machine in 1814. Having received financial support from his government, the Austrian tailor worked on the development of his machine until 1839 but he couldn’t create anything worthwhile. Perhaps the tailor didn’t have the technical wit, perhaps technical knowledge, and perhaps – simple luck. But the fact remains that state money was wasted. However, in 1839 he built a machine imitating the weaving process using the chain stitch. 

The first practical and widely used sewing machine was invented by [[Barthélemy Thimonnier]], a French tailor, in 1829. His machine sewed straight seams using [[chain stitch]] like Saint's model, and in 1830, he signed a contract with Auguste Ferrand, a [[mining engineer]], who made the requisite drawings and submitted a patent application. The [[patent]] for his machine was issued on 17 July 1830, and in the same year, he opened (with partners) the first machine-based clothing manufacturing company in the world to create army uniforms for the [[French Army]]. However, the [[factory]] was burned down, reportedly by workers fearful of losing their livelihood following the issuing of the patent.&lt;ref name="Thimmonier"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/536932/sewing-machine], "Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2011. Web. 31 Dec. 2011.".&lt;/ref&gt;

A model of the machine is exhibited at the [[London Science Museum]]. The machine is made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop. The first American [[lockstitch]] sewing machine was invented by [[Walter Hunt (inventor)|Walter Hunt]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismacs.net/sewing_machine_history.html A Brief History of the Sewing Machine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His machine used an eye-pointed needle (with the eye and the point on the same end) carrying the upper thread and a falling shuttle carrying the lower thread. The curved needle moved through the fabric horizontally, leaving the loop as it withdrew. The shuttle passed through the loop, interlocking the thread. The feed let the machine down, requiring the machine to be stopped frequently and reset up. Hunt eventually lost interest in his machine and sold individual machines without bothering to patent his invention, and only patenting it at a late date of 1854.  In 1842, John Greenough patented the first sewing machine in the United States. The British partners Newton and Archibold introduced the eye-pointed needle and the use of two pressing surfaces to keep the pieces of fabric in position, in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ismacs.net/howe/case_against_elias_howe.html |title=Case Against Howe|accessdate=2013-12-17|author=Forsdyke, Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first machine to combine all the disparate elements of the previous half-century of innovation into the modern sewing machine was the device built by English inventor John Fisher in 1844,  thus a little earlier than the very similar machines  built by  [[Isaac Merritt Singer]]  in 1851, and  the lesser known [[Elias Howe]], in 1845. However, due to the botched filing of Fisher's patent at the Patent Office, he did not receive due recognition for the modern sewing machine in the legal disputations of priority with Singer, and it was Singer who won the benefits of the patent.

=== Industrial competition ===
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Elias Howe]], born in Spencer, Massachusetts, created his sewing machine in 1845, using a similar method to Fisher's except that the fabric was held vertically. An important improvement on his machine was to have the needle running away from the point, starting from the eye.&lt;ref&gt;Elias Howe Jr., Sewing Machine, United States Patent Office, US Patent 4,750, issued 10 September 1846, expired 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; After a lengthy stay in England trying to attract interest in his machine, he returned to America to find various people infringing his patent, among them [[Isaac Merritt Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Bill Bryson]]: ''Made in America: an Informal History of the English Language in the United States'', Black Swan, 1998, {{ISBN|0-552-99805-2}}, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually won a case for patent infringement in 1854 and was awarded the right to claim royalties from the manufacturers using ideas covered by his patent, including Singer.

Singer had seen a rotary sewing machine being repaired in a Boston shop. As an engineer, he thought it was clumsy and decided to design a better one. The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a presser foot to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic tension system. This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe's machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851, and it was suggested {{by whom|date=August 2014}} he patent the foot pedal or [[treadle]], used to power some of his machines; unfortunately, the foot pedal had been in use too long for a patent to be issued. When Howe learned of Singer's machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a [[lump sum]] for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe's patent and paid him $1.15 per machine before entering into a [[Joint venture|joint partnership]] with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first [[hire-purchase]] arrangement to allow people to buy their machines through payments over time.

Meanwhile, [[Allen B. Wilson]] developed a shuttle that [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocated]] in a short arc, which was an improvement over Singer and Howe's. However, John Bradshaw had patented a similar device and threatened to sue, so Wilson decided to try a new method. He went into partnership with [[Nathaniel Wheeler]] to produce a machine with a [[rotary hook]] instead of a shuttle. This was far quieter and smoother than other methods, with the result that the [[Wheeler &amp; Wilson]] Company produced more machines in the 1850s and 1860s than any other manufacturer. Wilson also invented the four-motion feed mechanism that is still seen on every sewing machine today. This had a forward, down, back and up motion, which drew the cloth through in an even and smooth motion. Charles Miller patented the first machine to stitch [[buttonhole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|10609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1850s more and more companies were being formed, each trying to sue the others for patent infringement.  This triggered a [[patent thicket]] known as the Sewing Machine War.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Mossoff, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354849 A Stitch in Time: The Rise and Fall of the Sewing Machine Patent Thicket]; summarized and discussed at [http://volokh.com/posts/chain_1240849478.shtml Sewing Machine Blogging], The Volokh Conspiracy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seworbit.com |url=https://www.seworbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, the [[Sewing Machine Combination]] was formed, consisting of Singer, Howe, Wheeler, Wilson, Grover and Baker. These four companies pooled their patents, with the result that all other manufacturers had to obtain a license and pay $15 per machine. This lasted until 1877 when the last patent expired. 

[[James Edward Allen Gibbs]] (1829–1902), a farmer from Raphine in Rockbridge County, Virginia patented the first [[chain stitch]] single-thread sewing machine on June 2, 1857. In partnership with James Willcox, Gibbs became a principal partner in Willcox &amp; Gibbs Sewing Machine Company. Willcox &amp; Gibbs commercial sewing machines are still used in the 21st century.

=== Spread and maturation ===
[[File:Jonescs.jpg|thumb|Jones Family CS machine from around 1935]]

William Jones started making sewing machines in 1859 and in 1860 formed a partnership with Thomas Chadwick. As [[Jones Sewing Machine Company|Chadwick &amp; Jones]], they manufactured sewing machines at [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], England until 1863. Their machines used designs from Howe and Wilson produced under licence.&lt;ref&gt;Veteran Sewing Machines by E Brian Jewel pp. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Chadwick later joined Bradbury &amp; Co. William Jones opened a factory in [[Guide Bridge]], Manchester in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Sewing Machines by K. R Gilbert (1970) published for the London Science Museum pp12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 a Jones advertising sheet claimed that this factory was the "Largest Factory in England Exclusively Making First Class Sewing Machines".&lt;ref&gt;Sewalot at: http://www.sewalot.com/jones_sewing_machines.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was renamed as the Jones Sewing Machine Co. Ltd and was later acquired by [[Brother Industries]] of Japan, in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Brother Industries at: {{cite web |url=http://www.brother.co.uk/g3.cfm/s_page/204540 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419073315/http://www.brother.co.uk/g3.cfm/s_page/204540 |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sewing patterns.jpg|thumb|left|Vintage sewing patterns]]
Clothing manufacturers were the first sewing machine customers, and used them to produce the first [[ready-to-wear]] clothing and shoes. In the 1860s consumers began purchasing them, and the machines—ranging in price from £6 to £15 in Britain depending on features—became very common in middle-class homes. Owners were much more likely to spend free time with their machines to make and mend clothing for their families than to visit friends, and [[women's magazine]]s and household guides such as ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|Mrs Beeton's]]'' offered [[dress pattern]]s and instructions. A sewing machine could produce a man's shirt in about one hour, compared to 14 1/2 hours by hand.&lt;ref name="draznin2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=Victorian London's Middle-Class Housewife: What She Did All Day (#179) | publisher=Greenwood Press | author=Draznin, Yaffa Claire | year=2001 | series=Contributions in Women's Studies | location=Westport, Connecticut | pages=66–68 | isbn=0-313-31399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 the world's first [[crochet]] machine was invented and patented by [[Joseph M. Merrow]], then-president of what had started in the 1840s as a machine shop to develop specialized machinery for the knitting operations. This crochet machine was the first production [[overlock]] sewing machine. The [[Merrow Machine Company]] went on to become one of the largest American Manufacturers of [[overlock]] sewing machines and continues to be a global presence in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.

In 1885 Singer patented the [[Singer Vibrating Shuttle]] sewing machine, which used Allen B. Wilson's idea for a vibrating shuttle and was a better lockstitcher than the oscillating shuttles of the time. Millions of the machines, perhaps the world's first really practical sewing machine for domestic use, were produced until finally superseded by rotary shuttle machines in the 20th century. Sewing machines continued being made to roughly the same design, with more lavish decoration appearing until well into the 1900s.

The first electric machines were developed by [[Singer Corporation|Singer Sewing Co.]] and introduced in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/sewmachine.htm Sewing Machine History – Invention of the Sewing Machine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[First World War]], Singer was offering hand, treadle and electric machines for sale. At first, the electric machines were standard machines with a motor strapped on the side, but as more homes gained power, they became more popular and the motor was gradually introduced into the casing.

=== Stitches ===
[[File:Husqvarna 3600 C226.jpg|thumb|The [[bobbin driver]] of a [[VSM Group AB|Husqvarna]] 3600 sewing machine]]

Sewing machines can make a great variety of plain or patterned stitches. Ignoring strictly decorative aspects, over three dozen distinct stitch formations are formally recognized by the ISO 4915:1991 standard, involving one to seven separate threads to form the stitch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amefird.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Stitch-Type-Matrix.pdf Summary of stitch types]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plain stitches fall into four general categories: [[chainstitch]], [[lockstitch]], [[overlock]], and [[coverstitch]].

==== Chainstitch ====

Chainstitch was used by early sewing machines and has two major drawbacks:[[File:chainstitch1.gif|thumb|right|The basic chain stitch.]]

* The stitch is not self-locking, and if the thread breaks at any point or is not tied at both ends, the whole length of stitching comes out. It is also easily ripped out.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;[http://home.howstuffworks.com/sewing-machine1.htm] The Home Sewing Machine&lt;/ref&gt;
* The direction of sewing cannot be changed much from one stitch to the next, or the stitching process fails.

A better stitch was found in the lockstitch. The chainstitch is still used today in clothing manufacture, though due to its major drawback it is generally paired with an [[overlock]] stitch along the same seam.

==== Lockstitch ====
[[File:lockani1.gif|thumb|Formation of a lock-stitch using a boat shuttle as employed in early domestic machines]]
[[File:Lockstitch.gif|thumb|Lockstitch utilising a rotating hook invented by Allen B Wilson. This is employed on many modern machines]]
[[File:G&amp;bani.gif|frame|Formation of the double locking chain stitch]]

[[Lockstitch]] is the familiar stitch performed by most household sewing machines and most industrial "single needle" sewing machines from two threads, one passed through a needle and one coming from a bobbin or shuttle. Each thread stays on the same side of the material being sewn, interlacing with the other thread at each needle hole by means of a [[bobbin drivers|bobbin driver]]. As a result, a lockstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn; it does not need to be near an edge.

==== Overlock ====

[[Image:Overlockerindustrial.jpg|thumb|A Zoje industrial overlocker]]
[[Overlock]], also known as "serging" or "serger stitch", can be formed with one to four threads, one or two needles, and one or two loopers. Overlock sewing machines are usually equipped with knives that trim or create the edge immediately in front of the stitch formation. Household and industrial overlock machines are commonly used for garment seams in knit or stretchy fabrics, for garment seams where the fabric is light enough that the seam does not need to be pressed open, and for protecting edges against raveling. Machines using two to four threads are most common, and frequently one machine can be configured for several varieties of overlock stitch. Overlock machines with five or more threads usually make both a chainstitch with one needle and one looper, and an overlock stitch with the remaining needles and loopers. This combination is known as a "safety stitch". A similar machine used for stretch fabrics is called a ''mock safety''.

==== Coverstitch ====

Coverstitch is formed by two or more needles and one or two loopers. Like lockstitch and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a bottom cover stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper threads covers raw seam edges, much as the overlock stitch does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.

==== Zigzag stitch ====
[[File:Regular zig-zag.svg|thumb|Zigzag stitch]]

A [[zigzag stitch]] is a variant geometry of the lockstitch. It is a back-and-forth stitch used where a straight stitch will not suffice, such as in preventing raveling of a fabric, in stitching stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge.

When creating a zigzag stitch, the back-and-forth motion of the sewing machine's needle is controlled by a [[cam]]. As the cam rotates, a fingerlike follower, connected to the needle bar, rides along the cam and tracks its indentations. As the follower moves in and out, the needle bar is moved from side to side.&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's Digest Complete Guide to Sewing''. Pleasantville, New York: The Reader's Digest Association, Inc., pp. 32–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Very old sewing machines lack this hardware and so cannot natively produce a zigzag stitch, but there are often shank-driven attachments available which enable them to do so.

=== Feed mechanisms ===

Besides the basic motion of needles, loopers and [[bobbin]]s, the material being sewn must move so that each cycle of needle motion involves a different part of the material. This motion is known as feed, and sewing machines have almost as many ways of feeding material as they do of forming stitches. For general categories, there are: drop feed, needle feed, walking foot, puller, and manual. Often, multiple types of feed are used on the same machine. Besides these general categories, there are also uncommon feed mechanisms used in specific applications like edge joining fur, making seams on caps, and blindstitching.

==== Drop feed ====
[[File:Two threads threaded sewing machine.jpg|thumb|Presser foot raised with feed dogs visible]]

The drop feed mechanism is used by almost all household machines and involves a mechanism below the sewing surface of the machine. When the needle is withdrawn from the material being sewn, a set of "[[feed dogs]]" is pushed up through slots in the machine surface, then dragged horizontally past the needle. The dogs are serrated to grip the material, and a "presser foot" is used to keep the material in contact with the dogs. At the end of their horizontal motion, the dogs are lowered again and returned to their original position while the needle makes its next pass through the material. While the needle is in the material, there is no feed action. Almost all household machines and the majority of industrial machines use drop feed. 

==== Differential feed ====
Differential feed is a variation of drop feed with two independent sets of dogs, one before and one after the needle. By changing their relative motions, these sets of dogs can be used to stretch or compress the material in the vicinity of the needle. This is extremely useful when sewing stretchy material, and overlock machines (heavily used for such materials) frequently have differential feed.

==== Needle feed ====

A needle feed, used only in industrial machines, moves the material while the needle is in the material. In fact, the needle may be the primary feeding force. Some implementations of needle feed rock the axis of needle motion back and forth, while other implementations keep the axis vertical while moving it forward and back. In both cases, there is no feed action while the needle is out of the material. Needle feed is often used in conjunction with a modified drop feed, and is very common on industrial two needle machines. Household machines do not use needle feed as a general rule.

==== Walking foot ====
[[File:Davis1.jpg|thumb|Vintage Davis vertical feed (walking foot) sewing machine produced around 1890]]

A [[walking foot]] replaces the stationary [[presser foot]] with one that moves along with whatever other feed mechanisms the machine already has. As the walking foot moves, it shifts the workpiece along with it. It is most useful for sewing heavy materials where needle feed is mechanically inadequate, for spongy or cushioned materials where lifting the foot out of contact with the material helps in the feeding action, and for sewing many layers together where a drop feed will cause the lower layers to shift out of position with the upper layers.

==== Puller feed ====

Some factory machines and a few household machines are set up with an auxiliary ''puller feed'', which grips the material being sewn (usually from behind the needles) and pulls it with a force and reliability usually not possible with other types of feed. Puller feeds are seldom built directly into the basic sewing machine. Their action must be synchronized with the needle and feed action built into the machine to avoid damaging the machine. Pullers are also limited to straight seams, or very nearly so. Despite their additional cost and limitations, pulling feeds are very useful when making large heavy items like tents and vehicle covers.

==== Manual feed ====

A manual feed is used primarily in freehand embroidery, quilting, and shoe repair. With manual feed, the stitch length and direction is controlled entirely by the motion of the material being sewn. Frequently some form of hoop or stabilizing material is used with fabric to keep the material under proper tension and aid in moving it around. Most household machines can be set for manual feed by disengaging the drop feed dogs. Most industrial machines can not be used for manual feed without actually removing the feed dogs.

=== Needles ===
{{Main article|Sewing machine needle}}

Sewing machines use special needles tailored to their needs and to the character of the material being sewn.

===Industrial vs domestic===
[[File:Industrialvdomesticsewing.jpeg|thumbnail|Industrial Sewing Machine (left), Domestic Sewing machine (right)]]
Industrial sewing machines are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task. Industrial machines, unlike domestic machines, perform a single dedicated task and are capable of long hours of usage and as such have larger moving parts and comparatively much larger motors. Industrial machines are also more generic; a motor for almost any type of machine can work on any brand. Sewing feet and bobbins between brands are interchangeable. However, with domestic machines the motor, and to a lesser extent bobbins and sewing feet, are brand specific.

The motors on industrial machines, as with most of their components, lights, etc., are separate, usually mounted to the underside of the table. Domestic machines have their [[OEM]] motors mounted inside the machine. There are two different types of motor available for industrial machines: a servo motor (which uses less electricity and is silent when not in use), and the more traditional clutch motor (which is always spinning; even when not in use).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/beginners-guide-to-sewing-with-industrial-machines/ Beginner’s guide to sewing with industrial machines&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social impact ==
[[File:Eatons Seamstresses.jpg|thumb|Seamstresses in 1904]]

Before sewing machines were invented women spent much of their time maintaining their family's clothing. Middle-class housewives, even with the aid of a hired seamstress, would devote several days of each month to this task. It took an experienced seamstress at least 14 hours to make a dress shirt for a man; a woman's dress took 10 hours;&lt;ref name="SewingMachine"&gt;[http://www.moah.org/exhibits/virtual/sewing.html Sewing Machine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109065246/http://www.moah.org/exhibits/virtual/sewing.html |date=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a pair of summer pants took nearly three hours.&lt;ref name="19thCenturyFashionandtheSewingMachine" &gt;[http://historywired.si.edu/detail.cfm?ID=502 19th Century Fashion and the Sewing Machine]&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals would have only two sets of clothing: a work outfit and a Sunday outfit.

Sewing machines reduced the time for making a dress shirt to an hour and 15 minutes; the time to make a dress to an hour;&lt;ref name="SewingMachine" /&gt; and the time for a pair of summer pants to 38 minutes.&lt;ref name="19thCenturyFashionandtheSewingMachine" /&gt; This reduced labor resulted in women having a diminished role in [[household management]], and allowed more hours for their own [[leisure]] as well as the ability to seek more employment.&lt;ref name="SewingMachine" /&gt;
[[File:Woman with Singer.jpg|thumb|Woman using a treadle sewing machine manufactured by Singer]]
[[File:Commercial. Clothing Factory. St. Hubert street, Montreal. Maurice Laniel BAnQ P48S1P06570.jpg|thumb|People working in a clothing factory in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1941]]
Industrial use of sewing machines further reduced the burden placed upon housewives, moving clothing production from housewives and seamstresses to large-scale [[factory|factories]].&lt;ref name="SewingMachine" /&gt; The movement to large-scale factories also resulted in a decrease in the amount of time clothing production took, which caused the prices for clothing to drop significantly. This is because manufacturers were able to decrease the number of workers needed to produce the same amount of clothing, resulting in reduced costs. Increased supply also lowered the cost.&lt;ref name="19thCenturyFashionandtheSewingMachine" /&gt;

The initial effects of sewing machines on workers were both positive and negative, however in the long run the negative effects decreased. Many of the women who had previously been busy at home could now seek employment in factories, increasing the income for their family. This allowed for families to be able to afford more sets of clothing and items than they previously could.&lt;ref name="19thCenturyFashionandtheSewingMachine" /&gt; For seamstresses, home sewing machines allowed them to produce clothing for the average person during periods when demand for fitted clothes was low, effectively increasing their earnings. When industrial sewing machines initially became popular many seamstresses working in factories, as well as those working at home, lost their jobs as it meant that fewer workers could produce the same output.&lt;ref name="SewingMachine" /&gt; In the long run these now unemployed workers along with thousands of men and children would eventually be able to gain employment in jobs created as the clothing industry grew.&lt;ref name="19thCenturyFashionandtheSewingMachine" /&gt;

The sewing machine's effects on the clothing industry resulted in major changes for other industries as well. Cotton production needed to increase in order to match the demand of the new clothing factories. As a result, cotton became planted in new areas where it hadn't previously been farmed. Other industries involved in the process benefited as well such as metal companies who provided for parts of the machines and shippers to move the increased amounts of goods.&lt;ref name="TheSewingMachineandItsImpactonAmerica" &gt;[http://sewingmachine.umwblogs.org/the-sewing-machine-its-impact-on-america/ The Sewing Machine and Its Impact on America]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being important for clothing production, sewing machines also became important in the manufacturing of furniture with upholstery, curtains and towels, toys, books, and many other products.&lt;ref name="TheSewingMachineandItsImpactonAmerica" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2041">The '''China-UK Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network''' ('''SAIN''') is a [[Sustainable agriculture]] Network launched in 2008 to provide a framework for collaboration on [[agriculture]] and [[climate change]] between the [[UK]] and [[China]].

The agreement supports the already existing China-UK Sustainable Development Dialogue (SDD) signed by the [[Chinese Ministry of Agriculture]] and the UK [[Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA). Agreed upon by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the development of SAIN was included in the SDD work program on Sustainable Agriculture and Fisheries. After being originally proposed at the UK-China Partners in Science Conference in North West China, a business plan was created after consultation with Chinese stake-holders, bilateral agencies, and international organizations. in December 2008, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and Department of Environment, food and Rural Affairs  accepted and adopted the new policy.

The UK-China Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network has four primary goals:
1. Support UK-China SDD by policy approaches, institutional mechanisms, and moving policy and science to the ground level.
2. Encourage and grow research on environmentally sustainable agriculture and its relevance to local, national, and the global economy.
3. Gather important actors, such as farmers and policy makers, and educate them on environmentally sustainable agriculture issues. 
4. Increase global sustainability with south-south learning.

The organization of SAIN consists of a Governing Board, two Secretariat Offices, and Working Groups. The North West Agriculture Forestry University in China and East Anglia University in England are the locations of the two Secretariat Offices.

'''Top Industrial Managers for Europe (T.I.M.E.)''' is a network of fifty-three [[engineering school]]s and faculties and [[technical universities]]. The oldest European network of engineering schools in its field, the T.I.M.E. Association promotes [[graduate student]] exchanges and double degrees throughout Europe and the world to enable students to achieve a broader, high-level scientific engineering education with in-depth intercultural experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time-association.org/history/|title=T.I.M.E. History {{!}} T.I.M.E.|website=www.time-association.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422032705/http://www.time-association.org/history/|archive-date=2017-04-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundreds of graduate students per year participate in T.I.M.E. mobility activities and pursue double degrees (at Master and Doctorate levels). Double degrees require the participating student to spend more than three semesters in another member university and at least the same in her/his home university, in order to be awarded two full degrees.

The T.I.M.E. network includes primarily graduate engineering schools and technical universities from Europe, but increasing numbers of members are now from other continents.

== History ==
In 1989, the T.I.M.E. network was created at the [[École Centrale Paris]], a leading French engineering school. Its main purpose was to coordinate European double degree and exchange programmes in engineering at the Master’s level. The T.I.M.E. network had 16 founding members, each a leading engineering institution in its respective country.

The T.I.M.E. Association was formally incorporated as a not-for-profit body under French law in 1997, with 29 members. Current membership (2015-2016) is 53 institutions from 20 countries. To date, the T.I.M.E network has produced more than 5,000 graduates in total.

TIME members include the following engineering schools and faculties and technical universities:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time-association.org/membership/list/|title=List of Members (July 1st. 2015) {{!}} T.I.M.E.|website=www.time-association.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''urban stream''' is a formerly natural [[River|waterway]] that flows through a [[Urban area|heavily populated area]].  Urban streams are often [[Water pollution|polluted]] by [[urban runoff]] and [[combined sewer]] outflows.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Christopher J. et al.(2005).[http://www.biology.duke.edu/wilson/EcoSysServices/papers/WalshEtal2005.pdf "The urban stream syndrome: current knowledge and the search for a cure."] ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society,'' 2005, 24(3):706–723. {{DOI|10.1899/04-028.1}}, {{ISSN|0887-3593}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water scarcity]] makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence, J.E., C.P.W. Pavia, S. Kaing, H.N. Bischel, R.G. Luthy, and V.H. Resh |title= Recycled Water for Augmenting Urban Streams in Mediterranean-climate Regions: A Potential Approach for Riparian Ecosystem Enhancement |journal=Hydrological Sciences Journal |year=2014 |volume=59|pages= 488–501 |doi=10.1080/02626667.2013.818221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments may alter the flow or course of an urban stream to prevent localized [[flood|flooding]] by [[river engineering]]: lining [[stream bed]]s with [[concrete]] or other [[hardscape]] materials, diverting the stream into [[culvert]]s and [[storm sewer]]s, or other means. Some urban streams, such as the [[subterranean rivers of London]], run completely underground. These modifications have often reduced habitat for [[fish]] and other species, caused downstream flooding due to alterations of [[flood plain]]s, and worsened [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national-management-measures |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hobart Rivulet Underground.jpg|thumb|right|Some urban streams, such as the [[Hobart Rivulet]] in [[Tasmania]], run [[Subterranean river|underground]] for substantial distances]]
Some communities have begun [[stream restoration]] projects in an attempt to correct the problems caused by alteration, using techniques such as [[daylighting (streams)|daylighting]] and fixing stream bank [[Erosion#Water|erosion]] caused by heavy [[stormwater]] runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=California Department of Water Resources|title=Urban Streams Restoration Program |url=http://www.watershedrestoration.water.ca.gov/urbanstreams/ |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Andrew C. |last= Revkin |authorlink= |title= Rolling Back Pavement to Expose Watery Havens |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/asia/17daylight.html?_r=1 |format= |work= [[New York Times]] |publisher= |location= |date=16 July 2009|accessdate=19 July 2009 |quote= }}

'''xD-Picture Card''' is a [[flash memory card]] format, used in [[digital camera]]s made by [[Olympus company|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]]. The xD in the xD-Picture Card stands for eXtreme Digital.

xD cards have been manufactured with capacities of 16&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] up to 2&amp;nbsp;GB. They are not used in any cameras currently in production.

== History ==

The cards were developed by [[Olympus company|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]], and introduced into the market in July 2002. [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] and [[Samsung Electronics]] manufactured the cards for Olympus and Fujifilm. xD cards were sold under other [[brand]]s, including [[Kodak]], [[SanDisk]], [[PNY Technologies|PNY]], and [[Lexar]], but were not branded with the respective companies' logos, except for Kodak. Previously, xD competed primarily with [[Secure Digital]] (SD) cards, [[CompactFlash]] (CF), and [[Sony]]'s [[Memory Stick]]. Because of its higher cost and limited usage in products other than digital cameras, xD lost ground to SD, which is broadly used by cellular phones, personal computers, digital audio players and many other digital cameras.

Olympus began to move away from the xD format with the release of the [[Olympus E-P1|E-P1]] camera, which supported only [[Secure Digital]] memory cards.&lt;ref name="olympusamerica.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Olympus America Inc. - CCS Department |url=http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/product.asp?product=1461&amp;page=specs |title=Archived Products &amp;gt E-P1 |publisher=Olympusamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222202105/http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/product.asp?product=1461&amp;page=specs |archivedate=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Spring 2010, all new Olympus cameras announced at the 2010 [[CES 2010|Consumer Electronics Show]] and [[Photo Marketing Association Annual Convention and Trade Show|Photo Marketing Association International Trade Show]] can use SD cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympusamerica.com/oai_HeadlinesDetails.asp?pressNo=727 | title = The New Olympus FE Series Just May Be The World's Smartest Entry-Level Cameras | publisher = Olympusamerica.com | date = 2010-01-07 | accessdate = 2011-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympusamerica.com/oai_HeadlinesDetails.asp?pressNo=733 | title = Return From Life's Everyday Adventures With High Definition Proof: The New Olympus STYLUS TOUGH-3000 | publisher = Olympusamerica.com | date = 2010-01-07 | accessdate = 2011-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympusamerica.com/oai_HeadlinesDetails.asp?pressNo=734 | title = Are You Ready For Your Closeup?

The higher-end DSLR cameras such as the E-3 and E-5 among others continue to use Compact Flash cards as well.

== Comparison with rival formats ==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}
The xD format has been discontinued. New cards are still manufactured, but cameras supporting xD memory cards exclusively are no longer manufactured.

=== Advantages ===

* Contains no [[flash translation layer]] (designed to emulate the block device structure of a [[hard disk drive|magnetic disk drive]]). Better-designed [[flash file system]]s can directly access the [[NAND flash|NAND]] flash hardware.
* Very similar to a standard NAND chip. Modified XD readers can be used to read arbitrary NAND chips.

=== Disadvantages ===

* Card format is [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] to Fujifilm and Olympus, just as the Memory Stick format is to Sony. No public documentation available (see below for [[reverse-engineering]] results). In contrast, the CompactFlash format is described by completely open and free specifications.
* Has not kept up with the transfer rate, or speed, of other cards, notably CompactFlash and SD, but also the later versions of the Memory Stick. The fastest xD card offers less than 10% of the speed of current (2009) CompactFlash cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
* Directly derived from the [[Smart Media]] card. Thus, has no [[wear leveling]] controller. May have a shorter life span than comparable cards with FTL wear levelers ''if'' the file system used does not take into account wear leveling.
* Generally more expensive than other memory card types. {{as of|2009|9}}, 2&amp;nbsp;GiB xD cards' retail prices are approximately three times those of same-capacity SD cards.
* Many newer Olympus and Fujifilm digital cameras accept the more popular [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[CompactFlash|CF]] cards, in addition to or instead of the xD format.
* Small maximum capacity relative to other memory card formats. First-generation xD cards have a maximum capacity of only 512&amp;nbsp;MiB. Type M expands the theoretical maximum capacity to 8&amp;nbsp;GiB, but {{as of|2009|1|lc=on}}, there are no cards available with capacity greater than 2&amp;nbsp;GiB.
* Although physically smaller than Secure Digital and Memory Stick cards, xD cards are ''larger'' than these competitors' reduced-size variants ([[microSD]] and [[Memory Stick Micro]]).
* Less widely supported by camera, card reader, and accessory manufacturers than other formats. {{As of|2010|01}}, SD cards (and variants) are supported by all consumer-level digital cameras from major manufacturers.

[[File:XD-MicroSD.JPG|thumb|upright|A size comparison of an xD-Picture card with a MicroSD Card]]

The original xD cards were available in 16&amp;nbsp;MiB to 512&amp;nbsp;MiB capacities. The Type M card, released in February 2005,&lt;ref name="Steve 2005-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steves-digicams.com/pr/olympus_02152005_1gbxd_pr.html |title=Olympus 1 GiB xD |publisher=Steves-digicams.com |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[multi-level cell]] (MLC) architecture to achieve a theoretical storage capacity of up to 8&amp;nbsp;GiB. {{As of|2010|June}}, Type M cards are available in sizes from 256&amp;nbsp;MiB to 2&amp;nbsp;GiB. However, the Type M suffers from slower read/write speeds than the original cards.

The Type H card, first released in November 2005,&lt;ref name="Steve 2005-11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steves-digicams.com/pr/olympus_11282005_typeh-xd_pr.html |title=Olympus Type H xD |publisher=Steves-digicams.com |date=2005-11-28 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers higher data rates than Type M cards (theoretically as much as 3 times faster). As of 2008, Type H cards were only available in 256&amp;nbsp;MiB, 512&amp;nbsp;MiB, 1&amp;nbsp;GiB, and 2&amp;nbsp;GiB capacities. Both Fuji and Olympus discontinued the production of Type H cards in 2008, citing high production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | url = http://www.dpreview.com/news/0801/08012301olympusxd.asp | title = Faster xD Picture Cards launched: Digital Photography Review | publisher = Dpreview.com | date = 2008-01-23 | accessdate = 2011-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Type M+ card, first released in April 2008,&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympuspresspass.com/press_pass_cut/opp_press_details.asp?pressNo=578 |title=Olympus Introduces New High-Speed xD-Picture Card For Digital Cameras |publisher=Olympus Press Pass |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers data rates 1.5 times that of Type M cards. As of 2008, cards are available only in 1 and 2 GiB capacities.

Olympus says that its xD cards support special "picture effects" when used in some Olympus cameras, though these software features are not intrinsically hardware-dependent. Type H and M+ cards however, are required in newer models to capture video at high rate (640×480 @ 30fps). Due to changes in the cards' storage architecture, newer Type M and H cards may have compatibility issues with some older cameras (especially video recording). Compatibility lists are available for Olympus: Olympus America's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_xdcompatibility.asp |title=FE-Series : xD Compatibility Chart |publisher=Olympus America |date= |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fujifilm's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital/accessories/card/index.html#compati |title=Card Adapter |publisher=Fujifilm Global |date= |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer cards are incompatible with some [[card reader]]s.

=== Theoretical transfer speeds ===

Pictures may be transferred from a digital camera's xD card to a [[personal computer]] by plugging the camera into the PC via a [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394]] cable, or by removing the card from the camera and inserting it into a [[card reader]]. In both cases, the computer sees the card as a [[mass storage]] device containing image files, although software or firmware can alter this representation. Card readers may be integrated into the PC or attached via cable. Adapters are available to allow an xD picture card to be plugged into other readers (and in some cases cameras), including [[PC card]], [[parallel port]], [[CompactFlash]] and [[Smart Media|SmartMedia]].

=== Detailed specifications ===

Detailed specifications are tightly controlled by Olympus and Fujifilm, which charge licensing fees and royalties and require [[non-disclosure agreements]] in exchange for the technical information required to produce xD-compatible devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xd-picture.com/obtain/index.html How to obtain xD-Picture Card License] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703131155/http://www.xd-picture.com/obtain/index.html |date=July 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory format used is not well documented. It is difficult to study it directly, since most camera devices and most [[USB]] [[card reader]]s do not provide direct access to the flash memory. Since the cards are controller-less, cameras and card readers must perform [[wear leveling]] and error detection. They normally hide the portion of the memory which stores this information (among other things) from higher level access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elinux.org/JuiceBox_UMDCart |title=JuiceBox UMDCart |publisher=eLinux.org |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a few models of xD card readers based on the Alauda chip ''do'' allow direct access (bypassing the above mechanisms) to an xD card's flash memory. These readers have been [[reverse-engineer]]ed and [[Linux]] [[device driver|driver]]s have been produced by the [[Alauda Project]], which has documented the on-chip data structures of the xD card.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alauda.sourceforge.net/wikka.php?wakka=XdMedia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311054942/http://alauda.sourceforge.net/wikka.php?wakka=XdMedia |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this information, xD card headers are similar to those used by SmartMedia, and include chip manufacturer information.

==== Raw hardware ====
{{Original research|section|date=July 2011}}
[[File:XD card 16M Fujifilm back.jpg|thumb|upright|The back of an xD card, showing the 18 pins]]
[[File:XD Card to USB adapter with cards.jpg|thumb|upright|xD card reader for USB]]

At the raw hardware level, an xD card is simply an ordinary [[NAND flash]] [[integrated circuit]] in an unusual package. Comparing the pinout of an xD card&lt;ref name="pinout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinouts.ru/Memory/xd_card_pinout.shtml |title=xD card pinout |publisher=Pinouts.ru |date= |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trcdatarecovery.com/docs/NandDesignGuide.pdf NAND Design Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; to the pinout of a NAND flash chip in a standard [[Thin small-outline package|TSOP]] package,&lt;ref name="pinout"/&gt; one finds a nearly one-to-one correspondence between the active pins of the two devices. xD cards share this characteristic with the older [[SmartMedia]] cards, which are also basically raw NAND flash chips, albeit in a larger package.

xD and SmartMedia cards can be used by hobbyists as a convenient source of NAND flash memory chips for custom projects. For example, the [[Mattel]] [[Juice Box]] [[Portable media player|PMP]] can be booted into Linux using a modified cartridge containing an xD card with a boot image written on it. Additionally, SmartMedia and xD card readers can be used to read the data from NAND flash chips in electronic devices, by soldering leads between the chip and the card reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandonu.googlepages.com/camcorderhack |title=xD NAND Flash Reader |publisher=Brandonu.googlepages.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2007/05/05/read-embedded-flash-chips/ |title=Read Embedded Flash Chips |publisher=Uchobby.com |date=2007-05-05 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Panoramic mode ====

Some Olympus cameras offer camera-based [[panoramic]] processing.  In those cameras that support both xD and [[CompactFlash]] cards, panoramic processing only works with images stored on the xD card, if installed. Newer Olympus cameras have neither xD cards nor this restriction.

Unsubtantiated reports claim that some cameras such as the E-450 only support panoramic processing when using Olympus branded xD cards.  The model numbers have not been documented.  In this case, there appears to be a workaround: it appears that the card manufacturer information is simply stored in the flash memory, in the Card Information Structure (described in the Alauda Project's documentation, see above). Thus, it is possible to alter another brand of xD card to present itself as Olympus xD card by accessing the raw flash memory. This can be done by using a hacked [[device driver]] for a USB card reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/roberthaus/pan/ |title=Robert Haus |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027054358/http://geocities.com/roberthaus/pan/ |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
