The '''A.L. Monsohn Lithographic Press''' (דפוס אבן א"ל מאנזאהן) was established in [[Jerusalem]] in 1892 by Abraham-Leib (or Avrom-Leyb) [[Monsohn Family of Jerusalem|Monsohn]] II (Jerusalem, c.1871-1930) and his brother Moshe-Mordechai (Meyshe-Mordkhe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Grayevski |first1= Pinḥas |title= Osef temunot (albom) mi-yelide ha-aretz: rabbanim, ḥakhamim u-sofrim, ‘asqane ha-ṣibbur |date=1930|publisher= Yerushalayim : Pinḥas Grayevski |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/osef-temunot-albom-mi-yelide-ha-arets-rabanim-hakhamim-u-sofrim-askane-ha-tsibur/oclc/53190977&amp;referer=brief_results/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by members of the Hamburger family,&lt;ref name="On the lithographic activities of Abraham-Leib and Moshe-Mordechai Monsohn in Jerusalem, in ''Ha-Melitz'' no. 203, 19 September 1897."&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.jpress.nli.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_heb/?action=search&amp;text=%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%91%20%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%96%D7%90%D7%94%D7%9F|title= "The Holy Land: Letters from Jerusalem," ''Ha-Melitz'', Jerusalem, 19 September 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; the brothers had been sent to [[Frankfurt]] in 1890 to study [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monzon|first1=Shimon|last2=Gavish|first2=Galia|last3=Appleton|first3=Judith|title= A.

Monsohn Lithographic Press in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]. At first it was situated in [[Bab al-Huta]]; it was later moved to the courtyard opposite what is today the Old Yishuv Court Museum ([[Hebrew]]: [[:he:מוזיאון חצר היישוב הישן|מוזיאון חצר היישוב הישן]]) at 6 Or Ha-Hayim Street in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], where Abraham-Leib Monsohn lived with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Grayevski |first1=Pinḥas |title=Mi-ginzei Yerushalayim,ḥoveret 6,pp. 29-30|date=1930|publisher=Yerushalayim :Tsiyon |url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/mi-ginze-yerushalayim-kolel-teudot-historiyot-le-toldot-ha-yishuv-ha-yehudi-be-erez-yisrael/oclc/13222572&amp;referer=brief_results/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the Old City, the press was relocated to the [[Mamilla]] section of Jerusalem, and later to Yosef Ziv Street in the [[Tel Arza]] neighborhood. The Monsohn Press produced about 300 color prints per day, the only color printing done at the time in Jerusalem. In 1894 they imported a new machine which could print 1,000 copies a day—a great advance in local printing. The founders of the Monsohn press produced Jewish-themed color [[postcards]], [[greeting cards]], [[Jewish National Fund]] stamps, and maps documenting the evolution of the Jewish settlement in [[Eretz Israel]] in the nineteenth-twentieth centuries; religious material such as decorative plaques for [[synagogues]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Sarfati |first1= Rachel | title= Offerings from Jerusalem: Portrayals of Holy Places by Jewish Artists |date=2002|publisher= Yerushalayim : Muze’on Yisra’el |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/offerings-from-jerusalem-portrayals-of-holy-places-by-jewish-artists/oclc/690023193&amp;referer=brief_results/}}&lt;/ref&gt; portraits of [[Old Yishuv]] rabbis such as [[Shmuel Salant]], [[Mizrah]] posters indicating the direction of prayer for synagogues, memorial posters, and posters for [[Sukkot]] booths;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Fischer|first1= Yona |last2= Peled|first2= Haviva|title= Omanut ve-umanut be-Erez-Yisrael ba-meah ha-tesha-‘esreh|date=1979|publisher= Yerushalayim : Muze’on Yisra’el |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/omanut-ve-umanut-be-erets-yisrael-ba-meah-ha-tesha-esreh/oclc/18244616&amp;referer=brief_results/}}&lt;/ref&gt; color frontispieces for books such as Pentateuch volumes and the early song collections of [[Abraham Zvi Idelsohn]] (e.g., ''Shire Zion'', Jerusalem 1908); artistic wedding invitations; and later, government posters;&lt;ref name="Article on the Monsohn press posters."&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naamat.org/images/stories/magazine/haganahposters.pdf |title=Molly Abramowitz, "The Mysterious Case of the Haganah Posters," Na’amat Women, Summer 2009, 12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101648/http://www.naamat.org/images/stories/magazine/haganahposters.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and labels, packaging and advertisements for the pioneering entrepreneurs of Eretz Israel.

For years, the Monsohn (later, Monson/Monzon) Press was considered the best and most innovative in the country—pioneering in such techniques as [[Hot stamping|gold-embossing]] and [[offset printing]], among others. Early items for tourists included collections of ''[[Flowers of the Holy Land]]'' (c. 1910-1918)—pressed local flowers accompanied by scenes from the Eretz Israel countryside and relevant verses from the Bible, edited by [[Jsac Chagise]] (or Itzhak Haggis), an immigrant from Vitebsk, and bound in carved olive wood boards.&lt;ref name="Online exchanges about Flowers and Views of the Holy Lanod."&gt;{{cite news|url= https://thebarrowboy.wordpress.com/2009/01/06/flowers-of-the-holy-land/|title=Flowers and Views of the Holy Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after World War I Monsohn (now spelled מונזון) used [[zincography]] to produce the prints included in the Hebrew ''[[Gannenu]]'' educational booklets for young children illustrated by [[Ze'ev Raban]] of the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] and printed in Jerusalem by [[Hayim Refael Hakohen]] (vol. 1, 1919; vols. 2-3, 1920).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url=  http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&amp;doc_number=000117639&amp;local_base=MBI01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Monsohn moved into the new, western part of Jerusalem, in a shop with four presses and 30 workers, including Abraham-Leib's sons, David, Yosef, Moshe and Shimon, and his daughter Raytse's husband, Abraham Barmacz. The concern did business with all sectors of the city's population, including [[Arabs]], for whom they printed in [[Arabic]]. Among their clients were members of the [[Ginio]], [[Havilio]], and [[Strauss (company)|Elite]] families, and [[Shemen (manufacturer)|Shemen]], [[Dubek]], and other renowned national brands, manufacturing products such as [[wine]], [[candy|candies]], [[oil]], and [[cigarettes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Monzon|first1= Arye|title= The Monzon Family History in Jerusalem|date= 2007|publisher= Jerusalem : The author|url= http://www.bentisser.com/uploads/1/5/4/1/15410790/monzon_family_english.pdf/}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also printed [[Film poster|movie]] and [[Poster#Travel posters|travel posters]], and government posters, [[postcards]] and [[documents]], hotel luggage labels, receipts for [[Bikur Cholim Hospital]] and other local institutions, metal charity boxes, Melnik, Rosin &amp; Co. (Jerusalem) embroidery designs (c.1900), and cloth covers for ''[[hallot]]''. During the [[Austerity in Israel|Tzena]] austerity period Monsohn was the exclusive printer of government [[coupon book]]lets.

Shimon Monson (or Monzon, b. 1907; son of Abraham-Leib II) and Shimon Barmacz (b. 1922; son of Raytsa Monsohn Barmacz [b. 1901]), recipient of the [[Yakir Yerushalayim]] award),&lt;ref name="A news article announcing the death of Shimon Barmatz in 2009."&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/160054|title=Pre-State Fighter Shimon Barmatz Dead at 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; were responsible for the press in its final stage, during which it also produced [[Jewish National Fund]] [[calendars]], color [[map]]s, illustrations of [[animals]] in the [[Bible]], [[tourist]] brochures, and printed [[books]], especially [[photo-offset]] editions of sacred works, of which they printed over 80 (e.g., ''Mishnah Berurah'', 6 vols., 1950;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url=  http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/PILYY8PJ3H682A78GYM7PAH7BYS3SAJBTJQVNTAT4Q9FPYBY38-10276?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=008521&amp;set_entry=000047&amp;format=999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Miqra'ot Gedolot'', 5 vols., 1955;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url=  http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/PILYY8PJ3H682A78GYM7PAH7BYS3SAJBTJQVNTAT4Q9FPYBY38-04562?func=find-acc&amp;acc_sequence=000090361}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ḥoq Le-Yisrael'', 5 vols., 1956;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url= http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/PILYY8PJ3H682A78GYM7PAH7BYS3SAJBTJQVNTAT4Q9FPYBY38-20287?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=008521&amp;set_entry=000039&amp;format=999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shulhan Arukh'', 2 vols., 1956-1957;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url=  http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/PILYY8PJ3H682A78GYM7PAH7BYS3SAJBTJQVNTAT4Q9FPYBY38-16400?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=008521&amp;set_entry=000035&amp;format=999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zohar'', 5 vols., 1958-1960;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url=  http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/PILYY8PJ3H682A78GYM7PAH7BYS3SAJBTJQVNTAT4Q9FPYBY38-21372?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=008521&amp;set_entry=000028&amp;format=999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moreh Nevukhim'', 3 vols., 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url=  http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/PILYY8PJ3H682A78GYM7PAH7BYS3SAJBTJQVNTAT4Q9FPYBY38-20168?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=008521&amp;set_entry=000013&amp;format=999}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 1955 Shimon Monson also printed the 1955 first Jerusalem edition of [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'' for the [[Olympia Press]] (2 vols.). The revolutionary [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] Bible was printed at the press of Shimon Monzon (Pentateuch, 1959; complete Bible, 1965 and later printings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bibliography of the Hebrew Book|url= http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/PILYY8PJ3H682A78GYM7PAH7BYS3SAJBTJQVNTAT4Q9FPYBY38-04562?func=find-acc&amp;acc_sequence=000090361/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to compete with larger, more modernized concerns, the Monsohn/Monzon Press closed in 1992. A grandson of the founders helped establish [[Keter Publishing House|Keter Press]], printer of the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'' and still one of [[Israel]]'s leading printing establishments. Shimon Barmacz's son, Mordechai (b. 1948), established the Hebron Press in [[Kiryat Arba]]. Elyakim Monzon (b. 1927), son of Abraham-Leib's son Yosef (b. 1903), also engaged in printing.  Moshe Monzon (b. 1958), grandson of Abraham-Leib's son Moshe, produces artistic tapestries. The prints produced by the A.L. Monsohn Lithography are today sought by collectors the world over.

'''Anderson Hunter Dupree''' (born 29 January 1921, in [[Hillsboro, Texas]]) is an American historian and one of the pioneer historians of the [[history of science and technology]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'' on-line&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early education==
The son of a lawyer, George W. Dupree, and his wife, Sarah Hunter, he attended [[Oberlin College]], where he earned his bachelor of arts degree ([[summa cum laude]]) in 1942. Upon completion of his undergraduate work, he joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1942-1946, and became a Lieutenant in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'' on-line&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of [[World War II]],  Dupree married Marguerite Louise Arnold (c. 1918-May 27, 2014) in 1946, having two children including the historian Marguerite Dupree and the [[harpsichord]] maker Anderson H. Dupree.

Hunter Dupree entered [[Harvard University]], where he completed his master's degree in 1947, and his Ph.D. in 1952, having written his doctoral dissertation on [[Asa Gray]], titled "Asa Gray: The Development of a Statesman of Science, 1810-1848".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dupree|first=A. Hunter|year=1988|title=Asa Gray, American Botanist, Friend of Darwin|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0-801-83741-8|pages=xvii-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marguerite earned a Ph.D. in history from Harvard and also taught at universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marguerite Louise (Arnold) Dupree|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=171210197|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=June 3, 2014|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1950, Dupree took up his first academic position as assistant professor of history at Texas Technological College (now [[Texas Tech University]]) in [[Lubbock, Texas]], where he remained until 1952, when he was appointed a research fellow at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061209040957/http://www.huh.harvard.edu/collections/gray.htm   Gray Herbarium] at [[Harvard University]]. He served two appointments there in 1952-54 and 1955-56. In addition, he served as project director on grants at the [[National Science Foundation]], 1953-55.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'' on-line&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, [[the University of California, Berkeley]] appointed Dupree as visiting assistant professor of history, then promoted to associate professor in 1958, and professor of history in 1961. He served additionally as assistant to the [[chancellor]] in 1960-62, and director of the [[Bancroft Library]] in 1965-66.  In addition, Dupree was a consultant to the committee on science and public policy at the [[National Academy of Science]] in 1963-64. He remained at Berkeley until 1968.

Despite being a competent [[academic]], Dupree's tenure in the Bancroft Library directorship was brief and stormy. He was appointed to the directorship in June 1965 but clashed repeatedly with the staff over library internal policy, which sparked a near-revolution among its employees. Part of the disagreement involved Dupree's emphasis on modernizing traditional library practices and the way collections, particularly [[manuscripts]], were handled in the collections. He also required an accounting for long-term projects on which the library devoted resources but could show few actual results.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Dupree to Dale L. Morgan, 14 September 1965, Morgan papers, Bancroft Library.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1966 The UC-Berkeley president returned him to the history faculty that same June.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Dupree to Dale L. Morgan, 18 January 1966, Morgan papers, Bancroft Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, [[Brown University]] appointed Dupree George L. Littlefield Professor of History, a position he held until his retirement in 1981. While in this post, he served as a consultant to the Panel on Science and Technology and Astronautics, [[U.S. House of Representatives]], 1969–73; trustee of the [[American Textile History Museum]], a member of the [[NASA Historical Advisory Committee]], and the [[Atomic Energy Commission's Historical Advisory Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'' on-line&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
* In 1976, he received the Presidential Award of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] and was selected as a Fellow, Center for Advanced Studies, [[National Humanities Center]] in 1978-79.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'' on-line&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1990, he was awarded the [[George Sarton Medal]].

{{Nihongo|'''''Angelic Layer'''''|エンジェリックレイヤー|Enjerikku Reiyā|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] series released by [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]. The manga is published in [[Japan]] by [[Kadokawa Shoten]], and in [[English language|English]] originally by [[Tokyopop]], but has since been re-licensed by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. It is the group's first work to use a quite different art style unseen in any other CLAMP series, which uses a more distinctly pared down style. There is less emphasis on detail and more on accentuated posing and gestures. This kind of artwork would later be used in series like ''[[Chobits]]'' and ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.

The manga was adapted into a 26-episode [[anime]] series produced by [[Bones (studio)|Bones]] titled {{nihongo|''Angelic Layer: Battle Doll''|機動天使エンジェリックレイヤー|Kidō Tenshi Enjerikku Reiyā|lit., "Angelic Layer: Mobile Angel"}} which aired on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 1, 2001 – September 23, 2001. Seven volumes of videos were released by [[ADV Films]] on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in 2003. It was re-released in 2005 as a five volume [[box set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advfilms.com/CatalogFilms_Detail.asp?ID=4260 |title=Angelic Layer Complete Collection |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=ADV Films.com |publisher=A.D.

[[Anime Limited]] announced they would release the series in the UK in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.alltheanime.com/mcm-london-comic-con-may-2018-newswire-2/|title=MCM LONDON COMIC CON MAY 2018 NEWSWIRE #2 – SUNDAY NEWS ROUND-UP|date=May 28, 2018|publisher=[[Anime Limited]]|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Angelic Layer'' takes place in the same universe as Clamp's later work ''[[Chobits]]'', which similarly deals with the relationship between humans, human-created devices, toys, and godlike power. Several characters also appear in Clamp's ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' including most of the main characters, as well as the angel Blanche.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Angelic Layer characters}}
The primary protagonist is [[List of Angelic Layer characters#Misaki Suzuhara|Misaki Suzuhara]]. Despite her short appearance she is a seventh grader who just moved to [[Tokyo]] to live with her aunt, Shouko Asami. After arriving in the city outside of [[Tokyo Station]], Misaki watches a battle between two dolls on a big live-screen called Angelic Layer, a highly popular game in which players (called [[Deus]]) buy and custom-design dolls known as Angels that are moved by [[Brain-computer interface|mental control]] when on a field called the "layer."

Interested in learning about Angelic Layer, an eccentric man wearing a white lab coat and glasses, calling himself "''Icchan''" (いっちゃん), encourages Misaki to purchase and create her own angel. She wants the angel to be "a short girl, but strong and happy", and names it Hikaru, based on Hikaru Shidō from Clamp's ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'' (a [[Story within a story|manga in ''Angelic Layer'''s world]]). Even though she's clueless about the game, Misaki soon competes in tournaments and is assisted and watched carefully by Icchan. Later, Icchan's identity is revealed as [[List of Angelic Layer characters#Ichiro "Icchan" Mihara|Ichiro Mihara]], the co-creator of Angelic Layer.

Misaki begins studying at the Eriol Academy, an educational institution which include grades [[escalator school|from kindergarten through high school]]. There she becomes friends with [[List of characters in Angelic Layer#Main characters|Hatoko Kobayashi]], a very intelligent and mature kindergarten girl who is a famous Deus and an Angelic Layer expert. Her incredibly fast angel Suzuka is a favourite contender in tournaments. Misaki also befriends Hatoko's older brother [[List of Angelic Layer characters#Kōtarō Kobayashi|Kōtarō]] and his friend [[List of Angelic Layer characters#Tamayo Kizaki|Tamayo Kizaki]], a girl fascinated by martial arts. Both turn out to be Misaki's classmates.

While adjusting to her new surroundings, Misaki is also gripped by her past. Her thoughts often dwell on her mother, whom she has not seen since pre-school. Eventually, Misaki learns that her mother was key in the development of Angelic Layer, which she worked on in an attempt to develop a perfect [[prosthesis]] for her [[multiple sclerosis]], which has confined her to a wheelchair. Her mother is also the Deus of Athena and the champion of Angelic Layer.

The differences in the anime series: Misaki names her angel of her favorite doll from childhood. The ending to the manga also has different couplings. In the manga, Misaki's mother does not have multiple sclerosis. Icchan plays an important role in the ''[[Chobits]]'' storyline, but this connection was reduced to a single scene in the anime; the ''Chobits'' anime was also made by a [[Madhouse (studio)|different company]]. Kaede's younger brother [[List of Chobits characters#Minoru Kokubunji (M)|Minoru]] is also a ''Chobits'' character.

==Reception==
''Angelic Layer'' has received mixed reviews. THEM Anime Reviews on the other hand gave ''Angelic Layer'' a 5-star rating, noting that the character designs were well presented and the animation was colourful, also that ''Angelic Layer'' portrayed the concepts of friendship and how "through common interests, even very different people can be friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=32 |title=Angelic Layer |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |author=Jason Bustard |work=T.H.E.M.

''Angelic Layer'' won the [[Animation Kobe#TV Feature Award|Animation Kobe Award for TV Feature]] in 2001. [[Anime News Network]] however, was less kind, comparing it to [[Pokémon]] and [[Digimon]], and calling it a glorified tie-in to "a toy you can't purchase."

'''Ann B. Kelleher''', from Macroom, County Cork, is an engineer, and a senior officer of Intel Corporation. She has headed up Intel's high-volume integrated circuit production, and was the first Irish woman to be named as a vice-president of the corporation.

== Education ==
Kelleher is originally from [[Macroom]] in County Cork, Ireland, where her father worked as a farmer.  With parental encouragement, Kelleher pursued maths and science in secondary school,&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/wild-geese-from-a-macroom-farm-to-the-top-level-at-intel-in-oregon-1.3625708|title=Wild Geese: From a Macroom farm to the top level at Intel in Oregon|last=Keogh|first=Olive|date=13 September 2018|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chose to study [[engineering]] in [[University College Cork]] (UCC), being one of just five women in a class of 55. She specialised in [[electrical engineering]] and graduated in 1987. Kelleher continued electrical engineering studies at Masters level instead of accepting a job offer at Digital in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, graduating in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= | date=26 July 2013 | title= Women Invent Tomorrow: Ann Kelleher | location=| publisher= Silicon Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then became the first ever female to receive a PhD from Ireland's National Microelectronics Research Centre (NMRC), now part of the Tyndall National Institute at UCC, in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/it-executive-urges-girls-to-study-science-and-technology-1.2444895|title=IT executive urges girls to study science and technology|last=Roche|first=Barry|date=26 November 2015|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ran a process integration group in Tyndall from 93-96.

== Early career ==
In 1996 Kelleher joined [[Intel Ireland]] in [[Leixlip]], Co. Kildare, as a process engineer, where she quickly achieved promotion. Her first major role of responsibility was as factory manager of ''Fab 24'', a plant for the manufacturing of [[semiconductors]], in Leixlip, when it opened in 2006. At the time, it was Intel's first chip factory in Europe using advanced 65nm process technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/intel-opens-2bn-fab-24-2-plant-26380907.html|title=Intel opens $2bn Fab 24 -2 plant - Independent.ie|last=|first=|date=23 June 2006|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Kelleher decided to go to the United States to become the plant manager at Intel’s Fab 12 plant in [[Chandler, Arizona]]. Kelleher also site managed Intel’s [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico]] Fab 11X fabrication facility for a period before finally moving to [[Portland, Oregon]] in 2015 where she lives as of 2018.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/ann-b-kelleher/|title=Dr. Ann B. Kelleher|last=|first=|date=|work=Intel Newsroom|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
Kelleher was general manager of the Fab/Sort Manufacturing organisation. In that role, she was responsible for all aspects of Intel’s high-volume [[silicon]] manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2011, Kelleher became the first Irish woman in the history of the company to be named as a vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ann B. Kelleher |url=https://irishamerica.com/2011/12/ann-b-kelleher/ |website=Irish America |accessdate=12 November 2018 |date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, she was promoted to senior vice-president of the Technology and Manufacturing Group, a unit of around 30,000 staff.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-promotes-four-corporate-officers/|title=Intel Promotes Four Corporate Officers|last=|first=|date=31 January 2018|work=Intel Newsroom|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work includes corporate quality assurance, customer fulfillment and supply-chain management, and strategic planning for the company’s worldwide manufacturing operations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2018 Kelleher was one of 25 women recognised in the "Ireland's Most Powerful Women Awards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/our-most-powerful-women-to-be-celebrated-at-awards-37007420.html|title=Our 'most powerful women' to be celebrated at awards|last=Edwards|first=Patrick|date=14 June 2018|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, ''[[Forbes]]'' suggested that Kelleher would be well suited to replacing [[Elon Musk]] as the Chairman of [[Tesla, Inc.]] due to her experience in "in high-tech and high-volume manufacturing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chucktannert/2018/11/05/what-tesla-needs-in-its-new-chairman-specialized-knowledge-and-the-chutzpah-to-stand-up-to-musk/#4ea841b94d34|title=What Tesla Needs From Its New Chairman: Specialized Knowledge And The Chutzpah To Stand Up To Musk|last=Tannert|first=Chuck|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for gender equality in engineering ==
Kelleher is an advocate for women working in engineering roles and holding senior management positions in the tech industry. She has said that more girls should study [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) subjects in school and university. Kelleher has also argued that more women should be applying for senior management roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal Life ==
Kelleher travels to [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] a few times a year, as well as visiting the family home.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14602">'''Barometric light''' is a name for the [[light]] that is emitted by a [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-filled [[barometer]] tube when the tube is shaken. The discovery of this phenomenon in 1675 revealed the possibility of electric lighting.

== The phenomenon and its explanation ==
The earliest barometers were simply glass tubes that were closed at one end and filled with mercury.  The tube was then inverted and its open end was submerged in a cup of mercury.  The mercury then drained out of the tube until the pressure of the mercury in the tube — as measured at the surface of the mercury in the cup — equaled the atmosphere's pressure on the same surface.

In order to produce barometric light, the glass tube must be very clean and the mercury must be pure.&lt;ref&gt;Even if the glass tube is clean and the mercury is pure, eventually the light will cease to appear because a thin film of mercury will form on the glass.  In order to produce barometric light again, the glass must be cleaned again.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the barometer is then shaken, a band of light will appear on the glass at the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] of the mercury whenever the mercury moves downward.

When mercury contacts glass, the mercury transfers electrons to the glass.  Whenever the mercury pulls free of the glass, these electrons are released from the glass into the surroundings, where they collide with gas molecules, causing the gas to glow — just as the collision of electrons and neon atoms causes a neon lamp to glow.&lt;ref&gt;Gay L. Dybwad and C. E. Mandeville (1967) "Generation of light by the relative motion of contiguous surfaces of mercury and glass," ''Physical Review'', vol. 161, pages 527-532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

Available on-line at:  [http://www.physics.ucla.edu/Sonoluminescence/fricelec.pdf University of California, Los Angeles].  Article includes '''photograph of barometric light''' occurring in a glass cylinder partially filled with mercury and low-pressure neon gas.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Barometric light was first observed in 1675 by the French astronomer [[Jean Picard]]:&lt;ref&gt;"Experience fait à l'Observatoire sur la Barometre simple touchant un nouveau Phenomene qu'on y a découvert" [Experiment made at the [astronomical] observatory [in Paris] on a simple barometer concerning a new phenomenon that was discovered there], ''Le Journal des Sçavans'' [later: ''Journal des Savants'' ], page 112 (Paris edition) or page 126 (Amsterdam edition) (25 May 1676).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Original text:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On sçait que le Barometre simple n’est autre chose qu’un tuyau de verre scellé hermetiquement par le haut &amp; ouvert par le bas, dans lequelle il y a du vif-argent qui se tient ordinairement dans certaine hauteur, le reste au dessus estant vuide.  M. Picard en a un à l’Observatoire qui dans l’obscurité, lors qu’on le remuë assez pour faire balancer le vif-argent, fait comme des éclairs &amp; jette une certaine lumiere entrecouppée qui remplit toute la partie du Tuyau où se fait le vuide; mais cela n'arrive à chaque balancement que lors que le vuide se fait, &amp; dans la seule descente du vif-argent.  On a tâché de faire la même experience sur divers autres Barometres de même composition; mais on n’a encore reüssi que sur un seul.  Comme on est resolu d’examiner la chose en toute maniere, nous en donnerons plus au long toutes les circonstances qu’on y découvrïra.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is known that the simple barometer is nothing more than a glass tube hermetically sealed at the top and open at the bottom, in which there is some quicksilver which ordinarily stays at a certain height, the remainder above being void.  Mr. Picard has one of them at the Observatory, which in the dark, when one moves it enough to make the quicksilver jiggle, flashes like sparks and throws a certain flickering light which fills the entire part of the tube where it is void; but that happens during each swing only when there is a void and only during the descent of the quicksilver.  The same experiment has been attempted with various other barometers of the same construction; but it has still been successful only with the one.  As it has been resolved to investigate the matter in every way, we will give in greater length everything that is discovered about it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As an astronomer, Picard measured the positions of stars, planets, etc.  He knew that their apparent position in the sky is affected by atmospheric [[refraction]].  Atmospheric refraction, in turn, is affected by the air's temperature and pressure.  He measured the atmospheric pressure via a barometer.

Available on-line at:  [http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/24/289-304/2129.full.pdf+html Royal Society of London].&lt;/ref&gt;  Hauksbee showed that a complete [[vacuum]] was not essential to the phenomenon, for the same glow was apparent when mercury was shaken with air only partially rarefied, and that even without using the barometric tube, bulbs containing low-pressure gases could be made to glow via externally applied static electricity.  The phenomenon was also studied by contemporaries of Hauksbee, including the Frenchman [[Pierre Polinière]]&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Polinière, ''Expériences de physique'' [Experiments in Physics] (Paris: J. de Laulne, 1709), volume 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fgQ5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA539&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html pages 539-540].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Corson, "Pierre Polinière, Francis Hauksbee, and Electroluminescence:  A case of simultaneous discovery," ''Isis'', vol. 59, no. 4, pages 402-413 (Winter 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and a French mathematician, [[Philippe de la Hire|Gabriel-Philippe de la Hire]],&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel-Philippe de la Hire, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3487x/f392.image.langEN "Remarque sur quelques experiences faites avec plusieurs barometres, et sur la lumiere que fait un de ceux dont on s'est servi en l'agitant verticalement"] (Remark on some experiments made with several barometers, and on the light that one of them makes and that is gotten by shaking it vertically), ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences de Paris'', pages 226-228 (12 July 1705).

In its most narrow sense it is a synonym to [[biofuel]], which is fuel derived from biological sources. In its broader sense it includes [[biomass]], the biological material used as a biofuel, as well as the social, economic, scientific and technical fields associated with using biological sources for energy. This is a common misconception, as bioenergy is the energy extracted from the biomass, as the biomass is the fuel and the bioenergy is the energy contained in the fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vxu.se/td/english/bioenergy/blog/what_is_bioenergy/ |title=What is bioenergy? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823200449/http://www.vxu.se/td/english/bioenergy/blog/what_is_bioenergy/ |archivedate=23 August 2010 |publisher=Växjö University, Bioenergy Technology Department |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a slight tendency for the word ''bioenergy'' to be favoured in Europe compared with ''biofuel'' in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.openei.org/wiki/Definition:Bioenergy|title=Definition: Bioenergy {{!}} Open Energy Information|website=en.openei.org|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of biomass fuel is that it is often a by-product, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In theory this means there is no competition between fuel and food production, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Land use, existing biomass industries and relevant conversion technologies must be considered when evaluating suitability of developing biomass as feedstock for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Doshi|first2=Amar|last3=Maire|first3=Juliette|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Measuring the regional availability of biomass for biofuels and the potential for microalgae|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=September 2015|volume=49|pages=1271–1285|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.084|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115003548#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass is the material derived from recently living [[organism]]s, which includes plants, animals and their byproducts.&lt;ref name="Department of Energy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.gov/energysources/bioenergy.htm|title=Bioenergy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manure, garden waste and crop residues are all sources of biomass. It is a renewable energy source based on the [[carbon cycle]], unlike other [[natural resource]]s such as [[petroleum]], [[coal]], and [[nuclear reactor|nuclear]] fuels. Another source includes [[Animal waste]], which is a persistent and unavoidable [[pollutant]] produced primarily by the animals housed in industrial-sized farms.

There are also agricultural products specifically being grown for [[biofuel]] production. These include [[maize|corn]], and [[soybeans]] and to some extent [[willow]] and [[switchgrass]] on a pre-commercial research level, primarily in the United States; [[rapeseed]], [[wheat]], [[sugar beet]], and willow ({{convert|15,000|ha|abbr=on|disp=or}} in Sweden) primarily in Europe; sugarcane in Brazil; [[palm oil]] and [[miscanthus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/08/18/is-biomass-really-renewable/|title=Is Biomass Really Renewable?|last=Cho|first=Renee|date=2011-08-18|website=Earth Institute|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Southeast Asia;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Sarah C.|last2=Boddey|first2=Robert M.|last3=Alves|first3=Bruno J.

[[Hemp]] has also been proven to work as a biofuel.  [[Biodegradable]] outputs from industry, agriculture, forestry and households can be used for biofuel production, using e.g. [[anaerobic digestion]] to produce [[biogas]], [[gasification]] to produce [[syngas]] or by direct combustion. Examples of [[biodegradable waste]]s include straw, timber, manure, rice husks, sewage, and food waste. The use of biomass fuels can therefore contribute to waste management as well as fuel security and help to prevent or slow down [[climate change]], although alone they are not a comprehensive solution to these problems.

Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas—also called "[[landfill gas]]" or "biogas." Crops, such as corn and sugar cane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats. Also, Biomass to liquids (BTLs) and cellulosic ethanol are still under research.

==Sewage biomass==
The use of municipal and household waste is on the forefront of new sources for biomass, and is a largely discarded resource on which new research is being conducted for use of energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biomass.net/Biomass-Alternative-Energy.html|title=Having Power With Biomass Alternative Energy|website=www.biomass.net|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new bioenergy [[sewage treatment]] process aimed at developing countries is now on the horizon; the [[Omni Processor]] is a self-sustaining process which uses the sewerage solids as fuel to convert sewage waste water into drinking water and electrical energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janickibioenergy.com/s100.html|title=Janicki Bioenergy website|accessdate=11 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109083138/http://janickibioenergy.com/s100.html|archivedate=9 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30709273|title=BBC news article "Bill Gates drinks water distilled from human faeces"|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=BBC News|date=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2015/01/10/janicki-omniprocessor/#309781e41a82|title=Watch Bill Gates Sip Water Made From Sewer Sludge|last=|first=|date=|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sewage sludge is a point of focus in current research for developing bioenergy from biomass. The large quantity being produced by households at a continuous rate presents an opportunity to extract valuable compounds contained within it which can be then used to produce bioenergy. The main form of bioenergy being produced from sewage is methane, but producing other forms is still being researched. The use of sewage to produce methane reduces the amount of waste put into landfills, its costs of transportation and disposal, and also keeps a larger amount of gas out of the atmosphere, as more is able to be captured. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215002309/http://www.fluxfarm.com/uploads/3/1/6/8/3168871/sewage_sludge_as_a_biomass_resource_for_the_production_of_energy.pdf|title=Sewage Sludge as a Biomass Resource for the Production of Energy: Overview and Assessment of the Various Options|last=Rulkens|first=Wim|date=2008|website=Energy and Fuels|archive-url=|archive-date=2017-12-15|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-new-waste-treatment-make-energy-profits-sewage-plants/|title=Can New Waste Treatment Make Energy and Profits from Sewage Plants?|last=Pyper|first=Julia|date=December 22, 2011|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Electricity generation from biomass==
The biomass used for electricity production ranges by region.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Forest byproducts, such as wood residues, are popular in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Agricultural waste is common in [[Mauritius]] (sugar cane residue) and [[Southeast Asia]] (rice husks).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, is popular in the [[UK]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===Electricity from sugarcane bagasse in Brazil===
[[Image:Canaviais Sao Paulo 01 2008 06.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Sugarcane]] (''Saccharum officinarum'') plantation ready for harvest, [[Ituverava]], [[State of São Paulo|São Paulo State]]. Brazil.]]
[[Image:Panorama Usina Costa Pinto Piracicaba SAO 10 2008.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sugar/ethanol plant located in [[Piracicaba]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo State]]. This plant produces the electricity it needs from [[bagasse]] residuals from sugarcane left over by the milling process, and it sells the surplus electricity to the public grid.]]

Sucrose accounts for little more than 30% of the chemical energy stored in the mature plant; 35% is in the leaves and stem tips, which are left in the fields during harvest, and 35% are in the fibrous material (bagasse) left over from pressing.

The production process of sugar and ethanol in Brazil takes full advantage of the energy stored in [[sugarcane]]. Part of the bagasse is currently burned at the mill to provide heat for distillation and electricity to run the machinery. This allows ethanol plants to be energetically self-sufficient and even sell surplus electricity to utilities; current production is {{convert|600|MW|abbr=on}} for self-use and {{convert|100|MW|abbr=on}} for sale. This secondary activity is expected to boom now that utilities have been induced to pay "fair price "(about US$10/GJ or US$0.036/kWh) for 10 year contracts. This is approximately half of what the World Bank considers the reference price for investing in similar projects (see below).  The energy is especially valuable to utilities because it is produced mainly in the dry season when hydroelectric dams are running low. Estimates of potential power generation from bagasse range from {{convert|1,000|to|9,000|MW|abbr=on}}, depending on technology. Higher estimates assume gasification of biomass, replacement of current low-pressure steam boilers and turbines by high-pressure ones, and use of harvest trash currently left behind in the fields. For comparison, Brazil's [[Angra Nuclear Power Plant|Angra I nuclear plant]] generates {{convert|657|MW|abbr=on}}.

Presently, it is economically viable to extract about 288 MJ of electricity from the residues of one tonne of sugarcane, of which about 180 MJ are used in the plant itself. Thus a medium-size distillery processing {{convert|1000000|t}} of sugarcane per year could sell about {{convert|5|MW|abbr=on}} of surplus electricity. At current prices, it would earn US$18 million from sugar and ethanol sales, and about US$1 million from surplus electricity sales. With advanced boiler and turbine technology, the electricity yield could be increased to 648 MJ per tonne of sugarcane, but current electricity prices do not justify the necessary investment. (According to one report, the World Bank would only finance investments in bagasse power generation if the price were at least US$19/GJ or US$0.068/kWh.)

Bagasse burning is [[environmentally friendly]] compared to other fuels like oil and coal. Its ash content is only 2.5% (against 30–50% of coal), and it contains very little sulfur. Since it burns at relatively low temperatures, it produces little nitrous oxides. Moreover, bagasse is being sold for use as a fuel (replacing heavy fuel oil) in various industries, including citrus juice concentrate, vegetable oil, ceramics, and tyre recycling. The [[state of São Paulo]] alone used {{convert|2000000|t|sigfig=3}}, saving about US$35 million in fuel oil imports.

Researchers working with [[cellulosic ethanol]] are trying to make the extraction of ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and other plants viable on an industrial scale.

==Electricity from electrogenic micro-organisms==
Another form of bioenergy can be attained from [[microbial fuel cells]], in which chemical energy stored in wastewater or soil is converted directly into electrical energy via the metabolic processes of electrogenic micro-organisms. The power generation capability of this technology has not been found to be economically viable till date, however, this technology has found been found to be more useful for chemical treatment processes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cambrianinnovation.com/|title=- Cambrian Innovation - Biology For a Cleaner Planet™|work=Cambrian Innovation|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and student education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mudwatt.com|title=MudWatt Science Kit|author=MudWatt|work=MudWatt|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
{{further information|Environmental impact of biodiesel}}
Some forms of forest bioenergy have recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations, including [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], for the harmful impacts they can have on forests and the climate. Greenpeace recently released a report entitled [http://www.greenpeace.org//canada/en/campaigns/forests/boreal/archive/Burning-trees-for-energy-puts-Canadian-forests-and-climate-at-risk-Greenpeace/ Fuelling a BioMess] which outlines their concerns around forest bioenergy. Because any part of the tree can be burned, the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages [[Logging#Full-tree logging|Whole-Tree Harvesting]], which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting, and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest. In some jurisdictions, forest biomass is increasingly consisting of elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems, including standing trees, naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest. Environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees, and even longer in low productivity areas; furthermore, logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon. In light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org//canada/en/campaigns/forests/boreal/archive/Burning-trees-for-energy-puts-Canadian-forests-and-climate-at-risk-Greenpeace/ Greenpeace.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051341/http://www.greenpeace.org/ |date=June 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/slyutse/today_nrdc_and_our_partners.html|title=NRDC fact sheet lays out biomass basics, campaign calls for action to tell EPA our forests aren't fuel|work=nrdc.org|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Scientist]] described a scenario in a September 2016 article which illustrated why the journal believed bioenergy can be bad: Suppose you cut down a 50-year oak tree in your garden and use the logs to heat your house instead of coal. Wood emits more carbon dioxide than coal per unit of heat gained and the roots left in the soil emit more carbon dioxide as they rot. If you plant another tree it will soak up that carbon dioxide in about 50 years. But if you had left the original tree in place  it would have soaked up the carbon dioxide from the coal and more.  It could take centuries before cutting down the tree would give any benefit. But the world needed to cut carbon dioxide over the next few decades if the global warming was to be kept below 3 degrees C.&lt;ref name = NewScientist&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Le Page|first=Michael|date=2016-09-24|title=The Great Carbon Scam|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130922-600-revealed-the-renewable-energy-scam-making-global-warming-worse/|journal=The New Scientist|series=3092|volume=231|pages=20–21|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal also concluded that official claimed carbon reductions from renewables had been overstated. The [[European Union]], for example, got more 64% of its renewable energy from biomass (mostly wood) but [[United Nations]] and EU rules did not count the carbon emissions from burning biomass.&lt;ref name = NewScientist/&gt;

Recently, a new company called Mango materials used bacterial fermentation to produce an intracellular biopolymer, polyhydroxyalkanoate from methane. The great advantage of biopolymers is that it is biodegradable which makes it environment friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/articles/new-process-being-tested-biodegradable-plastics|title=New Process Being Tested for Biodegradable Plastics|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because methane is being used that decreases the price of polymers that it would compete with traditional plastics. Also, because methane would be converted into biopolymer that would reduce methane emissions. Chief Executive Officer Molly Morse said that the unused methane would be enough to produce more than three billion pounds of biopolymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/articles/new-process-being-tested-biodegradable-plastics|title=New Process Being Tested for Biodegradable Plastics|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morse announced in 2017 that using this polymer will reduce the waste in the textile industry because it will be reproduced as biopolymer again in every effective industrial loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40476430/the-shirt-of-the-future-is-made-from-polyester-thats-been-created-by-methane-eating-bacteria|title=The Shirt Of The Future Will Be Made By Methane-Eating Bacteria|date=2017-10-03|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 120217-M-PH863-006 - U.S. Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Brandon Mann uses his automatic rifle s scope to scan the area while providing security with his military working dog.jpg|thumbnail|right|Marine Corps Lance Cpl. uses his automatic rifle, with a Vickers Sling, to scan the area in Helmand province, Afghanistan, on Feb. 17, 2012.]]
On May 1, 2012 the Vickers Combat Application Sling was assigned NSN: 1005-01-604-0627.

== Vickers Sling name ==

The Vickers Sling, a firearm sling, is named after Larry Vickers. Larry Vickers, a retired [[US Army]] 1st SFOD-Delta ([[Delta Force]]) combat veteran, took part in [[Operation Just Cause]] and participated in [[Operation Acid Gambit]], a mission to extract a [[CIA operative]], Kurt Muse, from Modelo Prison in [[Panama City, Panama]].&lt;ref name=NSN /&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunfighter Moment – Larry Vickers|url=http://soldiersystems.net/2015/02/28/gfm/|accessdate=2015-02-28|work=soldiersystems.net|agency=Soldier System|issue=Weekly|publisher=Alias Training &amp; Security Services|date=2015-02-28|ref=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larry Vickers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Background|url=http://vickerstactical.com/about-larry-vickers-2/about-larry-vickers/|website=Vickers Tactical|publisher=Vickers Tactical|accessdate=1 April 2015|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Force Gear and Larry Vickers both originally designed the Vickers Sling product line, the Vickers Combat Application Sling (VCAS).&lt;ref name=Ocab /&gt;

[[File:Musterklammer 2005-05-06.JPG|thumb|A variety of brass fasteners. Note the two legs of different length.]]
A '''brass fastener''', '''brad''', '''paper fastener''' or '''split pin''' is a [[stationery]] item used for securing multiple sheets of [[paper]] together.
A patent of the fastener was issued in 1866 to George W McGill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | inventor-last = McGill
 | inventor-first = George

 | publication-date =
 | issue-date = 1866
 | title = Improvement in metallic paper-fasteners
 | country-code = US
 | description =
 | patent-number = 56587}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fastener is inserted into [[hole puncher|punched holes]] in the stack of paper, and the leaves, or [[tines]], of the legs are separated and bent over to secure the paper. This holds the pin in place and the sheets of paper together. For few sheets of paper, holes can be made using the sharp end of the fastener.

A split pin may be used in place of [[Staple (fastener)|staple]]s, but they are more commonly used in situations where rotation around the joint is desirable. This lends split pins to use in mobile paper and [[Paperboard|cardboard]] models, and they are often used as modern [[scrapbooking]] embellishments. In the film industry, brass fasteners are an industry standard in binding [[screenplay]]s.

It is shaped somewhat like a nail with a round head and flat, split length. Brass fasteners are made of a soft [[metal]] such as [[brass]] and the tines are typically of two slightly different lengths to allow easy separation. A brass fastener is similar in design and function to the mechanical counterpart [[split pin]]s.

On its return trip to the twenty-first century the modernistic elevator rises in a glow of gold light while passing through shimmering reflections from the rainbow of the future world."  Here, the Bubbleator rises to the upper floor of the Washington State Coliseum, now Key Arena.]]

The '''Bubbleator''' was a large, bubble-shaped hydraulic [[elevator]] with transparent [[acrylic glass]] walls operated from an elevated chair built for the [[1962 World's Fair]] in [[Seattle]]. These transparent walls gave the illusion of looking through an actual 'soap bubble' by refracting light to obtain a rainbow-like effect for the riders inside. It was originally part of the Washington State Coliseum (now a sports venue known as [[KeyArena]]), where it lifted 100 passengers at a time up one floor through a structure of interlocking [[aluminum]] cubes to the "World of Tomorrow" exhibit. T. C. Howard of Synergetics, Inc. designed the Bubbleator and the exhibit.  After the fair, the Bubbleator was relocated to the Center House at [[Seattle Center]]. By 1984, it had been removed and put in storage to make way for the [[Seattle Children's Museum]]. It was sold to a private owner in [[Des Moines, Washington]], who recycled the upper part of the dome into a [[greenhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/66575_fairwhere16.shtml|title=Century 21 remnants found new homes|journal=Seattle PI|date=April 15, 2002|author=Susan Phinney|accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The control chair, which had also been in private hands, was donated to the [[Museum of History and Industry]] in 2005.

While boarding the Bubbleator, passengers were commanded by an ethereal female voice to "Please move to the rear of the sphere", or the "Martian type" male elevator operator would say, "Step to the rear of the Sphere" in a creepy sci-fi type voice.

The soundtrack for the Bubbleator was conducted by Attilio Mineo and released as ''Man in Space with Sounds.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.subliminalsounds.se/DOK/mineo2.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060928212645/http://www.subliminalsounds.se/DOK/mineo2.html |archivedate= 2006-09-28 |title= Attileo Mineo |publisher=Subliminal Sounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cellular shades''' are a [[window covering]] used to block or filter light and insulate windows to save energy. Cell size can vary. Cell shapes hold trapped air and create a barrier between the window surface and the a room. Since there's no test for shades they can't be ranked, but they qualified for a 2011 US energy tax credit.&lt;ref name=oldhouse&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20530758,00.html|title=Is it Worth It? Honeycomb Shades|publisher=This Old House.com|accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows and doors make up for approximately one-third of a home’s total thermal loss, according to the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrdc.org/living/energy/energy-out-window.asp  
|title=Smarter Living: Energy Out the Window?|publisher=National Resources Defense Council|accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to heat loss in winter, and entry of undesired heat in summer. When air inside the room comes in contact with windows, it is cooled or warmed. By [[convection]] this air then circulates around the room. Cell shapes in the blinds hold trapped air and create a barrier between the window surface and the room.&lt;ref name="oldhouse" /&gt; Shades, however, provide only slight control of air infiltration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy-Efficient Window Treatments|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/energy-efficient-window-treatments|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellular shades can be constructed as single cell, double cell, or triple cell shades. Single cell fabric has an [[R-value (insulation)|R-Value]] between 0.28 and 0.44 (1.6 and 2.5 imperial), and double cell fabric has a metric R-value between 0.49 and 0.70 (2.8 and 4.0 imperial).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cellularwindowshades.com/content/33-rvalue|title= Prevent Heat Loss In Your Home: R-Value |publisher=Cellular Window Shades|accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6 mm (¼”) thick single pane window has a metric R-value of 0.16 (0.91 imperial).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/thermal-moisture-protection/rvalues.html|title=R-values of Insulation and Other Building Materials |publisher=Architect's Technical Reference|accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[window blind]]s, which are made of hard materials, they are made of a soft paper- or cloth-like material. Typically spun lace and bonded polyester are used, but other fabrics can be used during the manufacturing process.

In common with all blinds cellular shades can reduce of  [[solar gain]] in summer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/residential/windows/todays_windows.html|title= Residential, Today's Windows &amp; How they Work |publisher=California Energy Commission|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide black out for sleeping. Also as with other window treatments, they are raised and lowered horizontally with a string. Cordless cellular shades are available to reduce the risk of strangulation for small children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/PageFiles/129594/5009a.pdf ], [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]], Safety Alert: Are Your Window Coverings Safe?

{{refimprove|date=February 2007}}
'''Clinker''' is a general name given to waste from industrial processes, particularly those that involve [[smelting]] metals, [[welding]], burning [[fossil fuel]]s and use of a [[blacksmith]]'s [[forge]], which commonly causes a large buildup of clinker around the [[tuyere]]. Clinker often forms a loose, dark deposit consisting of waste materials such as [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[coal]], [[slag]], [[charcoal]], and [[Gritstone|grit]].  Clinker often has a glassy look to it, usually because of the formation of molten [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] compounds during processing. Clinker generally is much denser than coke, and, unlike coke, generally contains too little carbon to be of any value as fuel.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|clinker}}
"Clinker" is from Dutch, and was originally used in English for bricks; see [[clinker brick]]. The term was later applied to hard residue, due to similar appearance.

==Uses==
Clinker often is reused as a cheap material for [[Pavement (material)|paving]] [[footpath]]s. It is laid and rolled, and forms a hard path with a rough surface that presents less risk of slipping than most loose materials. In sufficient thickness such a layer drains well and is valuable for controlling muddiness. However, if laid without sufficient adhesive, it needs frequent rolling and addition of more clinker to maintain the path in good condition if it is subject to heavy foot traffic.  

In [[sewage treatment]] works, the foul water first is screened to remove floating debris. Then it is sedimented to remove insoluble particles. After this, it is sprayed over a filter bed of clinker. Aerobic microbes soon grow in hollows in the clinker, where they kill harmful anaerobic bacteria in the water and remove much of the offensive organic waste.

Historically, clinker from coal-burning steamships simply was discarded overboard, leaving detectable trails on the seabed of some prominent steamship routes. As such, the deposits have proven to be of both biological and archaeological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=K.N.|title=A Trail of Rocks Traces Historical Steamship Routes|url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/article-short/trail-rocks-traces-historical-steamship-routes|accessdate=13 October 2017|work=[[Hakai magazine]]|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During sampling of [[granular material]]s (whether [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne]], [[Suspended solids|suspended in liquid]], [[aerosol]], or aggragated), '''correct sampling''' is defined in [[Gy's sampling theory]] as a sampling scenario in which all particles in a population have the same probability of ending up in the sample.&lt;ref name="Gy1979"&gt;P. M. Gy (1979), ''Sampling of Particulate Materials: theory and practice.'' Elsevier: Amsterdam, 431 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration of the property of interest in a sample can be a [[Bias (statistics)| biased]] estimate for the concentration of the property of interest in the population from which the sample is drawn. Although generally non-zero, for correct sampling this bias is thought to be negligible.&lt;ref name="Gy1979"/&gt;

'''Doming''' is a phenomenon found on some [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] televisions in which parts of the [[shadow mask]] become heated.  In televisions that exhibit this behavior, it tends to occur in high-contrast scenes in which there is a largely dark scene with one or more localized bright spots.  As the electron beam hits the shadow mask in these areas it heats unevenly.  The shadow mask warps due to the heat differences, which causes the electron gun to hit the wrong colored [[phosphors]] and incorrect colors to be displayed in the affected area.

[[File:Pink Floyd Their Mortal Remains - 2017-10-13 - Andy Mabbett - 27.jpg|thumb|A selection of [[Nick Mason]]'s customised drumsticks, from various makers, displayed at the [[Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains]] exhibition ]]

A '''drumstick''' is a type of [[percussion mallet]] used particularly for playing [[snare drum]], [[drum kit]] and some other [[percussion instrument]]s, and particularly for playing [[unpitched percussion]].

Specialized beaters used on some other percussion instruments, such as the metal beater or ''wand'' used with a [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], and particularly beaters or ''mallets'' used with [[tuned percussion]] such as [[xylophone]] and [[timpani]], are not normally referred to as ''drumsticks''. Drumsticks generally have all of the following characteristics:

* They are normally supplied and used in pairs.
* They are held in the hands, most often one in each hand.
* They may be used to play at least some sort of [[drum]] (as well as other instruments).
* They are normally used only for unpitched percussion.

==Construction==
[[Image:Drumstick anatomy.svg|thumb|100px|left|The parts of a simple drumstick]]

The [[archetypical]] drumstick is [[Turning|turned]] from a single piece of [[wood]], most commonly of [[hickory]], less commonly of [[maple]], and least commonly but still in significant numbers, of [[oak]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockdrummingsystem.com/underground/drum-articles/choosing-the-right-drumsticks.php retrieved 9/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Drumsticks of the traditional form are also made from metal, [[carbon fibre]] and other modern materials.
 
The '''tip''' or '''bead''' is the part most often used to strike the instrument. Originally and still commonly of the same piece of wood as the rest of the stick, sticks with [[nylon]] tips have also been available since 1958, originally conceived by [[Jonathan Humphrey]] and Joe Calato in [[Niagara Falls, NY]]. In the 1970s, an [[Polyoxymethylene|acetal]] tip was introduced, designed by Ken Drinan and Paul Kiersted.

Tips of whatever material are of various shapes, including acorn, barrel, oval, teardrop, pointed and round.

The '''shoulder''' of the stick is the part that tapers towards the tip, and is normally slightly convex. It is often used for playing the [[bell (cymbal)|bell]] of a [[cymbal]]. It can also be used to produce a cymbal crash when applied with a glancing motion to the bow or edge of a cymbal, and for playing ride patterns on china, swish and pang cymbals.

The '''shaft''' is the body of the stick, and is cylindrical for most applications including drum kit and orchestral work. It is used for playing [[cross stick]] and applied in a glancing motion to the rim of a cymbal for the loudest cymbal crashes.

The '''butt''' is the opposite end of the stick to the tip. Some rock and metal musicians use it rather than the tip.

==Conventional numbering==
{{anchor|5A}}
Plain wooden drumsticks are most commonly described using a number to describe the weight and diameter of the stick followed by one or more letters to describe the tip. For example, a 7A is a common jazz stick with a wooden tip, while a 7AN is the same weight of stick with a nylon tip, and a 7B is a wooden tip but with a different tip profile, shorter and rounder than a 7A. A 5A is a common wood tipped rock stick, heavier than a 7A but with a similar profile. The numbers are most commonly odd but even numbers are used occasionally, in the range 2 (heaviest) to 9 (lightest).

The exact meanings of both numbers and letters differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, and some sticks are not described using this system at all, just being known as ''Jazz'' (typically a 7A, 8A or 8D) or ''Heavy Rock'' (typically a 5B) for example. The most general purpose stick is a 5A. However, there is no one stick for any particular style of music.

==Techniques==
[[File:Traditional Grip.jpg|thumb|Traditional grip]]
[[File:Top Secret DSC 1189.jpg|thumb|"Fire-sticks" used by [[Top Secret Drum Corps]]]]

===Grip===
{{main|grip (percussion)}}

There are two main ways of holding drumsticks:
* [[Traditional grip]], in which right and left hands use different grips.
* [[Matched grip]], in which the two hand grips are mirror-image.

Traditional grip was developed to conveniently play a [[snare drum]] while riding a horse, and was documented and popularised by [[Sanford A. Moeller]] in ''[[The Art of Snare Drumming]]'' (1925). It was the standard grip for kit drummers in the first half of the twentieth century and remains popular, and the standard grip for most snare drummers.

Matched grips are standardized for most other instruments, and became popular for kit drumming towards the middle of the twentieth century, threatening to displace the traditional grip for kit drumming. However the traditional grip has since made a comeback, and both types of grip are still used and promoted by leading kit drummers and teachers.

'''Engineering for Change''' ('''E4C''') is an online platform and international community of engineers, scientists, non-governmental organizations, local community advocates and other innovators working to solve global development problems. The organization's founders are the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], and [[Engineers Without Borders]] USA. E4C facilitates the development of affordable, locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to the most pressing humanitarian challenges and shares them freely online as a form of [[open source appropriate technology]].

Members of the E4C community use the platform's online tools to share knowledge and collaborate. They work together to design and apply technical solutions wherever they see the need. Solutions fall into seven categories on the organization's Web site, and they can include big infrastructural projects such as community water purification and bridge building, or smaller, personal technologies such as bicycle-powered electricity generators and cellphone applications for healthcare.

== History ==
In 2009, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers created a website to pull together the disparate sources of information on appropriate technology and solutions in global development. The site aggregated information, hosted a library of often little-known technologies, and offered tools to enable collaboration among development teams worldwide. Throughout 2010, the site operated in alpha and then beta with a mostly closed group of users. A public site, at engineeringforchange.info, mirrored some of the content on the test site, but without all of its functionality. IEEE and EWB-USA signed on as partners in time for the public launch on January 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Design Tool Whose Time Has Come | publisher = nextbillion.net | url = http://www.nextbillion.net/blog/2011/01/05/engineering-for-change | accessdate = 2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the organization has more than 25,000 members. Many of them are also members of the founding organizations, which have a combined membership of more than 500,000.

== Solutions Library ==
E4C users can post projects they are working on and challenges they are having to gain insight from the wider community. They can use an open-source archive of solutions to development issues that include models for development projects, tested devices and other information gleaned from global organizations. The members can learn how to use their skills in developing countries and resource-poor areas from experts in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solutions Library |publisher=E4C |url=https://www.engineeringforchange.org/solution/library/viewAll/Water |accessdate=2011-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726032211/https://www.engineeringforchange.org/solution/library/viewAll/Water |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also track the projects that interest and contribute their own advice and information.

== Education ==
Education is an important part of Engineering for Change. The Web site provides educational materials on how to design and implement solutions, and an archive of relevant academic programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Center |publisher=E4C |url=https://www.engineeringforchange.org/learnMore?learnSubject=design |accessdate=2011-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726032234/https://www.engineeringforchange.org/learnMore?learnSubject=design |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2454">The '''Fischer assay''' is a standardized laboratory test for determining the oil yield from [[oil shale]] to be expected from a conventional [[shale oil extraction]].  A 100&amp;nbsp;gram oil shale sample crushed to &lt;2.38&amp;nbsp;mm is heated in a small aluminum [[retort]] to {{convert|500|°C|°F|-1}} at a rate of 12°C/min (22°F/min), and held at that temperature for 40&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=dyni&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The distilled vapors of oil, gas, and water are passed through a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] and cooled with ice water into a graduated [[centrifuge tube]]. The oil yields achieved by other technologies are often reported as a percentage of the Fischer Assay oil yield.

'''rdGizmo For You LTD''' is in [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]]. Initially manufactured and sold [[electronics|electronic]] devices based on member ideas and suggestions in a form of "Wishes". Currently the organization is focused on a single project under the name OSRC (Open Source Remote Control) which it designed and created.

==History==
rdGizmo For You LTD was founded in 2007 by Demetris Rouslan Zavorotnitsienko, the CEO and Lead developer of the organization. Its first products were [[GPS]] trackers and hand-held PDA's as well as many other devices which were all Open Source and available to the public for download or modifications. The name '''[[Gadget|Gizmo]] For You''' came about because the company creates ''Gizmos'' and naturally ''For You'' relates to everyone since anyone can participate or initiate a project.

In late 2011 the CEO and founder of the organization, created a device under the name OSRC (Open Source Remote Control). Based on these designs the company redirected all its resources towards the project, recreating the web space to accommodate the newly developed series of products and their community. All past designs, made by Gizmo For You were transferred to the OSRC website and are hosted there for historical reasons.

In 2013 a need for a 3D printer became clear for the OSRC project and the company created the Ilios 3D printer. Unfortunately due to lack of financing, the OSRC project was suspended and the Ilios 3D printer website was created and separated from the OSRC project. Currently the company is mainly concentrated on developing and supporting the Ilios 3D printer.

A '''gold-aluminium intermetallic''' is an [[intermetallic]] compound of [[gold]] and [[aluminium]] that occurs at contacts between the two metals. 

These intermetallics have different properties than the individual metals, which can cause problems in [[wire bonding]] in [[microelectronics]]. The main compounds formed are Au&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (white plague) and AuAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (purple plague), which both form at high temperatures. 

'''White plague''' is the name of the compound Au&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as the problem it causes. It has low electrical conductivity, so its formation at the joint leads to an increase of electrical resistance which can lead to total failure. '''Purple plague''' (sometimes known as 'purple death' or [[William Chandler Roberts-Austen|Roberts-Austen]]'s '[[Colored_gold#Purple_gold|purple gold]]') is a [[brittle]], bright-purple compound, AuAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or about 78.5%Au-21.5%Al by mass. AuAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the most stable thermally of the Au-Al intermetallic compounds, with a melting point of 1060°C (see phase diagram), similar to that of pure gold. The process of the growth of the intermetallic layers causes reduction in volume, and hence creates cavities in the metal near the interface between gold and aluminium.

Other gold-aluminium intermetallics can cause problems as well. Below 624°C, purple plague is replaced by Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al, a tan-colored substance. It is a poor conductor and can cause electrical failure of the joint that can lead to mechanical failure. At lower temperatures, about 400&amp;ndash;450°C, an [[interdiffusion]] process takes place at the junction. This leads to formation of layers of several intermetallic compounds with different compositions, from gold-rich to aluminium-rich, with different growth rates. Cavities form as the denser, faster-growing layers consume the slower-growing ones. This process, known as [[Kirkendall effect|Kirkendall voiding]], leads to both increased electrical resistance and mechanical weakening of the wire bond. When the voids are collected along the diffusion front, a process aided by contaminants present in the lattice, it is known as [[Horsting void]]ing, a process similar to and often confused with Kirkendall voiding.

All problems caused by gold-aluminium intermetallics can be prevented either by using bonding processes that avoid high temperatures (e.g. [[ultrasonic welding]]), or by designing circuitry in such a way as to avoid aluminium-to-gold contact using aluminium-to-aluminium or gold-to-gold junctions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">A '''graphene antenna''' is a proposed high-frequency antenna based on [[graphene]], a one atom thick two dimensional carbon crystal, that would enhance radio communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perruisseau-Carrier|first=J.|date=November 2012|title=Graphene for antenna applications: Opportunities and challenges from microwaves to THz|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6402934/|journal=2012 Loughborough Antennas Propagation Conference (LAPC)|pages=1–4|doi=10.1109/lapc.2012.6402934|arxiv=1210.3444}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=April 2016}} The unique structure of graphene would enable these enhancements. Ultimately, the choice of graphene for the basis of this nano antenna was due to the behavior of electrons. This is currently{{when|date=October 2015}} being researched and graphene appears to be a feasible basis for antennas.

== Antenna ==
It would be unfeasible to simply reduce traditional metallic antennas to nano sizes, because they would require tremendously high frequencies to operate.{{fact|date=April 2016}} Consequently, it would require a lot of power to operate them. Furthermore, electrons in these traditional metals are not very mobile at nano sizes and the necessary electromagnetic waves would not form. However, these limitations would not be an issue with graphene's unique capabilities. A flake of graphene has the potential to hold a series of metal electrodes. Consequently, it would be possible to develop an antenna from this material.&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Llatser|first1=Ignacio|title=Characterization of graphene-based nano-antennas in the terahertz band|conference=IEEE European Conference on Antennas and Propagation|date=2012|pages=194–198|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6206598|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dragoman|first1=Mircea|title=Terahertz Radio based on Graphene|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=2010|volume=107|issue=10|page=104313|url=http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?sid=google&amp;auinit=M&amp;aulast=Dragoman&amp;atitle=Terahertz+antenna+based+on+graphene&amp;id=doi:10.1063/1.3427536&amp;title=Journal+of+applied+physics&amp;volume=107&amp;issue=10&amp;date=2010&amp;spage=104313&amp;issn=0021-8979|accessdate=October 28, 2014|doi=10.1063/1.3427536|bibcode=2010JAP...107j4313D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron behavior ===
Graphene has a unique structure, wherein, electrons are able to move with minimal resistance. This enables electricity to move at a much faster speed than in metal, which is used for current antennas. Furthermore, as the electrons oscillate, they create an electromagnetic wave atop the graphene layer, referred to as the [[Surface plasmon polariton|surface plasmon polariton wave]]. This would enable the antenna to operate at the lower end of the terahertz frequency, which would be more efficient than the current copper based antennas. Ultimately, researchers envision that graphene will be able to break through the limitations of current antennas.&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal 1"/&gt;

=== Properties ===
It has been estimated that speeds of up to terabits per second can be achieved using such a device.{{fact|date=April 2016}} Traditional antennas would require very high frequencies to operate at nano scales, making it an unfeasible option. However, the unique slower movement of electrons in graphene would enable it to operate at lower frequencies making it a feasible option for a nano sized antenna.&lt;ref name="Journal 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toon|first1=John|title=Graphene-Based Nano-Antennas May Enable Networks of Tiny Machines|url=http://www.news.gatech.edu/2013/12/11/graphene-based-nano-antennas-may-enable-networks-tiny-machines|website=Georgia Tech|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Research 1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anthony|first1=Sebastian|title=Graphene acts as a plasmonic antenna, leads towards 0.1nm wires in chips|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/116549-graphene-acts-as-plasmonic-antenna-leads-towards-0-1nm-wires-in-chips|website=ExtremeTech|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

=== Oak Ridge National Laboratory  ===
Researchers from the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) have discovered a unique way to create an atomic antenna. Two sheets of graphene can be connected by a silicon wire that is approximately 0.1 nanometer in diameter. This is approximately 100 times smaller than current metal based wires, which can only be reduced to 50 nanometers. This silicon wire however, is a [[Plasmon|plasmotic]] device, which would enable the formation of surface plasmon polariton waves required to operate this nano antenna.&lt;ref name="Research 1"/&gt;

=== Samsung  ===
Samsung has funded $120,000 for research into the graphene antenna to a team of researchers from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]]. Their research has shown that graphene is a feasible material to make nano antennas with. They have simulated how the electrons would behave, and have confirmed that surface plasmon polariton waves should form. This wave is essential for the graphene antenna to operate at the low end of the terahertz range, making it more efficient than traditional antenna designs. Researchers are currently working on implementing their research, and finding a way to propagate the electromagnetic waves necessary to operate the antenna. Their findings were published in the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Samsung&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewitt|first1=John|title=Samsung funds graphene antenna project for wireless, ultra-fast intra-chip links|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/149172-samsung-funds-graphene-antenna-project-for-wireless-ultra-fast-intra-chip-links|website=ExtremeTech|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hansen Writing Ball''' is an early [[typewriter]]. It was invented in 1865 and patented and put into production in 1870, and was the first commercially produced typewriter.

== Design ==

The writing ball (Danish: ''skrivekugle'') was invented in 1865 by the reverend [[Rasmus Malling-Hansen]] (1835–1890) principal of the [[Royal Institute for the Deaf-Mutes]] in [[Copenhagen]].

The Hansen ball was a combination of unusual design and ergonomic innovations: its distinctive feature was an arrangement of 52 keys on a large brass hemisphere, causing the machine to resemble an oversized pincushion. From the book ''Hvem er Skrivekuglens Opfinder'', written by Malling-Hansen's daughter [[Johanne Agerskov]], we know how Malling-Hansen made experiments with a model of his writing ball made out of porcelain. He tried out different placements of the letters on the keys, to work out the placement that led to the quickest writing speed. He ended up placing the most frequently used letters to be touched by the fastest writing fingers, and also placed most of the vowels to the left and the consonants to the right. This, together with the short pistons which went directly through the ball, made the writing speed of the writing ball very fast.

Like most of the early 19th-century typewriters, it did not allow the paper to be seen as it passed through the device.

=== Early designs ===
The first models typed on a paper attached to a cylinder, which could be made to move both rotationally with the cylinder and longitudinally along the cylinder, enabling the user to format and space the letters manually. The user would attach a piece of white paper and a sheet of coloring paper onto the cylinder by way of several clips. These models also included an electro-magnet for the Ball which controlled both the typewriter's movement and manipulation, thus making Malling-Hansen's machine the first electric typewriter. This electro-magnet was powered by a 10 or 12-cell battery, and controlled a mechanical [[escapement]] in the typewriter's clockwork, moving the carriage a fixed amount each time one of the pistons was depressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1872|title=The Writing Ball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLJXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA68|journal=The Mechanics' Magazine and Journal of Science, Arts, and Manufactures|publisher=Mechanic's Magazine|volume=96|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improvements ===
Malling-Hansen made several improvements on his invention throughout the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1874 he patented the next model, and now the cylinder was replaced by a flat mechanical paper-frame. The electromagnetic battery was still used to move the paper along as the Ball typed upon it, and the design led to a lower possibility for error. Malling-Hansen improved further on his design, and created a semi-cylindrical frame to hold one sheet of paper. This best known model was first patented in 1875, and now the battery was replaced by a mechanical escapement. All these improvements made for a simpler and more compact writing apparatus.

== Sale and popular use ==

It was exhibited at a great industrial exhibition in Copenhagen in 1873, at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873, and at the Paris exhibition or [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]].  All through the 1870s it won several awards.

The writing ball was sold in many countries in Europe, and it is known that it was still in use in offices in London as late as 1909.  But due to its hand-crafted production, it was overtaken in the market by the mass-produced [[Sholes and Glidden typewriter]] which [[E. Remington and Sons]] started to make in 1873.

Malling-Hansen also invented a very high speed writing machine for [[shorthand|stenography]], called the Takygraf, and a copying technique called the Xerografi—both invented in 1872.

More-or-less intact Hansen balls have fetched hundreds of thousands of [[Euro]]s in auctions. Few remain in existence today.

In 1881, when he had serious problems with his sight, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wanted to buy a [[typewriter]] to enable him to continue his writing, and from letters to his [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche|sister]] it is known that he personally was in contact with "the inventor of the typewriter, Mr Malling-Hansen from Copenhagen". He mentioned to his sister that he had received letters and also a typewritten postcard as an example. Nietzsche received his writing ball in 1882 directly from the inventor, [[Rasmus Malling-Hansen]], in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It was the newest model, the portable tall one with a color ribbon, serial number 125, and several typescripts are known to have been written by him on this writing ball (approximately 60). It is known that Nietzsche was also familiar with the newest model from [[E. Remington and Sons]] (model 2), but he wanted to buy a portable typewriter, so he chose to buy the Malling-Hansen writing ball, as this model was lightweight and easy to carry. Unfortunately, Nietzsche wasn't totally satisfied with his purchase and never really mastered the use of the instrument. A number of theories have been advanced to explain why Nietzsche did not make more use of it. For example, [[Rüdiger Safranski]] indicates it was "defective".&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2002, p250&lt;/ref&gt; New research indicates Nietzsche was not aware that his trouble in using the machine had been caused by damage to it during transportation to Genoa in Italy, where he lived at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Eberwein, ''Nietzsches Schreibkugel'', Eberwein Typoskript, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and when he turned to a mechanic who had no typewriter repair skills, the man managed to damage the writing ball even more. Nietzsche claimed that his thoughts were influenced by his use of a typewriter (''"Our writing instruments contribute to our thoughts"'', 1882).&lt;ref&gt;Don Ihde, Bodies in Technology, University of Minnesota Press, 2001, p97&lt;/ref&gt; As one researcher has noted, "Nietzsche's interest in rhetoric and his experience of the typewriter framed his understanding of language in a highly symbolic way: the traditions of the philosophy of language versus the scientific and technological conditions of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Christian Emden, ''Nietzsche on Language, Consciousness, and the Body'', University of Illinois Press, 2005, p28&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1882 he even made a poem about his writing ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retronaut.com/2011/06/the-writing-ball/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061517/http://www.retronaut.com/2011/06/the-writing-ball/ |archivedate=2014-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malling-hansen.org/friedrich-nietzsche-and-his-typewriter-a-malling-hansen-writing-ball.html |title=The International Rasmus Malling-Hansen Society: Friedrich Nietzsche's typewriter -free download |publisher=Malling-hansen.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}[[File:View from the Window at Le Gras, Joseph Nicéphore Niépce.jpg|thumb|Retouched version of the earliest surviving camera photograph, 1826 or 1827, known as ''[[View from the Window at Le Gras]]''|353x353px]]&lt;!--Note that this reproduces Helmut Gernsheim's ubiquitous 1952 creation, a very heavily painted-over paper print copy of the original plate. It represents his subjective interpretation of what the photograph recorded and really ought to be replaced with an objective reproduction, such as a recent digital snapshot of the artifact as it now appears on display at the Ransom Center in Austin, TX.--&gt;

The history of [[photography]] began in remote antiquity with the discovery of two critical principles; the [[camera obscura]] image projection and the observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light. Apart from a possibly photographic but unrecognised process used on the [[Turin Shroud]] there are no artefacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt to capture images with light sensitive materials prior to the 18th century.
Around 1717 [[Johann Heinrich Schulze]] captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought of making the results durable. Around 1800 [[Thomas Wedgwood (photographer)|Thomas Wedgwood]] made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce detailed [[photogram]]s, but Wedgwood and his associate [[Humphry Davy]] found no way to fix these images.

In the mid-1820s, [[Nicéphore Niépce]] first managed to fix an image that was captured with a camera, but at least eight hours or even several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very crude. Niépce's associate [[Louis Daguerre]] went on to develop the [[daguerreotype]] process, the first publicly announced  and commercially viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The details were introduced as a gift to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography.&lt;ref name="Hirsch on Niepce"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vftTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Joseph+Nicephore+Niepce+View+From+the+Window+of+Gras&amp;dq=Joseph+Nicephore+Niepce+View+From+the+Window+of+Gras&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=3|title=Seizing the Light: A History of Photography|first=Robert|last=Hirsch|date=2 June 2018|publisher=McGraw-Hill|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XNXVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA68&amp;lpg=RA3-PA68&amp;dq=birth+year+photography+1839&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=URk1ndo3Cz&amp;sig=DHzKyTKpFDV_AGBCKztTuUMhlvc&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlnqXRx4rQAhWCdCwKHZh4Co0Q6AEIcDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=birth%20year%20photography%201839&amp;f=false The Michigan Technic 1882 ''The Genesis of Photography with Hints on Developing]&lt;/ref&gt;
The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based [[calotype]] [[negative (photography)|negative]] and [[salt print]] processes invented by [[William Henry Fox Talbot]]. Subsequent innovations made photography easier and more versatile. New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds, and eventually to a small fraction of a second; new photographic media were more economical, sensitive or convenient, including [[roll film]]s for casual use by amateurs. In the mid-20th century, developments made it possible for amateurs to take pictures in [[color photography|natural color]] as well as in [[black-and-white]].

The commercial introduction of computer-based electronic digital cameras in the 1990s soon revolutionized photography. During the first decade of the 21st century, traditional film-based photochemical methods were increasingly marginalized as the practical advantages of the new technology became widely appreciated and the image quality of moderately priced digital cameras was continually improved. Especially since cameras became a standard feature on smartphones, taking pictures (and instantly publishing them online) has become an ubiquitous everyday practice around the world.

==Etymology==
The coining of the word "photography" is usually attributed to [[Sir John Herschel]] in 1839. It is based on the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''φῶς (phōs)'', (genitive: ''phōtós'') meaning "light", and ''γραφή (graphê)'', meaning "drawing, writing", together meaning "drawing with light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=photography&amp;searchmode=none|title=photography - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history of the camera==
{{main|Camera obscura}}
[[File:Camera obscura box.jpg|thumb|Principle of a box camera obscura with mirror]]

A natural phenomenon, known as [[camera obscura]] or pinhole image, can project a (reversed) image through a small opening onto an opposite surface. This principle may have been known and used in prehistoric times. The earliest known written record of the camera obscura is to be found in Chinese writings called [[Mozi (book)|Mozi]], dated to the 4th century BCE. Until the 16th century the camera obscura was mainly used to study optics and astronomy, especially to safely watch solar eclipses without damaging the eyes. 
In the later half of the 16th century some technical improvements were developed: a (biconvex) lens in the opening (first described by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in 1550) and a [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] restricting the aperture ([[Daniel Barbaro]] in 1568) gave a brighter and sharper image. In 1558 [[Giambattista della Porta]] advised using the camera obscura as a drawing aid in his popular and influential books. Della Porta's advice was widely adopted by artists and since the 17th century portable versions of the camera obscura were commonly used - first as a tent, later as boxes. The box type camera obscura was the basis for the earliest photographic cameras when photography was developed in the early 19th century.
{{further|History of the camera}}

==Before 1700: Turin Shroud and light sensitive materials==
The notion that light can affect various substances - for instance the suntanning of skin or fading of textile - must have been around since very early times. Ideas of fixing the image seen in mirrors or other ways of creating images automatically may also have been in people's mind long before anything like photography was developed.&lt;ref name=Gernsheim&gt;[[Helmut Gernsheim|Gernsheim, Helmut]] (1986).

Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25128-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seem to be no historical records of any ideas even remotely resembling photography before 1725, despite early knowledge of light-sensitive materials and the camera obscura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=n5EZ5UYiQE4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Burning%20with%20Desire%3A%20The%20Conception%20of%20Photography%22&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Burning with Desire: The Conception of Photography|last=Batchen|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that some lost type of photographic technology must have been applied before 1357: the [[Shroud of Turin]] contains an image that resembles a sepia photographic [[negative (photography)|negative]] and is much clearer when it is converted to a positive image. The actual method that resulted in this image has not yet been conclusively identified. It first appeared in historical records in 1357 and [[radiocarbon dating]] tests indicate it was probably made between 1260 and 1390.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allen, Nicholas P.

==1700 to 1802: earliest concepts and fleeting photogram results==
===Schulze's Scotophorus: earliest fleeting letter photograms (circa 1717)===
Around 1717&lt;ref&gt;The title page dated 1719 of a section (of a 1721 book) containing the original publication can be seen [http://digitale.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/vd18/content/pageview/4921255 here]. In the text Schulze claims he did the experiment two years earlier&lt;/ref&gt; German [[polymath]] [[Johann Heinrich Schulze]] accidentally discovered that a slurry of [[chalk]] and [[nitric acid]] into which some [[silver]] particles had been dissolved was darkened by sunlight. After experiments with threads that had created lines on the bottled substance after he placed it in direct sunlight for a while, he applied [[stencils]] of words to the bottle. The stencils produced copies of the text in dark red, almost violet characters on the surface of the otherwise whitish contents. The impressions persisted until they were erased by shaking the bottle or until overall exposure to light obliterated them. Schulze named the substance "Scotophorus", when he published his findings in 1719. He thought the discovery could be applied to detect whether metals or minerals contained any silver and hoped that further experimentation by others would lead to some other useful results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bibliotheca Novissima Oberservationum ac Recensionum|url=http://digitale.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/vd18/content/pageview/4935943|year=1721|pages=234–240|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Litchfield, Richard Buckley (1903).

===De la Roche's fictional image capturing process (1760)===
The early science fiction novel ''[[Giphantie]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=0idPAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=%22de%20la%20roche%22%20giphantie&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Giphantie|last=de la Roche|first=Tiphaigne|year=1760|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1760) by the French [[Tiphaigne de la Roche]] described something quite similar to (colour) photography, a process that fixes fleeting images formed by rays of light: "They coat a piece of canvas with this material, and place it in front of the object to capture. The first effect of this cloth is similar to that of a mirror, but by means of its viscous nature the prepared canvas, as is not the case with the mirror, retains a facsimile of the image. The mirror represents images faithfully, but retains none; our canvas reflects them no less faithfully, but retains them all. This impression of the image is instantaneous. The canvas is then removed and deposited in a dark place. An hour later the impression is dry, and you have a picture the more precious in that no art can imitate its truthfulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artinfiction.wordpress.com/2015/07/07/tiphaigne-de-la-roche-giphantie1760/|title=Tiphaigne de la Roche – Giphantie,1760|author=|date=7 July 2015|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; De la Roche thus imagined a process that made use of a special substance in combination with the qualities of a mirror, rather than the camera obscura. The hour of drying in a dark place suggests he possibly thought about the light sensitivity of the material, but he attributes the effect to its viscous nature.

===Scheele's forgotten chemical fixer (1777)===
In 1777, the chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] was studying the more intrinsically light-sensitive [[silver chloride]] and determined that light darkened it by disintegrating it into microscopic dark particles of metallic silver. Of greater potential usefulness, Scheele found that [[ammonia]] dissolved the silver chloride but not the dark particles. This discovery could have been used to stabilize or "fix" a camera image captured with silver chloride, but was not picked up by the earliest photography experimenters.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Scheele also noted that red light did not have much effect on silver chloride (a feature that would later be applied to be able to see while printing black and white photographs in darkrooms).&lt;ref name=Litchfield/&gt;

Although Thomas Wedgwood felt inspired by Scheele's writings in general, he must have missed or forgotten these experiments: he found no method to fix the photogram and shadow images he managed to capture around 1800 (see below).&lt;ref name=Litchfield/&gt;

===Thomas Wedgwood &amp; Humphry Davy: Fleeting detailed photograms (1790?-1802)===
[[Thomas Wedgwood (photographer)|Thomas Wedgwood]] (1771-1805) is believed to have been the first person to have thought of creating permanent pictures by capturing camera images on material coated with a light-sensitive chemical. He originally wanted to capture the images of a camera obscura, but found they were too faint to have an effect upon the [[silver nitrate]] solution that was advised to him as a light-sensitive substance. Wedgwood did manage to copy painted glass plates and captured shadows on white leather as well as on paper moistened with a silver nitrate solution. Attempts to preserve the results with their "distinct tints of brown or black, sensibly differing in intensity" failed. 
It is unclear when Wedgwood's experiments took place. He may have started before 1790; [[James Watt]] wrote a letter to Thomas Wedgwood's father [[Josiah Wedgwood]] to thank him "for your instructions as to the Silver Pictures, about which, when at home, I will make some experiments". This letter (now lost) is believed to have been written in 1790, 1791 or 1799. In 1802 an account by [[Humphry Davy]] detailing Wedgwood's experiments was published in an early journal of the [[Royal Institution]] with the title ''An Account of a Method of Copying Paintings upon Glass, and of Making Profiles, by the Agency of Light upon Nitrate of Silver''. 
Davy added that the method could be used for objects that are partly opaque and partly transparent to create accurate representations of for instance "the woody fibres of leaves and the wings of insects". He also found that solar microscope images of small objects were easily captured on prepared paper. Davy, apparently unaware or forgetful about Scheele's discovery, concluded that substances should be found to get rid of (or deactivate) the unexposed particles in silver nitrate or silver chloride "to render the process as useful as it is elegant".&lt;ref name=Litchfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Litchfield|first=Richard Buckley|year=1903|title=Tom Wedgwood, the First Photographer|publisher= Duckworth and Co|url=https://archive.org/stream/tomwedgwoodfirst00litcrich#page/184/mode/2up|pages=185–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wedgwood may have prematurely abandoned his experiments due to his frail and failing health. He died aged 34 in 1805.

Davy seems not to have continued the experiments. Although the journal of the small, infant Royal Institution probably reached its very small group of members, the article eventually must have been read by many more people. It was reviewed by [[David Brewster]] in the ''Edinburgh Magazine'' in December 1802, appeared in chemistry textbooks as early as 1803, was translated into French, and published in German in 1811. Readers of the article may have been discouraged to find a fixer, because the highly acclaimed scientist Davy had already tried and failed. Apparently the article was not noted by Niépce or Daguerre, and by Talbot only after he had developed his own processes.&lt;ref name=Litchfield/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batchen, Geoffrey (1999).

===Jacques Charles: Fleeting silhouette photograms (circa 1801?)===
French balloonist/professor/inventor [[Jacques Charles]] is believed to have captured fleeting negative photograms of [[silhouette]]s on light sensitive paper at the start of the 19th century, prior to Wedgwood. Charles died in 1823 without documenting the process, but purportedly demonstrated it in his lectures at the Louvre. It was not publicized until [[François Arago]] mentioned it at his introduction of the details of the Daguerreotype to the world in 1839. He later wrote that the first idea of fixing the images of the camera obscura or the solar microscope with chemical substances belonged to Charles. Later historians probably only built on Arago's information and much later the unsupported year 1780 was attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Litchfield|first=Richard Buckley|year=1903|title=Tom Wedgwood, the First Photographer - Appendix B|publisher= Duckworth and Co|url=https://archive.org/stream/tomwedgwoodfirst00litcrich#page/230/mode/2up|pages=228–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Arago indicated the first years of the 19th century and a date prior to Wedgwood's process published in 1802, this would mean that Charles' demonstrations took place in 1800 or 1801 - assuming Arago was this accurate almost 40 years later.

In 1816 [[Nicéphore Niépce]], using paper coated with [[silver chloride]], succeeded in photographing the images formed in a small camera, but the photographs were [[negative (photography)|negatives]], darkest where the camera image was lightest and vice versa, and they were not permanent in the sense of being reasonably light-fast; like earlier experimenters, Niépce could find no way to prevent the coating from darkening all over when it was exposed to light for viewing.

Retrieved 25 May 2013.

In partnership, Niépce in [[Chalon-sur-Saône]] and [[Louis Daguerre]] in [[Paris]] refined the bitumen process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dagu/hd_dagu.htm | title=Daguerre (1787–1851) and the Invention of Photography | work=Timeline of Art History | publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] | date=October 2004 |accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; substituting a more sensitive resin and a very different post-exposure treatment that yielded higher-quality and more easily viewed images. Exposure times in the camera, although substantially reduced, were still measured in hours.&lt;ref name="nnhist" /&gt;

==1830 to 1840: early monochrome processes==
Niépce died suddenly in 1833, leaving his notes to Daguerre. More interested in silver-based processes than Niépce had been, Daguerre experimented with photographing camera images directly onto a mirror-like silver-surfaced plate that had been fumed with [[iodine]] vapor, which reacted with the silver to form a coating of [[silver iodide]]. As with the bitumen process, the result appeared as a positive when it was suitably lit and viewed. Exposure times were still impractically long until Daguerre made the pivotal discovery that an invisibly slight or [[latent image|"latent" image]] produced on such a plate by a much shorter exposure could be "developed" to full visibility by [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] fumes. This brought the required exposure time down to a few minutes under optimum conditions. A strong hot solution of common salt served to stabilize or [[photographic fixer|fix]] the image by removing the remaining silver iodide. On 7 January 1839, this first complete practical photographic process was announced at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;(Arago, François) (1839) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2967c/f8.image "Fixation des images qui se forment au foyer d'une chambre obscure"] (Fixing of images formed at the focus of a ''camera obscura''), ''Comptes rendus'', '''8''' : 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the news quickly spread.&lt;ref&gt;By mid-February successful attempts to replicate "M. Daguerre's beautiful discovery", using chemicals on paper, had already taken place in Germany and England: ''The Times'' (London), 21 February 1839, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, all details of the process were withheld and specimens were shown only at Daguerre's studio, under his close supervision, to Academy members and other distinguished guests.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., a 9 May 1839 showing to [[John Herschel]], documented by [http://foxtalbot.dmu.ac.uk/letters/transcriptName.php?bcode=Hers-JF&amp;pageNumber=66&amp;pageTotal=&amp;referringPage=3 Herschel's letter to WHF Talbot].

It was superseded by the [[collodion process]].

After reading early reports of Daguerre's invention, [[Henry Fox Talbot]], who had succeeded in creating stabilized photographic negatives on paper in 1835, worked on perfecting his own process. In early 1839, he acquired a key improvement, an effective fixer, from his friend [[John Herschel]], a [[polymath]] scientist who had previously shown that hyposulfite of soda (commonly called "hypo" and now known formally as [[sodium thiosulfate]]) would dissolve silver salts.&lt;ref&gt;John F. W. Herschel (1839) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k560980/f154.image "Note on the art of photography, or the application of the chemical rays of light to the purposes of pictorial representation,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''4''' : 131-133.  On page 132 Herschel mentions the use of hyposulfites.&lt;/ref&gt; News of this solvent also benefited Daguerre, who soon adopted it as a more efficient alternative to his original hot salt water method.&lt;ref&gt;Daguerre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4TAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Historique et description des procédés du Daguerréotype et du diorama''] [History and description of the processes of the daguerreotype and diorama] (Paris, France:  Alphonse Giroux et Cie., 1839).  On page 11, for example, Daguerre states:  "Cette surabondance contribue à donner des tons roux, même en enlevant entièrement l'iode au moyen d'un lavage à l'hyposulfite de soude ou au sel marin."  (This overabundance contributes towards giving red tones, even while completely removing the iodine by means of a rinse in sodium hyposulfite or in sea salt.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick Langenheim circa 1849.jpg|thumb|left|A [[calotype]] showing the American photographer [[Frederick Langenheim]], circa 1849. Note that the caption on the photo calls the process "Talbotype".]]
Talbot's early [[silver chloride]] "sensitive paper" experiments required camera exposures of an hour or more. In 1841, Talbot invented the [[calotype]] process, which, like Daguerre's process, used the principle of chemical development of a faint or invisible "latent" image to reduce the exposure time to a few minutes. Paper with a coating of [[silver iodide]] was exposed in the camera and developed into a translucent [[negative (photography)|negative]] image. Unlike a daguerreotype, which could only be copied by rephotographing it with a camera, a calotype negative could be used to make a large number of positive prints by simple [[contact print]]ing. The calotype had yet another distinction compared to other early photographic processes, in that the finished product lacked fine clarity due to its translucent paper negative. This was seen as a positive attribute for portraits because it softened the appearance of the human face{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Talbot patented this process,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=pIpDAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;#PPP1,M1 Improvement in photographic pictures], Henry Fox Talbot, United States Patent Office, patent no. 5171, June 26, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt; which greatly limited its adoption, and spent many years pressing lawsuits against alleged infringers. He attempted to enforce a very broad interpretation of his patent, earning himself the ill will of photographers who were using the related glass-based processes later introduced by other inventors, but he was eventually defeated. Nonetheless, Talbot's developed-out silver halide negative process is the basic technology used by chemical film cameras today. [[Hippolyte Bayard]] had also developed a method of photography but delayed announcing it, and so was not recognized as its inventor.

In 1839, [[John Herschel]] made the first glass negative, but his process was difficult to reproduce.  Slovene [[Janez Puhar]] invented a process for making photographs on glass in 1841; it was recognized on June 17, 1852 in Paris by the Académie Nationale Agricole, Manufacturière et Commerciale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.puhar.si/?J=202000004 | title=Life and work of Janez Puhar &amp;#124; (accessed December 13, 2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1847, Nicephore Niépce's cousin, the chemist [[Abel Niepce de Saint-Victor|Niépce St. Victor]], published his invention of a process for making glass plates with an [[albumen]] emulsion; the Langenheim brothers of Philadelphia and John Whipple and William Breed Jones of Boston also invented workable negative-on-glass processes in the mid-1840s.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1851 [[Frederick Scott Archer]] invented the [[collodion process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard G.

(Carroll refers to the process as "Tablotype" in the story "A Photographer's Day Out")&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Works of Lewis Carroll, from the Random House Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Bowyer Berkeley]] experimented with his own version of collodion emulsions after Samman introduced the idea of adding [[dithionite]] to the [[pyrogallol]] developer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Berkeley discovered that with his own addition of [[sulfite]], to absorb the [[sulfur dioxide]] given off by the chemical dithionite in the [[photographic developer|developer]], that dithionite was not required in the developing process. In 1881 he published his discovery. Berkeley's formula contained pyrogallol, sulfite and citric acid. Ammonia was added just before use to make the formula [[alkaline]]. The new formula was sold by the [[Platinotype Company]] in London as Sulpho-Pyrogallol Developer.&lt;ref name="levenson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levenson|first=G. I.

Nineteenth-century experimentation with photographic processes frequently became proprietary.The German-born, New Orleans photographer Theodore Lilienthal successfully sought legal redress in an 1881 infringement case involving his "Lambert Process" in the Eastern District of Louisiana.

==Popularization==
The daguerreotype proved popular in response to the demand for [[portrait photography|portraiture]] that emerged from the middle classes during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Early American Daguearreotype: Cross Currents in Art and Technology|last=Gillespie|first=Sarah Kate|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=9780262034104|location=Cambridge: Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} This demand, which could not be met in volume and in cost by oil painting, added to the push for the development of photography.

[[Roger Fenton]] and [[Philip Henry Delamotte]] helped popularize the new way of recording events, the first by his [[Crimean War]] pictures, the second by his record of the disassembly and reconstruction of [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]].  Other mid-nineteenth-century photographers established the medium as a more precise means than engraving or lithography of making a record of landscapes and architecture:  for example, [[Robert Turnbull Macpherson|Robert Macpherson]]'s broad range of photographs of Rome, the interior of the Vatican, and the surrounding countryside became a sophisticated tourist's visual record of his own travels.

In America, by 1851 a broadside by daguerreotypist [[Augustus Washington]] was advertising prices ranging from 50 cents to $10.&lt;ref name="Loke, Margarett (2000), The New York Times, 7 July, Arts"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE5DD1F39F934A35754C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |title= Photography review; In a John Brown Portrait, The Essence of a Militant|accessdate=2007-03-16 | work=The New York Times | first=Margarett | last=Loke | date=July 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, daguerreotypes were fragile and difficult to copy. Photographers encouraged chemists to refine the process of making many copies cheaply, which eventually led them back to Talbot's process.

Ultimately, the [[Photographic processes|photographic process]] came about from a series of refinements and improvements in the first 20 years. In 1884 [[George Eastman]], of [[Rochester, New York]], developed dry gel on paper, or [[Photographic film|film]], to replace the photographic plate so that a photographer no longer needed to carry boxes of plates and toxic chemicals around. In July 1888 Eastman's [[Kodak]] camera went on the market with the slogan "You press the button, we do the rest". Now anyone could take a photograph and leave the complex parts of the process to others, and photography became available for the mass-market in 1901 with the introduction of the [[Brownie (camera)|Kodak Brownie]].

==Early photography in India==

Daguerreotype cameras were advertised in Calcutta a year after their invention in France — but photographic societies in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras were beginning to pop up from the 1850s onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/indias-earliest-photographers/|title=India's Earliest Photographers|first=Rena|last=Silverman|date=18 June 2015|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the practice of photography evolved, a contrasting style developed alongside the predominantly European influence on the artform. This turn is most notable in the work of [[Lala Deen Dayal|Raja Deen Dayal]], India's most celebrated 19th-century photographer, whose appointment as court photographer to the sixth [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] allowed him unique access to the inner circles of aristocratic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjp-online.com/2015/06/the-new-medium-exhibiting-the-first-photographs-ever-taken-in-india/#closeContactFormCust00|title=The New Medium: exhibiting the first photographs ever taken in India – British Journal of Photography|author=|date=|website=www.bjp-online.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1858, the Venetian photographer [[Felice Beato]] traveled to [[Lucknow]] on assignment from the [[War Department (United Kingdom)|British War Department]] to document the massacres there. His most famous photograph is of corpses inside the walled garden of the [[Sikandar Bagh|Secundra Bagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrington|first1=Peter|title=Front Man|url=http://www.historynet.com/front-man.htm|website=HistoryNet|publisher=MHQ Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2018|language=English|date=Spring 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A European woman working in Calcutta in the early 1860s, E. Mayer, was likely the first woman to practice photography professionally in India. She operated a portrait studio for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Siddhartha|title=Zenana Studio: Early Women Photographers of Bengal, from Taking Pictures: The Practice of Photography by Bengalis|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.7977573.0004.202|website=Trans-Asia Photography Review|accessdate=20 April 2018|location=In Translation, Volume 4, Issue 2, Spring 2014, translated to English by Debjani Sengupta|language=Bengali originally from Ananda Publishers 1988|date=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colour process==
{{Main|Color photography}}
[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|The first durable color photograph, taken by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]] in 1861]]
A practical means of [[color photography]] was sought from the very beginning. Results were demonstrated by [[Edmond Becquerel]] as early as 1848, but exposures lasting for hours or days were required and the captured colors were so light-sensitive they would only bear very brief inspection in dim light.

The first durable color photograph was a set of three black-and-white photographs taken through [[additive color|red, green, and blue]] color [[filter (optics)|filters]] and shown superimposed by using three [[Magic lantern|projectors]] with similar filters. It was taken by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]] in 1861 for use in a lecture by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who had proposed the method in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell | page = 449 | author = James Clerk Maxwell | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | isbn = 0-486-49560-4 | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographic emulsions then in use were insensitive to most of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]], so the result was very imperfect and the demonstration was soon forgotten. Maxwell's method is now most widely known through the early 20th century work of [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii|Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii]]. It was made practical by [[Hermann Wilhelm Vogel]]'s 1873 discovery of a way to make [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]] sensitive to the rest of the spectrum, gradually introduced into commercial use beginning in the mid-1880s.

Two French inventors, [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]] and [[Charles Cros]], working unknown to each other during the 1860s, famously unveiled their nearly identical ideas on the same day in 1869. Included were methods for viewing a set of three color-filtered black-and-white photographs in color without having to project them, and for using them to make full-color prints on paper.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brian|first=Coe|title=The Birth of Photography|year=1976|publisher=Ash &amp; Grant|isbn=0-904069-07-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first widely used method of color photography was the [[Autochrome]] plate, a process inventors and brothers [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] began working on in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907.&lt;ref name="Nickel" /&gt; It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together in the eye and produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. 
[[File:Autochrome of Mark Twain.jpg|thumb|A color portrait of [[Mark Twain]] by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], 1908, made by the recently introduced [[Autochrome]] process]]
Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then through the use of a rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance [[silver bromide]] after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, [[Reversal film|reversal processing]] was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.&lt;ref name="Nickel"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douglas R. Nickel|date=1992|title=Autochromes by Clarence H. White|url=|journal=Record of the Art Museum, Princeton University|series=2|volume=51|pages=31–32|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potatoes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.photographymuseum.com/potatoestopictures.html|title=Potatoes to Pictures|date=|website=The American Museum of Photography|publisher=The American Photography Museum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competing screen plate products soon appeared and film-based versions were eventually made. All were expensive and until the 1930s none was "fast" enough for hand-held snapshot-taking, so they mostly served a niche market of affluent advanced amateurs.

A new era in color photography began with the introduction of [[Kodachrome]] film, available for 16&amp;nbsp;mm home movies in 1935 and 35&amp;nbsp;mm slides in 1936. It captured the red, green, and blue color components in three layers of emulsion. A complex processing operation produced [[complementary color|complementary]] cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images in those layers, resulting in a [[subtractive color]] image. Maxwell's method of taking three separate filtered black-and-white photographs continued to serve special purposes into the 1950s and beyond, and [[Polachrome]], an "instant" slide film that used the Autochrome's additive principle, was available until 2003, but the few color print and slide films still being made in 2015 all use the multilayer emulsion approach pioneered by Kodachrome.

==Development of digital photography==
{{Main|Digital photography}}
[[File:NBSFirstScanImage.jpg|thumb|Walden Kirsch as scanned into the [[SEAC (computer)|SEAC]] computer in 1957]]
In 1957, a team led by [[Russell A. Kirsch]] at the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed a [[binary number|binary]] [[digital data|digital]] version of an existing technology, the [[wirephoto]] drum scanner, so that alphanumeric characters, diagrams, photographs and other graphics could be transferred into digital [[computer memory]]. One of the first photographs scanned was a picture of Kirsch's infant son Walden. The resolution was 176x176 [[pixel]]s with only one [[bit]] per pixel, i.e., stark black and white with no intermediate gray tones, but by combining multiple scans of the photograph done with different black-white threshold settings, [[grayscale]] information could also be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.nist.gov/panels/seac/EARLIEST.HTM|title=SEAC and the Start of Image Processing at the National Bureau of Standards – Earliest Image Processing|author=|date=|website=nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) is the image-capturing [[Optoelectronics|optoelectronic]] component in first-generation digital cameras. It was invented in 1969 by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]] at AT&amp;T [[Bell Labs]] as a memory device. The lab was working on the [[Picturephone]] and on the development of [[semiconductor]] bubble memory. Merging these two initiatives, Boyle and Smith conceived of the design of what they termed "Charge 'Bubble' Devices". The essence of the design was the ability to transfer charge along the surface of a semiconductor. It was [[Dr. Michael Tompsett]] from [[Bell Labs]] however, who discovered that the CCD could be used as an imaging sensor. The CCD has increasingly been replaced by the [[active pixel sensor]] (APS), commonly used in [[camera phone|cell phone cameras]]. These mobile phone cameras are used by billions of people worldwide, dramatically increasing photographic activity and material and also fueling [[citizen journalism]].

* 1973 – [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] releases the first large image-capturing CCD [[Microprocessor|chip]]: 100 rows and 100 columns.&lt;ref name="Janesick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janesick|first=James R|title=Scientific Charge Coupled Devices|year=2001|publisher=SPIE Press|isbn=0-8194-3698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1975 – [[Bryce Bayer]] of Kodak develops the [[Bayer filter]] mosaic pattern for CCD color image sensors
* 1986 – Kodak scientists develop the world's first [[Pixel#Megapixel|megapixel]] sensor.

The [[world wide web|web]] has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1992 (an image of the [[CERN]] house band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]]). Since then sites and apps such as [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Instagram]], [[Picasa]] (discontinued in 2016), [[Imgur]] and [[Photobucket]] have been used by many millions of people to [[Image sharing|share their pictures]].

==Early years and career==
A self-described programmer since he was 14, Hughes attended [[Oriel Grammar School]] in Gorleston, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and [[De Montfort University]] (formerly Leicester Polytechnic) in [[Leicester]], Leicestershire, where he received a BSc in Information Technology.

Hughes is a former Consulting IT Specialist who worked on emerging technologies at [[IBM]] for 20 years. He is now an independent consultant under the business called Feeding Edge Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/ceb1032fe3eb40a2392ebceb3c6e0b9a/compdetails Companies House listing]&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[gamer]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; he describes seeing a massive increase in the capability and design ethics within games and the rise of online gaming.

In 1997, Hughes started working on the [[World Wide Web]], changing his perspective on the science and technology and business due to the much richer mix of people involved in the web revolution{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. He told part of this story in a 2008 interview with Rita J. King on ''The Imagination Age'', in which he described how in 1992 he was one of the earliest advocates of using [[Personal Computer|PCs]] at IBM.&lt;ref name="theimaginationage1"&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Rita J. |url=http://www.theimaginationage.net/2008/02/moving-away-from-mimicry.html |title=Moving Away from Mimicry |publisher=The Imagination Age |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a public speaker and Internet personality ([[Tim Guest]]'s book ''[[Second Lives: A Journey Through Virtual Worlds]]'' features Hughes in a chapter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epredator.blogspot.com/2008/06/wow-i-am-in-lot-of-books.html |title=epredator's blog – The real life of a metaverse evangelist: Wow I am in a lot of books |publisher=Epredator.blogspot.com |date=12 June 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) he shares his experiences both of the growing virtual worlds industry, the changes in culture, personal experiences of challenging the status quo and leading through doing. "Every time I see something as stupid, I realise it's the thing I should pay the most attention to,"&lt;ref name="theimaginationage1"/&gt; he said in a 2008 interview.

Cultural and technology changes and new ways to operate across companies is a core theme. In 2008 he received the first industry award for Innovation in Virtual Worlds in the Enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/09/04/and-the-winner-of-award-for-innovation-in-the-enterprise-is/ |title=And the winner of award for innovation in the enterprise is… |publisher=eightbar |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When I'm in the metaverse, I'm physically at my computer, mentally I am at that virtual location," Hughes told the BBC in 2007.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As a digital native his epredator persona spans many [[Web 2.0]] places, blogs, [[PlayStation Network]], [[World of Warcraft]], [[Xbox Live]], Twitter, [[Flickr]], [[Linkedin]], etc. Understanding how to use that presence, still representing himself but with elements of theatre brought about by more creative expression online, he says, has led him beyond being the programmer he grew up as.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

As a metaverse evangelist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirkpatrick |first=David |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/02/05/8399120/index.htm |title=It's not a game – February 5, 2007 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term it is believed he first brought into popular use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wylie |first=Ian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2008/sep/11/work |title=Metaverse evangelist and other bizarre job titles &amp;#124; Money &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is an advocate for the widespread application and use of virtual worlds. [[Virtual worlds]], Hughes says, extend to more than just entertainment or corporate communication. "They represent past cultures, existing places, instrumenting the planet, showing business process models in actions the list goes on. Metaverses can also be used to deliver virtual goods, but now making those virtual goods real again is possible. Rapid fabrication and the rise of the fabricaneur heralds another phase in our existence online."&lt;ref name="feedingedge1"/&gt;

He presents a thread on emerging technology on the television series [[The Cool Stuff Collective]] by Archie Productions, which was launched in 2010, covering topics such as [[3D printer]]s, haptics, scanning and virtual worlds.

The '''London Pneumatic Despatch Company''' (also known as the '''London Pneumatic Dispatch Company''') was formed on 30 June 1859,&lt;ref&gt;Pneumatic Despatch Company (Limited), ''Prospectus''&lt;/ref&gt; to design, build and operate an underground railway system for the carrying of mail, parcels and light freight between locations in London. The system was used between 1863 and 1874.

==Background==
[[File:London Pneumatic Despatch testing.JPG|thumb|Testing at Battersea]]

Sir [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Rowland Hill]] of the [[General Post Office]] commissioned two engineers to investigate the feasibility of a pneumatic tube-based system between the General Post Office and the West District Central Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Year Book''. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 and 1856 they reported favourably but there would be significant cost. The scheme was not progressed.

In 1859 [[Thomas Webster Rammell]] and [[Josiah Latimer Clark]] proposed an underground tube network in central London "for the more speedy and convenient circulation of despatches and parcels".&lt;ref&gt;''Atmospheric Railways'', Charles Hadfield, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 1859 with offices at 6 Victoria Street, Westminster. Capital of £150,000 was sought through 15,000 shares at £10 each. The company's directors were its chairman [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]], deputy chairman [[Mark Huish]], [[Thomas Brassey]], [[Edwin Clark (civil engineer)|Edwin Clark]], the Hon. William Napier, [[John Horatio Lloyd]], [[William Henry Smith (1792–1865)|William Henry Smith]] and [[Sir Charles Rich, 3rd Baronet|Sir Charles Henry John Rich]].

With initial funding of £25,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|25000|1859|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} the company tested the technology and constructed a pilot route at the [[Soho Foundry]] of [[Boulton and Watt]] in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;''The Atmospheric Railways'', Francis Howard Clayton, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-scale trial was at [[Battersea]] during the summer of 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Wells Journal - Saturday 3 August 1861&lt;/ref&gt; A single tube was installed, 452 yards long, with curves of up to {{convert|300|ft|m}} radius and gradients of up to 1 in 22. {{RailGauge|2ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] track was cast inside the tube. Wheeled capsules were fitted with vulcanised rubber flaps to make an air seal. Power was provided by a 30 horse-power [[steam engine]] with a {{convert|21|ft|m}} diameter fan. Single capsules weighed up to 3 tonnes, and achieved speeds up to 40&amp;nbsp;mph (60&amp;nbsp;km/h).

==Operation==
[[File:1p0c 8c0637.jpg|thumb|First dispatch of mail bags through the pneumatic tube from the district office in Eversholt Street to Euston Station. ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 18 February 1863]]

A permanent line of {{RailGauge|2ft}} narrow gauge was constructed between [[Euston railway station]] and the North West District Post Office in Eversholt Street, a distance of approximately a third of a mile. The line was tested from 15 January 1863, and operation started on 20 February 1863. A capsule conveying up to 35 bags of mail could make the short journey between terminals in one minute. Thirteen journeys were operated each day, with a daily operating cost of £1 4s 5d. The Post Office was charged a nominal fee for use of the service, presumably to encourage them to accept the technology.&lt;ref&gt;"Pneumatic Dispatch". Alfred E. Beach. American News Company. New York. 1868.&lt;/ref&gt;

A journalist made a report on the first scheme at Euston:

{{cquote|''Near the bottom of Euston Square, there is the mouth of the tube, and there are the travelling trucks, ready to be thrust into it; and as we look, a bell rings at some distance up the rail – this is a signal that a mail-train has arrived... At this signal we hear a shovel of coke thrown into a furnace, a small steam-engine begins to beat swiftly... the pneumatic wheel ... is twenty-one feet in diameter, and is composed of two discs of iron... These discs are braced together by spoke-like partitions, and these partitions communicate with an opening for the entrance of air about the axis. As this wheel rapidly revolves, the air is sucked in at its centre, and thrown off ... at its open rim or edge. This gale is not allowed to disperse itself, however, but when any work has to be done, is confined within a paddle-box, and allowed to pass out ... through a pipe in connection with the great pneumatic despatch tube... Here, then, we have the means of pulling or pushing the travelling carriages along their subterranean road, and as we speak we see it in operation: for a mail-guard opens a door, throws in two or three mail-bags just snatched out of the guard's van as it rolls into the [mainline] station, the iron carriages are shoved into the tube, the air-tight door at its mouth is closed... and we hear them rumbling off on their subterranean journey at a rate, we are informed, of twenty miles an hour... a bell connected with an electric telegraph warns him that the attendant at the other end of the tube is about to thrust the carriage into the tube on its return journey. It has been pushed along... by the pressure of air thrown out by the wheel, but it has to be pulled back by suction; the valve of the suction-pipe, in the connection with the centre of the disc, is accordingly opened, and speedily we hear a hollow rumbling, and out shoots the carriage, ready once more for fresh bags.|source=''The Living Age'', Volume 77, Issue 984, 1863}}

The company sought to develop further lines within London, and attempted to raise an additional £125,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|125000|1863|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} of capital. The prospectus proposed a network of lines between "points so important that it is unnecessary to dwell upon the magnitude of the traffic that must naturally arise between them". The first line was to have been a route linking the Camden Town and Euston (Square) stations of the London and North Western Railway.
[[File:Receipt Pneumatic Despatch Company.jpg|thumb|receipt for purchase of 18 shares in the Pneumatic Desptach Company at @ £1 each]]

Work started on a {{RailGauge|3ft8.5in}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] line from Euston to Holborn in September 1863.&lt;ref name="Atmospheric Railways 1967"&gt;''Atmospheric Railways'', David and Charles Hadfield, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The tubes were constructed by the [[Staveley Coal and Iron Company]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's Magazine''. Volume 218&lt;/ref&gt; The first 'trains' ran on 10 October 1865 after a demonstration in which the chairman, [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]], travelled from Holborn to Euston in one of the capsules.&lt;ref name="Friend"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Friend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA108|edition=Google eBook|volume=39|year=1866|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysicsHistory"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lucibella |first1=Michael |editor1-last=Chodos |editor1-first=Alan |date=February 2013 |title=February 26, 1870: First pneumatic powered subway line in New York City |url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201302/physicshistory.cfm |journal=American Physical Society |volume=Volume 22 |issue=2 |pages=16 |doi= |access-date=July 20, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Another line from Holborn to Gresham Street via the [[General Post Office, London|General Post Office on St Martin's le Grand]] was under construction in 1865. By the time of the 1866 financial crisis caused by the [[Overend, Gurney and Company]] collapse, a ⅜&amp;nbsp;mile tube from Holborn to Hatton Garden had been constructed.&lt;ref name="Atmospheric Railways 1967"/&gt; Total expenditure so far was £150,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|150000|1866|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}
[[File:The Post Office in St Martin le Grand by Thomas Shepherd (late 1820s).jpg|thumb|General Post Office in St Martin's le Grand]]
Construction restarted in 1868, and it was completed to St. Martin's le Grand (for the General Post Office) in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;"Beneath your Feet", ''New Scientist'', 1 April, Vol. 146, no. 1972, pp5.&lt;/ref&gt; Capsules from the General Post Office reached Newgate Street within 17 minutes, at speeds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph.

The Post Office made several trials of the system, but there were not substantial time savings to be made, and by 1874, the Post Office abandoned its use, and the company went into liquidation in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;''Mails under London'', L.C. Stanway. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Edinburgh Evening News reported in 1876 that the trucks containing the parcels continually stuck in the tunnels, and this was the reason for the failure of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Evening News - Monday 2 October 1876&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1921, an agreement was reached between the Pneumatic Despatch Company and the Postmaster General for the sale (for £7,500) of the remaining infrastructure of "the tube" to the Postmaster General. The agreement recognised that "the Company has not for many years past worked the tube and the same is not now in working order" and that various persons had made unauthorised breaches in the tube as originally constructed.  The agreement was confirmed by the Post Office (Pneumatic Tubes) Act 1922,&lt;ref&gt;12 &amp; 13 Geo. 5. Chapter 43.&lt;/ref&gt; which also repealed enactments from 1859, 1864 and 1872 authorising the company.

Two of the original vehicles survive, having been recovered in 1930, one in the [[Museum of London]] and the other in the [[National Railway Museum]] at York.

The '''M7 grenade launcher''', formally '''rifle grenade launcher, M7''', was a [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[rifle grenade]] launcher attachment for the [[M1 Garand]] rifle that saw widespread use throughout [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. The M7 was a tube-shaped device, with one end slotting over the barrel of the rifle, the other end holding the grenade in place. [[Blank (cartridge)|Blank cartridges]] were loaded into the rifle prior to firing. When fired, the expanding gases generated by the cartridges propelled the grenade forward with considerable force. The M7 could fire grenades up to {{convert|200|m|yd|abbr=off}}, compared with the maximum of {{convert|30|m|yd|abbr=off}} achieved by hand grenades.

Fragmentation, anti-armor and [[smoke grenades]] were available for the M7.

==Development==

When the United States entered World War II in 1941, all infantry were issued with the [[Mk 2 grenade|Mk 2]] [[hand grenade|fragmentation hand grenade]]. Owing to its hand-thrown nature, it had a range of only {{convert|35|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} and could not be used against armored targets. To keep its weight down, it had to have a small charge, with a fatality radius of just {{convert|6|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}. For longer ranges, rifle grenade attachments were available for the [[M1903 Springfield]] (M1 grenade launcher) and [[M1917 Enfield]] (M2 grenade launcher). These rifles were limited standard, however, and had been all but replaced by the new service rifle, the M1 Garand, by 1943. To rectify this, U.S. Army Ordnance designed a new launcher attachment for the M1 Garand, designated the M7, which could fire much heavier grenades up to 250 yards. M7 compatible fragmentation grenades had a fatality radius of {{convert|11|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="patton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Michael|title=Weapons of Patton's Armies|publisher=Zenith Imprint|year=2000|pages=35–36|isbn=0-7603-0821-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marines"&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Michael|author2=Stewart, Greg |title=Weapons of the Modern Marines|publisher=Zenith Imprint|year=2004|isbn=0-7603-1697-X|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entered production and service in 1943.&lt;ref name="patton"/&gt;

==Design details and employment==
[[File:M1 Garand rifgren-shooting line.jpg|thumb|An American soldier demonstrating the use of the M7 grenade launcher to fire a practice grenade with a wire or rope attached using his [[M1 Garand]].]]

The M7 grenade launcher was a tube-shaped device with an overall length (including the mounting bracket) of 7.5 inches. One end fitted onto the barrel of the M1 Garand rifle enclosing the [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]], and was held in place with the rifle's [[bayonet lug]]. The other end was cylindrical with a small clip that held the grenade in place by friction. To launch a grenade, a special high-powered [[Blank (cartridge)|cartridge]] made specifically for the purpose (the [[.30-06 Springfield]] M3 grenade cartridge) was chambered in the rifle. Using markings engraved onto the device to determine the desired range, the rifle grenade was slipped over the launcher. When fired, the resulting expanding gases propelled the grenade a considerable distance depending on the grenade type, the vertical angle that the rifle was held, and how far the grenade was positioned onto the launcher. Since the device disabled the [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] function of the rifle to prevent damage to the gun from firing grenades, the rifle could not be fired normally when the M7 launcher was in place; the gun could be fired in an emergency by cycling the action by hand. Fragmentation, anti-tank, and smoke grenades and pyrotechnic signals were available along with an adapter to enable the use of hand grenades.&lt;ref name="patton"/&gt; One to three M7 grenade launchers were issued to each rifle squad depending on period. It was also issued to support and headquarters elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayen|first=John|author2=Anderson, Duncan |title=US Army Infantry Divisions 1944-45|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2007|pages=10|isbn=1-84603-119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:M1 Garand grenade sight.jpg|thumb|M15 auxiliary sight on the left side an M1 Garand.]]
The M7 series grenade launcher came with accessories. The M15 auxiliary sight was mounted on the left-hand side of the stock accompanied by a template to allow it to be properly positioned on the stock. A spirit level allowed the user to figure out the arc of the weapon to aid in aiming the grenade. A rubber recoil boot (part No. B200968) could be slipped on the butt of the Garand's stock to reduce recoil when it was fired.

The M7 booster cartridge or "Vitamin Pill" could be inserted into the M7 grenade launcher's muzzle to increase its range by an additional 100 to 150 yards.&lt;ref name="WAR DEPARTMENT 1944, Page 41 &amp; 42"&gt;WAR DEPARTMENT, INFANTRY FIELD MANUAL § WEAPON AND AMMUNITION TECHNICAL MANUAL, INFANTRY REGIMENT, PARACHUTE, June 1944, Page 41 &amp; 42&lt;/ref&gt; These booster charges resembled a short .45 Colt blank cartridge, with a small hole in the base.&lt;ref name="WAR DEPARTMENT 1944, Page 41 &amp; 42"/&gt; When the blank cartridge was fired, its flame would travel up the rifle's barrel, ignite the booster charge, and propel the booster cartridge into the base of the rifle grenade.&lt;ref name="WAR DEPARTMENT 1944, Page 41 &amp; 42"/&gt; The booster cartridge would fall out of the rifle grenades tail fin assembly in flight.&lt;ref name="WAR DEPARTMENT 1944, Page 41 &amp; 42"/&gt;

The M8 grenade launcher was similar except it was designed to be mounted on the [[M1 carbine]] and used the [[.30 Carbine]] M6 grenade cartridge. Users of the M8 needed to be careful, as the recoil could crack or break the carbine's stock.

==Improved models==
*'''M7A1''' (Springfield Armory T95) [July, 1945 - 1951]: The major problem with the M7 grenade launcher is that it left the gas cylinder lock closed when attached, venting the cylinder. This meant the operator would have to cock the weapon to extract the spent cartridge and load a fresh one from the [[Clip (ammunition)#En bloc|en-bloc clip]]. The M7A1 incorporated a spring-loaded piston designed to keep the gas cylinder closed when loaded until the grenade was fired, but then opened to allow normal semi-automatic function. The spring-loaded launcher also recoiled when fired, preventing damage to the rifle. The M1 Garand design was modified to use a hardened gas cylinder lock (marked with an 'H', for "hardened") dubbed the "flat-edged lock" (ordnance part No. 7265959). This allowed prolonged use of the new launcher system.
*'''M7A2''' [July, 1951 - 1952]: The only problem with the M7A1 was that sometimes the launcher would get stuck when fired or the gas cylinder lock would break. This rendered the rifle and launcher useless and required repair by an armorer with special tools. The jamming problem was solved by using a heavier spring-loaded piston on the launcher and introduced a redesigned grenade retaining spring. The M1 Garand was then modified with a distinctive dual gas cylinder lock (marked with a 'M', for "modified") dubbed the "high hump lock" (ordnance part No. 7265871). The launcher had a mount machined into it to take a proposed leaf-sight that was never adopted.
*'''M7A3''' (ordnance part No. 7266167) [September, 1952 - 1961]: During the [[Korean War]], it was found that [[World War II]]-era anti-tank grenades were useless against the Soviet [[T-34]] tanks fielded by the North Korean Army. A new high-velocity anti-tank rifle grenade called the [[Mecar]] [[ENERGA anti-tank rifle grenade|ENERGA]] (dubbed the M28 in US Army service) was soon issued. However, its grenade launcher (dubbed the T119) had the same problems as the original M7 launcher and the M28 was inaccurate when launched from the M7A2. The M7A2 launcher was simply redesigned with a longer tube to fire the improved grenades and could be used with either the "flat edge" or "high hump" lock. After the war (from early 1956 to late 1959) it could be fitted with a leaf-sight that was calibrated for use with the M28. The M7A3 kit ( ordnance part No. 5750089) consisted of a M7A3 launcher packed with a "high hump" gas lock to allow the grenadier to upgrade an earlier model M1 Garand to the new specification.

Inserting a norator in a circuit schematic provides whatever current and voltage the outside circuit demands, in particular, the demands of [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]]. For example, the output of an ideal [[opamp]] behaves as a norator, producing nonzero output voltage and current that meet circuit requirements despite a zero input.

A norator is often paired with a [[nullator]] to form a [[nullor]].

Two trivial cases are worth noting: A nullator in parallel with a norator is equivalent to a short (zero voltage any current) and a nullator in series with a norator is an open circuit (zero current, any voltage).

'''OMA Device Management''' is a [[device management]] protocol specified by the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA) Device Management (DM) Working Group and the Data Synchronization (DS) Working Group.  The current approved specification of OMA DM is version 1.2.1, the latest modifications to this version released in June 2008.&lt;ref name="OMADM1.2.1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/technical/release_program/dm_v1_2.aspx | title = OMA Device Management V1.2 | publisher = [[Open Mobile Alliance]] | accessdate = 2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The candidate release 2.0 was scheduled to be finalized in September 2013.&lt;ref name="OMADM2.0"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/technical/release_program/dm_v2_0.aspx | title = OMA Device Management V2.0 | publisher = [[Open Mobile Alliance]] | accessdate = 2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
OMA DM specification is designed for management of [[mobile device]]s such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] computers.  Device management is intended to support the following uses:
* [[Provisioning]] – Configuration of the device (including first time use), enabling and disabling features
* Device Configuration – Allow changes to settings and parameters of the device
* [[FOTA (technology)|Software Upgrades]] – Provide for new software and/or bug fixes to be loaded on the device, including applications and system software
* [[Fault management|Fault Management]] – Report errors from the device, query about status of device

All of the above functions are supported by the OMA DM specification, and a device may optionally implement all or a subset of these features.  Since OMA DM specification is aimed at mobile devices, it is designed with sensitivity to the following:
* small footprint devices, where memory and storage space may be limited
* constraint on bandwidth of communication, such as in wireless connectivity
* tight security, as the devices are vulnerable to software attacks; authentication and challenges are made part of the specifications

==Technical description==
OMA DM was originally developed by [[The SyncML Initiative]] Ltd, an industry consortium formed by many mobile device manufacturers.   The SyncML Initiative got consolidated into the OMA umbrella as the scope and use of the specification was expanded to include many more devices and support global operation.

Technically, the OMA DM protocol uses [[XML]] for data exchange, more specifically the sub-set defined by [[SyncML]].  The device management takes place by communication between a server (which is managing the device) and the client (the device being managed).  OMA DM is designed to support and utilize any number of data transports such as:
* physically over both wireline ([[USB]], [[RS-232]]) and wireless media ([[GSM]], [[CDMA]], [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], or [[Bluetooth]])
* transport layers implemented over any of [[Wireless Session Protocol|WSP]] ([[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]), [[HTTP]], or [[OBEX]] or similar transports

The communication protocol is a request-response protocol.  Authentication and challenge of authentication are built-in to ensure the server and client are communicating only after proper validation.  The server and client are both stateful, meaning a specific sequence of messages are to be exchanged only after authentication is completed to perform any task.

The communication is initiated by the OMA DM server, asynchronously, using any of the methods available such as a [[Wap_push#WAP_Push|WAP Push]] or [[SMS]].  The initial message from server to client is said to be in the form of a notification, or alert message.

Once the communication is established between the server and client, a sequence of messages might be exchanged to complete a given device management task.  OMA DM does provide for alerts, which are messages that can occur out of sequence, and can be initiated by either server or client.  Such alerts are used to handle errors, abnormal terminations etc.

Several parameters relating to the communication such as the maximum message size can be negotiated between the server and client during the initiation of a session.  In order to transfer large objects, the protocol does allow for sending them in smaller chunks.

Error recovery based on timeouts are not specified completely, hence, different implementations could possibly differ (protocol is not fully specified relating to these, and seem to leave them open intentionally).

The protocol specifies exchange of Packages during a session, each package consisting of several messages, and each message in turn consisting of one or more commands.  The server initiates the commands and the client is expected to execute the commands and return the result via a reply message.

{{distinguish|Oceanographic Data Acquisition System}}
{{refimprove|date=September 2016}}
An '''ocean data acquisition system''' ('''ODAS''') is a set of instruments deployed at sea to collect as much [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] data as possible. With their sensors, these systems deliver data both on the state of the ocean itself and the surrounding lower atmosphere. The use of [[microelectronics]] and technologies with efficient energy consumption allows to increase the types and numbers of sensor deployed on a single device.

== Definition ==
According to [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] and [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO), "ODAS means a structure, platform, installation, buoy, or other device, not being a ship, together with its appurtenant equipment, deployed at sea essentially for the purpose of collecting, storing or transmitting samples or data relating to the marine environment or the atmosphere or the uses thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=ftp://ftp.wmo.int/Documents/PublicWeb/amp/mmop/documents/dbcp/Dbcp8/DBCP-08-Guide-Moored-Buoys.pdf |title=Guide to moored Buoys and other Ocean Data Acquisition Systems |first=A. |last=Meinl |series=DBCP Technical Document No. 8 |page=3 |year=1996 |publisher=[[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]], [[World Meteorological Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Each hour, the data gathered by the system is transferred to the WMO's [[Global Telecommunications System]] by a [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite after having gone through a number of quality checks.&lt;ref name="axystechnologies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://axystechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Advances-in-buoy-technology-for-wind-wave-data-collection-and-analysis.pdf |title=Advances in Buoy Technology for Wind/Wave Data Collection and Analysis |first=S. G. P. |last=Skey |first2=M. D. |last2=Miles |publisher=Axys Technologies |accessdate=30 September 2016}} {{better source|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time data with information on the maritime environment can then be used for forecasts of physical states like weather, ocean currents or wave conditions which, in turn, may serve to warn seafarers of unfavourable conditions in the area.

== ODAS types ==
[[File:NOAA-NDBC-discus-buoy.jpg|thumb|ODAS buoy connected to the United States [[National Data Buoy Center]]]]
ODAS can be mounted on the following structures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_oe&amp;task=viewDocumentRecord&amp;docID=446 |title=Platform Metadata Catalogue: ODAS Metadata |publisher=Joint WMO/IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) Expert Team on Marine Cimatology |date=26–27 March 2007 |conference=Second session}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lighthouse]]s
* [[Lightvessel]]s
* Towers
* [[Oil platform|Offshore platforms]]
* [[Buoy]]s

ODAS buoys are not [[navigational aid]]s but have been included into the [[International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities|IALA Maritime Buoyage System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iala-aism.org/wiki/dictionary/index.php/ODAS_buoy |title=ODAS buoy |work=International Dictionary of Marine Aids to Navigation |publisher=[[International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities]] |date=15 February 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structures have a fixed geographical position.

== Data ==
Data gathered by an ODAS may include the following parameters:
* Air temperature
* [[Atmospheric pressure]] at sea level
* Wind direction
* [[Wind speed]] including gusts
* [[Sea state]]
* [[Wave height]]
* [[Sea surface temperature]]

== Disadvantages ==
* ODAS buoys are expensive to obtain and need to be deployed by specialised vessels.

'''Payment order,''' in international banking, is a directive to a bank from a [[bank account]] holder instructing the bank to make a payment or series of payments to a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/payment-order.html|title=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Payment orders'' are post-contract instruments often used to pay fee agreements to agents and usually contain conditions for the payment to be met such as successful completion of contract requirements.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

''Payment orders'' with "conditions" should not be confused with "conditional payment orders". Conditional payment orders are pre-contract instruments consisting of a documented fee agreement between the beneficiary and the payer, proof of ability for the payer to pay which is often issued by [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|Swift]] MT799 to the recipient's bank, and occasionally may include bank instructions for the establishment of a payment order following contract execution.  Either payment orders or conditional payment orders are assumed to be irrevocable unless otherwise stated.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Payment orders with conditions may be established after signing of a contract and posting of a letter of credit or other financial instrument with the paying bank but are never put in place prior to contract execution because of the risk that the contract will not materialize.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Petroleum And Explosives Safety Organisation''' (PESO) is the department formed by [[Government of India]] to control and administer the usage of explosives, [[petrol stations in India]]. The agency issues licenses for Operation of Petrol Stations under Form XIV, Licenses to operate Petroleum Product Transportation vehicles, Licenses for Refineries, Petrochemical Complexes, etc. The Department is headed by Chief Controller of Explosives and is headquartered at [[Nagpur]] in the State of [[Maharashtra]] in [[India]]. The Northern Regional Office is based at [[Faridabad]] in the state of
[[Haryana]]. The agency has framed various rules like ''Petroleum Rules 2002'' for the safe operation of [[petrol station]]s, ''Explosive Rules 1983'', ''Gas Cylinder Rules 2002( applicable to all states)'', and ''Stative &amp; Mobile Pressure Vessels (Unfired) 1981'' for [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] Vessels. It functions under Department Of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).

'''The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO)''' with its headquarter at Nagpur and a network of 5 Circle offices, 18 Sub-circle offices and Central Testing Station has been continuing to serve the public and industry for over 100 years in all matters relating to safety in manufacture, storage, transport and handling of explosives, petroleum, compressed gases and other hazardous substances through comprehensive administration of Explosives Act, 1884, Petroleum Act, 1934, Inflammable Substances Act, 1952 and rules framed there under viz. Explosives Rules, 2008, Gas Cylinders Rules, 2004, Static &amp; Mobile Pressure Vessels (Unfired) Rules, 1981, Petroleum Rules, 2002, Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987 &amp; Cinematographic Films Rules, 1948.

A '''protein microarray''' (or '''protein chip''') is a [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput]] method used to track the interactions and activities of proteins, and to determine their function, and determining function on a large scale.&lt;ref name="Melton2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melton|first1=Lisa|title=Protein arrays:  Proteomics in multiplex|journal=Nature|volume=429|issue=6987|year=2004|pages=101–107|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/429101a|pmid=15129287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main advantage lies in the fact that large numbers of proteins can be tracked in parallel. The chip consists of a support surface such as a glass slide, nitrocellulose membrane, bead, or [[microtitre plate]], to which an array of capture proteins is bound.&lt;ref name="Schena200a5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Schena|title=Protein Microarrays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-q0EaVqjbAC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2005|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-3127-4|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hybridization probe|Probe]] molecules, typically labeled with a fluorescent dye, are added to the array.

==Motivation for development==
Protein microarrays were developed due to the limitations of using DNA microarrays for determining gene expression levels in [[proteomics]]. The quantity of [[mRNA]] in the cell often doesn't reflect the expression levels of the proteins they correspond to. Since it is usually the protein, rather than the mRNA, that has the functional role in cell response, a novel approach was needed. Additionally [[post-translational modifications]], which are often critical for determining protein function, are not visible on DNA microarrays.&lt;ref name="TalapatraRouse2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talapatra|first1=Anupam|last2=Rouse|first2=Richard|last3=Hardiman|first3=Gary|title=Protein microarrays: challenges and promises|journal=Pharmacogenomics|volume=3|issue=4|year=2002|pages=527–536|issn=1462-2416|doi=10.1517/14622416.3.4.527|pmid=12164775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein microarrays replace traditional proteomics techniques such as [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2D gel electrophoresis]] or [[chromatography]], which were time consuming, labor-intensive and ill-suited for the analysis of low abundant proteins.

==Making the array==
The proteins are arrayed onto a solid surface such as microscope slides, membranes, beads or microtitre plates. The function of this surface is to provide a support onto which proteins can be immobilized. It should demonstrate maximal binding properties, whilst maintaining the protein in its native conformation so that its binding ability is retained. Microscope slides made of glass or silicon are a popular choice since they are compatible with the easily obtained robotic arrayers and laser scanners that have been developed for DNA microarray technology.  [[Nitrocellulose slide|Nitrocellulose]] film slides are broadly accepted as the highest protein binding substrate for protein microarray applications.

The chosen solid surface is then covered with a coating that must serve the simultaneous functions of immobilising the protein, preventing its [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], orienting it in the appropriate direction so that its binding sites are accessible, and providing a [[hydrophilic]] environment in which the binding reaction can occur. In addition, it also needs to display minimal non-specific binding in order to minimize background noise in the detection systems. Furthermore, it needs to be compatible with different detection systems. Immobilising agents include layers of aluminium or gold, hydrophilic polymers, and [[Gel electrophoresis|polyacrylamide gels]], or treatment with [[amines]], [[aldehyde]] or [[epoxy]]. Thin-film technologies like [[physical vapour deposition]] (PVD) and [[chemical vapour deposition]] (CVD) are employed to apply the coating to the support surface.

An aqueous environment is essential at all stages of array manufacture and operation to prevent protein denaturation. Therefore, sample buffers contain a high percent of [[glycerol]] (to lower the freezing point), and the humidity of the manufacturing environment is carefully regulated. Microwells have the dual advantage of providing an aqueous environment while preventing cross-contamination between samples.

In the most common type of protein array, robots place large numbers of proteins or their [[ligands]] onto a coated solid support in a pre-defined pattern. This is known as robotic contact printing or robotic spotting. Another fabrication method is [[Inkjet printer|ink-jetting]], a drop-on-demand, non-contact method of dispersing the protein polymers onto the solid surface in the desired pattern.&lt;ref name="Calvert2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvert|first1=Paul|title=Inkjet Printing for Materials and Devices|journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=13|issue=10|year=2001|pages=3299–3305|issn=0897-4756|doi=10.1021/cm0101632}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric spotting]] is a similar method to ink-jet printing. The printhead moves across the array, and at each spot uses electric stimulation to deliver the protein molecules onto the surface via tiny jets. This is also a non-contact process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabidopsis.info/students/microarrays/techarrayconstruc.html |title=DNA Microarrays: Techniques |publisher=Arabidopsis.info |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828094957/http://arabidopsis.info/students/microarrays/techarrayconstruc.html |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photolithography]] is a fourth method of arraying the proteins onto the surface. Light is used in association with [[photomasks]], opaque plates with holes or transparencies that allow light to shine through in a defined pattern. A series of chemical treatments then enables deposition of the protein in the desired pattern upon the material underneath the photomask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shin|first1=DS|last2=Kim|first2=DH|last3=Chung|first3=WJ|last4=Lee|first4=YS|title=Combinatorial solid phase peptide synthesis and bioassays.|journal=Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|date=30 September 2005|volume=38|issue=5|pages=517–25|pmid=16202229|doi=10.5483/bmbrep.2005.38.5.517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capture molecules arrayed on the solid surface may be [[antibodies]], [[antigens]], [[aptamer]]s (nucleic acid-based ligands), [[Affibody molecule|affibodies]] (small molecules engineered to mimic monoclonal antibodies), or full length proteins. Sources of such proteins include cell-based expression systems for [[recombinant proteins]], purification from natural sources, production [[in vitro]] by [[Cell-free protein array|cell-free translation systems]], and synthetic methods for [[peptides]]. Many of these methods can be automated for high throughput production but care must be taken to avoid conditions of synthesis or extraction that result in a denatured protein which, since it no longer recognizes its binding partner, renders the array useless.

Proteins are highly sensitive to changes in their microenvironment. This presents a challenge in maintaining protein arrays in a stable condition over extended periods of time. [[In situ]] methods — invented and published by Mingyue He and Michael Taussig in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7674752 |status=patent |title=Functional protein arrays |pubdate=2004-08-15 |gdate=2010-03-10 |fdate=2003-05-13 |invent1=Mingyue He |invent2=Michael John Taussig |assign1=Discema Limited |class= Biochemical Method |url=https://patents.justia.com/patent/7674752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=M|last2=Taussig|first2=MJ|title=Single step generation of protein arrays from DNA by cell-free expression and in situ immobilisation (PISA method).|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=June 2001|volume=29|issue=15|pages=E73–3|pmid=11470888|pmc=55838|doi=10.1093/nar/29.15.e73}}&lt;/ref&gt; — involve on-chip synthesis of proteins as and when required, directly from the DNA using cell-free protein expression systems. Since DNA is a highly stable molecule it does not deteriorate over time and is therefore suited to long-term storage. This approach is also advantageous in that it circumvents the laborious and often costly processes of separate protein purification and [[DNA cloning]], since proteins are made and immobilised simultaneously in a single step on the chip surface. Examples of in situ techniques are PISA (protein in situ array), NAPPA (nucleic acid programmable protein array) and DAPA (DNA array to protein array).

==Types of arrays==
[[File:Protein arrays.svg|right|thumb|Types of protein arrays|506x506px]]
There are three types of protein microarrays that are currently used to study the biochemical activities of proteins.

Analytical microarrays are also known as capture arrays. In this technique, a library of antibodies, aptamers or affibodies is arrayed on the support surface. These are used as capture molecules since each binds specifically to a particular protein. The array is probed with a complex protein solution such as a [[cell lysate]]. Analysis of the resulting binding reactions using various detection systems can provide information about expression levels of particular proteins in the sample as well as measurements of binding affinities and specificities. This type of microarray is especially useful in comparing protein expression in different solutions. For instance the response of the cells to a particular factor can be identified by comparing the lysates of cells treated with specific substances or grown under certain conditions with the lysates of control cells. Another application is in the identification and profiling of diseased tissues.

[[Reverse phase protein lysate microarray|Reverse phase protein microarray]] (RPPA) involve complex samples, such as tissue lysates. Cells are isolated from various tissues of interest and are lysed. The lysate is arrayed onto the microarray and probed with antibodies against the target protein of interest. These antibodies are typically detected with [[chemiluminescent]], fluorescent or [[colorimetric]] assays. Reference peptides are printed on the slides to allow for protein quantification of the sample lysates. RPAs allow for the determination of the presence of altered proteins or other agents that may be the result of disease. Specifically, post-translational modifications, which are typically altered as a result of disease can be detected using RPAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1828913 | pmid=17126887 | doi=10.1016/j.mad.2006.11.021 | volume=128 | issue=1 | title=Protein microarray technology | year=2007 | journal=Mech. Ageing Dev. | pages=161–7 | last1 = Hall | first1 = DA | last2 = Ptacek | first2 = J | last3 = Snyder | first3 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional protein microarrays==

Functional protein microarrays (also known as target protein arrays) are constructed by immobilising large numbers of purified proteins and are used to identify protein–protein, protein–DNA, protein–[[RNA]], protein–[[phospholipid]], and protein–small-molecule interactions, to assay enzymatic activity and to detect antibodies and demonstrate their specificity. They differ from analytical arrays in that functional protein arrays are composed of arrays containing full-length functional proteins or protein domains. These protein chips are used to study the biochemical activities of the entire proteome in a single experiment.

The key element in any functional protein microarray-based assay is the arrayed proteins must retain their native structure, such that meaningful functional interactions can take place on the array surface.The advantages of controlling the precise mode of surface attachment through use of an appropriate affinity tag are that the immobilised proteins will have a homogenous orientation resulting in a higher specific activity and higher signal-to-noise ratio in assays, with less interference from non-specific interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koopmann|first1=JO|last2=Blackburn|first2=J|title=High affinity capture surface for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation compatible protein microarrays.|journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|date=2003|volume=17|issue=5|pages=455–62|doi=10.1002/rcm.928|pmid=12590394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=JM|last2=Shoko|first2=A|last3=Beeton-Kempen|first3=N|title=Miniaturized, microarray-based assays for chemical proteomic studies of protein function|date=2012|volume=800|pages=133–62|doi=10.1007/978-1-61779-349-3_10|pmid=21964787|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-61779-348-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
Protein array detection methods must give a high signal and a low background. The most common and widely used method for detection is fluorescence labeling which is highly sensitive, safe and compatible with readily available microarray laser scanners. Other labels can be used, such as affinity, photochemical or radioisotope tags. These labels are attached to the probe itself and can interfere with the probe-target protein reaction. Therefore, a number of label free detection methods are available, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), carbon nanotubes, carbon nanowire sensors (where detection occurs via changes in conductance) and microelectromechanical system (MEMS) cantilevers. All these label free detection methods are relatively new and are not yet suitable for high-throughput protein interaction detection; however, they do offer much promise for the future.

Protein quantitation on [[nitrocellulose slide|nitrocellulose coated glass slides]] can use near-IR fluorescent detection. This limits interferences due to auto-fluorescence of the nitrocellulose at the UV wavelengths used for standard fluorescent detection probes.&lt;ref name="WilliamsNarayanan1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Richard J.|last2=Narayanan|first2=Narasimhachari.|last3=Casay|first3=Guillermo A.|last4=Lipowska|first4=Malgorzata.|last5=Peralta|first5=Jose Mauro.|last6=Tsang|first6=Victor C.

==Applications==
There are five major areas where protein arrays are being applied: diagnostics, proteomics, protein functional analysis, antibody characterization, and treatment development.

Diagnostics involves the detection of antigens and antibodies in blood samples; the profiling of sera to discover new disease [[biomarkers]]; the monitoring of disease states and responses to therapy in personalized medicine; the monitoring of environment and food. Digital bioassay is an example of using protein microarray for diagnostic purposes. In this technology, an array of microwells on a glass/polymer chip are seeded with magnetic beads (coated with fluorescent tagged antibodies), subjected to targeted antigens and then characterised by a microscope through counting fluorescing wells. A cost-effective fabrication platform (using [[OSTE polymers]]) for such microwell arrays has been recently demonstrated and the bio-assay model system has been successfully characterised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/acsami.6b15415 | pmid=28266828 | volume=9 | issue=12 | title=Single-Step Imprinting of Femtoliter Microwell Arrays Allows Digital Bioassays with Attomolar Limit of Detection | year=2017 | journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces | pages=10418–10426 | last1 = Decrop | first1 = Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proteomics pertains to protein expression profiling i.e. which proteins are expressed in the lysate of a particular cell.

Protein functional analysis is the identification of protein–protein interactions (e.g. identification of members of a protein complex), protein–phospholipid interactions, small molecule targets, enzymatic [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s (particularly the substrates of [[kinases]]) and receptor ligands.

Antibody characterization is characterizing [[cross-reactivity]], specificity and mapping [[epitopes]].

Treatment development involves the development of antigen-specific therapies for [[autoimmunity]], cancer and allergies; the identification of small molecule targets that could potentially be used as new drugs.

==Challenges==
Despite the considerable investments made by several companies, proteins chips have yet to flood the market. Manufacturers have found that proteins are actually quite difficult to handle. Production of reliable, consistent, high-throughput proteins that are correctly folded and functional is fraught with difficulties as they often result in low-yield of proteins due to decreased solubility and formation of inclusion bodies.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} A protein chip requires a lot more steps in its creation than does a [[DNA chip]].

There are a number of approaches to this problem which differ fundamentally according to whether the proteins are immobilised through non-specific, poorly defined interactions, or through a specific set of known interactions. The former approach is attractive in its simplicity and is compatible with purified proteins derived from native or recombinant sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacBeath|first1=G|last2=Schreiber|first2=SL|title=Printing proteins as microarrays for high-throughput function determination|journal=Science|date=8 September 2000|volume=289|issue=5485|pages=1760–3|pmid=10976071|doi=10.1126/science.289.5485.1760|doi-broken-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angenendt|first1=P|last2=Glökler|first2=J|last3=Sobek|first3=J|last4=Lehrach|first4=H|last5=Cahill|first5=DJ|title=Next generation of protein microarray support materials: evaluation for protein and antibody microarray applications.|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|date=15 August 2003|volume=1009|issue=1–2|pages=97–104|pmid=13677649|doi=10.1016/s0021-9673(03)00769-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but suffers from a number of risks. Most notable amongst these relate to the uncontrolled nature of the interactions between each protein and the surface; at best, this might give rise to a heterogeneous population of proteins in which active sites are sometimes occluded by the surface; at worst, it might destroy activity altogether due to partial or complete surface-mediated unfolding of the immobilised protein.

Challenges include: 1) finding a surface and a method of attachment that allows the proteins to maintain their secondary or [[tertiary structure]] and thus their biological activity and their interactions with other molecules, 2) producing an array with a long shelf life so that the proteins on the chip do not denature over a short time, 3) identifying and isolating antibodies or other capture molecules against every protein in the human genome, 4) quantifying the levels of bound protein while assuring sensitivity and avoiding background noise, 5) extracting the detected protein from the chip in order to further analyze it, 6) reducing non-specific binding by the capture agents, 7) the capacity of the chip must be sufficient to allow as complete a representation of the proteome to be visualized as possible; abundant proteins overwhelm the detection of less abundant proteins such as signaling molecules and receptors, which are generally of more therapeutic interest.&lt;ref name="FungThulasiraman2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fung|first1=Eric T|last2=Thulasiraman|first2=Vanitha|last3=Weinberger|first3=Scot R|last4=Dalmasso|first4=Enrique A|title=Protein biochips for differential profiling|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=12|issue=1|year=2001|pages=65–69|issn=0958-1669|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(00)00167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''quantum vacuum thruster''' ('''QVT''' or '''Q-thruster''') is a theoretical system that uses the same principles and equations of motion that a conventional [[Plasma propulsion engine|plasma thruster]] would use, namely [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD), to make predictions about the behavior of the propellant. However, rather than using a conventional plasma as a propellant, a QVT uses the [[quantum vacuum fluctuations]] of the [[Zero-point energy|zero-point field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Harold|last2=March|first2=Paul|last3=Lawrence|first3=James|last4=Vera|first4=Jerry|last5=Sylvester|first5=Andre|last6=Brady|first6=David|last7=Bailey|first7=Paul|title=Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|volume=33|issue=4|date=2016|doi=10.2514/1.B36120|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.B36120|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joosten ;|first1=B.

It would also allow for much higher specific impulses for QVT systems compared to other spacecraft as they would be limited only by their power supply’s energy storage densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=H.|last2=March|first2=P.|title=Advanced Propulsion Physics: Harnessing the Quantum Vacuum|journal=Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space|date=2012|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/nets2012/pdf/3082.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold G. White|Harold White's]] [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory]] (NASA Eagleworks) suggests that their [[RF resonant cavity thruster|RF cavity]] may be an example of a quantum vacuum thruster (QVT or Q-thruster).

== History and controversy ==
The name and concept is controversial.  In 2008, Yu Zhu and others at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University claimed to measure thrust from such a thruster, but called it a "microwave thruster without propellant" working on quantum principles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 2011 it was mentioned as something to be studied by [[Harold G. White]] and his team at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA]]'s [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory|Eagleworks]] Laboratories,&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt; who were working with a prototype of such a thruster.  Other physicists, such as [[Sean M. Carroll]] and [[John Baez]], dismiss it because the quantum vacuum as currently understood is not a plasma and does not possess plasma-like characteristics.

==Theory of operation==
[[File:EmDrive built by Eagleworks inside the test chamber.jpg|thumb|Prototype resonant cavity thruster built by [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory|NASA Eagleworks]]]]

A vacuum can be viewed not as empty space but as the combination of all [[Zero-point energy|zero-point fields]]. According to [[quantum field theory]] the universe is made up of matter fields whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (e.g. [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (i.e. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have some intrinsic [[zero-point energy]].&lt;ref name="Academic Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milonni|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter W. Milonni|title=The Quantum Vacuum: An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics|date=1994|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=9780124980808|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPHJCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Describing the quantum vacuum, a ''[[Physics Today]]'' article cited by the NASA team describes this ensemble of fields as "''a turbulent sea, roiling with waves associated with a panoply of force-mediating fields such as the photon and Higgs fields''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bush|first1=John W.

[[Virtual particles]] spontaneously flash into existence and annihilate each other at every point in space due to the energy of [[quantum fluctuations]]. Many real physical effects attributed to these vacuum fluctuations have been experimentally verified, such as [[spontaneous emission]], [[Casimir force]], [[Lamb shift]], [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the electron]] and [[Delbrück scattering]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milonni|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter W.

The [[Casimir effect]] is a weak force between two uncharged conductive plates caused by the [[zero-point energy]] of the vacuum.

A QVT system seeks to make use of this predicted Casimir-like momentum transfer.

=== Controversy and criticism ===
Some notable physicists have found the Q-thruster concept to be implausible. For example, mathematical physicist [[John Baez]] has criticized the reference to "quantum vacuum virtual plasma" noting that: "There's no such thing as 'virtual plasma' ".&lt;ref&gt;https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/WfFtJ8bYVya&lt;/ref&gt; Noted Caltech theoretical physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] has also affirmed this statement, writing "[t]here is no such thing as a ‘quantum vacuum virtual plasma,’...".&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/08/06/nasa-validate-imposible-space-drive-word/#.VCYphStdU3c&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lafleur found that [[quantum field theory]] predicts no net force, implying that the measured thrusts are unlikely to be due to quantum effects. However, Lafleur noted that this conclusion was based on the assumption that the electric and magnetic fields were homogeneous, whereas certain theories posit a small net force in inhomogeneous vacuums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1411.5359 |title=Can the quantum vacuum be used as a reaction medium to generate thrust? |date=2014-11-19 |last1=Lafleur |first1=Trevor |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, the violation of energy and momentum conservation laws have been heavily criticized. In a presentation at Nasa Ames Research Centre in November 2014, Harold White addressed the issue of conservation of momentum by stating that the Q-thruster conserves momentum by creating a wake or anisotropic state in the quantum vacuum. White indicated that once false positives were ruled out, Eagleworks would explore the momentum distribution and divergence angle of the quantum vacuum wake using a second Q-thruster to measure the quantum vacuum wake.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wokn7crjBbA&lt;/ref&gt; In a paper published in January 2014, White proposed to address the conservation of momentum issue by stating that the Q-thruster pushes quantum particles (electrons/positrons) in one direction, whereas the Q-thruster recoils to conserve momentum in the other direction. White stated that this   principle  was similar to how a submarine uses its propeller to push water in one direction, while the submarine recoils to conserve momentum.&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140013174.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the violations of fundamental laws of physics can be avoided.

=== Other hypothesized quantum vacuum thrusters ===
A number of physicists have suggested that a spacecraft or object may generate thrust through its interaction with the quantum vacuum. For example, Fabrizio Pinto in a 2006 paper published in the ''[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]'' noted it may be possible to bring a cluster of polarisable vacuum particles to a hover in the laboratory and then to transfer thrust to a macroscopic accelerating vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2006.59.247 |title=Progress in Quantum Vacuum Engineering Propulsion |publisher=JBIS |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Jordan Maclay in a 2004 paper titled "A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum (Dynamic Casimir Effect)" published in the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' noted that it is possible to accelerate a spacecraft based on the dynamic [[Casimir effect]], in which [[electromagnetic radiation]] is emitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum (Dynamic Casimir Effect) |journal=Foundations of Physics  |volume=34  |issue=3  |pages=477–500  |date=2004-03-01  |arxiv=physics/0303108 |bibcode=2004FoPh...34..477M  |author1=MacLay  |first1=G.

E. |last2= Little |first2=S. R. |bibcode = 2010arXiv1012.5264P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, researcher Yoshinari Minami in a 2008 paper titled "Preliminary Theoretical Considerations for Getting Thrust via Squeezed Vacuum" published in the ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'' noted the theoretical possibility of extracting thrust from the excited vacuum induced by controlling squeezed light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2008.61.315 |title=Preliminary Theorectical Considerations for Getting Thrust via Squeezed Vacuum |publisher=JBIS |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Alexander Feigel in a 2009 paper noted that propulsion in [[quantum vacuum]] may be achieved by rotating or aggregating magneto-electric [[nano-particle]]s in strong perpendicular electrical and magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0912.1031 |title=A magneto-electric quantum wheel |date=2009-12-05 |last1=Feigel |first1=Alexander |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Puthoff,&lt;ref name=Puthoff/&gt; although this method can produce angular momentum causing a static disk (known as a Feynman disk) to begin to rotate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v285/n5761/abs/285154a0.html |title=Observation of static electromagnetic angular momentum in vacua |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09 |volume=285 |issue=5761 |doi=10.1038/285154a0 |journal=Nature |pages=154–155|bibcode=1980Natur.285..154G |year=1980 |last1=Graham |first1=G.

The Eagleworks team has theorized that this device is a Q-thruster.&lt;ref name="Warp Field Physics 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Harold|title=Eagleworks Laboratories: Warp Field Physics|journal=Nasa Technical Reports Server (NTRS)|date=2013|volume=20140000851|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140000851.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thruster consists of a set of circular dielectrics sandwiched between electrodes; its inventor describes it device as producing thrust through a preselected shaping of an electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Propulsion device and method employing electric fields for producing thrust|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6492784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitec Inc. alleges that in 2011 they tested the "asymmetrical capacitor" device in a high vacuum several times and have ruled out ion wind or electrostatic forces as an explanation for the thrust produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gravitec Inc.

The magnitude of the thrust scaled approximately with the cube of the input voltage (20–110&amp;nbsp;μN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eagleworks Newsletter 2013|url=https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/86787010/513081407/name/Eagleworks+Newsletter+2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the researchers have not published a peer-reviewed paper detailing the results of this experiment.

Using a [[torsion pendulum]], [[Harold G. White (NASA)|White's]] team claimed to have measured 30–50 ''μ''N of thrust from a [[Microwave cavity|microwave cavity resonator]] designed by Guido Fetta in an attempt at propellant-less propulsion. Using the same measurement equipment, a non-zero force was also measured on a "null" resonator that was not designed to experience any such force, which they suggest hints at "interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anomalous Thrust Production from an RF Test Device Measured on a Low-Thrust Torsion Pendulum |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140006052.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; All measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure, presumably in contact with air, and with no analysis of systematic errors, except for the use of an RF load without the resonant cavity interior as a control device.&lt;ref&gt;http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2014-4029&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Paul March from that team made new results public, claiming positive experimental force measurements with a torsional pendulum in a hard vacuum: about 50&amp;nbsp;µN with 50 W of input power at 5.0×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]], and new null-thrust tests.&lt;ref name="NBF_20150206"&gt;{{cite web

Yu Zhu previously claimed to have measured anomalous thrust arising from a similar device, using power levels roughly 100 times greater, and measuring thrust roughly 1000 times greater.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Performance Analysis of Microwave Thrust without Propellant Based on the Quantum Theory|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-YHXB200805027.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodward Effect Results.png|thumb|right|Plot diagram of the 2006 [[Woodward effect]] test results]]
As of 2015, Eagleworks is attempting to gather performance data to support the development of a Q-thruster engineering prototype for [[reaction control system|reaction-control-system]] applications in the force range of 0.1–1 N with a corresponding input electrical power range of 0.3–3&amp;nbsp;kW. The group plans to begin by testing a refurbished test article to improve the historical performance of a 2006 experiment that attempted to demonstrate the [[Woodward effect]]. The photograph shows the test article and the plot diagram shows the thrust trace from a 500g load cell in experiments performed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=March|first1=P.|last2=Palfreyman|first2=A.|title=The Woodward Effect: Math Modeling and Continued Experimental Verifications at 2 to 4 MHz| journal=Proceedings of Space Technology and Applications International Forum (STAIF)|volume=813|pages=1321|year=2006|editor=M.

The group hopes that testing the device on a high-fidelity torsion pendulum (1–4&amp;nbsp;μN at 10–40 W) will unambiguously demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. The team is maintaining a dialogue with the [[International Space Station|ISS national labs office]] for an on-orbit [[International Space Station#Scientific research|detailed test objective]] (DTO) to test the Q-thrusters operation in the vacuum and weightlessness of outer space.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110023492_2011024705.pdf|title=Eagleworks Laboratories: Advanced Propulsion Physics Research|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4194">'''Real-time data''' ('''RTD''') is information that is delivered immediately after collection. There is no delay in the timeliness of the information provided. Real-time data is often used for navigation or tracking.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, T. and Sommer, S. eds. ''[http://store.esri.com/esri/showdetl.cfm?SID=2&amp;Product_ID=868&amp;Category_ID=49 A to Z GIS]''&lt;/ref&gt; Such data is usually [[data processing|processed]] using [[real-time computing]] although it can also be stored for later or off-line [[data analysis]].

Real-time data is not the same as [[dynamic data]]. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time).

==In economics==
Real-time economic data, and other [[official statistics]], are often based on preliminary estimates, and therefore are frequently adjusted as better estimates become available. These later adjusted data are called "[[Official statistics#Data revision|revised data]]". 
The terms real-time economic data and real-time economic analysis were coined&lt;ref&gt;Dean Croushore (2011), '[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.49.1.72 Frontiers of Real-Time Data Analysis]'. ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 49 (1), pp. 72-100.&lt;/ref&gt; by Francis
X. Diebold and Glenn D. Rudebusch.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Diebold and Glenn D. Rudebusch (1991),
'Forecasting Output with the Composite Leading Index: A Real-Time Analysis'. ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'' 86 (415), pp. 603–10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macroeconomics|Macroeconomist]] Glenn D. Rudebusch defined real-time analysis as 'the use of sequential information sets that were actually available as history unfolded.'&lt;ref&gt;Glenn D. Rudebusch (2002), '[http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/grudebusch/Rudebusch_EJ2002.pdf  Assessing Nominal Income Rules for Monetary Policy with Model and Data Uncertainty]'. ''Economic Journal'' 112 (479), pp. 402–32&lt;/ref&gt;  Macroeconomist [[Athanasios Orphanides]] has argued that economic policy rules may have very different effects when based on error-prone real-time data (as they inevitably are in reality) than they would if policy makers followed the same rules but had more accurate data available.&lt;ref&gt;A. Orphanides and J.C. Williams (2006), '[http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/fipfedgfe/2005-51.htm Monetary Policy under Imperfect Knowledge]'. ''Journal of the European Economic Association'' 4 (2-3), pp. 366-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to better understand the accuracy of economic data and its effects on economic decisions, some economic organizations, such as the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] and the Euro-Area Business Cycle Network (EABCN), have made databases available that contain both real-time data and subsequent revised estimates of the same data.

==In auctions==
[[Real-time bidding]] is programmatic real-time auctions that sell digital-ad impressions. Entities on both the buying and selling sides require almost instantaneous access to data in order to make decisions, forcing real-time data to the forefront of their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, A. [http://econsultancy.com/blog/64088-publishers-embrace-real-time-bidding-as-data-takes-centre-stage-new-report, Publishers embrace real-time bidding as data takes centre stage: new report], 8 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; To support these needs, new strategies and technologies, such [[Druid (open-source data store)|Druid]] have arisen and are quickly evolving.&lt;ref&gt;Lorica, B.

==Platform technologies==
Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary [[microRNA]] extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process.&lt;ref&gt;"Other News To Note," ''Bioworld Today'', April 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin
Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Ford Hospital and Rosetta Genomics To Develop MicroRNA-based Diagnostics For Brain Cancer," ''Company Reports'', January 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.&lt;ref&gt;"Nanogen, Inc. Licenses MGB Probe Technology To Rosetta Genomics, Ltd.," ''Reuters Significant Developments'', December
11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs &lt;ref&gt;"Rosetta and Rockefeller Enter MicroRNA Agreement," ''Datamonitor News and Comment'', June 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.

==Licenses and collaborations==
In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the [[Henry Ford Health System]] in Detroit, Michigan to develop [[microRNA]]-based diagnostics and prognostics for [[brain cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Business Diary: Acquisitions," ''Crain's Detroit Business'', February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' [[PCR]] technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fdanews.com/newsletter/article?articleId=102868&amp;issueId=11189 "Rosetta Genomics Licenses Roche PCR Technology", ''FDAnews Device Daily Bulletin'', January 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with [[New York University]] Medical
Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for [[melanoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, Jay. "Rosetta Genomics, Ltd--ROSG: To Work In Collaboration With NYU Medical Center," ''Knobias'', September 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced [[Columbia University Medical Center]] would utilize its [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]] (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.&lt;ref&gt;"Rosetta Genomics Ltd. Signs Agreement With Columbia University Medical center,"
''Reuters'', May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop [[antisense drugs]] that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.&lt;ref&gt;"Isis, Rosetta Join On Cancer Treatment,"
''Associated Press'', February 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2183">The '''SCR-203''' was a [[U.S. Army]] [[radio]] [[transceiver]] used during [[World War II]] and designed to be mounted on an animal [[pack saddle]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SCR-203 radio.jpg|thumb|250px|title|SCR-203 pack radio 1943]] --&gt;

==Specifications==
The SCR-203 was a low power, short range, portable command set designed to clamp onto a Phillips pack saddle for animal-pack transportation and operation. It was used primarily by the [[cavalry]], and [[field artillery]]. It consisted of the BC-228 transmitter, the BC-227 receiver, and BC-235 control box and could transmit 7.5 [[watt]]s [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] voice, [[Modulated continuous wave|MCW]], or [[Continuous wave|CW]] for a range of approximately 30 [[miles]]. Its [[radio frequency]] coverage was approximately 2.0 to 3.0 [[Mhz]]. The unit was powered by various battery packs and a GN-35 hand cranked [[wiktionary:Generator|generator]] and used a 25&amp;nbsp;ft whip [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].

==History==
The [[mule]]-packed radio concept dates back to before [[World War I]], but due to the decline of the Horse Cavalry and the miniaturization of radio components, the SCR-203 was the last of the U.S. Army's radio sets designed to be animal-mounted. The SCR-203 was replaced by the [[SCR-245]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9719">'''Sidney Leavitt Pressey''' ([[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], December 28, 1888 &amp;ndash; July 1, 1979) was Professor of [[Psychology]] at [[Ohio State University]] for many years. He is famous for having invented a [[teaching machine]] many years before the idea became popular. 

:"The first.. [teaching machine] was developed by Sidney L. Pressey... While originally developed as a self-scoring machine... [it] demonstrated its ability to actually teach".&lt;ref name=H&amp;B&gt;Hilgard E.R. &amp; Bower G.H. 1966. ''Theories of learning''. 3rd ed, New York:Appleton-Century-Crofts. Chapter 16: Learning &amp; the technology of instruction, 554{{ndash}}561 Programmed learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressey joined Ohio State in 1921, and stayed there until he retired in 1959. He continued publishing after retirement, with 18 papers between 1959 and 1967.&lt;ref name=Lorin&gt;Anderson, Lorin W. 2002. Pressey, Sidney L. (1888–1979). In ''Encyclopedia of Education''. [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403200497.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He was  a [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]] who "rejected a view of learning as an accumulation of responses governed by environmental stimuli in favor of one governed by meaning, intention, and purpose".&lt;ref name=Lorin/&gt; In fact, he had been a cognitive psychologist his entire life, well before the "mythical birthday of the cognitive revolution in psychology".&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, Jerome S. 1992. Another look at New Look 1. ''American Psychologist''. '''47''', 780–783.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 'teaching machine' ==
Pressey's idea started as a machine for administering [[multiple-choice]] questions (MCQs) to students. MCQs were (and are still) a basic method for testing students in the United States. Pressey's machine had a window with a question and four answers. The student pressed the key  to the chosen answer. The machine recorded the answer on a counter to the back of the machine, and showed the next question. 

The great idea was to fix the machine so that it would not move on until the student chose the right answer. Then it was easy to show that this second arrangement taught the students which were the right answers. This was the first demonstration that a machine could teach, and also a demonstration that [[knowledge of results]] was the cause of the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1926. A simple apparatus which gives tests and scores {{ndash}} and teaches. ''School and Society'', '''23''' (586), 373–376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1927. A machine for automatic teaching of drill material. ''School and Society'', '''25''' (645), 549–552.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1932. A third and fourth contribution toward the coming "industrial revolution" in education. ''School and Society'', '''36''' (934), 668–672.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of feedback to the learner is basic: it just tells the learner whether they are right or not. Later work on other kinds of learning material showed that even better results were got when the feedback contained more explanatory material.&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1965. Experimental results on instructional devices and materials. In Glaser R. (ed) ''Training research and education''. New York: Wiley, especially 258–266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annett J. 1964. The role of knowledge of results in learning: a survey. In ''Educational Technology'', De Cecco (ed), Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressey continued to improve his devices after [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;Pressey 1950. Development and appraisal of devices providing immediate automatic scoring of objective tests and concomitant self instruction. ''Journal of Psychology'', '''29''', 417–447.&lt;/ref&gt; and the papers of Pressey and his colleagues are reprinted in a leading sourcebook.&lt;ref name=TMPL/&gt;

A number of reviews credit Pressey with being the originator of teaching machines, and of important aspects of [[programmed learning]]. This was long before the better known efforts of [[B.F. Skinner]].&lt;ref name=Lums&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1963. Instruments and media of instruction. In N.L. Gage (ed) ''Handbook of research on teaching''. Chicago: AERA and Rand McNally, 592 (auto-instructional methods), 620 (differential feedback).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMPL&gt;Lumsdaine A.A &amp; Glaser R. (eds) 1960. ''Teaching machines and programmed learning: a source book''. Washington D.C. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowder N. 1959. Automatic tutoring by means of intrinsic programming. In Galanter E.H. (ed) ''Automatic teaching: the state of the art''. New York: Wiley, 109–116.&lt;/ref&gt; The review by Klaus gave a special appreciation of Pressey and his work.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus D.J. 1965. Analysis of programming techniques. In Glaser R. (ed) ''Teaching machines and programmed learning II: data and directions''. Washington D.C. Department of Audiovisual Instruction, National Education Association, 144–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner, who was responsible for bringing the whole subject into popular view, acknowledged Pressey's work in his 1958 paper on teaching machines.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner B.F. 1958. Teaching machines. ''Science'' '''128''', 969–977, reprinted in Skinner 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner B.F. 1965. ''The technology of teaching''. Appleton-Century-Croft. Includes reprints of Skinner's earlier papers on programmed learning, and discusses the limitations of classroom teaching in several places, such as chapter 5 Why teachers fail, and chapter 10 A review of teaching.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressey's own term was "adjunct autoinstruction". He thought it important to follow learning by questions "to enhance the clarity and stability of cognitive structure by correcting misapprehensions, and deferring the instruction of new matter until there had been such clarification and elucidation".&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1951. Teaching machines (and learning theory) crisis. ''J. Applied Psychology'' '''47''', 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The topic itself might be programmed, or it might not.&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1964. Auto elucidation without programming. ''NSPI Journal'' '''3''', 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pressey's major textbook ==
Pressey's major textbook ''Psychology and the new education'', 1937 and 1944,&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1933. ''Psychology and the new education''. Harper, and Pressey S.L. &amp; Robinson F.P. 1944. ''Psychology and the new education''. Revised edition, Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;
is a prototypical cognitive text for student teachers. He writes (p369) of a diagnostic attack on teaching problems:
:"For example, analysis of error, and remedial work based on the analysis, was found to improve greatly the mastery of algebra.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker G.E. 1932. An evaluation of remedial teaching in algebra. ''Educational Trends'' '''1''', 29–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In another experiment, individualization and diagnosis caused great improvement, as shown by actual performance, in the mastery of vocational agriculture".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts R.W. 1932. A further study in individualized instruction. ''Journal of educational research''. '''25''', 261–266.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pressey goes on to quote more published examples, and gives the data from some of these studies. The whole of chapter 10, The nature and control of the learning process, is directly relevant to the ideas of programmed learning which developed after [[World War II]] in the [[United States]].

Pressey's whole approach to educational psychology ran in opposition to the influence of [[B.F. Skinner]] and the behaviorists, as this quotation illustrates:
:"The archvillain, leading so many people astray, is declared to be learning theory! No less a charge is made than that the whole trend of American research and theory as regards learning has been based on a false premise{{mdash}}that the important features of human learning are to be found in animals. Instead, the all-important fact is that humans have transcended animal learning. Language, number, such skills as silent reading, make possible facilitations of learning, and kinds of learning, impossible even for the apes, Autoinstruction should enhance such potentials. Instead, current animal derived procedures in autoinstruction destroy meaningful structure to present material serially in programs, and replace processes of cognitive clarification and largely rote [[reinforcement]]s of bit learnings".&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1963. Autopresentation vs. autoelucidation. ''Programmed instruction'' '''2''', 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slickline''' refers to a single strand wire which is used to run tools into wellbore for several purposes. It is used in the oil and gas industry, but also describes that niche of the industry that involves using a slickline truck or doing a slickline job.

Slickline looks like a long, smooth, unbraided wire, often shiny, silver/chrome in appearance. It comes in varying lengths, according to the depth of wells in the area it is used (it can be ordered to specification) up to 35,000 feet in length. It is used to lower and raise downhole tools used in oil and gas well maintenance to the appropriate depth of the drilled well. In use and appearance it is connected by the drum it is spooled off of in the back of the slickline truck to the wireline [[sheave]] a round wheel grooved and sized to accept a specified line and positioned to redirect the line to another sheave that will allow  the slickline to enter the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/wireline-sheave-wheels/&lt;/ref&gt; Slickline is used to lower downhole tools into an oil or gas well to perform a specified maintenance job downhole. Downhole refers to the area in the pipe below surface, the pipe being either the casing cemented in the hole by the drilling rig (which keeps the drilled hole from caving in and pressure from the various oil or gas zones downhole from feeding into one another) or the tubing, a smaller diameter pipe hung inside the casing.

==Uses==
Slickline is more commonly used in production tubing. The wireline operator monitors at surface the slickline tension via a weight indicator gauge and the depth via a depth counter 'zeroed' from surface, lowers the downhole tool to the proper depth, completes the job by manipulating the downhole tool mechanically, checks to make sure it worked if possible, and pulls the tool back out by winding the slickline back onto the drum it was spooled from. The slickline drum is controlled by a hydraulic pump, which in turn is controlled by the 'slickline operator'.

Slickline comes in different sizes and grades. The larger the size, and higher the grade, generally means the higher line tension can be pulled before the line snaps at the weakest spot and causes a costly 'fishing' job. Due to downhole tools getting stuck because of malfunctions or 'downhole conditions' including sand, scale, salt, asphaltenes, and other well byproducts settling or loosening off the pipe walls because of agitation either by the downhole tools or a change in downhole inflow, sometimes it is necessary to pull hard on the tools to bring them back uphole to surface. If the tools are stuck, and the operator pulls too hard, the line will snap or pull apart at the weakest spot, which is generally closer to surface as the further uphole the weak point in the line is, the more weight it has to support (the weight of the line).

Weak spots in the line can be caused by making the circle around the counter wheel, making a bend around a sheave, a kink in a line from normal use (when rigging up the equipment extra line must be pulled out from the truck to give enough slack when the pressure control lubricator is picked up - this leaves line coiled on the often rutted ground, and sometimes it snags and kinks the line).

When the slickline parts, this can create an expensive 'fishing' job. It is called fishing because you often have to try different 'fishing' tools until you get a 'bite', then you have to work the original tools downhole free, or cut off the slickline where they join the tools downhole so that you can pull the broken slickline back to surface and out of the way, in order to fish the stuck toolstring. Because of the downtime involved in 'fishing', meaning not being able to flow the oil/gas well, the client is losing money by lack of production and also the cost of the slickline unit to fish, and the cost of what is left in the hole if it is not fished out (in the oil/gas industry, if the cause of the fishing job was not the fault of the slickline company, the oil/gas company is usually responsible to pay for it, and it can be very expensive).

Slickline was originally called measuring line, because the line was flat like a tape measure, and marked with depth increments so the operators would know how deep in the hole they were. This probably changed because the flat measuring line wasn't as strong as the modern slickline, and separate depth counters were developed.
It is advantageous to keep the diameter of the wire as small as possible for the following reasons:

* It reduces the load of its own weight.
* It can be run over smaller diameter sheaves, and wound on smaller diameter spools or reels without overstressing by bending (where the wire bends makes it weaker. Where it makes a complete circle, such as a counter wheel, makes it weaker yet).
* It keeps the reel drum size to a minimum (which reduces the area needed in the back of the slickline unit to house the drum and hydraulic pump, reducing weight and leaving more room for the other specialized equipment needed for slickline operations).
* It provides a small cross-section area for operation under pressure.

The disadvantage of a smaller diameter slickline is the lower strength. Depth and the nature of the job (a tool that must be pulled hard or might be stuck) will affect what slickline truck (different trucks specialize in different sizes of line) used.

The sizes of solid wireline in most common uses are: 0.092", 0.108", 0.125", 0.140", 0.150", and 0.160" in diameter, and are obtainable from the wire-drawing mills in one-piece standard lengths of 18,000, 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000 foot lengths. Other diameters and lengths are usually available on request from the suppliers, with the largest size currently available at 0.188".

==Mechanical and Hydraulic Jars==
Slickline tools operate with a mechanical action, controlled from surface in the wireline trucks operators compartment. Typically, this mechanical action is accomplished by the operation of jars. There are generally two types of jars; mechanical and hydraulic.

Mechanical jars look like a long, tubular piece of machined metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' depends on how much sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.

Hydraulic jars for slickline are generally meant to jar up only, because not enough sinker bar is able to feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the downhole tools. Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force on the top of the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by threaded connection to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the downhole tools. Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that [[hydraulic fluid]] has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range.

Generally once he hits that range on his weight indicator, he waits while the jars open to the less restricted point, whereupon the sinker bar travels upwards rapidly, providing an upwards hit on the downhole tools. The jars can then be 'reset' by lowering the line until the weight of the sinker bar closes, or pushes the inner mandrel of the hydraulic jars back to the starting position. Because the hydraulic jars are designed to provide a wait time to allow the operator to get up to the desired line tension, they can provide a very effective upwards hit.

Mechanical jar and hydraulic jar hitting power is affected by the length of the jars (the longer the length, they faster they can travel before they stop), the mass of the weight above them (the more the mass, the harder they will hit), and the tension of the line pulling on them.

Some completion components may be deployed and retrieved on slickline such as wireline retrievable [[Downhole safety valve|safety valves]], battery powered downhole gauges, perforating, placing explosively set bridge plugs, and placing or retrieving [[gas lift]] valves.  Slickline can also be used for fishing, the process of trying to retrieve other equipment and wire, which has been dropped down the hole.

==Applications==
The most common applications for slickline are:

* Tagging T.D. (Total Depth, which is the furthest depth possible down the wellbore)
* Gauge Ring runs (which is running a special sized downhole tool called a gauge ring, which comes in various pre-machined diameters, designed to ensure the pipe is clear to a certain point)
*Tubing Broach / Plunger Installations (a tubing broach looks like an aggressive, tubular file, available in different diameters, used for removing burrs and crimps in the inside of tubing and casing in oil and gas wells)[[File:Slickline_Tubing_Broach.jpg|thumb|right|Tubing Broach]]
* Bailing sand and debris (removing formation sand/rock and other such debris left over from the drilling and completion of the well, using a specialized tool called a bailer. This tool uses either a Chinese water pump type stroke action or a hydrostatic vacuum action to suction up the downhole debris, allowing it to be conveyed back to surface via the wireline)
* Shifting sleeves (formations downhole can be isolated behind sliding metal 'windows' called sliding sleeves. They are shifted open or closed by means of a specialized shifting tool locating the sleeve and it being jarred up or down, providing access or closing off that formation or section of casing)
* Setting / Pulling plugs and chokes (specialized downhole tools which either lock into pre-machined restrictions in the tubing, or which lock into the tubing itself, sealing pressure from below or above the plug)
* Setting / Pulling gas lift valves
* Running tailpipes (tubing extensions where the tubing is not landed close enough to the formation perforations in the casing)
* Bottom hole pressure  and temperature surveys (specialized electronic and mechanical tools designed to measure the pressure and temperature at predetermined depths in the wellbore. This data can be used to determine reservoir life)
* Spinner Surveys (to determine which formation perforations have the best inflow / which perforations make the most water / liquids)
* Kinley perforator, sandline cutter, and caliper
* Running production logging tools
* Fishing operations (fishing usually refers to attempting to retrieve lost tools or wire, or other debris that was not intended to restrict the flow / disrupt the well operations. Fishing can be difficult, due the fish being downhole, and other affecting conditions such as high pressure, the fish being jammed in the tubing / casing)
* Paraffin cutting (making a hole through and removing a wax buildup, which is a byproduct of oil cooling too much to reach surface)
* Chipping ice / salt (restrictions and plugs which can be formed as by products of a flowing well)
* Lubricating long assemblies in and out of the hole (lubricating is done via a larger than tool overall diameter pipe, joined at surface on top of the wellhead, which houses the valve that shuts the pressure in downhole. The lubricator should be long enough to be able to swallow the toolstring and downhole tools that are to be run or pulled)

==Braided line==
Braided line is generally used when the strength of slickline is insufficient for the task.  Most commonly, this is for heavy fishing such as retrieving broken drill pipe.

==Slickline Tools==

===Jar===
This type of tool can be extended and closed rapidly to induce a mechanical shock to the tool string.  This shock can induce certain components such as plugs to lock into place and then unlock for retrieving. Jars are commonly used to shear small brass or steel pins that are put in place to function certain down-hole tools at a certain moment. The operator can use the jars to shear the pins at a predetermined depth. Spang jars are manually operated by the wireline operator who either lifts or lowers wire rapidly, requiring a great deal of expertise.

===Stem===
Stem essentially just serves to add weight to the toolstring.  The weight may be necessary to overcome the pressure of the well.  Some variations of stem, called roller stem, may have wheels built into the tool to allow the tool string to glide more easily down moderately deviated wells. Stem give the hammering action to the tool string which in turn allows the jars to transmit the force given by the movement of the stems bars.  Depending on well conditions, either extra small OD stems are use or extra large.  The range can be from .75" to 3.50" OD and the stems normally come in 2&amp;nbsp;ft, 3&amp;nbsp;ft or 5&amp;nbsp;ft lengths.  The connection to the rope socket or other tools can be a threaded connection or a QLS system (quick connect).

===Pulling tools===
These are tools designed for fishing other wireline components which have been dropped or placed in the well down hole.  All wireline tools are designed with 'fishing necks' on their top side, intended to be easily grabbed by pulling tools with a matching 'id' to that of the 'od' of the fishing neck.  Pulling tools are also used for retrieving seated components such as plug prongs. Almost all pulling tools are equipped with a safety feature (shear pin) so they may release a stuck tool and allow the tool string to be brought to the surface for changes in components (hydraulic jars for example).

===Gauge Cutter (Gauge Ring)===
A gauge cutter is a tool with a round, open-ended bottom which is milled to an accurate size. Large openings above the bottom of the tool allow for fluid bypass while running in the hole.
Most often a gauge ring will be the first tool ran on a slickline operation. A gauge ring that is just undersized will allow the operator to ensure clear tubing down to the deepest projected working depth; for example 2 7/8" tubing containing 2.313" profiles would call for a gauge ring between 2.25" - 2.30". 
A gauge ring can also be used to remove light paraffin that may have built up in the tubing. Often a variety of different sized gauges and/or scratchers will be run to remove parafin little by little.Gauge cutter can be used for drift runs also.

===Lead impression block===
If an obstruction is found downhole, a lead impression block can be run to help determine its nature.  The LIB has a malleable lead base in which the obstruction can leave an impression when they meet. 
The LIB is called Wireline Camera because of its function to mark any object downhole.
They are also sometimes called "confusion" blocks because they only give a two-dimensional view of the down-hole object, making it hard for an inexperienced person to determine what three-dimensional object is in the hole

===Downhole bailer===
Bailers are downhole tools that are generally long and tubular shaped, and are used for both getting samples of downhole solids (sand, scale, asphaltines, rust, rubber and debris from well servicing operations) and for 'bailing' the unwanted downhole solids from the well. Bailers are attached either via threaded connection or releasable downhole tool to the wireline toolstring, and are manipulated from surface by the wireline operator. Bailers usually have an interchangeable bottom (the shoe) which also houses a check to keep the solids from falling or washing out of the bottom.

===Sample bailer===
A sample bailer is generally around a meter long, and has a hollow tube (the barrel) usually around 40&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, with a 'ball check' on the bottom and an opening at the top. This tool is beat downwards into the as yet unknown obstruction using the mechanical jars and weight above of the wireline toolstring. Generally, after a predetermined amount of 'hits', hopefully allowing a usable sample of solids to fill the barrel. When the tool is pulled upwards, the solids usually (hopefully) settle the ball check onto its 'seat', which will keep the solids in the barrel during the return trip to surface, where the solids can be inspected to determine what the downhole obstruction was. This procedure can be 'hit and miss', the success depending on how readily the solid was accepted into the barrel, and if the ball check was properly seated on the return trip to surface. If the ball check is not seated (sometimes a large, hard piece of solid will sit in between the ball and seat) downhole fluids tend to 'wash' the sample out of the bottom of the sample bailer, leaving the inspectors at surface wondering if the tool actually collected a sample. Persistence is generally a good rule of thumb with this tool.

===Stroke bailer===
A stroke bailer functions like a 'Chinese water pump', and is used to collect unwanted solids from the wellbore. A stroke bailer is long and tubular looking, with a smaller rod that extends from the top, a hole in the bottom, and is generally around 7 meters long, but the length depends on how much barrel section is added to the bailer. The barrel 'free floats' on the stroke rod, which is attached to the wireline toolstring. The tool is usually 'spudded' into the downhole solid, then the wireline toolstring is pulled upwards, which in turn pulls the stroke up through the barrel. Ideally, this draws the downhole solid in through the bottom 'shoe' of the tool, past the check and into the barrel for collection. The tool is usually stroked either a predetermined number of times, or until it appears the tool is not stroking, which can mean either it is full, or stuck.

===Hydrostatic bailer===
A hydrostatic bailer functions like a 'vacuum', and is used to suck up unwanted solids from the wellbore. A hydrostatic bailer is generally around 2.5 meters long and is tubular looking, with two 10&amp;nbsp;mm holes on opposing sides at the top of the tool, and a hole in the bottom. A hydrostatic bailer uses a pinned plug with o-ring seals at the bottom, and a plug at the top to maintain the surface pressure that it was assembled at (nominally around 100 kPa) all the way to the bottom of the well, whereupon it is spudded into the downhole solids, which ideally pushes the shoe into the bottom plug, which shears the pin on the bottom plug. An oil or gas well's pressure downhole is always more than atmospheric pressure at surface, due to the formation pressure, and a combination of depth and hydrostatic weight of wellbore fluids. Sometimes fluid will be added to the wellbore to assist in bailing by bringing up the pressure, and also lubricating the downhole solid. Because the pressure inside the bailer is much less than the downhole wellbore pressure, any solids that are loose enough are 'sucked up' by the vacuum formed when the bottom plug is sheared and travels upwards through the barrel, followed by the solids. At the same time, due to the changed from negative pressure to positive pressure, the top plug pops out (and is caught by the top part of the tool), and excess flow is directed out through the 10&amp;nbsp;mm ports on the sides of the top of the tool. These ports allow the barrel to fill more readily. Then the bailer is returned to surface where it is taken apart, the solids are emptied, and it is cleaned and serviced with new o-ring seals. Care must be taken when disassembling at surface as the tool is potentially charged with the downhole pressure (possibly many tens of thousands of kpa) and may 'blow apart' when being unthreaded if not bled off first.

===Running Tools===
These tools are primarily used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) located in the tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring that is used to 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection to the top of a variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.

The '''Swill milk scandal''' was a major [[adulterated food]] scandal  in [[New York (state)|New York]] in the 1850s. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported an estimate that in one year 8,000 infants died from swill milk.&lt;ref name=NYT1858/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B17F83E581B7493C0AB178ED85F4C8584F9 "Swill - Milk and Infant Mortality"], ''The New York Times'', May 22, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
It is named '''swill milk''' because cows were fed [[swill]] which was residual [[mashing|mash]] from nearby [[distilleries]]. The milk was whitened with [[plaster of Paris]], thickened with starch and eggs, and hued with molasses.&lt;ref name=NYT2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/opinion/30wilson.html|title=The Swill is Gone |author=Bee Wilson |date=29 September 2008|work=The New York Times |accessdate = 30 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110505095957/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/opinion/30wilson.html| archivedate=May 5, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the extraction of [[alcohol]] from the [[macerated]] grain, the residual mash still contains nutrients, and therefore it was an economical advantage to keep cows stabled near distilleries and feed them with swill.&lt;ref name=NYT1858&gt;{{cite news|title=How We Poison Our Children|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1858/05/13/78535562.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 13, 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[New York Academy of Medicine]] carried out an examination and established the connection of swill milk with the increased infant mortality in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard A. Meckel|title=Save the Babies: American Public Health Reform and the Prevention of Infant Mortality, 1850&amp;ndash;1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJTbkOJMReYC&amp;pg=PA64|year=1990|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-08556-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vanderheijden|title=International Food Safety Handbook: Science, International Regulation, and Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssYiTYa2ZDIC&amp;pg=PA651|date=16 July 1999|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-9354-8|page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of swill milk was also well exposed in pamphlets and caricatures of the time.

In May 1858, ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'' did a landmark exposé of the distillery-dairies of Manhattan and Brooklyn that marketed so-called swill milk that came from cows fed on distillery waste and then adulterated with water, eggs, flour, and other ingredients that increased the volume and masked the adulteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David B. Sachsman|author2=David W. Bulla|title=Sensationalism: Murder, Mayhem, Mudslinging, Scandals, and Disasters in 19th-Century Reporting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dVtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132|year=2013|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-5171-8|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swill milk dairies were noted for their filthy conditions and overpowering stench both caused by the close confinement of hundreds (sometimes thousands) of cows in narrow stalls where, once they were tied, they would stay for the rest of their lives, often standing in their own manure, covered with flies and sores, and suffering from a range of virulent diseases. These cows were fed on boiling distillery waste, often leaving the cows with rotting teeth and other maladies. The milk drawn from the cows was routinely adulterated with water, rotten eggs, flour, burnt sugar and other adulterants with the finished product then marketed falsely as "pure country milk" or "Orange County Milk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Mullaly|title=The Milk Trade in New York and Vicinity: Giving an Account of the Sale of Pure and Adulterated Milk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXIZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|year=1853|publisher=Fowlers and Wells|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial published at the height of the scandal, the ''New York Times'' described swill milk as a "bluish, white compound of true milk, pus and dirty water, which, on standing, deposits a yellowish, brown sediment that is manufactured in the stables attached to large distilleries by running the refuse distillery slops through the udders of dying cows and over the unwashed hands of milkers..."&lt;ref name=NYT1858/&gt;

Frank Leslie's exposé caused widespread public outrage and local politicians were strongly pressured to punish and regulate the distillery-dairies, which were formally complained to be "swill milk [[nuisance]]".&lt;ref name=smn&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1858/06/08/78536748.pdf "The Swill-Milk Nuisance"], ''The New York Times'', June 8, 1858&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tammany Hall]] politician Alderman [[Michael Tuomey (politician)|Michael Tuomey]], known as "Butcher Mike" defended the distillers vigorously throughout the scandal—in fact, he was put in charge of the Board of Health investigation. ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'' staked out distillery owner [[Bradish Johnson]]'s mansion at 21st and Broadway, and reported that in the midst of the investigation, Tuomey was observed making late night visits. Tuomey assumed a central role in the ensuing investigations, and, with fellow Aldermen E. Harrison Reed and William Tucker, shielded the dairies and turned the hearings into one-sided exercises designed to make dairy critics and established health authorities look ridiculous, even going to the extent of arguing that swill milk was actually as good or better for children than regular milk.&lt;ref name=smn/&gt;  With Reed and others, Tuomey successfully blocked any serious inquiry into the dairies and stymied calls for reform. The Board of Health exonerated the distillers, but public outcry led to the passage of the first food safety laws in the form of milk regulations in 1862.&lt;ref name=Swindled&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Bee|title=Swindled|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tuomey became known for his attempts to block the new regulations, and earned the new moniker "Swill Milk" Tuomey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=They Ought to Be Beaten – "Swill Milk" Tuomey|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1878/10/29/80733332.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 29, 1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Tuomey's assistance in clearing up the unclean image milk developed, Robert Hartley a social reformist, aided in the restoration of milk being a nutritional and safe-to-drink beverage. During the mid to late nineteenth century, Hartley utilized Biblical references in his essays to appeal to the urban community. He asserted that universal milk consumption could help alleviate society's "sins", poverty, and alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="DePuis, E. 2002"&gt;DePuis, E. (2002). Nature's Perfect food: How milk became America's Drink. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==America's first pure milk agitator==

Robert Hartley was America's first consumer advocate and milk agitator. After resigning from his job as a factory manager in Mohawk Valley, New York. Hartley decided to move to NYC, to dedicate his life to joining and establishing many of the cities major reform organizations: such as, the New York City Temperance Society, The City Mission tract Society, and The New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (DuPuis). Hartley had a desire to better the lives of humans, which is why he was interested in New York City's poor milk supply.

Hartley's desire to perfect human society provided the basis for his interest in the New York City milk supply. As a temperance reformer, he aimed to eliminate the extra profits provided to the city's brewers through the linked milk and alcohol production systems. As a social reformer interested in the welfare of the poor, he improved the New York milk supply. Beginning in the 1830s in newspaper articles and lectures, and eventually summarized in a publication titled "A Historical, Scientific, and Practical Essay on Milk as an Article of Human Sustenance", Hartley exposed the unsanitary practices of the swill milk system. He was the first American to make a sustained argument that milk was the perfect food.&lt;ref name="DePuis, E. 2002"/&gt;

'''''Typewriting Behavior''''' is a book by [[August Dvorak]], [[Nellie Merrick]], [[William Dealey]] and [[Gertrude Ford]].  It was published in 1936 by the [[American Book Company (1890)|American Book Company]]. It is currently out of print but can be found in most major libraries.

The book is a study on the psychology of [[typing]].  It gives a scientific approach to teaching and learning typewriting, from personalities to patterns and machine effects.  It gives an in depth overview on the subject of typing.

This book also introduced the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]].

A '''universal library''' is a [[library]] with universal collections. This may be expressed in terms of it containing all existing information, useful information, all books, all works (regardless of format) or even all possible works. This ideal, although unrealizable, has influenced and continues to influence librarians and others and be a goal which is aspired to. Universal libraries are often assumed to have a complete set of useful features (such as [[finding aids]], [[translation]] tools, alternative formats, etc.).

The [[Library of Alexandria]] is generally regarded as the first library approaching universality, although this idea may be more mythical than real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilip.org.uk/groups/lhg/alexandria.html Abstract], The Alexandrian library and its aftermath, Uwe Jochum, presented at the Second Anglo-German seminar on library history, ''The universal library: from Alexandria to the internet'', London, September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that at one time, this library contained between 30 and 70 percent of all works in existence.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/magazine/14publishing.html?ex=1305259200&amp;en=c07443d368771bb8&amp;ei=5090 Scan This Book!, ''New York Times Magazine'', May 14, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; The re-founded modern library has a non-universal collections policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibalex.org/Libraries/Presentation/Static/15610.aspx |title=Bibliotheca Alexandrina, BA Libraries, Collection Development Policy |publisher=Bibalex.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a phrase, the "universal library" can be traced back to the naturalist [[Conrad Gessner]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca universalis]]'' of 1545.

In the 17th century, the ideal of universality continued to be attractive. The French librarian [[Gabriel Naudé]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And therefore I shall ever think it extremely necessary, to collect for this purpose all sorts of books, (under such precautions, yet, as I shall establish) seeing a Library which is erected for the public benefit, ought to be universal; but which it can never be, unlesse it comprehend all the principal authors, that have written upon the great diversity of particular subjects, and chiefly upon all the arts and sciences; [...] For certainly there is nothing which renders a Library more recommendable, then when every man findes in it that which he is in search of ...&lt;ref&gt;''Advis pour dresser une bibliotheque'', Paris, 1627, translated by John Evelyn as ''Instructions concerning erecting of a library'', London, 1661, pp. 19&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilip.org.uk/groups/lhg/alexandria.html Abstract], [[C. G. Heyne]] and the university library at Göttingen: from 'Universalbibliothek' of the eighteenth century to the 'Sammlung Deutscher Drucke', 1701-1800, Graham Jefcoate and Gerd J. Boette, presented at the Second Anglo-German seminar on library history, ''The universal library: from Alexandria to the internet'', London, September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fiction==
[[Science fiction]] has used the device of a library which is universal in the sense that it not only contains all existing written works, but all possible written works.  This idea appeared in [[Kurd Lasswitz]]'s 1901 story "The Universal Library" and [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]]'s essay "The Total Library" before its more famous expression in Borges's story "[[The Library of Babel]]". Such a library, however, would be as useless as it would be complete. A similar idea was a planet called Memory Alpha, (from the Star Trek episode "[[The Lights of Zetar]]") which was the Federation's "storehouse of computer databases containing all cultural history and scientific data it has acquired.".&lt;ref&gt;The Lights of Zetar, Wikipedia entry; [[The Lights of Zetar]].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been commented that the  Internet already approaches this state.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet and the revival of the myth of the universal library, Miroslav Kruk, ''Australian Library Journal'' '''48''', #2 (May 1999); [https://web.archive.org/web/20040803162151/http://clintongreen.tripod.com/universal.html abridged version] available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Discworld]], [[Terry Pratchett]]'s fantasy world, all libraries in the [[multiverse]] are connected in "L-space", effectively creating a single semi-universal library.

==Modern times==
With the advent of cheap widely available digital storage, the ideal of universality, although still impossible to attain, has become closer to being feasible. Many projects are now attempting to collect  a section of human knowledge into one database. These projects vary in breadth and scope, and none are complete.  Examples include digitization projects such as [[Project Gutenberg]] and [[Carnegie-Mellon]]'s [[Universal library (Carnegie Mellon University)|Universal library]], [[digital library|digital libraries]] which are using [[book scanning]] to collect [[public domain]] works; [[The European Library]], an integrated catalog for Europe's national libraries; and the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which, using the [[Wiki]] system, is attempting to collect the breadth of important human knowledge under various [[open content]] projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Wiktionary]]. However, many technical and legal problems remain for the dissemination of all possible knowledge on the Internet.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

=== Current barriers ===
Current barriers to the construction of a universal digital library include:
*Books have been [[lost works|lost]]. While the best-known lost library may be the [[Library at Alexandria]], wars, civil strife and natural disasters [[Destruction of libraries|destroy libraries and archives]] on a regular basis. Further losses are due to neglect.
*Copyright: Many books are under [[copyright]] and current widespread business models require scarcity of books to remunerate authors.
*Censorship: Most jurisdictions have prohibited at least some [[List of books banned by governments|banned books]].
*[[manuscript|Unpublished manuscripts]]: If unpublished manuscripts are included in the definition of ''book,'' catching newly written manuscripts is likely to be a challenge.
*Current digitization efforts are largely library-based, and so materials deemed outside the scope of libraries are very poorly represented.

'''Waste treatment''' refers to the activities required to ensure that [[waste]] has the least practicable impact on the environment. In many countries various forms of waste treatment are required by law.

==Solid waste treatment==
{{main|List of solid waste treatment technologies}}

The treatment of solid wastes is a key component of [[waste management]]. Different forms of solid waste treatment are graded in the [[waste hierarchy]].

==Waste water treatment ==
{{main|List of waste water treatment technologies}}

===Agricultural waste water treatment===

[[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] is treatment and disposal of liquid animal waste, pesticide residues etc. from agriculture.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===

[[Industrial wastewater treatment]] is the treatment of wet wastes from manufacturing industry and commerce including mining, quarrying and heavy industries

===Sewage treatment===

[[Sewage treatment]] is the treatment and disposal of human waste. [[Sewage]] is produced by all human communities and is often left to compost naturally or is treated using processes that separate solid materials by settlement and then convert soluble contaminants into biological sludge and into gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]].

==Radioactive waste treatment==
{{main|List of nuclear waste treatment technologies}}

[[Radioactive waste treatment]] is the treatment and containment of radioactive waste.
