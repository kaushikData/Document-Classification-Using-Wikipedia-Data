'''''14 Carrot Rabbit''''' is an [[animated cartoon]] short in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' series featuring [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Yosemite Sam]] (here as Chillicothe Sam), directed by [[Friz Freleng]] and first released March 15, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044313|title=14 Carrot Rabbit|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a play on "14 [[Carat (purity)|karat]]", as in a purity level for [[gold]].

==Plot==
The basic plot of ''14 Carrot Rabbit'' takes place during the [[gold rush]] in The [[Klondike, Yukon]] ("where men were men and women were women....a darn good arrangement"), and centers on [[Yosemite Sam]] (here as Chilkoot Sam) who steals other people's gold. The story begins with an old man named Louie slouching over by a river to clean the gold he found in a pan. Sam suddenly appears, uses his gun and reputation to scare him away, and claims the gold.  When he sees how little he has stolen from old Louie, he says "Picking's mighty slim around here, hardly no reward for a day's work," even though he did not work for it. Sam later takes the gold to a shop called "Next to Last Chance Saloon" to trade them for money. After the weigh-up, Sam is furious to find out that Pierre can offer only $10 for the gold. 

While Sam complains about the result ("It's getting so a man can't earn a dishonest living!"), [[Bugs Bunny]] wobbles into the shop with another gigantic piece of gold to trade in. (Being a rabbit, he welcomes carrots in lieu of cash.) When Bugs leaves, Sam asks Pierre for the secret of Bugs' success. Pierre tells Sam that Bugs always gets a "funny feeling" when he's near gold.

With this information, Sam goes to find Bugs...whom he indeed observes get the "funny feeling". Bugs digs up a lost collar button. Sam then decides to ask Bugs to be his partner; if Bugs can locate the gold, Sam will dig it up and split it with the rabbit in a 50/50 deal. Bugs stares back at the camera and wiggles his eyebrows with a smirk, knowing that Sam cannot be trusted. Despite this, Bugs plays along...asking if he can actually afford to take Sam up on his offer. The claim-jumper advertises himself as "Square-deal Sam". They stroll along together when Bugs indicates he's found gold. Bugs points out the spot to Sam, who proceeds to dig...and abruptly dissolves his partnership with Bugs. The double-crossed Bugs notices that Sam is about to dig right through a cliff and into a lake hundreds of feet down. Sam ignores Bugs' warning (thus clearing the rabbit's conscience), digs through the cliff and plummets into the lake. 

Soon afterwards, Bugs goes downhill and proceeds to dig when Sam shows up again. Sam accuses Bugs of trying to get the gold for himself (talk about [[calling the kettle black]]!); he grabs Bugs' shovel, hypocritically complaining "That's what I get for trusting a rabbit". As the thief digs ever deeper, it turns out he's in a loaded dump truck driven by Bugs! The rabbit drives his truck to a cliff and empties its load over the edge. Sam keeps digging until he finds himself on the bottom of a falling soil pile ("Great [[Horned lizard|horny toads!]] I must've dug clean through to [[China|Chinee]]!"). The thief's fall is broken by hard ground.

Enraged, Sam vows to chase Bugs through every state in the [[United States|Union]]...and literally does, until the rabbit suddenly has another "funny" moment. Sam's efforts to resist the gold-digging infatuation are in vain; he digs and indeed finds tons of gold. ("I'm a zillionaire!" he gloats.) Tragically, it turns out that Sam has been digging up the United States Gold Reserve in [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]. He is hauled off to the stockade by a couple of [[Military Police|MP]]s, while Bugs bids him farewell ("See you in 20 years, Sam!"). Then a third MP asks Bugs what ''he's'' doing here; Bugs nervously explains that he's waiting for a streetcar. At that moment, inexplicably, an [[ocean liner]] appears on the scene (despite there being no water in the vicinity). Bugs isn't stymied, however: "In a spot like this, a boat will do!" With that, he rushes aboard to make his getaway.

The '''animated documentary''' is a [[film genre|genre of film]] which combines [[animation]] and [[documentary film|documentary]]. This genre should not be confused with documentaries about movie and TV animation history that feature excerpts.

== History ==

[[File:Winsor McCay (1918) The Sinking of the Lusitania.webm|thumb|left|alt=Video of the animated film ''The Sinking of the Lusitania''|thumbtime=1:57|[[Winsor McCay]]'s 1918 film ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]'' was the first animated documentary.]] 

The first recognized example of this genre is Winsor McCay's 1918 12-minute-long film ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/great-animated-documentaries/ 10 Great Animated Documetaries-Blog-Independent Lens-PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;, which uses animation to portray the 1915 sinking of {{RMS|Lusitania}} after it was struck by two torpedoes launched  by a German [[U-boat]]; an event of which no recorded film footage is known to exist.&lt;ref name="film history"&gt;DelGaudio, Sybil. ''If Truth Be Told, Can Toons Tell It? Documentary and Animation''. Film History 9:2 (1997) p. 189-199&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the 1920s, animation has been used in [[educational film|educational]] and [[Social guidance film|social guidance]] films, and has often been used to illustrate abstract concepts in mainly live-action examples of these genres. Early examples of fully animated educational films are ''The Einstein Theory of Relativity'' (1923) and ''Evolution'' (1925) by [[Fleischer Studios|Max and Dave Fleischer]].&lt;ref name="film history" /&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] used it in films such as ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]'' (1943), ''[[How to Catch a Cold]]'' (1951) and ''[[Our Friend the Atom]]'' (1957).&lt;ref name="film history" /&gt;

In 1953, [[Norman McLaren]]'s ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' won the Academy Awards for Best Documentary (Short Subject). The award is somewhat considered a mistake, but the fact that it was not only indicated into that category, but also won, shows that, somehow, the animated images spoke to the judges almost like a documentary.

''[[Of Stars and Men]]'', a 1964 animated feature by [[John Hubley]] which tells of humankind's quest to find its place in the universe, won an award in the documentary category at the [[San Francisco Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="film history" /&gt;

Mosaic Films promoted the use of animated documentaries in the United Kingdom in 2003 with the award-winning series ''Animated Minds''. Commissioned by [[Channel 4]] and directed by [[Andy Glynne]], it uses real testimony from survivors of mental illness, combined with engaging visuals, to climb inside the minds of the mentally distressed. The first series won the award for Best Animation at the [[Banff World Media Festival]] (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brits dominate Banff Rockies|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/brits-dominate-banff-rockies/1094771.article|work=Broadcast|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] featured a programme of "documentaries that partly or completely consist of animation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idfa.nl/industry/programme/festival-sections/non-competitive-programmes/idfa-animation-programme.aspx IDFA Animation Programme], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the article written to accompany the event, Kees Driessen talked about the "least controversial" form of the genre; the "illustrated [[radio documentary]]", citing [[Aardman Animation]]'s 1987 film ''Lip Synch: Going Equipped'' (directed by [[Peter Lord]]) as an example.&lt;ref name="mice"&gt;Driessen, Kees. [http://www.idfa.nl/repository/documents/More%20than%20just%20talking%20mice%20(Paul%20Fierlinger).pdf More than just talking mice]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724154450/http://www.idfa.nl/repository/documents/More%20than%20just%20talking%20mice%20%28Paul%20Fierlinger%29.pdf |date=July 24, 2011 }}. ''IDFA Magazine''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most consistent creators of this form of animated documentary today is [[Paul Fierlinger]].&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;Robinson, Chris. [http://animationpimp.animationblogspot.com/2007/11/18/waking-life-the-truth-is-in-the-animation-montage-magazine-2004/ Waking Life: The Truth is in the Animation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621234841/http://animationpimp.animationblogspot.com/2007/11/18/waking-life-the-truth-is-in-the-animation-montage-magazine-2004/ |date=June 21, 2008 }}. ''Montage Magazine''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; His films from the late 1980s-onward typically feature recordings of people talking about certain topics in their lives (such as alcohol abuse or loneliness), accompanied by Fierlinger's animation which mainly illustrates the stories in a realistic way.  This is a contrast from films and series such as Aardman's ''[[Creature Comforts]]'', which [[Recontextualisation|recontextualise]] such audio recordings by combining them with more fanciful, non-realistic animated interpretations.

Fierlinger's 1995 animated feature-length [[autobiography]] ''Drawn from Memory'', in which he is the main subject as well as the director, voice actor and only animator &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.animationshowofshows.com/products/drawn-from-memory-a-film-by-paul-fierlinger Drawn From Memory DVD-Animation Show of Shows]&lt;/ref&gt;, was also called a documentary by Driessen.&lt;ref name="mice" /&gt; This technique of animating interviews has also been used by other filmmakers, such as [[Chris Landreth]] in his [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning 2004 short film ''[[Ryan (film)|Ryan]]'' (mainly based on an interview done with animator [[Ryan Larkin]]) and [[Jonas Odell]] in the 2006 Swedish film ''Aldrig som f√∂rsta g√•ngen!'' (''Never Like the First Time!'', consisting of animated segments of people's descriptions of their first time engaging in sex). The film ''[[Chicago 10 (film)|Chicago 10]]'', about the [[Chicago Seven]] incident, received some acclaim for recreating courtroom scenes using animation. Another documentary with animated elements is the German film [[Neuk√∂lln Unlimited]], which uses animation to depict past traumas of its protagonists.

The Oscar-nominated 2008 [[Israel]]i film  ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2016/the-10-best-animated-documentaries-from-the-past-10-years/2/ The 10 Best Animated Documentaries from The Past 10 Years ¬´ Taste of Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; was advertised as being the first feature-length animated documentary.&lt;ref&gt;Ide, Wendy. [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/cannes/article3939739.ece Waltz With Bashir]. ''Times Online''. May 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some animated documentaries that were nominated or won for Oscars are ''[[So Much for So  Little]]'' (1949) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8xnTMj3nys The First Exact Academy Awards Tie: 1950 Oscars]&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[Sunrise Over Tiananmen Square]]'' (1998) &lt;ref name="Oscars1999"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/71st-winners.html |title=The 71st Academy Awards (1999) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 19, 2011 |publisher=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation]]'' (2005), ''[[I Met the Walrus]]'' (2007) and ''[[Last Day of Freedom]]'' (2015). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MbA_q5yTeA "A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness" winning Best Documentary Short-Oscars on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashton Lane''' is a cobbled backstreet in the [[Glasgow#The West End|West End]] of [[Glasgow]]. It is connected to [[Byres Road]] by a short linking lane beside [[Hillhead subway station]] and is noted for its bars, restaurants and a licensed cinema.
[[File:Glasgow westend (31).JPG|thumb|right|240px|Off the main thoroughfare of [[Byres Road]], Ashton Lane is a focus for bars, cafes and restaurants.]]

==Overview==
The Lane was not always the focus of West End cafe society. By the early 1970s, it was a run-down area of small residential and empty commercial properties. However, in 1976, the cost to renew the lease on the cramped property in Ruthven Lane that housed the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/16/ubiquitous-chip-glasgow-restaurant-review|title=The Ubiquitous Chip, Glasgow ‚Äì restaurant review {{!}} Marina O'Loughlin|last=O'Loughlin|first=Marina|date=2014-05-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; forced the owner to look for new premises. 'The Chip', as it is locally known, moved to its current location in a derelict property that had been the stables for a funeral undertaker. The move was a gamble for the owner, Ronnie Clydesdale, since the Lane was a backwater to the thriving [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] but in 1977 the [[Glasgow Underground|Glasgow Subway]] closed for a major refurbishment. This forced several small businesses to relocate from [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] and the then-famous Grosvenor Cafe followed The Chip into Ashton Lane.

[[File:AshtonLaneGlasgow.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Ashton Lane, looking from Great George Street.]]

Other bars and restaurants were opened: the Cul-de-Sac creperie in the former [[Barr and Stroud]] factory and Bar Brel in the old coachhouse that had been used latterly as a landscape gardener's yard but was, in 1910, the chauffeur‚Äôs house and garage for Dr Marion Gilchrist‚Äôs 'prim dark green Wolseley landaulette'. Dr Gilchrist (1864-1952) was, in 1894, the first woman to graduate in medicine in Scotland.

[[File:CresswellLaneGlasgow.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Cresswell Lane, Glasgow.]]

The Grosvenor Picture Theatre was built on site of Henderson‚Äôs Cab and Funeral Office in Byres Road and Ashton Lane. The cinema opened on 3 May 1921 with 'Helen of the Four Gates' and 'Eastwards Ho' and the performances were accompanied by the theatre‚Äôs own orchestra and organist. The building was designed by architects Gardner &amp; Glen and had a distinctive terracotta fa√ßade. The original entrance faced Byres Road and the upper level housed a Caf√© and American Soda Fountain and, by 1929, a waiting room. The original cinema seated around 1,350 people, but in the 1970s it underwent considerable reconstruction. The entrance was moved from Byres Rd to Ashton Lane, and the old entrance became Bonham's Wine Bar (the railing in the original foyer is retained in the upstairs bar). After falling into disrepair, the cinema closed 30 June 2002, but was relaunched in October 2003 after a multimillion-pound refurbishment. This created two screens on the ground floor, a bar and restaurant in the former neglected roof space and a new cafe/bar on Ashton Lane. The cinema now has two screens, each seating a hundred people and shows a mix of blockbuster and art-house movies. 

Today, bars and restaurants occupy most of the premises in Ashton Lane. The Famous Grosvenor Cafe and the now internationally renowned 'Chip' remain a defining feature. Some like Jinty McGuintys Irish Bar have been there a while too, almost 25 years.

Ashton Lane continues north as Cresswell Lane, where the variety of bars and restaurants is supplemented by a gallery of small specialist shops. The Lane and its surroundings might then be regarded as Glasgow's equivalent of [[Dublin]]'s [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] area or [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Rose Street]]. While still popular with local residents and students, it is now firmly established on the Glasgow tourist trail.

[[Australian rules football]] has been played in [[Sweden]] since 1993, with the game currently played in [[Helsingborg]], [[Malm√∂]], [[Lund]], [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Karlstad]], [[Falun]], [[Norrt√§lje]] and [[Uppsala]].  A national governing body was formed in 2007 under the name ''Svenska Australisk Fotbollsf√∂rbundet'' or ''AFL Sweden''.

==History==
Australian rules football began in Sweden in late 1993 with the creation of the Helsingborg Saints for play in the [[Danish Australian Football League]].  They continued as the only Australian rules club in Sweden (excepting the short-lived [[Lund Bulldogs]] in 1995) until 2002, when the DAFL was restructured and the Saints were divided into three new clubs, the [[Port Malm√∂ Maulers]], Helsingborg West Raptors and [[Lund Magpies]].  After 2005, the three [[Scania]] teams became feeders for the [[South Sweden Saints]] (changed name back to Helsingborg Saints in 2008), who competed in the DAFL Premier League and reached the 2005 Grand Final.

In 2003 a new club was formed, the [[G√∂teborg Berserkers]], followed by the [[Stockholm Dynamite]] in 2004.  The three centres for footy in Sweden continued to operate largely independently of each other, with the Dynamite creating its own three team local league, the [[Stockholm region Australian Football Federation]].

A loose federation calling itself the Swedish Australian Football Association was created, but no real governing body was created until late 2007.  The announcement of the creation of the Swedish Australian Football League in 2006 comprises the [[Scania]] and [[Gothenburg]] clubs, the Stockholm teams remaining separate in the SAFF.

AFLSweden is the official governing body of Australian rules football in Sweden.

==2015 Elitserien==
With AFL Sweden working towards being recognised as a sport in Sweden and inclusion into the Swedish 'Riksidrottsf√∂rbundet' in 2017, plans were made to expand footy within the country. Part of those plans was the creation of a national competition or the 'Elitserien'. In 2015 the first Elitserien tournament was held over 6 rounds with 4 competing teams: Port Malm√∂ Maulers, Helsingborg Saints, S√∂dermalm Blues and Stockholm Dynamite (Dynamite team composed of players from Solna, √Örsta, Bromma and Norrt√§lje). Each team hosted a double header round as well as a regional derby match. S√∂dermalm Blues, the team with the best record after 6 rounds, were crowned champions.

==E4 Cup==
The [[Stockholm Dynamite]] has competed against the [[South Sweden Saints]] (aka Scania Griffins) at least once a year to date since 2004.  The Southerners won the first cup in 2004 (surprisingly considering they were thrashed in a practice game earlier in the year) and defended it successfully in 2005.  The E4 Cup is named for the E4 motorway connecting the capital with the country's south. This cup has now been replaced by the SAFL regional league.

==National team==

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:swedishelks.jpg|thumb|Swedish Elks in 2005]] --&gt;
The Swedish national team is nicknamed the Elks, drawn from teams across Sweden.

The team wears the [[national colours]] of Sweden (represented on the [[Flag of Sweden]]).  The Elks have worn two different jumpers in international competition, their first being a yellow jumper with a blue V featuring three gold crowns and the Swedish name for Sweden (Sverige) on the belly, and their second being a blue jumper with a yellow [[Scandinavian cross]] and Elk logo.

The first appearance of a Swedish national team was in 1997, when the Elks were defeated by [[Denmark]]'s [[Denmark (Australian rules football National Team)|Vikings]] in [[Helsingborg]].  The next Elks match was in 2004, when the Elks defeated the touring [[North London Lions]] by 11 points at [[Malm√∂]].  In 2005, the first test match between Sweden and Denmark is some time was held at [[Farum]], [[Denmark]], with the game played out as a draw.  This match consisted of an all-Danish Vikings side, although the Sweden side contained a number of Australians.

At the [[2007 EU Cup Australian rules football|2007 EU Cup]] in Hamburg, Sweden performed very well, eventually winning the tournament. The Elks thrashed [[Australian rules football in Austria|Austria]] by over 100 points in their first group match, then beat [[Australian rules football in France|France]] by 41 points to top Pool C. In the Quarter-Finals, Sweden defeated Pool B runners up the [[Australian rules football in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] by 31 points. In the Semi Finals, they met Pool B champions [[Australian rules football in England|England]]. The Swedes ran out 26 point winners, moving onto the final where they would play hosts [[Australian rules football in Germany|Germany]]. In the Final, Sweden won 14.9.93 to Germany 8.5.53. Sweden's Cameron Crooks was Best on Ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australian-football.eu/?show=Results EU Cup 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong growth in the Swedish league has the Elks sent a squad to the [[2008 Australian Football International Cup]].

==Clubs==

===National Regional League===
The Swedish Regional League began in 2007, featuring three sides representing the most established regions for Australian rules in Sweden, the Gothenburg Berserkers, Scania Griffins and Stockholm Dynamite.

===Gothenburg===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:garfc logo.jpg|thumb|GARFC Logo]] --&gt;

The G√∂teborg Berserkers are currently the only Australian rules team in [[Gothenburg]].  The Berserkers started training in 2003 and had their first seven-a-side game in late 2003.  In 2006, the Berserkers started playing against the [[Landskrona Bulldozers]] and [[Port Malm√∂ Maulers]] in the Southern Sweden Regional League.  The Berserkers wear a black and white striped long sleeve jumper (same as [[Collingwood Magpies]]) or a black-red sleeveless jumper.  As of 2007, they are competing against [[Stockholm]] and [[Scania]] in the national regional series.

===Scania===
Scania currently has two teams in the [[Danish Australian Football League]] (DAFL) , the Port Malm√∂ Maulers from [[Malm√∂]] and Helsingborg Saints based in [[Helsingborg]].  Feeding into these sides is the four-team Scania League (Sk√•neligan), featuring the GV Rebels and Malm√∂ Red Eyes in Malm√∂, Helsingborg West Raptors in Helsingborg and Landskrona Bulldozers representing [[Landskrona]] and [[Lund]].  The Lund Magpies also competed in the Scania League from 2003‚Äì06, former players joining the Bulldozers after the Magpies folded.

The regional representative side is nicknamed the Griffins.

Scania was home to the first Australian football club ever formed in Sweden, the Helsingborg Saints. The club was founded in 1993 by Ingmar 'Terry' Lundquist and Joacim Aulin.  The club was almost to be called the Ravens, but the nickname and playing strip of [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) club the [[St Kilda Saints]] eventually were adopted.  From 1994 onwards the Saints competed in the DAFL, and were briefly called South Sweden Saints from 2003‚Äì2007.  There was also a short-lived club in Lund, nicknamed the Bulldogs, 1995.

For the years 2003 and 2004, the Helsingborg Saints split their squad into three teams for the DAFL's new Scania Conference, these being the Helsingborg West Raptors, Lund Magpies and the Port Malm√∂ Maulers.  During this period, the Saints played as Scania in the DAFL's regional league, being a representative team made up of the best players from the three Scanian clubs.

In the 2005 structure for the DAFL the Saints returned, now called the South Sweden Saints and playing in the DAFL Premier League.  This season saw the Saints reach the DAFL Grand Final for the second time, again they were soundly defeated by the Farum Cats.

The Port Malm√∂ Maulers were formed in 2003, to play in the Scania Conference of the DAFL. As of the 2005 DAFL restructure, the Maulers are a feeder team for the South Sweden Saints (now called Helsingborg Saints again), who play in the DAFL Premier League.  In 2006, with the creation of the Swedish Australian Football League, the Maulers competed in the Southern Sweden regional league, against the Landskrona Bulldozers and the G√∂teborg Berserkers, and also field two sides in the new Scania league, the Malm√∂ Red Eyes and the GV Malm√∂ Rebels (named for their partner league the [[Goulburn Valley Football League]] in Australia.  As of 2007, the Port Malm√∂ Maulers compete in the DAFL Premier League. In 2009, they became the first team from outside the Copenhagen area to win the DAFL premiership.

===Stockholm===
[[Image:Stockholmdynamitelogo.png|thumb|Logo of the Stockholm Dynamite]]
Australian rules football in the Stockholm region is governed by the Stockholm region Australian Football Federation (SAFF).  The SAFF runs a five-team suburban competition featuring the Bromma Vikings, Solna Axemen, S√∂dermalm Blues, Norrt√§lje Dockers and √Örsta Swans, with a representative team known as the Stockholm Dynamite. The Falun Diggers participated in the 2011 competition but sat out 2012. Players from the SAFF are also eligible for selection to the Swedish national team.

After earlier attempts to start the game of Australian Rules in Stockholm, the first meeting of what was to become the SAFF was held on the December 19, 2003.

Early in April 2004 the Stockholm Dynamite (the new representative side for the SAFF) traveled to Malm√∂ and won a resounding victory in their premier game against a rather depleted South Sweden Saints side. Six weeks later the Dynamite accepted an invitation to play a full-strength team in Helsingborg for the inaugural E4 Cup (named after the major freeway between Stockholm and the south). The match resulted in a four-point win to South Sweden.

In Stockholm a three-team league was established, teams being North, South and Central.  After each team completed nine home-and-away games, North defeated Central in the 2004 Grand Final. The Dynamite also travelled to Denmark for the Sheep Station Cup and played an [[International Rules football|International Rules]] game against a local [[Gaelic football]] club.

In 2005, the Stockholm Australian Football Federation completed its second year. The senior competition again maintained the same three-team, nine-a-side competition, the sides now named the Northern Axemen, Central Royals and Southern Sharks. The Sharks defeated the Axemen for the premiership.

In the eighteen-a-side version of the game, 2005 was a learning curve for the Stockholm Dynamite.  The [[West London Wildcats]] toured Stockholm in early April, defeating the locals by a good margin.

In the E4 Cup, the South Sweden Saints made the long trek to Stockholm. The Saints proved too strong and controlled the game from the outset. Again there were many encouraging signs with the local players making up 40% of the Stockholm Team.  The Dynamite again ventured to Denmark for the Sheep Station Cup, finishing fourth.

With the completion of the 2005 senior competition in September, the SAFF turned its focus to junior development. The SAFF hired a professionally accredited physical education teacher and primary school teacher to co-ordinate Australian Rules Clinics at a number of Swedish schools. The sessions were aimed at children aged 10‚Äì16 and were based primarily upon the Auskick program.  In all, four schools were involved over 38 hours of clinics and 350 children got the opportunity to kick the Sherrin.

The game of Australian rules football has grown steadily in Stockholm over the past few years with a marked increase in local Swedish players.

===Middle Sweden===
2007 saw the formation of three new clubs in middle Sweden, based in the cities of [[Karlstad]], [[Uppsala]] and [[Falun]].

===Participation===
The AFL International Census in 2007 reported a total of 393 players in Sweden, of which 257 were senior, 58 junior and around 78 participants registered in the ''Viking footy'' Auskick like program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_International_Census_Sheet_240807.pdf AFL International Census 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524130530/http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_International_Census_Sheet_240807.pdf |date=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chicago film industry''' is a central hub for motion picture production and exhibition that was established before [[Hollywood]] became the undisputed capital of film making.  In the early 1900s, [[Chicago]] boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  [[Essanay Studios]] founded by [[George K. Spoor]] was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson.  Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios, [[Broncho Billy Anderson]] gave birth to the western genre.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public. This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the [[Great Depression]]. However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed. The [[Motion Picture Patents Company]], established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment. As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene. Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company. The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making.  Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival. Blockbusters, such as ''[[Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs.

==Beginnings of the Chicago film industry==

===Essanay Studios===
[[File:Essanay.jpg|thumb|Essanay Studio]]
[[File:His new job.jpg|thumb|''His New Job'' featuring Charlie Chaplin at Essanay Studios, Chicago'']]

Essanay Studios was a Chicago pioneer film company established in 1907 by George K. Spoor and [[Broncho Billy Anderson]].  Originally named the Peerless Film Manufacturing Company, Spoor and Anderson changed the name to Essanay by combining the first two letters of their surnames. Located on the north side on Argyle Street in Chicago, the firm grew to one of the largest film companies in the world before the rise of Hollywood.&lt;ref name = "Scheetz"&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/scheetz Scheetz, George] (1974). ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Chicago_Film_Industry.html?id=r8fWXwAACAAJ The Chicago Film Industry: Beginnings to 1918]''. Dissertation, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign English Department. Urbana.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Essanay Studio was based on Spoor's and Anderson's appetite for innovation.  Spoor was intrigued by Edison's [[Kinetoscope]] at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition but thought the invention could be improved.  Armed with a vision, Spoor created the Magniscope, which allowed films to be projected onto flat surfaces.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Spoor and Anderson installed, operated, and rented the Magniscope to many theaters around Chicago.  The Magniscope innovation would eventually create legal battles between Essanay and the Edison Company and end up with the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company.  Anderson's film prowess came from on-screen achievement.  He acted in the production of ''The Great Train Robbery'',and became one of the first western stars.  His nickname became, "Broncho Billy", for his involvement with western films.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Due to his love for westerns, Anderson convinced Spoor to establish Essanay branches in Boulder, Colorado and Fremont California.  These locations were perfect, especially the California location, because of the steady climate and mountainous landscape.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

Essanay Studios in Chicago was the capital of Chicago film in the first decades of the 1900s.  [[Charlie Chaplin]] started his career in 1915 at Essanay Studios.  He was hired in 1915 and paid $1,250.00 per week.&lt;ref name ="Verdi"&gt;Verdi, Tony (1996).  When Chicago was Hollywood. Hollywood's Attic. Burbank, California.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chaplin improvised the scripts that were given to him by adding slapstick humor.  Ben Turpin, fellow actor for Essanay, and Chaplin worked together on slapstick projects.  Turpin was cross-eyed which made him a natural sidekick to the antics of Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  Chaplin's only full feature production at Essanay was called ''[[His New Job]]''.&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt;  Another notable actress who found a beginning at Essanay Studio was [[Gloria Swanson]].  Swanson would later star in many television and film productions including the smash hit [[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]].

Despite booming success under Charlie Chaplin, Essanay Studios soon faced a downturn.  Chaplin did not like Chicago due to unpredictable weather conditions.  After only one month of work, Chaplin left Chicago to head west.  Spoor and Anderson soon hired French comedian, [[Max Linder]], to take the role of Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  Linder's rye humor was not appreciated by the Chicago audiences.  The company suffered economically due to the inability to produce a popular film.  In 1918 George Kleine purchased the studio to form a merger between Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay known as [[Vitagraph Studios#V-L-S-E, Incorporated|V-L-S-E, Incorporated]] which would eventually absorbed by [[Warner Brothers]].&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  The Essanay location would eventually be taken over by industrial film producer, Norman Wilding.  Currently, the remnants of the studio are part of [[St. Augustine College (Illinois)|St. Augustine's College]] which built a Charlie Chaplin memorial theater on site.&lt;ref name="Christopher"&gt;Christopher, Rob.

===Motion Picture Patents Company===

The rise of the Chicago film industry in the early 1900s was a product of technological advancement marked by political strategy. In 1889, [[Thomas Edison]] and William Dickson patented the [[Kinetoscope]]. The Kinetoscope allowed a single viewer to watch a film reel through a small window. At this time, Edison did not see any practical value to the Kinetoscope and dismissed the invention as a toy.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  However, aspiring filmmakers began designing and patenting similar projection machines around the Kinetoscope that allowed a film to be shown to a large audience. William Selig and George K. Spoor of Essanay Studios in Chicago, the [[Biograph Company]], and Vitagraph Company all improvised Edison's work.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Film companies of this time period customarily both created movies and established a means of viewing.

Despite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the [[Edison Manufacturing Company]] responded to this innovation with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Concurrent formation of a black market for projection equipment exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"&gt;Lindstrom, J.A. [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/452.html''Film'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', Chicago, 2004. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;   This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios.&lt;ref name="Dirks"&gt;Dirks, Tim. [http://www.filmsite.org/pre20sintro3.html "Film History Before 1920"], [[AMC Filmsite]], Chicago. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties for use of the improvised projection equipment. To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and projection equipment.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

===The Chicago independents push back===
Exhibitors and filmmakers who refused to pay the newly instituted fees were not stopped by this new legislation. Independent companies were formed outside of this trust almost immediately. Max Lewis, president of the Chicago Film Exchange, announced he would not comply with the $10 monthly licensing fee on projectors.&lt;ref&gt;"Declare War on Film Trust.: Five Cent Theater Men Organize for Resistance. Chicago Daily Tribune, 16 Jan 1909: 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 48 hours of the formation of the MPPC, a Chicago-based combine of independents, the International Projecting and Producing Company (IPPC), formed to counter the MPPC's stranglehold. The IPPC, headed by the John J. Murdoch, general manager of the [[Western Vaudeville Managers' Association]], dramatically announced the firm's formation with a $2 million base in the Feb. 6, 1909, issue of ''Show World'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Moving Picture War is Declared: Independents Organized by J. J. Murdock for Fight on "Film Trust." Chicago Daily Tribune 05 Feb 1909: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals risked their own livelihood by operating independently.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  The major companies in the trust could sue any of these firms for violation of patent rights.

==Boom of the Chicago film industry==

===1900s===

[[File:BBA Lantern Slide.jpg|thumb|An Advertisement for a western produced by Essanay founder, Brocho Billy Anderson]]

Chicago became a leader in motion pictures with innovative trailblazers and an interested public. In 1907, Chicago had more theaters per capita than any other city in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  Nickelodeons or five-cent theaters became extremely popular with the number of venues growing each year until the Great Depression. These theaters quenched the public's thirst for film and created solid neighborhood relations.

Revolutionary in Chicago's film industry was the establishment of rental houses or film exchanges; in 1907, Chicago had more than 15 film exchange houses, such as The Stereopticon &amp; Film Exchange, William Swanson &amp; Company, Chicago Projecting Company, and the International Projecting and Producing Company, formed by JJ Murdoch as an independent Chicago-based exchange. These rental houses allowed exhibitors to borrow films at a reduced cost than actually purchasing them.&lt;ref name="Dirks"/&gt;  This movement revolutionized motion picture viewership. It allowed patrons access to a wide array of films. The average viewer could now experience a variety of film disciplines for a small consumer cost. Rental houses also enabled theaters to change films frequently, keeping the film consumer interested. Chicago quickly became the leading film distribution market in the entire United States with control of 80% of the market in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;

Movie production also boomed. Production companies, like the Essanay Studios and the [[Selig Polyscope Company]], dominated the film landscape. These two firms employed hundreds of people and churned out hundreds of films every year. Filmmakers shot their films outdoors due to the need for ample lighting with the primitive camera equipment. Sets took up entire city blocks at a time. The banks of the [[Chicago River]] were often used as a set for the westerns Anderson trademarked.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Motion pictures were valued differently in the early era of film. Modern films are highly valued with vast amounts of resources being poured into the production value. In the early 1900s, films were viewed as products with a studio releasing multiple films per week.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;

==Decline of the Chicago film industry==

===1920s===
The Chicago film industry met decline for a combination of reasons. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established to protect the major players in the industry, actually promoted the birth of independent ventures.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  These ventures sought to circumvent payment to the companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company trust. Independent firms granted creative license to the actor and often competed with the major firms despite the significantly lower budget. To avoid litigation by the Motion Picture Patents Company for patent violation, many independent firms moved west, literally out of the reach of the major production companies.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

In addition to the avoidance of legal trouble, [[California]] was perfect for film making in other respects as well. Weather was notably milder compared to the unpredictability of Chicago's climate. This enabled production to move at a steady pace with greater consistency.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  The scenery of the west also attracted many production companies. California is made up of a diverse landscape of natural settings while Chicago offered a monotone set of plains. Filmmakers followed in the footsteps of G.M. Anderson with the desire to film westerns within the natural mountainous habitat.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

==Revival==

===1920s to present===
Despite the transition from Chicago to Hollywood in the 1920s, Chicago remained on the map. Citizens retained an insatiable appetite for motion pictures, even though production had left the city. Chicago boasted the largest chain of theaters during the studio era (1919‚Äì1952).&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt; The Balaban and Katz chain, once small west-side exhibitors, bloomed their business into a citywide phenomena. [[Balaban and Katz]] owned movie and stage palaces such as the [[Chicago Theatre]], [[Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre]], and [[Balaban and Katz Uptown Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt; High-profile film companies such as [[MGM]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[Republic]], [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[RKO]], and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] all held offices in Chicago.

Movie production again entered Chicago in the 1980 with the state of [[Illinois]] becoming a leader in money spent on film production. Notable films from the 1980s include ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]], [[The Color of Money]], [[Risky Business]], [[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]], [[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'', and ''[[When Harry Met Sally]].'' Feature film directors returned to the city including [[Dan Aykroyd]] and the [[Belushi family]] (''[[Blues Brothers]], [[About Last Night...|About Last Night]]'', and ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''), [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] (''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' and ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''), and [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]] (''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' and ''[[Chain Reaction (1996 film)|Chain Reaction]]'').&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;

Chicago further fostered its new production boom with the passage of an Illinois bill in 2009. This bill provides a 30% tax credit on all production costs within the state of Illinois.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy, Dan. [http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=170338''Illinois Tax Credit put Chicago Film Industry Back on the Map'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Medill Reports Chicago]]'', Chicago, 13 October 2010. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since instituting this law in 2009, many filmmakers have committed to Chicago for production. Recent films with Chicago as a filming location include ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'', and ''[[Source Code]]''. The new bill is supposed to benefit Chicago with increased tax revenue from $70 million in 2009 to $100 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6948">[[File:Cinemas in Antananarivo Madagascar.JPG|thumb|Former cinemas in Antananarivo]]
The '''Cinema of Madagascar''' refers to the film industry in [[Madagascar]].

The most notable director is [[Raymond Rajaonarivelo]], director of movies such as ''Quand Les Etoiles Rencontrent La Mer'' (''When the Stars Meet the Sea'') and ''Tabataba'' (''The Spreading of Rumors'').&lt;ref name="HealeLatif2008"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJWLCYGo2RgC&amp;pg=PA111|title=Madagascar|last2=Latif|first2=Zawiah Abdul|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7614-3036-0|page=111|last1=Heale|first1=Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest cinematographic production entirely produced in Madagascar by a Malagasy is a 22 minutes black and white movie entitled ''Rasalama Martiora'' (Rasalama, the Martyr). Directed in 1937 by the deacon Philippe Raberojo, it marked the centenary of the death of the Protestant martyr [[Rafaravavy Rasalama]]. Philippe Raberojo was the president of an association of French citizens of Malagasy origin, where he had access to a 9,5mm camera. Thus he was able to realise his film. The complete version is lost.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kolosary Cin√©ma Malagasy ‚Äì Madagascar en 11 Films|last=|first=|publisher=Institut Fran√ßais, Ile de France|year=2016|isbn=|location=Madagascar|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years Madagascar was crisis-shaken by several political overthrows. In 1960 Madagascar regained its independence, but still suffers from political instability. This complicated post-colonial period not only led to the closure or transformation of the country's cinemas into places of religious worship. Also almost the whole film industry was razed to the ground. Till today still there is no public cinema in Madagascar.

The film industry started to recover slowly around the year 2006 also due to the founding of [[Rencontres du Film Court Madagascar]] (RFC). Till today the RFC is Madagascar's only Film Festival.

Most Malagasy productions receive no public funding; nevertheless, around 60 short films and 1 or 2 feature films are made each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Malagasy language, the word ‚Äúcinema‚Äù is translated ‚ÄúSarimihetsika‚Äù which literally means ‚Äúmoving image‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Dance/Electronic Singles Sales''' (previously known as '''Hot Dance Singles Sales''' and '''Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales''') was a chart released weekly by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in the United States, established in 1985. It measured the sale of commercially released singles that deal with [[dance music]] and remixes.

The Hot Dance Singles Sales once included non-dance songs and singles without dance remixes if they were released as [[maxi single]]s, including singles by such artists as the [[Industrial metal]] band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[alternative rock]] band [[The Smiths]]. It was felt that this rule misled the chart's purpose of measuring the sales of dance music, and thus non-dance/non-remix maxi singles have more recently been excluded from this chart. As a result, although many non-dance acts release singles today in the maxi single format, they are not included in this chart unless the single includes dance remixes. 

At first when the chart was introduced, it had a 50-song chart position. By 2001, it was reduced to 25 and after the introduction of the Dance Airplay Chart in 2003 was reduced even further to its current 10-song chart position. They were also featured alongside the Dance Club Play Chart in the print edition of ''Billboard'' until 2003, when it became online only through Billboard.biz. On January 17, 2013, Billboard added a new chart, ''[[Dance/Electronic Songs]]'', which tracks the 50 most popular Dance and Electronic singles and tracks based on club play, single sales, radio airplay, digital downloads, and online streaming as reported on the Dance Club Songs, Dance/Mix Show Airplay, Dance Single Sales, and Dance/Electronic Digital Songs component charts. 

''Billboard'' discontinued the chart after 2013, as it was incorporated into the [[Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart and due to the decreasing number of vinyl sales.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

'''Decoder Ring Theatre''' is a Toronto-based theatre and audio production company that runs a Parsec Award and Podcast Award-winning [[podcast]] of the same name. It consists primarily of two series, ''[[Red Panda Adventures]]'' and ''[[Black Jack Justice]]'', both of which are done in the style of [[old-time radio]], and are released on alternating weeks.

== History ==
The group was first formed in 1999 by the actor-writer Gregg Taylor for a six-part mini-series take on the adventure programs of 1940s radio. (See ‚ÄúOriginal Red Panda mini-series‚Äù below). The programs were created as a pilot project for traditional broadcast, and were quite broad and silly in the belief that a comic approach might broaden their commercial potential. They were never broadcast.

Taylor's next project returned to the theatre, and was also radio-based, leading him to keep using the ‚ÄúDecoder Ring‚Äù name. The original ''Black Jack Justice'' was a one-act farce about a very, very bad day in the life of an old-time detective radio series. The show was a great success at the 2001 Toronto Fringe Festival, and led Taylor to continue under the Decoder Ring Theatre title. The next year the company returned to the Fringe with ''Prometheus Unplugged'', a comic take on the Promethean legends in which Mankind returns to Prometheus' mountain to inform God that he does not exist. Needless to say, God was less than thrilled.

The company was officially incorporated that year, and began a series of comic murder-mysteries to raise revenue for future projects. The series included ''Murder Most Deadly'', ''Death on the Avon'' and ''The Case of the Cockeyed Cupid''. It was at this point that the company launched the first version of its website, decoderringtheatre.com, and included MP3 versions of the almost-forgotten ''Red Panda'' mini-series. Soon it was receiving -email from all over the world{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} asking for more, and Taylor began the long process of accumulating scripts, equipment and performers for an ongoing podcast audio drama series.

A new, completely re-invented ''Red Panda'' continuity was launched as ''The Red Panda Adventures'', losing the parody and playing much straighter to the conventions of old-time radio and comic books. The eponymous play-within-a-play from ''Black Jack Justice'' was revived, with its battling central characters, and launched as a sister show. On October 15, 2005, Decoder Ring Theatre officially left behind the greasepaint and empty chairs of the theatre for the Internet.

In 2006, the podcast was nominated for a [[Parsec Award]]s for [[Parsec Awards#Best Audio Drama (Short)|Best Audio Drama (short)]], specifically for ''The Red Panda Adventures'',&lt;ref name="Parsec2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parsecawards.com/nominees.html |title=Parsec Awards Website |accessdate=September 24, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822181202/http://www.parsecawards.com/nominees.html |archivedate=August 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also one of the final five nominees for the [[People's Choice Podcast Awards]]' "Cultural/Arts" category.

===Deck Gibson, Far Reach Commander===
'''Old series'''&lt;br&gt;
In summer 2007, Decoder Ring Theatre released the ''Summer Showcase'', an anthology featuring six new podcasts showcasing stories by different writers. The most popular of these were two episodes of the space opera ''Deck Gibson, Far Reach Commander'', written and created by Parsec Award-winning author Matt Wallace (''The Failed Cities Monologues'').

In summer 2008, six new episodes of Deck Gibson were introduced. The podcast chronicles the adventures of Deck Gibson as he follows the mission of the Far Reach Fleet: to explore, to discover, to defend. Now he soars beyond frontiers of the galaxy never before seen by human eyes.

On June 27, 2013, an ebook by Matt Wallace (creator) entitled ''Deck Gibson: The Complete Scripts'' was released on Amazon.com. As of April 2014, however, no more episodes of Deck Gibson have been produced.

The '''diabolo''' ({{IPAc-en|d|iÀê|Àà|√¶|b|…ô|l|o ä}} {{respell|dee|AB|…ô-loh}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/diabolo|title=Diabolo - Define Diabolo at  Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly misspelled ''diablo'') is a [[juggling]] or [[circus skills|circus]] [[juggling prop|prop]] consisting of an [[axle]] ({{Lang-en-GB|bobbin}}) and two [[cone|cups]] (hourglass/egg timer shaped) or [[cylinder|discs]] derived from the '''Chinese yo-yo'''. This object is [[rotation|spun]] using a [[twine|string]] attached to two hand sticks ("batons" or "wands"). A large variety of tricks are possible with the diabolo, including [[toss (juggling)|tosses]], and various types of interaction with the sticks, string, and various parts of the user's body. Multiple diabolos can be spun on a single string.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Charlie (1996). ''Juggling'', p.56. Grange Books. {{ISBN|9781856278898}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like the Western [[yo-yo]], it maintains its spinning motion through a rotating effect based on [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]].

===Origin===
Chinese archaeologists theorize that the Chinese Diabolos (or Chinese yo-yo) originated from the Chinese spinning top. In the [[Hemudu culture|Hemudu Excavation]], wooden tops were excavated. In order to extend the spinning time of the tops, whips were used to spin the top. This released a sound, and gradually evolved into the term "Kongzhu" ({{zh|s=Á©∫Á´π|t=Á©∫Á´π|hp=K≈çng zh√∫|l=Air Bamboo}}). It was speculated that the Chinese poet [[Cao Zhi]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period had composed the poem "Rhapsody of Diabolos „ÄäÁ©∫Á´πËµã„Äã", making it the first record of Diabolo in Chinese history. The authenticity of the poem "Rhapsody of Diabolos „ÄäÁ©∫Á´πËµã„Äã" however required further research and evidence of proof. By the [[Tang dynasty]], the Chinese Diabolo became widespread as a form of toy. However the Chinese scholar Wu Shengda Âê≥ÁõõÈÅî, who lived in Taiwan, argued that records of Chinese Diabolo only appeared during late [[Ming dynasty]] [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] period, with its details well recorded in the book ''[[Dijing Jingwulue]]'', referring to Diabolos as "Kong Zhong" ({{zh|s=Á©∫Èíü|t=Á©∫Èêò|hp=K≈çng zhong|l=Air Bell}}).

===Spread to the West===
Chinese yo-yos have a longer axle with discs on either end, while the diabolo has a very short axle and larger, round cups on either end.{{citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=claim regarding classes of objects.}} Diabolos are made of different materials and come in different sizes and weights.

There are many names in the [[Chinese language]] for the Chinese yo-yo:

* {{zh|s=Á©∫Èíü|t=Á©∫Èêò|hp=k≈çngzh≈çng|l=sky bell|links=no}}

The first mention of a diabolo in the Western World was made by a missionary, Father Amiot, in Beijing in 1792 during [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]]'s ambassadorship, after which examples where brought to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://diabolart.free.fr/histoire.html History]", ''DiabolArt.Free.Fr''. {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]] (eventually adapted to the [[harmonica]] and [[accordion]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.crosssound.com/CS00/CS00Instruments/CSTHEACCORDION/accordionENG.html The Accordion]", ''CrossSound.com''.

The diabolo was part of a presentation of Chinese culture edited by stenographer {{ill|Jean-Baptiste Joseph Breton|fr|Jean-Baptiste Joseph Breton de la Martini√®re|vertical-align=sup}} in 1811-2 (''La Chine en miniature''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chineancienne.fr/breton-de-la-martiniere-la-chine-en-miniature/ Jean-Baptiste Breton de la Martini√®re (1777-1852)]", ''ChineAncienne.fr''. {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The toy's popularity waxed and waned throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museediabolo.fr/histoire3.DB.htm#histoire3.DB History of the Diabolo]", ''MuseeDiabolo.fr''. {{Fr icon}} Cites: "Diabolo", ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', Volume 8, 1911 and ''Popular Science'', D√©cembre 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 the diabolo "was all the rage&lt;!--"Ce jouet, qui a fait fureur en 1812"--&gt;"; then it "enjoyed an ephemeral vogue&lt;!--"Apres avoir joui d'une vogue ephemere"--&gt;" until it "finally fell into discredit&lt;!--"est tombe dans le...discredit."--&gt;" some time before 1861.&lt;ref name="Duckett"/&gt; Some consider the toy dangerous; injuries and deaths of players and bystanders have been claimed; and [[Pr√©fet de Police]] [[Louis L√©pine]] once outlawed the game in the streets of Paris.&lt;ref name="Diabolart"&gt;"[http://diabolart.free.fr/histoire.html History]", ''Diabolart.Free.Fr''. {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "diabolo" was coined by French engineer [[Gustave Phillippart]], who developed the modern diabolo in the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', 1958 ed. {{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although credit has also been given to [[Charles Burgess Fry]] (''The Outdoor Magazine'' in 1906) or Fry and Phillippart.&lt;ref name="Diabolart"/&gt; The term is derived the name from the Greek ''dia bolo'', roughly meaning "across throw". "In Greek, the term 'diaballo' means to throw across. It comes from a combination of 'dia' meaning across or through (as in the {{underline|dia}}meter of a circle, a line that crosses circle), and 'bolla' or originally 'ballo' which means to throw..."&lt;!--underline in source--&gt;&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Todd (1990). ''The Devil Stick Book'', p.100 and 103. B. Dube. {{ISBN|9780917643071}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word "diabolos" (the [[devil]], originally "the liar" or "the one that commits perjury", from the verb "diaballo", which means "to throw in", "to generate confusion", "to divide", or "to make someone fall", later used by Christian writers as "the liar that speaks against God"), from which many modern languages' words for "devil" (French: ''jeu de diable'',&lt;ref name="Notions"&gt;(1907).

McCready.&lt;/ref&gt; ''diable'', Italian: ''diavolo'', Spanish: ''diablo'', Portuguese: ''diabo'', German: ''Teufel'', Polish: ''diabe≈Ç'') derive, is unrelated. The term "loriot" was used in England,&lt;ref&gt;"Devil's Game is Coming," ''The Scrapbook'' (New York: Frank A. Munsey Company, 1907), vol. 4, part 1, p. 609-609.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "rocket-ball".&lt;ref name="Notions"/&gt;

Confusion about the provenance of the name may have arisen from the earlier name "the devil on two sticks", although nowadays this often also refers to another [[circus]]-based skill toy, the [[devil stick]]. "In time 'diabolo' was retained for the spinning version of the Chinese stick toy while the hitting version of the stick toy was rendered into English as the Devil Stick."&lt;ref name="Strong"/&gt;

"Phillipart claimed ''Diabolo'' to be his invention. In reality, he had improved a Napoleonic toy, which in turn had originated long ago in China."&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Orbanes, Philip (2004). ''The Game Makers: The Story of Parker Brothers from Tiddledy Winks to Trivial Pursuit'', p.47-8. Harvard Business. {{ISBN|9781591392699}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Charles Parker gained the U.S. license for the term ''diabolo'' in 1906, and the excessive fad for the toy lasted until 1910 (caricatures of public figures with the toy made it to newspapers), hurt greatly by a glut of unsold poor quality off-brand versions (costs ranged from one to eight dollars), and the toy was even removed from the Parker Brothers catalogue, a rare occurrence (its two-year return in 1929 also failed).&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Another estimate for the fad is 1910 to 1915,&lt;ref name="Popular"&gt;Rouse, Stewart; Louisiana (December 1955).

==Design==
[[File:ANASTASINI FAMILY mit Diabolos aus USA 01.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Anastasini Circus|Anastasini Diabolos]] with large diabolo (2011)]]

A diabolo is described as, "a double-coned [[bobbin]] that [is] twirled, tossed, and caught on a string secured by two wands, one held in each hand,"&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; and, more generally, as "an object that can be suspended on a string made taut by two held sticks".&lt;ref name="Middle"&gt;Hirt, Mary and Ramos, Irene (2008). ''Maximum Middle School Physical Education'', p.123. Human Kinetics. {{ISBN|9780736057790}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese yo-yo, often considered a type of diabolo, has been described as, "a short round wooden stick with two round disks, 1.5 cm thick with a space between them, attached on either end of the stick...It will rotate on a string, each end tied to a thin stick,"&lt;ref name="Shanghai"&gt;Woo, X. L. (2013). ''Old Shanghai and the Clash of Revolution'', p.22. Algora. {{ISBN|9780875869988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and as, "two hollow discs of light wood, with openings in the sides, united by a peg tapering to its center".&lt;ref name="Notions"/&gt;

As with the yo-yo, the design of the diabolo has varied through history and across the world. Chinese diabolos have been made of bamboo. Wooden diabolos were common in Victorian times in Britain. Rubber diabolos were first patented by Gustave Phillippart in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diabolo Patent|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US822628|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late twentieth century a rubberised plastic material was first used. Metal has also been used especially for fire diabolos. "Parker Brothers used steel for the bobbins [axles], with molded rubber ends, and also made some versions out of hollow [[Celluloid]]--which, because of its '[[friction]]less' properties, spun even faster than steel."&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Holes and metal strips alter the sound of the spinning diabolo,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museediabolo.fr/Archive_Mai_2012.q.htm#Archive_Mai_2012.q Spotlight on The song of diabolos]", ''MuseeDiabolo.fr''.&lt;/ref&gt; but create friction.

The size and weight of diabolos varies. Diabolos with more weight tend to retain their [[momentum]] for longer, whereas small, light diabolos can be thrown higher and are easier to accelerate to high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Darbyshire, Lydia; ed. (1993). ''Juggling'', p.76. Siddall, Jeremy; illustrations. Courage. {{ISBN|1-56138-224-8}}. "The heavier and larger ones are the most versatile."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rubber]] diabolos are less prone to breakage but are more prone to deformations. More commonly used are [[plastic]]-rubber hybrids that allow flex but hold their shape. The size of the disc or cone varies, as do the presence and size of holes in the discs or cones which may alter the sound produced. In yo-yos a cone is known as the [[butterfly yo-yo|butterfly shape]]. Regardless of the presence, size, and shape, "once a diabolo is spinning, the friction of the spinning diabolo against the string creates a whining sound; this is called 'making the diabolo sing.'"&lt;ref name="Middle"/&gt; "When played hard, the [Chinese] yoyo will give out a sharp shrill sound...The shrill sound would add an exciting atmosphere to the [Shanghai winter] festivals...A skillful player can use a pot cover [with a round handle] as a yoyo [without sound]."&lt;ref name="Shanghai"/&gt; A fast whirling kouen-gen produces, "a shrill whistling sound...not unlike the note of the steam siren."&lt;ref name="Notions"/&gt; Diabolos with only one cup ("monobolos") are also used.

== Basic principles ==
The most basic act of diabolo manipulation is to spin it on the string. "The string is placed between the circles, but in order for the diabolo to balance, it must maintain a spinning motion, much like a yo-yo."&lt;ref name="Middle"/&gt; However, "considerably more skill is needed to twirl a diabolo...than the Yo-yo it resembles,"&lt;ref name="Popular"/&gt; and, "the enthusiasts in the game assert that it takes much higher training of eye and muscle than [[lawn tennis]]."&lt;ref name="Notions"/&gt; "Diabolo requires hard practice and highly developed skills, and deserves its independent status."&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Wun-siou quoted in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GL0wAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=diabolo+chinese+yoyo&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=diabolo Taiwan Review, Volume 58]'' (2008), p.53. Kwang Hwa.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the user pulls the stick in his or her dominant hand so that the string moves along the axle, turning it. "The player...swing[s] the string right and left."&lt;ref name="Shanghai"/&gt; By doing this repeatedly and rapidly the diabolo rotates faster. The diabolo spin can be accelerated more quickly using various methods: the 'whip' rotates the diabolo faster by moving one handstick in front of the user's body and past the other handstick, the 'wrap' rotates the diabolo faster when the user wraps a loop of the string around the axle. Both methods increase the amount of string contact with the axle in any given time.

{{Quote|To spin the top, you raise and lower the sticks alternately, with a quick backward shift of the string at the end of each rotating impulse. When the speed is great enough to stabilize the top in flight, just whip the sticks apart to toss it into the air. As the spool comes down you catch it on a sloping string and let it roll down into slack bunched near one end.&lt;ref name="Popular"/&gt;}}

Once spin speed is increased to a sufficient level that the diabolo is stable, the user can then perform tricks. "Skillful players can set it whirling at a rate of 2,000 revolutions a minute, it is said."&lt;ref name="Notions"/&gt; Depending on how long a trick takes to perform, the user will normally have to spend some time increasing the spin speed of the diabolo before performing other tricks. Skilled users can perform multiple tricks while maintaining the spin speed of the diabolo. "A skilled person [can] catch it, hurl it fifty or sixty feet into the air, then catch it again with little effort."&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt;

== Tricks and styles ==

=== Fundamental tricks ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="width: 250px;" | Name !! Description
|-
| '''Toss''' || The diabolo is tossed in the air and then caught. The diabolist can do a turn in place or a skip over the string while the diabolo is in the air.
|-
| '''Trapeze/stopover''' || The diabolo goes under a stick and the stick touches the string, making the diabolo swing around the stick and land back on the string.
|-
| '''Cats cradle/spiderweb''' || This trick starts with a trapeze. The stick not in the trapeze is inserted between the strings on either side of the stick in the trapeze. The diabolo is tossed into the air, and the strings form an X. The diabolo is caught on the X, and then it can be tossed and caught again.
|-
| '''Suicide/stick release''' || Any trick in which the performer releases one stick, and catches it again. The stick may swing around the diabolo.
|-
| '''Grind''' || The spinning diabolo is balanced on a stick.
|-
| '''Sun''' || The diabolo is swung around in a large circle around both sticks, finishing with 2 twists of string above the diabolo. A sun in the opposite direction undoes this twist. There are many different types of suns; this is the most basic.
|-
| '''Orbits/satellites''' || The diabolo orbits around a body part such as the leg or waist.
|-
| '''Knot/magic knot''' || The line is tangled so as to create the illusion that the diabolo is knotted. It can usually be released with an upward toss motion.
|-
| '''Elevator/ladybug''' || The diabolo climbs up the string; this is done by wrapping the string around the axle and pulling tight.
|-
| '''Coffee grinder''' || The diabolo is caught on the underside of the string, and then the string is looped over one stick. From there, the diabolo is tossed multiple times over the stick.
|-
| '''Umbrella''' || The diabolo is swung and jerked side to side over both sticks, forming the outline of an umbrella.
|-
| '''Files''' || The performer puts both sticks in the left hand, swings the diabolo over the finger and back onto the string so there is a trapeze-like tangle, throws the sticks under the finger and catches them again.
|-
| '''Steam engine''' || The performer pulls the string down the side of the left stick and holds it with the left hand, then brings the right stick over the left and inside the loop created. The right stick is moved in a small circle pushing at the loop, which makes the diabolo jump.
|}

=== Advanced tricks ===
There are countless tricks and variations that fall outside the above categories; these are often more difficult and form the cutting edge of modern diabolo routines. Some examples are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="width: 250px;" | Name !! Description
|-
| '''Genocide''' || Any trick in which the stick is released and the diabolo leaves the string. The diabolo is subsequently caught on the string again, and the stick is caught again.
|-
| '''Whip catch''' || The diabolo is tossed into the air and caught with a whipping motion of the string towards the diabolo.
|-
| '''Finger grind''' || The spinning diabolo is balanced on a finger. This is best done with a bearing or triple bearing diabolo.
|-
| '''Infinite suicides''' || The diabolo appears to be suspended while one stick repeatedly orbits it, and the other stick travels in circles around the diabolo.
|-
| '''Slack whips''' || The stick or sticks are flicked in such a way that a loop of slack in the string is made; this then passes around the diabolo and/or sticks to attain a range of different string mounts.
|-
| '''Excalibur/vertical''' || A series of tricks in which the diabolo is turned vertical. Many tricks normally done outside of vertical can also be done in vertical.
|-
| '''Integral''' || Any trick in which both sticks are released while the string is held.
|-
| '''Star Cradle''' || The strings are twisted into a star-shaped pattern.
|}

=== Multiple diabolos ===
[[File:Diabolo juggler in Ueno Koen.jpg|thumb|right|Diaboloist in [[Ueno Park]] performing a 3-diabolo shuffle (2006)]]

Perhaps the most active area of development for diabolo performance involves tricks with more than one diabolo on a single string. When manipulating multiple diabolos "low", the diabolos orbit continuously on the string in a "shuffle". Shuffles are either synchronous (commonly referred to as "sync") or asynchronous ("async"), depending on whether the diaboloist's hands' movements occur simultaneously or not; shuffles may also be performed with only one hand.

Juggling multiple diabolos "high" involves continuously catching and throwing a number of diabolos, never with more than one diabolo on the string simultaneously. Diaboloists have pushed the number of diabolos juggled at once up to six "high" (although there is some controversy as to whether this counts as the number of catches achieved is so small) and five "low".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = 6 diabolos + New record|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nk25FtdS4Q|date = 2013-11-10|accessdate = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Black Sheep|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMxjOKDJGCQ|date = 2013-10-11|accessdate = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most diaboloists, however, stick to using only two or three diabolos at once. The introduction of multiple diabolos on a single string allows for many new moves. Many are applications of one-diabolo moves to multiple diabolos.

;Accelerations
:The diabolos are accelerated while they wrap and the diaboloist's dominant hand is pulled up in order to gain speed. Doing a Chinese acceleration or shuffling the diabolos very quickly are two other methods of accelerating diabolos.
;Hyperloop/sprinkler
:The diabolos orbit each other inside a closed loop of string.
;Columns/mini-columns
:Two diabolos are bounced up and down on the string.
;Cascade and reverse cascade (also possible with juggling)
:Three diabolos are bounced/thrown around in a cascade or reverse cascade pattern.
;[[Siteswap]]
:This is a notation borrowed from toss juggling in which the diabolos are thrown in different rhythms based on a numeric description. However, it uses a different system of numeric rhythms compared to toss juggling as diabolos uses one "hand" as string when toss juggling uses two hands to throw the object juggled.
;Fan
:Two diabolos are spun between the arms in a way which mimics the blades of a fan. While the diabolos rotate they do not switch positions on the string.
;Sun
:The diabolos are swung in a circle.
;Suicide
:Multiple-diabolo suicides are similar to one-diabolo suicides, but some tricks are not possible.
;Knots
:Multiple-diabolo knots are similar to one-diabolo knots, but both diabolos are wrapped up.
;Stalls
:This is where both diabolos are still spinning but not in shuffle. This allows the diaboloist to do a trick with the other.

=== Vertax ===
Another advanced diabolo style is ''vertax'' (vertical axis; also known as "Excalibur"). This is where the diabolo is "turned vertically" by means of "whipping" and is continually spun in this upright state. The person spinning it needs to rotate their body to keep up with the constant whipping action due to the momentum and centripetal motion at which the diabolo spins. Although the number of tricks seems limited, people are finding more ways to perform with this style, including vertax genocides, infinite suicides, and many suns, orbits, and satellites. It is also possible to have two diabolos in one string in vertax, this feat has been achieved by diabolo duo Tr'espace and a small number of other diaboloists. It has also been done in the form of a fan. Most of these tricks are accomplished by street performers in competitions, notably the GEDC and the Taipei PEC. Some cutting-edge skilled vertax jugglers include William (Wei-Liang) Lin (in 2006, ranked #1 in the world), Ryo Yabe (multiple diabolos), Higami (a Japanese juggling group, noted for inventing the first 'infinite suicide vertax'), and Jonathan P. Chen (noted for inventing the vertax genocide); these jugglers are former and multiple winners of the above-mentioned cups. Eric and Antonin (France) and Nate and Jacob Sharpe (USA) have contributed greatly to the development of vertax passing techniques. Finally, Alexis Levillon invented many vertax tricks including vertax integrals, furthered multidiabolo vertax, and has also invented the "Galexis" style, where one diabolo is horizontal, while the other is in vertax.

=== Contact diabolo ===
This is a relatively recent style of diabolo that is gaining popularity. It utilizes the diabolo so that it has little or no spin at all. Then it can be caught and passed and manipulated with different parts of the body instead of just the sticks and string. It has new possibilities and new ideas are arising from this. Examples include catching the diabolo between one's arm and the stick before throwing it back. Tricks with multiple diabolos have also been developed.

=== Loop diabolo ===
Instead of having two sticks connected by a string, the diabolo is manipulated on a loop of string held around the hands. This opens up a variety of new tricks. Yo-yo type slack tricks can also be performed in a loop.

=== Monobolo ===
Monobolo is a variation of the diabolo where instead of having two diabolo cups, there is only one and a weight on the other side. The monobolo can be used in the same fashion as normal diabolos. However, if a monobolo is put into excalibur, or horizontally, monobolos can be manipulated to be like a [[spinning top]]. To start a monobolo, twist the string around the axle and then let it gain some speed.

== Performances ==
[[File:Diabolo.mail.JPG|thumb|Diabolo juggling]]

[[Cirque du Soleil]] combines diabolos with acrobatics during feature acts in five shows: ''[[Quidam]]'', ''[[La Nouba]]'', ''[[Dralion]]'', ''[[Ovo (Cirque du Soleil)|Ovo]]'' ''and [[Viva Elvis#Acts|Viva Elvis]].''

In 2012 the [[Viva Elvis#Acts|Viva Elvis]] Casino show in Las Vegas, added a Diabolo Duet act, which includes Trevor Nassler &amp; Maria Wolf.

In 2006 [[Circus Smirkus]] presented a duo diabolo act starring Jacob and Nate Sharpe, with advanced tricks including the first double sprinkler pass in a performance as well as some five-diabolo passing.

The diabolo programs of many Chinese schools provide performances during the Chinese New Year or near the end of the school year.

'''DoCo''' is a [[Pop music|pop]] group composed of five female ''[[Ranma ¬Ω]]'' [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actresses]]. The performances are done in-character. DoCo has released three albums: ''DoCo‚òÖFirst'', ''DoCo‚òÜSecond'', and ''DoCo Original Karaoke''. Some of the songs were translated and performed in English by DoCo U.S.A., the corresponding English language voice actors. Some of their songs were used as the opening and ending themes for the ''Ranma ¬Ω'' [[List of Ranma %C2%BD episodes#OVA Episodes .281993-1996.29|OVA]], as well as in music videos that accompanied the OVAs. A few songs (such as the DoCo version of [[Coco (group)|CoCo]]'s "Equal Romance") also appear on various ''Ranma ¬Ω'' musical albums.

DoCo is in some sense a parody of [[Coco (group)|CoCo]]. As "CoCo" can be taken to mean [[wikt:„Åì„Åì#Japanese|„Åì„Åì]] (koko, here), "DoCo" can be taken to mean [[wikt:„Å©„Åì#Japanese|„Å©„Åì]] (doko, where?).

'''''Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief''''' (also known as '''''Dr. Dolittle 4''''' or '''''Dr. Dolittle 4: Tail to the Chief''''') is a 2008 American [[comedy film]], starring [[Kyla Pratt]] and [[Norm Macdonald]]. Like its predecessor, ''[[Dr. Dolittle 3]]'' in 2006, it was released direct to DVD on March 4, 2008. It is the fourth film in the ''Dr. Dolittle'' series, and the second film in the series not to feature [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Doctor Dolittle]], or [[Raven-Symon√©]] as Charisse Dolittle, although Doctor Dolittle (but not Charisse Dolittle) has been mentioned in the film.

==Plot==
Maya Dolittle is the girl who can talk to animals; so can her older sister Charisse Dolittle and father John Dolittle. John is away on animal expeditions while Charisse Dolittle's fate remains unknown. When the President asks for him to help with the Presidential dog and save an African forest, Maya takes her father's place. The dog Daisy has a very hot temper but after a lot of trouble, they begin to get along.

At a dinner with the prince and princess of the kingdom that the forest is located in, things are going well until they suddenly take a turn for the worse. With the help of animals, Maya finds out Chief Dorian was sabotaging the prince to shut down the forest and make millions. He is arrested and the forest is saved.

'''''Frenzic''''' is a [[puzzle game]] released by [[The Iconfactory]] and [[ARTIS Software]] for [[Mac OS X]] on 17 February 2007 and later on the [[Nintendo]] [[DSiWare]] in November 2010. According to the game credits, the concept of the game was invented by German developer [[Wolfgang Ante]] who gave the idea to [[The Iconfactory]], and later did most of the programming for the game. ''Frenzic's'' tagline is, "Takes minutes to learn and months to master", which is heavily agreed on by its reviewers.&lt;ref name="frenzic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frenzic.com/|title=Frenzic official site|accessdate=2007-03-17|format=|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mac Observer Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macobserver.com/review/2007/02/26.1.shtml|title=Mac Observer Review|accessdate=2007-03-17|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars Technica Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/03/01/7268|title=Ars Technica Review|accessdate=2007-03-17|format=|work=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:FrenzicGameplay.jpg|left|thumb|''Frenzic's'' main window.]]
The objective of the game is to fill the six circles around the game board with different colored pie wedges that appear on screen before the timer runs out. When a circle is completed with six pie wedges, the wedges disappears, and points are earned for all wedges cleared from the circle. More points are credited when more wedges of the same color are cleared, and vice versa. However, if a wedge is not placed before the timer runs out, a life is lost, prompting the player to make quick decisions. As the game progresses, the timers speed runs faster, and the game ends when all four lives are used up.

A female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Maeve |title=Who plays video games and identifies as a ‚Äúgamer‚Äù |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/who-plays-video-games-and-identifies-as-a-gamer/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[reappropriation|reappropriated term]], while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes==
Although men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a [[stereotype]] that women are not considered ¬®True Gamers¬® because they tend to play more [[Casual game|casual games]] which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y|title=SpringerLink|last=|first=|date=|website=db16.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

*''Newbie'': ''[[Newbie]]'', (commonly shortened to "noob", "n00b", or "newb") is a slang term for a [[wikt:novice|novice]] or [[wikt:newcomer|newcomer]] to a certain game, or to gaming in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Misc/welaish.html |title=Masonry on the Internet |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/words-online-gaming-opinions-books-newbs.html|title=Gamer Speak for Newbs|work=Forbes|author=Anna Vander Broek|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Casual gamer'': The term ''casual gamer'' is often used for gamers who primarily play [[casual games]], but can also refer to gamers who play less frequently than other gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/30/core-and-casual-whats-the-difference/|title=Core and Casual: What‚Äôs the difference?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay, or play more involved games in short sessions, or at a slower pace than hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"/&gt; The types of game that casual gamers play vary, and they are less likely to own a dedicated video game console.&lt;ref&gt;Magrino, Tom, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result;title;1 GameStop: Casual gamers spurring hardcore holiday sales]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072417/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B1 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, GameSpot, Sep 11, 2007, Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyes, Emma, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 GDC '08: Are casual games the future?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000000/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, ''GameSpot'', Feb 18, 2008, Accessed May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of casual games include ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers, as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6695921|title=Women driving 'casual game' boom|first=Troy|last=Wolverton|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fitness gamer"s, who play motion-based exercise games, are also seen as casual gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://playstationlifestyle.net/2010/04/19/plethora-of-fitness-titles-lined-up-for-playstation-move/|title=Plethora of Fitness Titles Lined Up For PlayStation Move#|work=PlayStation LifeStyle|date=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Core gamer'': A core or mid-core gamer is a player with a wider range of interests than a casual gamer and is more likely to enthusiastically play different types of games,&lt;ref name="IwataAsksWiiU3definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/index.html?disableNav=true/#/e32011/newhw/0/6|title=Iwata Asks: E3 2011 Special Edition|page=7|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-06-09|quote='''Iwata''':  the definition of a core gamer is much wider, namely, someone who has a much wider range of interests, someone who enthusiastically plays many types of games that challenges different creative directions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer. The mid-core gamer enjoys games but may not finish every game they buy, doesn't have time for long MMO quests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/06/are-you-a-mid-core-gamer/|title=Are you a mid-core gamer?|publisher=[[joystiq.com]]|author=Scott Jon Siegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[target market|target consumer]].&lt;ref name="NextGeneration"&gt;{{cite web | title=GameStop | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1277&amp;Itemid=32 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203110531/http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1277&amp;Itemid=32 | archivedate=2007-12-03 | first=Colin | last=Campbell | date=2005-10-10 | work=Edge | publisher=Future| accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] stated that they designed the [[Wii U]] to cater to core gamers who are in between the casual and hardcore categories.&lt;ref name="IwataAsksWiiU3cater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/index.html?disableNav=true/#/e32011/newhw/0/6|title=Iwata Asks: E3 2011 Special Edition|page=7|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-06-09|quote='''Iwata''': On the other hand, I certainly do not think that Wii was able to cater to every gamer's needs, so that's also something I wanted to resolve. [...] The keyword for our presentation at this year's E3 is "Deeper and Wider". With Wii U, I would like to offer this proposal with that concept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of theories have been presented regarding the rise in popularity of mid-core games.  James Hursthouse, the founder of Roadhouse Interactive, credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces, whereas [[Jon Radoff]] of [[Disruptor Beam]] compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/9/4604088/the-rise-of-midcore-gaming|title=Core gamers, mobile games and the origins of the midcore audience|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hardcore gamer'': [[Ernest W. Adams|Ernest Adams]] and [[Scott Kim]] have proposed classification metrics to distinguish "hardcore gamers" from casual gamers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131397/from_casual_to_core_a_statistical_.php | title=From Casual to Core: A Statistical Mechanism for Studying Gamer Dedication | publisher=Gamasutra | work=Gamasutra | accessdate=17 June 2014 | author=Adams, Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing action, competition, complexity, gaming communities, and staying abreast of developments in hardware and software. Others have attempted to draw the distinction based primarily on which platforms a gamer prefers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/260885,the-problems-of-defining-a-hardcore-gamer.aspx|title=The problems of defining a hardcore gamer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to decry the entire concept of delineating casual from hardcore as divisive and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/10/22/call-of-duty-demonstrates-the-completely-fictitious-line-between-hardcore-and-casual-gaming/|title='Call of Duty' Demonstrates The Completely Fictitious Line Between Hardcore And Casual Gaming|first=Paul|last=Tassi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional gamer===
{{See also|eSports}}
[[Professional]] gamers generally play video games for [[prize]] [[money]] or [[salaries]]. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in [[competitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Schorn |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/19/60minutes/main1220146.shtml |title='Fatal1ty' article at CBS News |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly [[South Korea]] and [[China]], professional gamers and teams are [[sponsorship|sponsored]] by large companies and can earn more than {{USD|link=yes}}100,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/7/23/235053/081 |title=A Brief Look At Professional Gaming |publisher=kuro5hin.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Major League Gaming]] contracted several ''[[Halo 2]]'' players including [[Tom "Tsquared" Taylor]] and members of [[Team Final Boss]] with $250,000 USD yearly deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/mlg-awards-1-75-million-in-contracts-for-top-pro-gamers |title=MLG Awards $1.75 Million in Contracts for Top Pro Gamers (press release)|work=Major League Gaming |date=December 18, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrogamer===
{{Main|Retrogaming}}
A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, [[retro games]]‚Äîolder video games and [[arcade game]]s. They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification in taxonomies===

A number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:
* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.
* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[Glitch|glitches]], and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatar==
{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}
{{See also|Player character}}
An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Similarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==
A [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the "true gamer" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to "[[cinemaphile]]".&lt;ref name="escapistPublisherNote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play "enough" to qualify.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term "gamer", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

In August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named [[Gamergate controversy]]. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[Gamergate controversy]] concerns issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #GamerGate.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Demographics===
[[File:Hillary Rodham Clinton playing a Nintendo Game Boy video game on the flight from Austin en route to Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hillary Clinton]] playing a [[Nintendo Game Boy]] video game on a flight]]
Games are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-10-30-platform-not-gender-drives-gamer-differences-eedar|last=Nofziger|first=Heather|title=Platform, not gender, drives gamer differences
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/public-debates-about-gaming-and-gamers/|title=2. Public debates about gaming and gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt; Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by [[Nintendo marketing#Demographic shifts|Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics]].&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Market penetration of [[smartphones]] with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience,&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt;

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18‚Äì29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=Why ALL gamers matter ‚Äî my view as a female games analyst|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun ‚ÄòGamer‚Äô Label}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of [[hispanics]] identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of [[African-Americans]] and 7% of [[whites]].&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt; The competitive [[fighting game]] scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant.&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|last=Bowman|first=Rich|work=Polygon|title=Why the Fighting Game Community is Color Blind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]].&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"/&gt; Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt;

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarrazin|first=Vincent|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/video-games/article/casualisation-video-games|title=The Casualisation of Video Games|work=ina global|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of [[gameplay]] in established genres and franchises.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"/&gt; Compared to seminal titles like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'', more recent mass-market action games like the [[Call of Duty]] series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of [[interactive movie]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamerDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-22-years-on-doom-retains-the-ability-to-shock|last=Stewart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=22 years on, Doom retains the ability to shock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in [[retro games]] but missing from new releases.&lt;ref name="gamasutraAmnesiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20141009/227370/Amnesiac_Heroes_Why_are_we_abandoning_gaming_history.php|last=Pepe|first=Felipe|work=Gamasutra|title=Amnesiac Heroes: Why are we abandoning gaming history?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick|title=Constitutive tensions of gaming's field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Graeme|work=Gamestudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Keogh]], these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; Belying these trends, games including ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Minecraft]]'' have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnathonSwift/20140110/208440/quotDumbing_downquot.php|last=Swift|first=Johnathon|work=Gamasutra|title=Dumbing down}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are "just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]''"&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/|last=Harwell|first=Drew|work=The Washington Post|title=More women play video games than boys, and other surprising facts lost in the mess of Gamergate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls.&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"/&gt; [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]] argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref name="edgeDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |work=Edge |title=Too many gamers think diversity means dumbing down ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to forget that outmoded view |date=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713174818/http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage Week''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: '''Seachtain na hOidhreachta''') is an annual nationwide set of hundreds of events organized by the [[Heritage Council]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ireland.com/entertainment/art/heritage-week/267370 Heritage Week], [http://www.ireland.com/ Ireland.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

They are a celebration of Ireland's culture, history, gardens, and architecture that gives visitors free access to landmarks that are either usually pay to enter or not open to the public. The week's attractions usually includes tours, events and activities related to history and culture.

Heritage Week is part of the [[European Heritage Days]], a joint action between the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehd.coe.int/  European Heritage Days: A joint action of the Council of Europe and the European Commission], [[Council of Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a volunteer programme associated with the organization of the events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/news-press/media/press-releases/national-heritage-week-launches-volunteer-programme/ National Heritage Week launches volunteer programme], [http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/ The Heritage Council], Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isabella Andreini''' (Padua, 1562 ‚Äì 10 June 1604),&lt;ref&gt;Savoia 2008, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Isabella Da Padova''', was an Italian actress and writer. Considered beautiful, elegant, and well educated, she was one of the most famous performers of her time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition|last=Richmond|first=Hugh Macrae|publisher=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabella Andreini was a member of the ''[[I Gelosi|Compagnia dei Comici Gelosi]]'', an important [[Touring theatre|touring theatre company]] that performed for the highest social circles of Italy and France. Famous in her time, and ever distinguished alike for her acting and her character, the [[Isabella (commedia dell'arte)|role of Isabella]] of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', was named after her.

==Life==
[[File:Portrait of a Woman with a Dog - Veronese - Museo Thyssen.jpg|thumb|left|Presumed portrait by [[Paolo Veronese]], {{Circa|1585}}‚Äì1588&lt;ref&gt;Aliverti 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Isabella Andreini was born '''Isabella Canali''' in [[Padua]], to [[Venice|Venetian]] parents.

Although her family was poor, Isabella received a complete classical education.  She was very interested in literary culture and became fluent in several languages&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Great Lives from History: Renaissance &amp; Early Modern Era, 1454‚Äì1600|last=Moose|first=Christina|publisher=Salem Press Incorporated|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58765-211-0|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she put to use in her ''La Pazzia d'Isabella'' ([[The Divine Madness of Isabella]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrenti|first=Anne-Marie|date=2015-08-01|title=Mad-Hot Madrigals: Selections from the Rime (1601) of Late Sixteenth-Century Diva Isabella Andreini (1562‚Äì1604)|journal=Italian Studies|volume=70|issue=3|pages=298‚Äì310|doi=10.1179/0075163415Z.000000000103|issn=0075-1634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1576, at age fourteen, Isabella Andreini was hired by the troupe of [[Flaminio Scala]], the ''[[Compagnia dei Comici Gelosi]]''. The Gelosi was a well-established theatre company that performed both scripted and unscripted [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Gelosi were patronized by the aristocracy of northern Italy, usually performing for the gentry of Italy and France. [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] of France was fond of the troupe, and Isabella performed for him in those very early years.

From the beginning, Isabella particularly performed the role of the enamored woman, the ''[[Innamorati|prima donna innamorata]]'', and she liked to improvise so the traditional character was less dull and more savvy. She began to [[Improvisation|improvise]] and eventually shaped the art form into one of comedic bits and spontaneity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mad-Hot Madrigals: Selections from the Rime (1601) of Late Sixteenth-Century Diva Isabella Andreini (1562‚Äì1604)|last=Sorrenti|first=Ann-Marie|publisher=Italian Studies|year=2015|issn=0075-1634|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was one of the women who introduced, developed, and excelled at improvisation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGill|first=Kathleen|year=1991|title=Women and Performance: The Development of Improvisation by the Sixteenth-Century Commedia dell'Arte|url=|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=43|pages=59‚Äì69}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was daring and memorable, sometimes taking off or tearing her clothes onstage. Additionally, Isabella was recognized for her flexibility, an important skill for all ''commedia dell'arte'' characters, regardless of sex. Isabella Andreini used her need to play the power dynamics for comedy in her characters.  She recognized the importance of her status as the leading actress in a brand new profession.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Isabella worked with the Gelosi until her death.

In 1578 Isabella Andreini met and married [[Francesco Andreini]], and non-traditionally took his last name,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Rosalind|year=2015|title=The Fame Monster: Diva Worship from Isabella Andreini to Lady Gaga|url=|journal=Italian Studies|volume=70|pages=402‚Äì415}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would become the director of the Gelosi (1589). Isabella became both the leading lady and an important voice within the Gelosi company. Together with her husband she managed the troupe's activities and she negotiated with possible patrons.{{sfn|Robin|Larsen|Levin|2007|p=9}}

Isabella bore seven children, three boys and four girls, while touring in the Gelosi. She was a dedicated mother. While her firstborn son, Giambattista, continued the theatrical tradition, all her other children were raised by the aristocracy of [[Mantua]] to become clergy in Italian [[Monastery|monasteries]], except one son who became a guard of a [[duke]].  She was very strong in her motherhood and her role as wife to Francesco Andreini.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacNeil|first=Anne|year=1995|title=The Divine Madness of Isabella Andreini|url=|journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association|volume=120|pages=195‚Äì215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commedia dell'arte - troupe Gelosi.JPG|thumb|333px|The ''commedia dell'arte troupe'' of the Gelosi in a late 16th-century Flemish painting ([[Mus√©e Carnavalet]], Paris). The woman is usually identified as Isabella.]]

In 1589, Isabella Andreini performed her comic work ''La Pazzia d'Isabella'' (''Isabella's madness'') for the [[Florence|Florentine]] court during the wedding of [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I de' Medici]] and [[Christina of Lorraine]], and the details of the mostly improvised play have endured until modern times. Fluent in several languages, she was renowned for her intellectual presentation and refined presence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this play she creates madness by using several languages and then imitating dialects of the other characters on stage.{{sfn|Robin|Larsen|Levin|2007|p=11}}  She was versatile in her craft and even referred to herself as being capable of playing any male roles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  She created the role of Fabrizio, a character used in many of [[Flaminio Scala]]'s scenarios, where she plays a transvestite pageboy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Isabella was noted as having played three different characters in one scenario, showcasing her improvisation skills and her talent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1599, Isabella Andreini performed before [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], King of France, and his wife [[Maria de Medici]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Isabella performed at least once for two other troupes: the [[Confidenti]] of the Duke of Mantua in 1589, and the [[Uniti]] in 1601.

In 1602, Isabella toured northern Italy, and in 1603 she performed again for Henry IV, Marie de' Medici and a local audience at [[Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] and Paris. This would be her last tour, because early in 1604 she died near [[Lyon]], on her way back to Italy, when she miscarried her eighth child at age 42.  After her state funeral, memorial coins were struck in her honour with one side representing her as a powerful Roman ruler, and the other as the [[List of Roman deities|fame goddess]] herself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The death of Isabella was observed by the people of Lyon, with a public funeral and an engraved medallion of that year which featured Isabella's portrait on one side, and the figure of Fame on the reverse with the words ''aeterna fama.'' Although Francesco Andreini dissolved the Gelosi after her death, their son [[Giambattista Andreini]], who was an actor and a playwright, started his own company, the [[Fedeli]], with the original troupe of the Gelosi.

Beside performing on stage, Isabella Andreini was a recognized intellectual who dedicated much of her time to literature. The themes of her plays were shaded with some notions questioning the situation of the woman in the society of that epoch; she wrote with a masculine voice in her creations that showed her virtue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indeed, after publishing ''[[Mirtilla]]'' (1588) she began corresponding with contemporary intellectuals, attending their forums, and -an uncommon achievement for a woman in her era- in 1601 she was integrated into the [[literary society]] of the ''[[Accademia degli Intenti]]'' of [[Pavia]], for which she adopted the nickname of ''Accesa.'' In a poetry contest held by the Cardinal [[Giorgio Cinthio Aldobrandini]] of Rome, Isabella Andreini attained second place, only behind the [[Renaissance]] poet [[Torquato Tasso]]. Like the Tasso, both [[Gabriello Chiabrera]] and [[Giambattista Marino]] have praised her.

Apart from writing plays, Isabella also wrote poetry and corresponded with a great variety of people{{sfn|Robin|Larsen|Levin|2007|p=11}}

===Publications===

* Her sonnets were published in diverse Italian books of anthology. (since 1587)
* ''Mirtilla,'' a pastoral drama, with some feminist advocacy. (1588)
* ''Rime,'' a collection of 359 poems (1601, in [[Italian language]]). In 1603, the French version was published for her tour of France.
* ''Rime..., Parte seconda.'' (posthumous, 1605)
* ''Lettere di Isabella Andreini padovana comica gelosa,'' a collection of fictional correspondence, about her personal life and art in general, for being performed as monologues onstage. (posthumous, 1607)
* ''Fragmenti de alcune scritture,'' a collection of improvised dialogs ([[contrasti]]) of Isabella's ''Inamorati'' characters, gathered by her husband. (posthumous, 1617)

==Legacy==

She inspired many French poets, notably [[Isaac du Ryer]] (d. c. 1631).

Isabella was known and infamous because of her intimacy onstage.  She connected with people and used complex characteristics to make her characters realistic and relatable&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the Diva on the Sixteenth-Century Commedia dell'Arte Stage|last=Kerr|first=Rosalind|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2015|isbn=9781442649118|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''commedia dell'arte'' [[stock character]], [[Isabella (commedia dell'arte)|Isabella]], used by subsequent com media dell'arte troupes, is named in her honor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In particular, this school of theater has studied the posthumous works of Isabella Andreini, ''Rime, Parte seconda'' and ''Fragmenti de alcune scritture''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Synopsis ==
;Act I (1952-1972)
Six-year-old Jen Tracy welcomes her newborn brother John into the world, with a warning about the way things work and a promise to protect him from Dad. ("Welcome to the World") As they grow, Jen does her best to shield John from life's disappointments, including a painful Christmas Eve fight between their parents. Not long after John's seventh birthday, Jen discovers a bruise on his face. "It was my fault," he tells her, "I broke a glass." Jen vows that Dad will never hurt John again, and she and John make a deal to always be there for each other. ("Think Big")
As the pair grows older, sibling rivalry crops up when John is forced to attend Jen's high school basketball finals. ("Dear God") But when it's time for Jen to go off to college, John begs her not to leave him alone. ("Hold Down the Fort") Jen is determined to break free, however, deal or no deal. "I can't hold your hand forever," she tells John. "Grow up".

Jen embraces the world of the '60s in groovy New York City, where she blossoms into a drug-experimenting hippie while John's life goes in the opposite direction. ("Timeline") Without Jen there to protect him, John falls under his father's influence and decides to join the Navy. ("It Took Me A While")

When Jen returns home from New York, she and John see how much they've changed and how far apart they've grown. ("Out of My Sight") Learning of Jen's plans to move to Canada with her draft-dodging boyfriend, John accuses her of rejecting everything he and Dad stand for, and they part in anger. ("Run and Hide") After John leaves, Jen unfurls an American flag, drapes it over a coffin, and we learn that John has been killed in Vietnam. "I'm sorry, little brother," she whispers as Act I ends. ("Epilogue")

;Act II (1972-1990)
Now living in Canada, 26-year-old Jen is the mother of a newborn baby boy, whom she names John. ("Old Clothes") But this John is not the na√Øve child of the '50s his mother expects him to be. When Jen moves back to the United States, leaving her failed marriage behind, she prepares to spend Christmas alone with seven-year-old John. Her gift to her son is an old baseball glove, which she proudly tells him belonged to his uncle. But John rejects the gift, complaining, "I'll be the only kid in school with a crappy old glove!"

Jen gets her son to play his uncle's favourite sport, but her obnoxious behavior at games only succeeds in mortifying him. ("Little League") Visiting her brother's grave on what would have been his 32nd birthday, Jen remarks on the similarities between the two Johns and vows that she won't fail her son. ("Just Like You") But when it's time for the 12-year-old to go off to camp, Jen finds herself barely able to say goodbye. ("Bye Room")

In a montage spanning John's high school years, John and Jen take turns as mock talk show hosts covering topics that reveal Jen's growing dependence on her son and John's struggle for freedom. ("Talk Show") Later, when John discovers that his mother has hidden his acceptance packet from Columbia University, it becomes clear that Jen is terrified that she'll lose John "again," and she is no longer able to differentiate between her brother and her son. ("Smile of Your Dreams")

Finally realizing how desperately his mother needs him, John decides to forgo Columbia in favour of a local community college. Disturbed to see him throwing away his future on her account, Jen ridicules his decision. John is deeply hurt by his mother's reaction, and he bitterly mocks her influence on his life. ("Graduation") As their argument escalates, Jen slaps her son.

Shaken by the parallels to her abusive father, Jen retreats to her brother's grave, where she finally accepts that it's time to move on. John joins his mother at the cemetery, where Jen asks his forgiveness. Jen is finally able to let her son go, and they take their first steps into the world on their own. ("Every Goodbye is Hello")

'''''Le nouveau show''''' is a Canadian [[sketch comedy]] series, which premiered as a [[web series]] on [[TOU.TV]] in 2015 before airing on [[ICI ARTV]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√©]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/14/le-nouveau-show_n_8295362.html "¬´Le nouveau show¬ª: le show d'une g√©n√©ration?"]. ''[[Huffington Post]]'', October 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was created by the same cast and crew who had previously created ''[[SNL Qu√©bec]]'', after that show was cancelled by [[T√©l√©-Qu√©bec]] earlier in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/television/201504/09/01-4859570-radio-canada-repeche-les-comediens-de-snl-quebec.php "Radio-Canada rep√™che les com√©diens de SNL Qu√©bec"]. ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', April 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's core cast members are Katherine Levac, Virginie Fortin, L√©ane Labr√®che-Dor, Pier-Luc Funk, Mathieu Quesnel, Guillaume Girard, Micka√´l Gouin and Phil Roy.&lt;ref name=canoe&gt;[http://fr.canoe.ca/divertissement/telemedias/nouvelles/archives/2016/04/20160422-152555.html#2 "Le nouveau show: 100 % humour"]. [[canoe.ca]], April 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Where ''SNL Qu√©bec'' had been created as a local adaptation of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''Le nouveau show'' dropped ''SNL''-related elements such as guest hosts, musical performers and ''[[Weekend Update|Les nouvelles SNL]]'', instead restricting itself to a straight sketch comedy troupe format.&lt;ref name=canoe/&gt;

'''Lillom''' was a [[theme park]] which was opened in 1985 in [[Lomme]], near the city of [[Lille]]. The project was initiated by Arthur Notebart, then mayor of Lomme and president of the [[Urban Community of Lille M√©tropole|Urban Community of Lille]]. It was one of the first French theme parks, and its themes were the history of mankind from prehistory to the future. The park was organized around a large lake, in five main areas:
*Prehistoric area
*Medieval city
*Turn-of-the-century area
*World of the future

Its mascot was a green dinosaur, ''Lommy''.

It closed in 1987 because it never turned any profit. Part of the park was destroyed to make way for the [[LGV Nord]]. The Middle-Ages city still exists today and houses a circus school.

'''''Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy'''''  is a two-act play written in the [[Marathi language]]. It has been written by Pradeep Dalvi (Mauli productions).&lt;ref name="IE-20110205" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HT-20110204"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Political-drama-surrounds-play-on-Nathuram-Godse/Article1-658335.aspx|title=Political drama surrounds play on Nathuram Godse|last=Kurian|first=Susamma|date=2011-02-04|publisher=HT Media|accessdate=9 April 2012|location=New Delhi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324235733/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Political-drama-surrounds-play-on-Nathuram-Godse/Article1-658335.aspx|archivedate=24 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on the book ''May It Please You Honour'' written by [[Gopal Godse]]. According to Karline McLain the play "enacts [[Nathuram Godse|Godse]]'s defense plea" and thus "explores the assassination of [[Gandhi]] and the trial of Godse from Godse's point of view.&lt;ref name="McLain2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karline McLain|title=India's Immortal Comic Books: Gods, Kings, and Other Heroes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4-Su0whKa0C&amp;pg=PA192|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=11 February 2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-22052-3|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staging and controversies==
In 1989 Dalvi was denied permission by the Maharashtra government to stage the play.&lt;ref name="rediff-1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/22godse.htm|title=The Rediff Special/Pradeep Dalvi  An assassin speaks|year=1998|publisher=Rediff On the Net|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was first staged in 1997. It ran 13 successful shows but was banned thereafter, by the governments of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name="Sehgal2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ikram ul-Majeed Sehgal|title=Defence journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6XfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=1 May 2003|publisher=Ikram ul-Majeed Sehgal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producer approached the high court in 1998, which permitted staging the play in 2001. The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] upheld the high court's ruling.&lt;ref name="DNA-20091226"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_gandhi-savarkar-don-green-hats-on-stage_1327572|title=Gandhi, Savarkar don green hats on stage|last=Siddhaye |first= Ninad |date=2009-12-26|publisher=Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.|accessdate=9 April 2012|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was staged in [[Thane]]'s auditorium Gadkari Rangayatan in April 2001 facing opposition from parties like [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Nationalist Congress Party]]; it was not presented again in Thane until 2011. An [[Indian Express]] news story quotes director [[Vinay Apte]] regarding the intimidation that artists connected with the play faced, such as the incident when the bus used by the artists while touring was set on fire by Indian National Congress activists in [[Mulund]] a suburb of [[Mumbai]]. Despite this 627 shows were staged in other cities.&lt;!--CONFUSING PHRASE, IS THIS 627 TOTAL, OR 629 WITH THE TWO THANE SHOWS "could be staged at places other than Thane" - WERE THEY ALL IN INDIA OR ALSO OTHER COUNTRIES??? --&gt;  In February 2011, the play re-opened to a packed house at the same Gadkari Rangayatan, in Thane. Two [[platoons]] of state reserve police and 350 regular policemen under the direction of senior officers provided security.&lt;ref name="IE-20110205"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/day-after-clash-producers-cancel-sunday-show/746363/0|title=Day after clash, producers cancel Sunday show|date=2011-02-05|publisher=The Indian Express Limited|accessdate=9 April 2012|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HT-20110204"/&gt; According to [[Tushar Gandhi]], Gandhi's great-grandson, the play creates martyrs of murderers who after "murdering him ([[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]) are now trying to murder his memory".&lt;ref name="Outlook-19980727"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?205924|title=Villain As Hero|last=AKHTAR |first=SHAMEEM |date=1998-07-27|publisher=The Outlook Group|accessdate=9 April 2012|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;It starred 
Sharad Ponkshe as Nathuram Godse.

==Criticism==
Both the play and its ban have been criticized by [[Shriram Lagoo]] a view which was considered representative of the views of other theater workers such as [[Vijay Tendulkar]], [[Satyadev Dubey]] and [[Amol Palekar]] by [[The Times of India]] in its article ''Banning a play is not the solution''. Civil liberties activists have opposed the ban though they consider the play "vicious".&lt;ref name="TOI-20011010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-10-10/mumbai/27255466_1_nathuram-godse-boltoy-government-bans-sakharam-binder|title='Banning a play is not the solution|date=2001-10-10|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd.|accessdate=9 April 2012|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nathuramayan===
[[Yashawant Dinkar Phadke]] in his book ''Nathuramayan'' has criticised Dalvi's play as presenting "distorted and falsified facts".&lt;ref name="TOI-20020802"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keyword/nathuram-godse/featured/5|title=Nathuram Godse|date=2002-08-02|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd.|accessdate=9 April 2012|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political activists opposing the play have urged Dalvi to answer questions put forward by Phadke in ''Nathuramayan''.&lt;ref name="HT-20110204" /&gt;

On June 18, 2018, American rapper [[XXXTentacion]], real name Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy, was shot and killed in an apparent robbery, just outside RIVA Motorsports, an upscale seller of motorcycles and boats in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]]. He was shot once in the neck&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/xxxtentacion-shot-in-the-neck/|title=XXXTentacion Murder Witness Says Rapper Was Shot In Neck|date=2018-06-20|work=Vibe|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was in critical condition before being pronounced dead at exactly 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.

==Events==
On June 18, Onfroy went to a bank to withdraw money before heading to RIVA Motorsports, an upscale seller of motorcycles and boats in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/06/19/vigil-slain-rapper-xxxtentcion/ |title=Vigil Held For Slain Local Rap Artist XXXTentcion |date=June 19, 2018|access-date=June 20, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After withdrawing money from a bank, he was followed by a dark-colored [[Dodge Journey]] SUV allegedly containing Dedrick Williams, Robert Allen, Michael Boatwright, and Trayvon Newsome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=XXL |title=XXXTentacion Dead at 20 After Being Shot |date=June 19, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTZ1cn2DKA|access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/new-details-in-xxxtentacion-murder-emerge-2342949|title=New details in XXXTentacion's murder emerge - NME|date=2018-06-23|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT, Onfroy arrived at RIVA Motorsports and entered with his friend.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/arts/music/xxxtentacions-killers-charged.html|title=XXXTentacion‚Äôs Killers Tracked Him as He Entered Motorcycle Dealership|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Allen followed Onfroy inside the store to confirm that it was Onfroy inside the BMW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/xxxtentacions-killers-were-tracking-him-surveillance-footage-released-news.60866.html|title=XXXTentacion's Killers Were Tracking Him: Surveillance Footage Released|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two minutes later, Newsome and Boatwright allegedly left the SUV and followed Onfroy inside before Williams bought the masks used during the robbery at a local convenience store.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A half an hour later, Onfroy left the dealership, entered his black [[BMW i8]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/06/19/search-gunmen-rapper-xxxtentacion/ |title=Search Is On For Gunmen Who Shot, Killed Rapper XXXTentacion |date=June 19, 2018|access-date=June 20, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to drive away from the dealership. The SUV drove in front of Onfroy's car, blocking him in while Newsome and Boatwright exited the vehicle and demanded property from Onfroy. A brief struggle ensued, which resulted in Onfroy being allegedly shot once in the neck by Boatwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/xxxtentacion-dead-murder-latest-killers-tracked-rapper-dedrick-devonshay-williams-orange-sandals-a8413236.html|title=Police reveal how XXXTentacion's killers tracked rapper in final moments before fatal shooting|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/entertainment/rapper-xxxtentacion-shot-dead/index.html |title=XXXTentacion Shot in Apparent Robbery |work=CNN |date=June 18, 2018|access-date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses told police Newsome and Boatwright took a [[Louis Vuitton]] bag from Onfroy's vehicle and then fled while Onfroy's friend exited the vehicle and ran away from the crime scene.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/xxxtentacion-shot-in-the-neck/|title=XXXTentacion Murder Witness Says Rapper Was Shot In Neck|date=2018-06-20|work=Vibe|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/xxxtentacion-reportedly-died-instantly-after-being-shot-in-the-neck-news.53162.html|title=XXXTentacion Reportedly Died Instantly After Being Shot In The Neck|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Shortly following the announcement of Onfroy's death, Broward County Sheriff's Office offered a $3,000 [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] for any information leading to the arrest of any suspects. Originally, many fans of Onfroy's, numerous internet users &amp; local residents suspected local Florida rappers Soldier Kidd and Soldier Jojo to be the killers of Onfroy due to several suspicious [[Instagram]] posts made by the pair with specific details that corroborated with witness reports, but these accusations were dropped when Dedrick Williams and Michael Boatwright (the alleged shooter) were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/broward-county-sheriff-xxxtentacion/ |title=Broward Sheriff Offers $3000 Reward In XXXTentacion Murder Case |date=June 19, 2018 |work=Vibe|access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2018, the [[Broward County Sheriff's Office]] arrested 22-year-old Dedrick Devonshay Williams in connection with Onfroy's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=XXXTentacion: Suspect arrested in rapper murder case |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44565813 |date=June 21, 2018 |access-date=June 23, 2018 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was driving in his silver 2004 Honda before a traffic stop occurred.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-06-21/man-appears-in-court-charged-with-murdering-rapper-xxxtentacion/ |title=Man appears in court charged with murdering rapper XXXTentacion |work=ITV News|access-date=June 21, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was detained in the car chase that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-murder-suspect-arrested-report/ |title=XXXTentacion Murder Suspect Arrested {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was identified by clothing he wore on June 18, which included orange sandals and a white tank top. The police matched images from security footage to recent pictures from Williams‚Äô Instagram feed, which featured ‚Äúthe same or similar bright orange sandals‚Äù. He was also identified by employees who saw him enter RIVA Motorsports to buy a [[neoprene]] mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8462391/xxxtentacions-court-documents-dedrick-devonshay-williams-motorcycle-dealership|title=New Court Documents Reveal XXXTentacion's Killers Followed Him Into Motorcycle Dealership|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Williams' arrest, two more active warrants were issued.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/arts/music/xxxtentacion-arrest-murder-charge.html |title=Suspect, 22, Arrested in Florida in Killing of XXXTentacion|access-date=June 21, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 22-year-old Robert Allen was named as a [[person of interest]] in the case, and was later arrested on July 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/police-name-person-of-interest-in-xxxtentacion-murder-report/|title=Police Name Person of Interest in XXXTentacion Murder: Report {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 22-year-old Michael Boatwright was also arrested by the Broward County Sherriff's Office. Originally, he was arrested on drug-related charges, but on July 10, a warrant was put out for him related to the death of Onfroy. Police believe that Boatwright was the one who fatally shot Onfroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-make-second-arrest-rapper-xxxtentacion-s-murder-n890536|title=Florida police make second arrest in rapper XXXTentacion's murder|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three men were later indicted by a [[grand jury]], alongside a fourth, for Onfroy's death.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

On August 7, 20-year-old Trayvon Newsome was later arrested for his involvement in the murder.

==Aftermath==

Cernan kept with the original "merry month of May", however, while Schmitt sang "December", which was the actual date at the time.

The channel was launched in 2006 by David Hall and Chris Moise, former programming executives from [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and at launch featured programming hosted by Hank Parker, Mark Sosin, Jimmy Houston, Larry Csonka, Roland Martin, Babe Winkelman, and others as well as a dozen radio shows and links to more than 150 outdoor blogs including a viewer created encyclopedia called "MyOutdoorWiki".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvover.net/2007/07/26/MyOutdoorTV+Launches+Online+Video+Network.aspx |title=MyOutdoorTV Launches Online Video Network |publisher=TVover.net |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by [[Outdoor Channel]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoorchannel.com/Hunting/News/Outdoor-Channel-Holdings-Acquires-MyOutdoorTV-com.aspx|title=Outdoor Channel Holdings Acquires MyOutdoorTV.com - Outdoor Channel|first=Outdoor|last=Channel|website=www.outdoorchannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor Channel was later acquired by [[Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment]] where the channel was made part of its [[Outdoor Sportsman Group]] collection.

MyOutdoorTV.com which was originally headquartered in [[Tennessee]] is now headquartered in [[Denver, Colorado]], part of the Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment family of companies.

==Controversy==
The channel stirred controversy upon launch in the [[United Kingdom]] on July 31, 2017, where Kroenke owns part the [[Premier League]] team [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for its showing of "[[blood sports]]". The channel was condemned by British animal rights groups. My Outdoor TV defended its programming "MOTV will present ethical, fair chase hunting and as long as it's legal it will be on there." "If you like hunting elephants, there will be legal elephant hunts, ethical elephant hunts, shown in that context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/07/31/arsenal-owner-stan-kroenke-faces-criticism-launching-sickening/|title=Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke faces criticism after launching 'sickening' trophy hunting TV channel|first=Telegraph|last=Sport|date=31 July 2017|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were calls to boycott the Arsenal club over the channel's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4136743/arsenal-boycott-stan-kroenke-tv-channel-my-outdoor-tv/|title=Threat to boycott Arsenal as owner Stan Kroenke launches sick TV channel in UK|date=31 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such words are  [[uncountable noun]]s, ''onomatopoeia'' refers to the property of such words. Common occurrences of words of the onomatopoeia process include animal noises such as "oink", "miaow" (or "meow"), "roar" and "chirp". Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader [[natural language|linguistic]] system;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/new_literary_history/v027/27.3bredin.html Onomatopoeia as a Figure and a Linguistic Principle], Hugh Bredin, The Johns Hopkins University, Retrieved November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://literarydevices.net/onomatopoeia/ Definition of Onomatopoeia], Retrieved November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as ''tick tock'' in [[English language|English]], ''tictac'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''dƒ´ dƒÅ'' in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], ''katchin katchin'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or "tik-tik" in [[Hindi language|Hindi]].

Although in the English language the term '''onomatopoeia''' means "the imitation of a sound", the compound word ''onomatopoeia'' (·ΩÄŒΩŒøŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±) in the Greek language means "making or creating names". For words that imitate sounds, the term ·Ω¥œáŒøŒºŒπŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œå (echomimetico) or [[echomimetic]]) is used. The word ·Ω¥œáŒøŒºŒπŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œå (echomimetico) derives from "·Ω¥œáœé", meaning echo or sound, and "ŒºŒπŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œå", meaning mimetic or imitating.

{{further|List of animal sounds}}

In the case of a [[frog]] croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: [[Ancient Greek]] ''brekekekex koax koax'' (only in Aristophanes' comic play ''The Frogs'') probably for [[marsh frog]]s; English ''[[wikt:ribbit|ribbit]]'' for species of frog found in North America; English verb ''[[wikt:croak|croak]]'' for the [[common frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/2000/5/00.05.11.x.html |title=Basic Reading of Sound Words-Onomatopoeia |publisher=Yale University |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other very common English-language examples are ''hiccup'', ''zoom'', ''bang'', ''beep'', ''moo'', and ''splash''. [[Machine]]s and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: ''honk'' or ''beep-beep'' for the horn of an automobile, and ''vroom'' or ''brum'' for the engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible [[electric arc|arcing]] of electricity, the word "zap" is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects generally connoting the same sort of localized but thorough{{clarify|date=May 2017}} interference or destruction similar to that produced in short-circuit sparking).

Human sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia, as when ''mwah'' is used to represent a kiss.&lt;ref name="mwah_ocford"&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mwah English Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

For animal sounds, words like ''[[Quack (sound)#Communication|quack]]'' ([[duck]]), ''moo'' (cow), ''[[Bark (utterance)|bark]]'' or ''woof'' (dog), ''[[Roar (utterance)|roar]]'' ([[lion]]), ''[[meow]]''/''[[miaow]]'' or ''[[purr]]'' (cat), ''cluck'' ([[chicken]]) and ''baa'' (sheep) are typically used in English (both as nouns and as verbs).

Some languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure. This may evolve into a new word, up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia. One example is the English word  "bleat" for sheep noise: in [[medieval]] times it was pronounced approximately as "blairt" (but without an R-component), or "blet" with the vowel drawled, which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation.

An example of the opposite case is "[[cuckoo]]", which, due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries, has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word ''furrow''.

''[[Verbum dicendi|Verba dicendi]]'' ("words of saying") are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and [[ideophone]]s into grammar.

Sometimes, things are named from the sounds they make. In English, for example, there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes: the [[zipper|zip]] (in the UK) or [[zipper]] (in the U.S.) Many birds are named after their calls, such as the [[bobwhite quail]], the [[weero]], the [[morepork]], the [[killdeer]], [[chickadee]]s and [[jay]]s, the [[common cuckoo|cuckoo]], the [[common chiffchaff|chiffchaff]], the [[whooping crane]], the [[whip-poor-will]], and the [[kookaburra]]. In [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]], the word for [[crow]] is ''kaakaa''. This practice is especially common in certain languages such as [[MƒÅori language|MƒÅori]], and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages.

=== Cross-cultural differences ===
Although a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures, it is often expressed through the use of different consonant strings in different languages. For example, the ''snip'' of a pair of scissors is ''cri-cri'' in Italian, ''riqui-riqui'' in Spanish, ''terre-terre'' or ''treque-treque'' in Portuguese, ''krits-krits'' in modern Greek and ''katr-katr'' in Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;Earl Anderson, ''A Grammar of Iconism'', Fairleigh Dickinson, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "honk" of a car's horn is ''ba-ba'' ([[Han characters|Han]]: Âè≠Âè≠) in Mandarin, ''tut-tut'' in [[French language|French]], ''pu-pu'' in Japanese, ''bbang-bbang'' in [[Korean language|Korean]], ''b√¶rt-b√¶rt'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''fom-fom'' in Portuguese and ''bim-bim'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

=== Onomatopoeic effect without onomatopoeic words ===
An onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of [[alliteration]] and [[literary consonance|consonance]] alone, without using any onomatopoeic words. The most famous example is the phrase ''"furrow followed free"'' in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. The words "followed" and "free" are not onomatopoeic in themselves, but in conjunction with "furrow" they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship. Similarly, alliteration has been used in the line ''"as the surf surged up the sun swept shore..."'', to recreate the sound of breaking waves, in the poem "I, She and the Sea".

== Comics and advertising ==
[[File:CRAC w.jpg|thumb|A sound effect of breaking a door]]
[[Comic strip]]s and [[comic book]]s make extensive use of onomatopoeia. Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer-artist [[Roy Crane]] (1901‚Äì1977), the creator of ''[[Captain Easy]]'' and ''[[Buz Sawyer]]'':
:It was Crane who pioneered the use of onomatopoeic sound effects in comics, adding "bam," "pow" and "wham" to what had previously been an almost entirely visual vocabulary. Crane had fun with this, tossing in an occasional "ker-splash" or "lickety-wop" along with what would become the more standard effects. Words as well as images became vehicles for carrying along his increasingly fast-paced storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeForest |first=Tim |title=Storytelling in the Pulps, Comics, and Radio: How Technology Changed Popular Fiction in America |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xAXWwYchscC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22wash+tubbs%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wash%20tubbs%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[DC Comics]] introduced a villain named [[Onomatopoeia (comics)|Onomatopoeia]], an athlete, martial artist, and weapons expert, who often speaks pure sounds.

[[Advertising]] uses onomatopoeia for [[mnemonic]] purposes, so that consumers will remember their products, as in [[Alka-Seltzer]]'s "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is!" jingle, recorded in two different versions (big band and rock) by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]

[[Rice Krispies]] (US and UK) and [[Rice Bubbles]] (AU){{clarify|date=May 2017}} make a "snap, crackle,   pop" when one pours on milk. During the 1930s, the illustrator [[Vernon Simeon Plemion Grant|Vernon Grant]] developed [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] as gnome-like mascots for the [[Kellogg Company]].

Sounds appear in road safety advertisements: "clunk click, every trip" (click the seatbelt on after clunking the car door closed; UK campaign) or "click, clack, front and back" (click, clack of connecting the [[seat belt]]s; AU campaign) or "click it or ticket" (click of the connecting seat belt, with the implied penalty of a traffic ticket for not using a seat belt; US DOT (Department of Transportation) campaign).

The sound of the container opening and closing gives [[Tic Tac]] its name.

=== Manner imitation ===
{{Main|Ideophone}}
In many of the world's languages, onomatopoeic-like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely auditive. Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts. For instance, Japanese ''barabara'' is used to reflect an object's state of disarray or separation, and ''shiiin'' is the onomatopoetic form of absolute silence (used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room, or someone coughing). It is used in English as well with terms like ''[[bling]]'', which describes the glinting of light on things like gold, chrome or precious stones. In Japanese, ''kirakira'' is used for glittery things.

== Examples in media ==
* [[James Joyce]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) coined the onomatopoeic ''tattarrattat'' for a knock on the door.&lt;ref name="Joyce1982"&gt;{{cite book |author=James Joyce |title=Ulysses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZdOUXIOBhwC&amp;pg=PT434 |year=1982 |publisher=Editions Artisan Devereaux |isbn=978-1-936694-38-9 |pages=434‚Äì |quote=...I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed as the longest [[palindromic]] word in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name="Booty2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=O.A.

* ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963) by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] is an early example of [[pop art]], featuring a reproduction of comic book art that depicts a fighter aircraft striking another with rockets with dazzling red and yellow explosions.
* In the 1960s TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', comic book style onomatopoeic words such as ''wham!'', ''pow!'', ''biff!'', ''crunch!'' and ''zounds!'' appear onscreen during fight scenes.
* [[Ubisoft]]'s ''[[XIII (video game)|XIII]]'' employed the use of comic book onomatopoeic words such as ''bam!'', ''boom!'' and ''noooo!'' during gameplay for gunshots, explosions and kills, respectively. The comic-book style is apparent throughout the game and is a core theme, and the game is an adaptation of [[XIII (comics)|a comic book of the same name]].
* The chorus of American popular songwriter [[John Prine]]'s song "Onomatopoeia" cleverly incorporates onomatopoeic words (though as discussed, 'ouch!' is not the sound of pain):  "Bang! went the pistol. | Crash! went the window. | Ouch! went the son of a gun. | Onomatopoeia | I don't wanna see ya | Speaking in a foreign tongue."
* The marble game [[KerPlunk (game)|KerPlunk]] has an onomatopoeic word for a title, from the sound of  [[marbles]] dropping when one too many sticks has been removed.
* The [[Nickelodeon]] cartoon's title ''[[KaBlam!]]'' is implied to be onomatapoeic to a crash.
* Each [[List of Harper's Island episodes|episode]] of the TV series ''[[Harper's Island]]'' is given an onomatopoeic name which imitates the sound made in that episode when a character dies. For example, in the episode titled ''"Bang"'' a character is shot and fatally wounded, with the "Bang" mimicking the sound of the gunshot.
* ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' Magazine cartoonist [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], already popular for his exaggerated artwork, often employed comic-book style onomatopoeic "sound effects" in his drawings (for example, "thwizzit" is the sound of a sheet of paper being yanked from a typewriter).  Fans have compiled [http://www.madcoversite.com/dmd.html ''The Don Martin Dictionary''], cataloguing each "sound" and its "meaning".

== Cross-linguistic examples ==
{{Main|Cross-linguistic onomatopoeias}}

== In linguistics ==
A key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent{{clarify|date=May 2017}}, as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Assaneo |first=Mar√≠a Florencia |last2=Nichols |first2=Juan Ignacio |last3=Trevisan |first3=Marcos Alberto |date=2011-01-01 |title=The anatomy of onomatopoeia |journal=PLoS One |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e28317 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028317 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=3237459 |pmid=22194825}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one can determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words, these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds doesn't necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=RHODES |first=R |date=1994 |title=Aural Images |url= |journal=In J. Ohala, L. Hinton &amp; J. Nichols (eds.) Sound Symbolism. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press |volume= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this [[sound symbolism]] in the English language is the use of words starting with ''sn-''. Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (''sneeze'', ''snot'', ''snore''). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=a6add37f-bf5b-4b3d-a431-9adb50d76cd5@sessionmgr4006&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=4203&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=88455764&amp;db=ufh |title=The Study of Onomatopoeia in the Muslims' Holy Write: Qur'an: OneSearch for Articles, Books, and More |website=eds.a.ebscohost.com |language=en |access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In linguistics, onomatopoeia is described as the connection, or symbolism, of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language, usually out of mimicry of a sound.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bredin |first=Hugh |date=1996-08-01 |title=Onomatopoeia as a Figure and a Linguistic Principle |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/24304 |journal=New Literary History |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=555‚Äì569 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1996.0031 |issn=1080-661X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a figure of speech, in a sense. Considered a vague term on its own, there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia. In one manner, it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non-vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language, like the hum of a bee being imitated with a ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù sound. In another sense, it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely.

Onomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context, not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Laing |first=C. E. |date=2014-09-15 |title=A phonological analysis of onomatopoeia in early word production |url=http://fla.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0142723714550110 |journal=First Language |language=en |doi=10.1177/0142723714550110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolic properties of a sound in a word, or a [[phoneme]], is related to a sound in an environment, and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory, hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound. Depending on a language‚Äôs connection to a sound's meaning, that language‚Äôs onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally. For example, a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds, which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry then a language like Japanese that overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language.

== The evolution of language ==
In ancient Greek philosophy, onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was: it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us. Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osaka |first=Naoyuki |year=1990 |title=Multidimensional Analysis of Onomatopoeia -A note to make sensory scale from word |url=http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/52479/1/soa024_025.pdf |journal=Studia phonologica |volume= |pages=25‚Äì33 |via=Kyoto University Research Information Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the development of a language, sounds that are associated with natural objects then go on to form words with related meanings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, ''gl-'' at the beginning of an English word can denote something that is shining or iridescent (e.g. glitter, glisten, gleam).{{dubious|date=May 2017}}

== Role in early language acquisition ==
When first exposed to sound and communication, humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear, whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Assaneo |first=Mar√≠a Florencia |last2=Nichols |first2=Juan Ignacio |last3=Trevisan |first3=Marcos Alberto |date=2011-12-14 |title=The Anatomy of Onomatopoeia |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028317 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e28317 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028317 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=3237459 |pmid=22194825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on in development, an infant will vary his/her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language(s) most heavily spoken in their environment, which may be called "tame" onomatopoeia, and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce, or "wild" onomatopoeia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As one begins to acquire one's first language, the proportion of "wild" onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring.

During the native language acquisition period, it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild-speech features to which they are exposed, compared to more tame and familiar speech features. But the results of such tests are inconclusive.

In the context of language acquisition, sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects, such as the association of the words takete and baluma{{Fix|text=are these arbitrary nonsense words which are used in tests?}} with either a round or angular shape{{clarify|date=May 2017}}, has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

== In other languages ==

=== Japanese ===
Onomatopoeia, or ''giongo'' in Japanese, is common in the Japanese language, from day to day conversation to serious news.&lt;ref&gt;Inose, Hiroko. "Translating Japanese Onomatopoeia and Mimetic Words." N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, onomatopoeia in Japanese can be categorized into three types:
* ''Giseigo'': mimics humans and animals. (e.g. ''WanWan'' for a dog's bark)
* ''Giongo'': mimics general noises in nature or inanimate objects. (e.g. ''zaazaa'' for rain on a roof)
* ''Gitaigo'': describes states of being, not sounds. (e.g. ''mushimushi'', uncomfortably warm)
Japanese also uses a system of sound symbolic words called mimetics. Though not entirely different from onomatopoeia, words that are mimetic are generally distinguished from onomatopoeia. Mimetic, or ''gitaigo'' in Japanese, words are a phonological representation of some kind of state of being, or something that doesn't exactly make sound.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

Sometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces reduplicated words.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Malay ===
There is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu- and the implication of something that is rounded. As well as with the sound of -lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like lok, kelok and telok (locomotive, cove and curve respectively).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=WILKINSON |first=R. J. |date=1936-01-01 |title=ONOMATOPOEIA IN MALAY |jstor=41559855 |journal=Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=14 |issue=3 (126) |pages=72‚Äì88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabic ===
Within the Qur'an, written in Arabic, instances of onomatopoeia are documented.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Out of about 77,701 words, there are 9 words that are onomatopoeic, 3 which are animal sounds (e.g. "mooing"), 2 which are sounds of nature (e.g. "thunder") and 4 that are human sounds (e.g. "whisper" or "groan").

'''''Playboy's Dark Justice''''' is a half-hour, computer-animated, [[softcore pornographic]] TV series shown on [[Playboy TV]] premiering on September 3, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64972595.html Cable World Programming Briefs August 21, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and running for 20 (of an intended 26) episodes until 2001, and was perhaps the first and only show of its kind created. Unlike most talk, variety, and reality series on Playboy TV, ''Dark Justice'' had characters and story arcs. It featured a heroine named Justina (voiced by [[Veronica Hart]]), who would fight crime as part of a [[vigilante]] force in a [[dystopian]] world in Metro City in 2120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/nys/pla/reports/PBY-FLSH/revised/PbyAr2000.pdf Playboy Financial Highlights 2000, page 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The plots  inevitably led to Justina and others in sexual situations. The series was directed by [[Michael Ninn]], with Robert C. England as technical director, lead animator, motion-capture actor, and the voice of Wendell,{{cn|date=February 2016}} and produced by Ninn and Hart (among others) through Hope Ranch Productions, and featured a number of porn stars as voice actors and models for [[motion capture]] animated with [[3D Studio Max]] and [[Character Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-beylik/57/888/50b James Beylik| LinkedIn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090728010338/http://geocities.com/jamesbeylik James Beylik]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loop.la/foro3/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=453&amp;start=60 Post by Juan Duque]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Justice'' was the only completed film and television production from Hope Ranch until its acquisition by Pure Play Media in 2002 and name change to [[Ninn Worx]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1328784/000112785506000394/pureplayexh10_10.htm PURE PLAY SB-2, LOAN/SECURITY AGREEMENT AMENDMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.productionhub.com/profiles/details/175979 Ali Alavi: About Me]&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Hope Ranch" appears to have been later used for the [[alternate reality game]] Kronos480BC promoting the Ninn Worx production "The Four".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argn.com/tag/kronos480bc Alternate Reality Gaming Meets the Adult Entertainment Industry with Kronos480BC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper was established in 1927 and was issued from [[Sofia]].&lt;ref name=sws/&gt; The paper was renamed to ''Duma'' in 1990. ''Duma'', despite some financial troubles, is still issued today.

''Rabotnichesko Delo'' was initially the weekly of the Bulgarian Workers' Party. Although it was banned following the [[Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1934]], it was nevertheless published illegally until 1944. In 1938, it merged with ''Rabotnicheski Vestnik'', the Bulgarian Communist Party's newspaper, founded in 1897. ''Rabotnichesko Delo'' criticized the bourgeois government, propagated the ideas of [[communism]] and was against the country's participation in [[World War]] as part of the [[Axis Powers]], advocating closer ties with the [[Soviet Union]] instead.

After the [[Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1944]], the newspaper was elevated to become the ruling party's main [[propaganda]] tool.

'''Reader's theatre''' or '''Reader's theater''' is a style of [[theater]] in which the [[actor]]s do not memorize their lines. Actors use only vocal expression to help the audience understand the story rather than visual storytelling such as sets, costumes, intricate blocking, and movement. This style of performance of literature was initially lauded because it emphasized hearing a written text as a new way to understand literature.
==History==
Readers Theatre is also known as [[Chamber theatre|Chamber Theatre]] or [[Interpretive Theatre]]. Readers Theatre became popular during and following the [[Second World War]] when resources to produce plays were scarce. There are four different types of Readers Theatre, each an evolution of the former and each with different attributes: Readers Theatre, Free Readers Theatre, Chamber Theatre, and Contemporary Readers Theatre. Each of these styles and manifestations of Readers Theatre are still performed today.

The original Readers Theatre was presented using only scripts and stools or chairs. The material performed was plays, poems, narrative fiction, and non-dramatic literature. The performers' focus was offstage and limited costuming was sometimes used (often the readers wore all black to strip away character and allow for more focus on vocal interpretation of the piece). While the readers may have interpreted the scenes or poems cold, in most cases the scripts were memorized and rehearsals were conducted with even more intensity than those conducted for a regular play. There was little to no interaction between performers or movement. This style of performance also helped performers deal with [[performance anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Rebecca. "Readers Theatre Presentation." Performance History. Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 14 April 2014. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free Readers Theater was a little more free than traditional Readers Theater. The materials performed were all the same except plays were no longer performed. The performers were now able to look at and interact with each a little more and the presence of scripts was optional. Blocking began to appear which suggested psychological relationships between characters and pictorial compositions (for example, if two characters hated each other, they might be at opposite ends of the stage, and as the tension rises, they might move toward each other). The performers still wore black, but some wore additional costume pieces to help suggest character (such as a hat or shawl).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Rebecca. "Readers Theatre Presentation." Performance History. Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 14 April 2014. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamber Theater focused on narrative fiction only (no other type of material was performed). Scripts were almost always memorized (a narrator might carry a script to make their authoritative voice). The movement became more elaborate and could be associated with more traditional theater practices; it was used in such a way to reveal the character's role and relationships in the story. Costuming evolved into suggested or full costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Rebecca. "Readers Theatre Presentation." Performance History. Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 14 April 2014. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Readers Theatre is commonly practiced today. It is less bound by convention and uses techniques from all of the above traditions of Readers Theatre. It is influenced by performance art techniques which is to say there is an increasing emphasis on creating a critical performance that interrogates the text instead of being faithful to it and doing a good representation to share the meaning with the audience. Contemporary Readers Theatre is influenced by [[Augusto Boal]] who emphasized creating interactive improvisational performances where the emphasis is on the performers and audiences' reaction to the central theme of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Rebecca. "Readers Theatre Presentation." Performance History. Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 14 April 2014. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre in Education==

According to some drama teachers,{{who|date=March 2013}} plays have built-in strategies to help students improve their reading skills. The acting out of dialogue causes readers to work more closely with the text to project and interpret meaning into the reading experience. Consequently, students gain improvement in vocabulary, comprehension and retention.  Reading in a small group provides reading role models which is also proven to improve reading skills in students. Research has shown that Readers Theatre can improve reading fluency, word choice and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/instructor/readerstheater.htm The Power of Readers Theater&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/read/rb/edlite-slide019.html Archived: Improving Fluency - Research-Based Instruction in Reading&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nifl.gov/partnershipforreading/publications/PFRbooklet.pdf (pages 24-29)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the foremost authors on Readers Theatre was Dr. Leslie Irene Coger.  Dr. Coger wrote the book ''Readers Theatre Handbook: A Dramatic Approach to Literature.''
&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED089286&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED089286 Readers Theatre Handbook: A Dramatic Approach to Literature. Revised Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dr. Leslie Irene Coger ==
Dr. Coger, mentioned above as one of the foremost authors on Readers Theatre, began studying expression at the age of nine with a local instructor, Gladys Anderson. In the 1930s, she attended the Curry School of Expression in Boston. She received her Ph.D. in 1952 and spent much of her career as a professor at Southwest Missouri State University. Her retirement was followed by Missouri governor Kit Bond naming July 11, 1981 "Leslie Irene Coger Day," and in 1982, Southwest Missouri State University named its new theatre after her. In 1989, she was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. In 1994, she received the Distinguished Service Award from the Performance Studies division of the National Communication Association (NCA).

Dr. Coger tracks the rise of Reader's Theatre as part of the larger shifts in her field, beginning with "expression" in the 1930s, to "oral interpretation" in the late 1940s, to simply "interpretation" in the late 1950s and 1960s. In the wake of New Criticism, the "interpretation" era focused on works of fiction and analysis of literature, and the study of persona, narrators, and the implied author. This turn gave the discipline room for group performances alongside solo performance of interpretations, including styles such as Chamber Theatre, Theatre of the Mind, and, as Dr. Coger writes in her handbook, Readers Theatre.

Finally, Dr. Coger tracks the shift in the 1990s from "interpretation" to "performance studies" the field as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Coger, Leslie Irene. "From Elocution to Performance Studies: A Personal History." ''Future of Performance Studies: Visions and Revisions''. Ed. Sheron Dailey. Annadale, VA: National Communication Association, 1998. 110 - 113. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salitre Magico''' is an [[amusement park]] located in [[Bogot√°]], [[Colombia]] inside the territory of the Parque el Salitre. Currently it has 39 mechanical attractions such as roller coasters, [[bumping cars]], and the unique "Castillo del Terror" (Castle of Horror). It was one of the most important and classic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogotaturismo.gov.co/atractivos/parques/zona_occidente.php#salitre Bogot√° Turismo:Salitre M√°gico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040829021412/http://www.bogotaturismo.gov.co/atractivos/parques/zona_occidente.php |date=2004-08-29 }} Consultado el 1 de Febrero de 2010&lt;/ref&gt; amusement parks of the city, as well as the largest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Etiqueta negra: una revista para distra√≠dos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ns2AAAAYAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Pool Producciones|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; among some others such as the [[Mundo Aventura]] and the [[Cici Aquapark]].

==History==
Inaugurated in 1973 under the name of "Parque El Salitre",&lt;ref name="Villegas2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Villegas|title=Bogot√° from the Air|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7-SNfrR4-wC&amp;pg=PT209|year=2002|publisher=Villegas Asociados|isbn=978-958-8156-22-4|pages=209‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located between the 68th Avenue and the 63rd Street, near the [[Parque Simon Bolivar]] in [[Bogot√°]]. It was then considered as one of the most modern parks on [[Latin America]]. Some years later, the park was closed to the public in 1999, in order to be remodeled.

Its reinauguration took place in December 2000, under a new name "Salitre M√°gico" and under the Mexican firm CIE,&lt;ref name="Clav√©2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvador Anton Clav√©|title=The Global Theme Park Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rH-wmRzn6AcC&amp;pg=PA86|year=2007|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-208-4|pages=86‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total of 29 rides located all over the park, among these there was a roller coaster nicknamed "the Screw" due to its helicoidal form which was imported from the United States and reassembled in [[Bogot√°]]; some other new attractions such as a giant Chicago Wheel called the "Rueda Millenium" (Millennium Wheel) with a total height of 40 m which offers a panoramic view of the city. The Salitre Magico also offers aquatic attractions and a wide variety of mechanical attractions and shows for children and the whole family. Close to the Salitre Magico, a brother park was inaugurated, the Cici Aquapark, which offers aquatic attractions including a sea waves simulator and several sledges. Both parks are currently part of the Mexican emporium [[Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento]].

==Rides==

Among the wide variety of rides, the park offers entertainment for children with attractions such as the [[Carousel]], Flying Swings, and mini-Wheel; some other of high impact such as the three Roller coasters, the Tornado, the Double Loop and the Screw which counts with free falls up from 15 m height and a total round of 500 m.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7856">'''Score Productions''' is an [[United States of America|American]] musical production company specializing in background [[music]] and themes for [[television series|television programs]]. Started in 1963 by music producer Robert A. Israel, Score has created some of the most recognizable tunes in America ‚Äî most identifiable by just a few notes.&lt;ref name=Score&gt;[https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20010418_bob_israel_living_an_american_dream_in_studio Bob Israel Living An American Dream in Studio-BMI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the composers who worked for Score Productions are [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]], [[Walt Levinsky]], Arthur B. Rubinstein, Dick Lieb, [[Michel Camilo]], [[Chuck Loeb]], [[Billy Barber (musician)|Billy Barber]], Irving "Benny" Robbin, [[Charles Gross]], Glen Daum, [[Birch Johnson]], and [[Les Fradkin]]. 

One of the Score-produced compositions, "[[Come on Down (Crystal Waters song)|Come on Down]]", also known as the theme song from ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', would eventually become a number one hit on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Dance Club Songs]] Chart for [[Crystal Waters]] in 2001. The single also marked the first time that a television theme song (and one that came from a game show) reached number one on a Dance chart, and the first to feature lyrics. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/come-on-down-mw0000657382 Come on Down-Crystal Waters-AllMusic]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Vivian Richards Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in North Sound, [[Antigua]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. It was built for use in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] where it hosted Super 8 matches. The stadium usually caters for 10,000 people, but temporary seating doubled its capacity for the 2007 World Cup. The stadium is named after former [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies cricket]] captain [[Viv Richards]].

==Location==
The stadium is about 10‚Äì20 minutes' drive from the capital city, [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]], and the country's [[VC Bird International Airport|international airport]]. The venue cost approximately US$60 million to build, with the majority of the funds coming from a Chinese Government grant.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first Test match staged on the ground began on 30 May 2008 when the West Indies hosted Australia, with the match ending in a draw.

==Facilities==
The stadium constitutes two main stands: the Northern Stand and the five story South Stand. In 2008, the roof of the South Stand was damaged by high winds.&lt;ref name="roofdamage"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/370525.html
  | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other facilities include a practice pitch for the various cricket teams, training infrastructure and a media centre. Sir Viv Richards Stadium is one of the few state-of-the-art venues that encompass underground passageways for the cricket teams to move about in.&lt;ref name="cricinfoprofile"&gt;{{cite web

Prior to the start of the first Test against [[England cricket team|England]] on 13 April 2015, the north and south ends were renamed for two former West Indies cricketers, [[Curtly Ambrose|Sir Curtly Ambrose]] and [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Sir Andy Roberts]].

== Outfield controversy ==
The ground's second Test match began against England on 13 February 2009, but the [[Battle of the Antigua Sandpit|match was abandoned]] after just ten balls due to the outfield's dangerous condition.

The groundstaff had applied an extra layer of sand after recent heavy rain, and again after a brief shower, which resulted in West Indies bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards being unable to gain a foothold when running in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12123_4920462,00.html |title=Antigua Test in turmoil |publisher=skysports.com |date=13 February 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sandy nature of the outfield had earnt the ground the nickname of 'Antigua's 366th beach' in the buildup to the game.&lt;ref name="constructioncost"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua
  | url = http://thatscricket.oneindia.in/news/2007/02/27/2702sir-vivian-richards-stadium-antigua.html
  | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The abandonment caused great embarrassment for West Indies cricket, with inquiries held by the [[West Indies Cricket Board|WICB]] and the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]]. The ICC ordered that the ground be suspended from staging all international matches for twelve months, and an official warning was issued to the WICB.

{{More citations needed|date=February 2013}}
A '''stand-in''' for [[film]] and [[television]] is a person who substitutes for the actor before filming, for technical purposes such as lighting and camera setup.
Stand-ins are helpful in the initial processes of film and television production. 

Stand-ins allow the [[director of photography]] to light the set and the camera department to light and focus scenes while the actors are absent. The director will often ask stand-ins to deliver the scene dialogue ("lines") and walk through ("blocking") the scenes to be filmed. 

Stand-ins are distinguished from [[body double]]s, who replace actors ''on camera'' from behind, in makeup, or during dangerous stunts. Stand-ins do not appear on camera. However, on some productions the jobs of stand-in and double may be done by the same person. In rare cases, a stand-in will appear on screen, sometimes as an in-joke. For instance, the actress who pretends to be Ann Darrow in the stage show during the final act of ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (2005) is played by [[Naomi Watts]]' stand-in, Julia Walshaw.

Stand-ins do not necessarily look like the actor, but they must have the same skin tone, hair color, height and build as the actor so that the lighting in a scene will be set up correctly. For example, if the lighting is set up with a stand-in shorter than an actor, the actor might end up having his or her head in relative darkness.

Stand-ins are also used for animated characters in a live-action film, sometimes with life-size character models, so that the animators know where to place their animation and how to make them move realistically, and for actors to know where to look. In these cases, skin tone and hair color are not so important. Height and build, however, are still important for any interactions between live-action and animated characters.

Some celebrities mandate that they will always have the same stand-in. Famous cases include Pluma Noisom (stand-in for [[Claudette Colbert]]), Harry Cornbleth ([[Fred Astaire]]) and Adam Bryant ([[Robin Williams]]). When [[Bette Davis]] walked out on her Warner Bros. contract, she negotiated for her regular stand-in, Sally Sage, to continue to work at the studio.

'''''The Farmer's Daughter''''' is an erotic text-based [[video game]] for the [[Commodore 64]] produced by Nocturnal Software and written by R.W. Fisher and D.W.J. Sarhan. The video game was produced in 1983 for the Commodore 64 and was released in 2002 for personal computers running [[MS-DOS]].

The player's character is a traveling [[lightning rod]] salesman whose car breaks down near an old farmhouse. At the house, the player is met at the door by the title character, a gorgeous young girl who disappears from sight as soon as he asks to use the [[telephone|phone]]. While rummaging through the house the player finds her diary and learns which objects need to be collected to make her wildest [[sexual fantasy]] come true. While avoiding various pitfalls including her oversexed brothers, her father (who thinks the character is a [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|revenuer]]) and his dog, the objects described are collected leading to a final encounter with the farmer's daughter in the [[hayloft]]. The game is timed by movements so that all objectives must be completed in 180 moves, lest the player miss the tow truck and lose the game.

The game is a fairly standard [[text adventure|text-based adventure]], and despite its risque subject matter there are no visuals.

'''The Playground Theater''', founded in 1997, remains the only continuously operating [[non-profit]] [[theater]] in [[Chicago]] dedicated to an art form invented in [[Chicago]] - [[Improvisational theatre|Modern Theatrical Improvisation]].  The Playground was founded in 1997 by its original member companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplaygroundtheater.com/about]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Playground theater exists as a non-profit co-op, governed by its member companies, or "teams." The Playground currently is home to over 12 house teams in addition to guest teams, and members of the theater's Incubator Program.
Located at 3209 N. Halsted Street, The Playground features performances every night. 

From time to time the theater holds auditions for its signature ''Incubator Program,'' in which applicants are judged on their skills at scene-based [[improvised comedy]].  Those who pass are assembled into Incubator Teams with a certain guaranteed number of shows on The Playground's stage.  The newly hatched teams are then free to govern their own fates, hire their own coaches, and generally pursue a career as an improv [[ensemble cast|ensemble]].  Some Incubator teams eventually wind up applying for membership status with the theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplaygroundtheater.com/about]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Playground launched Playground Theatricals in 2015 with the production of Don Chipotle, an original play written by Juan Villa. Playground Theater was created to provide a venue for Chicago‚Äôs improvisers to have more artistic control over the work they produce. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplaygroundtheater.com/about]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2016, The Playground Theater announced the launch of a new program for writers, directors and performers called MOSAIC. MOSAIC  which will focus on artists exploring individual identity and celebrating uniqueness. MOSIAC accepted a 7-month MOSAIC writer and production residency will run in association with The Department of Cultural Affairs at the Chicago Cultural Center. MOSAIC will begin accepting submissions for COMEDY and THEATRICAL productions in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplaygroundtheater.com/about]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatrical superstitions''' are [[superstition]]s particular to [[actor]]s or the [[theatre]].

==Macbeth==
{{Main|The Scottish Play}}
&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[Image:Vlcsnap-1361413.png|thumb|250px|The Simpson family greeting Sir [[Ian McKellen]], just before Homer says "Macbeth."|{{FFDC|1=Vlcsnap-1361413.png|log=2009 September 22|date=March 2012}}]]--&gt;
[[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'' is said to be cursed, so actors avoid saying its name when in the theatre (the [[euphemism]] "[[The Scottish Play]]" is used instead). Actors also avoid even quoting the lines from ''[[Macbeth]]'' before performances, particularly the [[Three Witches|Witches]]' incantations. Outside a theatre and after a performance, the play can be spoken of openly. If an actor speaks the name "Macbeth" in a theatre prior to one of the performances, they are required to perform a ritual to remove the curse. The ritual may vary according to local custom: one is to leave the theatre building, or at least the room occupied when the name was mentioned, spin around three times, spit, curse, and then knock to be allowed back in. This particular iteration of the ritual is documented in the play ''[[The Dresser]]'' and its film adaptations.&lt;ref name="Garber"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Garber |first=Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Shakespeare's Ghost Writers: Literature as Uncanny Causality |publisher=Methuen |year=1997 |location= |pages=88ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EsYy1TZkUwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-416-09432-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of this legend claims that it was the actor who played [[Lady Macbeth]] who died during the play's first production run and that Shakespeare himself had to assume the role.  There is no evidence that this legend is factual.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Euan.  [http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/02/04/macbeth/ "Mystery surrounds roots of the Macbeth curse"], ''MPR News'', [[Minnesota Public Radio]] website, published 2010-02-05, retrieved 2012-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Break a leg" vs. "Good luck"==
Generally, it is considered bad luck to wish someone "good luck" in a theatre. Prior to performances, it is traditional for the cast to gather together to avert the bad luck by wishing each other bad luck or cursing ‚Äì in English-speaking countries, the expression "[[break a leg]]" replaces the phrase "[[luck|good luck]]". The exact origin of this expression is unknown, but some of the most popular theories are the [[Break a leg#Traditional Theory|Shakespearean]] or traditional theory, and the [[Break a leg#Bowing|bowing theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steppenwolf.org/backstage/article.aspx?id=23 |title=Theatre Superstitions |publisher=Backstage Magazine |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001031042/http://www.steppenwolf.org/backstage/article.aspx?id=23 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australian theatrical circles saying "good luck" is also avoided, but the replacement is often "chookas!" This may be due to the belief among some dancers that saying "break a leg" may actually result in broken bones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindballet.com/ask-colin-chookas/ "Chookas!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808013638/http://www.behindballet.com/ask-colin-chookas/ |date=2011-08-08 }}, By Colin Peasley, manager, Education Programme for The Australian Ballet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghost light==
{{Main|Ghost light (theatre)}}
One should always leave a light burning in an empty theatre.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} 

Though it's a superstition, it does have practical value as well: the backstage area of a theatre tends to be cluttered with props and other objects, so someone who enters a completely darkened space is liable to be injured while hunting for a light switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lecatr.people.wm.edu/theatrical_superstitions_and_saints.html |title=Theatrical Superstitions and Saints |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghosts in Broadway Theatres===
In 2005, ''[[Playbill]]'' ran an article about Broadway theatres that were believed to be haunted.&lt;ref&gt;Viagas, Robert.  [http://www.playbill.com/features/article/93486-The-Ghosts-of-Broadway "The Ghosts of Broadway"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701153354/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/93486-The-Ghosts-of-Broadway |date=2012-07-01 }}, ''Playbill'' website, published 2005-06-10, retrieved 2012-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following is a list of hauntings from that article:
* [[Radio City Music Hall]]:  The Hall's builder, [[Samuel Roxy Rothafel]], is said to appear on opening nights accompanied by a glamorous woman spirit.
* [[New Amsterdam Theatre]]:  Silent film star and former [[Ziegfeld Follies]] girl [[Olive Thomas]] is said to have appeared several times since her death in 1920.  Thomas may be the most sighted ghost on Broadway, although to date she has only appeared to men.  [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], which restored the theatre in the 1990s, actively promotes the idea that Thomas haunts the theatre and makes accommodations for her presence.  A large photograph of her hangs in the lobby of the New Amsterdam next to equally large photos of more famous Follies stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Khan, Shazia|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/on_stage/107954/ziegfeld-girl-s-ghost-said-to-haunt-broadway-theater/|title=Ziegfeld Girl's Ghost Said To Haunt Broadway Theater|work=[[NY1]]|date=2009-10-26|accessdate=2012-06-15|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130033503/http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/on_stage/107954/ziegfeld-girl-s-ghost-said-to-haunt-broadway-theater/|archivedate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Belasco Theatre]]:  The top floor of the theatre is said to be haunted by its namesake [[David Belasco]], who lived in an apartment located there.
* [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]]:  The former premiere [[vaudeville]] theatre is said to be haunted by more than 100 ghosts.  According to the article, actress [[Andrea McArdle]] saw the ghost of a [[pit orchestra|pit]] [[cellist]] during her 1999‚Äì2000 run as Belle in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.
* [[Lyric Theatre (1998 New York City)|Lyric Theatre]]:  On December 21, 1909, the ghost of playwright [[Clyde Fitch]] allegedly appeared onstage during the final curtain call on opening night for his last play, ''The City''.  He strode to center stage, took a bow, then vanished before the eyes of the startled cast and audience.  (Fitch had died on September 4 of that year.)  The Lyric was one of two theatres demolished in 1996 to make way for what is now called the [[Foxwoods Theatre]].
* [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre]]:  Formerly the [[Martin Beck (vaudeville)|Martin Beck]] Theatre, it's believed that Beck's ghost is annoyed with the 2003 name change.  During that year's revival of ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', there were several reports of props and other items that were mysteriously moved or went missing.

==Whistling==
Related to a similar rule for sailing ships, it is considered bad luck for an actor to whistle on or off stage. As original stage crews were hired from ships in port ([[fly system|theatrical rigging]] has its origins in sailing rigging), sailors, and by extension theatrical riggers, used coded whistles to communicate scene changes. Actors who whistled would confuse them into changing the set or scenery and could result in injury or death. In today's theatres, the stage crew normally uses an [[intercom]] or [[cue light]] system.

==Miscellaneous==
* Some words and phrases are used during pre-stage warm-up sessions by actors. One of these is the [[Western Shoshone]] term "poo-wa-bah" (possibly meaning "doctor-water"). This term is used notably by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] (who talked about it in [[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]], a documentary on the making of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'') and his daughter [[Sofia Coppola]] (who is seen performing this ritual, along with her cast, in "Lost on Location", a making-of documentary included as a special feature on the ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' DVD).  It is thought that he began this pre-show ritual at his undergraduate alma mater [[Hofstra University]] where the tradition continues in Hofstra Drama Department productions.
* Specific theatres
** Some Broadway producers have also complained about the [[Foxwoods Theatre]] (formerly known as the "Hilton Theatre" and "Ford Center for the Performing Arts").  Completed in 1998, the main complaint is that the 1829 seat theatre's cavernous auditorium has poor sight lines and acoustics, making it difficult for audience members in distant seats to see or hear the actors.  [[Mel Brooks]] (whose ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' ran for 14 months there) made a different complaint about the theatre's acoustics, stating that its size also makes it difficult for performers to hear the laughter of the audience.  The theatre opened with the two-year, 834 performance run of the original production of the musical ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]''.  This was followed in 2001 by the four-year, 1524 performance run of the revival of the musical ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]''.  Normally, this would have given the theatre a good reputation, but its poor reputation grew exponentially in 2010‚Äì11 with the seemingly endless production problems of ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'',&lt;ref name=WSJSpidey&gt;Gamerman, Ellen.

** Before ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' began its six-year, 2017 performance run at the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] in 1956, that theatre was thought to be cursed.&lt;ref name=WSJSpidey/&gt;  It had been switched back and forth several times between being a motion picture theatre and a live stage theatre.  From its opening in 1930 until the opening of ''My Fair Lady'', the 1949 musical ''Texas, Li'l Darlin''' had the longest run at the Hellinger‚Äînine months and 293 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/venue.php?id=1202 Internet Broadway Database page for the Times Square Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trickster Arts''' is an [[indie game]] [[Video game developer|development]] team based in the Czech Republic. It consists of former [[2K Czech]] employees.

== History ==
The studio was founded in Fall 2012 when Matou≈° Je≈æek left 2K Czech and started to work on his own game. The project was titled ''Hero''. Je≈æek also contacted some of his friends and former colleagues to join his team. It includes Ladislav T√Ωƒç and Mat√∫≈° ≈†irok√Ω. They also released an iOS game ''Date Me If You Can''. Its Czech version ''Interande'' was, unlike the English version, a success.&lt;ref name=Andport&gt;{{cite web|last1=Va≈°√°tko|first1=Ond≈ôej|title=Interview s ƒçeskoslovensk√Ωmi v√Ωvoj√°≈ôi p≈ôipravovan√© pecky Hero of Many|url=http://androidportal.zoznam.sk/2013/05/interview-s-ceskymi-vyvojari-pripravovane-pecky-hero-of-many/|website=android portal.sk|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pracov&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zach|first1=Ond≈ôej|title=Pracovali na Mafii 2, nyn√≠ zabodovali s vlastn√≠ hrou.

The project ''Hero'' (renamed to ''Hero of Many'') was in  development for 10 months and was released in June 2013 to very positive response from critics. The game was also a minor financial success that allowed Trickster Arts to start works on another project.&lt;ref name="Pracov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vyvoj&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bach|first1=Martin|title=V√Ωvoj her v ƒåesku v roce 2013 - ƒç√°st 4.|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tema/vyvoj-her-v-cesku-v-roce-2013-cast-4-237337|website=Games.cz|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new project was an unnamed action adventure in which player controlled Fire. This was much bigger project than Hero of Many but the development was eventually stopped after a year as the game was too difficult for development and too expensive.

'''Barry Charles''',&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schneider (May 10, 2017) [https://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_under_water_adventures_of_australias_most_passionate_golden_showers_ent The under water adventures of Australia‚Äôs most passionate golden showers enthusiast, ‚ÄòTroughman‚Äô!], DangerousMinds.net, accessed 27 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''Troughman''' (born 1949/1950), is an Australian underground celebrity famous for his role in the [[paraphilia]] of [[urolagnia|watersports]] in toilets at Sydney gay venues in the late 1970s through 2000s. 

==Biography==
By the age of 17 Barry Charles, later Troughman, realised he was gay in Punchbowl, NSW.  Later this experience led him to believe that the laws in NSW which criminalised homosexuality had to be changed.  Troughman was part of the first Sydney Mardi Gras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-09/in-search-of-trough-man-an-icon-of-sydneys-1980s-gay-scene/8496200&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, at the age of 28, Charles was exposed to watersports in New York during a visit to the [[Mineshaft (gay club)|Mineshaft]] bar.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, 65‚Äì8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Australia, Charles realised at the Signal Bar in Sydney how he could incorporate his newly discovered interest in watersports into the bar which lacked special facilities.  He did this by using the shared urinal, or trough, common in Australian pubs and clubs.  This habit resulted in the name Troughman being applied to Barry.  Describing his sexual experience, Troughman began by crouching down and leaning against the urinal, before engaging in the signature activity he is most famous for, "it becomes easy to let myself go completely and, no longer kneeling or crouching, I lie right down in the urinal."&lt;ref&gt;Charles, 68‚Äì9.&lt;/ref&gt; Troughman also engaged in other watersports, and recalls having used [[bandana code]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, "Editors Comment," 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Troughman, the Horden Pavilion offered a safe space for sexual expression in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of Fox Studio's control of the site, and their implementation of [[Occupational Health and Safety]] he ceased to party there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-09/in-search-of-trough-man-an-icon-of-sydneys-1980s-gay-scene/8496200&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Reynolds by the early 2000s in the Sydney gay community "Troughman has become a cultural icon, an almost mythical figure," and that Troughman was particularly famous for his role in the Sydney Mardi Gras parties.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, "Editors Comment," 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1996 Troughman had been mentioned in the mainstream media in relation to the Sleaze Ball.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Logan, "Dance Spells" Metro section, ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 4 October 1996, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; An interview with Barry by Kerry Bashford appeared in Campaign magazine, accompanied by a photograph by Garrie Maguire. Sponge magazine, a small underground design magazine edited by Mark Sykes, also ran a story, again Maguire was commissioned to make the accompanying photograph, though it did not get printed, due to its literal interpretation of the subject. The photo was later seen in a Leather pride exhibition.

There is a sound archive of Barry being interviewed on GayWaves, a Gay Community radio program, where he spoke about his fetish and how he saw it as part of the gay sexual revolution of the 70s and 80s. Barry was active in the gay rights movement in Sydney. He was founding secretary of University of New South Wales Gay Liberation,a participant in the June 1978 street march from which grew the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Co-Convenor of Gay Rights Lobby 1981-1984. Gay rights campaigning led to the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in New South Wales in 1984. 

Part of the myth of Troughman included persistent rumours of death.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Donaldson, "Sleaze Preoccupies Sydneysiders," ''Sunday Star-Times,'' 4 October 1998, 15;  Reynolds, "Editors Comment," 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Troughman's cultural impact entered into mainstream Australian culture, where by 2007, his practices could be referred to off-hand in relation to public urinals, and comprise part of contemporary Australian myth.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Anderson, "Television," [Daily review] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 28 September 2010, 21; Sam de Brito, "Standard Urinal Protocol," All men are liars (blog) ''Sydney Morning Herald'' [http://blogs.smh.com.au/lifestyle/allmenareliars/archives/2007/02/urinal_protocol.html (online)] 27 February 2007 12:03 AM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
The 1998 film ''Troughman'' directed by Kellie Henneberry was screened at the [[Philadelphia QFest|International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;British Film Institute, Film and Television database entry "Troughman 1998" http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/617533; Australian Film Commission, "Australian Films and Multimedia at Overseas Festivals", ''Australian Film Commission News'', 175/76 August/September 1998, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors [[Baron Geisler]] and Kiko Matos, who involved in a feud in May 2016 in a bar, were faced in an exhibition match during the URCC Fight Night card held at the Valkyrie at the Palace last June 25, 2016. This two-round fight, however ended in a unanimous draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/137630-baron-geisler-kiko-matos-urcc-result|title=Baron Geisler, Kiko Matos fight to two-round draw|publisher=[[Rappler]]|last=Bandayrel|first=Rafael|date=June 25, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After which, both Geisler and Matos reconciled each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/06/25/16/baron-geisler-vs-kiko-matos-ends-in-draw|title=Baron Geisler vs Kiko Matos ends in draw|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|last=Gagelonia|first=Dennis|date=June 25, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AT URCC 28: Vindication, the first-ever 3-on-3 MMA exhibition match took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2016/11/7/13548794/video-and-results-urcc-28-hosts-crazy-3-vs-3-bout-de-tomas-and-lee-defend-titles|title=Video and Results: URCC 28 hosts crazy 3 vs 3 bout|date=7 November 2016|website=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams who competed were Team Chan and Team Estroso. All competitors were inside the cage simultaneously with three referees in charge of the action. The fight is momentarily halted after a competitor gets knocked or is unable to continue. Team Estroso won the fight with two of its fighters still standing while Team Chan was left with one.

On January 7, 2017, URCC held its first fight card in the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/12/22/16/mma-urcc-invades-us-with-4-title-fights-in-january|title=MMA: URCC invades US with 4 title fights in January|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=December 22, 2016|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

URCC held its second event in the United States in September 2017 in [[San Mateo, California]]. Officially called "URCC 32: Fury", the event was hosted at the [[San Mateo County]] event center and featured 3 title fights, as well as amateur fights sanctioned under [[California Amateur Mixed Martial Arts Organization]] (CAMO).

==Rules==
===URCC-USA===
All URCC fights hosted in the United States abide by the rules in place by the athletic commission of each respective state.

===URCC===
URCC's rules are different from those of established promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Professional Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Rules| url=http://www11.pair.com/urcc/urcc_home.html | accessdate = 2007-07-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626204639/http://www11.pair.com/urcc/urcc_home.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match length===
URCC matches consist of two rounds, each lasting ten minutes. Intermissions between each round are two minutes in length. All title bouts will have a 5-minute third round in case of a draw after the two rounds.

===Weight classes===

|-
|Cruiserweight || {{convert|95|kg|lb st|1|abbr=on}}
|-
|Heavyweight || Unlimited
|}

===Ring===
The URCC uses a five-roped square ring from 2002 until 2013.
On the 2014 event URCC 25: Take Over, the first URCC circular cage was released and planned to use it as official ring to the rest of the URCC history

===Attire===
URCC allows fighters latitude in their choice of attire but 4-ounce fingerless gloves and a [[mouthguard]] are mandatory. Shoes and derogatory markings on ring attire are forbidden. It is within a fighter's discretion to use other protective equipment such as groin guards.

===Victory===
Matches are won via:
* '''Submission'''
**Physical tap out
**Verbal tap out
* '''Knockout'''
**A fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue.
* '''Technical Knockout'''
** Referee Stoppage (the referee stops the match after seeing that one fighter is completely dominant to the point of endangering his opponent).
** Doctor Stoppage (the referee stops the match in the event that a fighter is injured via a legal blow and the ring doctor determines that he cannot continue).
** Forfeited Match (a fighter's corner throws in the towel).
* '''Decision'''
**If the match reaches its time limit then the outcome of the bout is determined by the three judges. The fight is scored by a 10-point must system per round.  A three step procedure per round is followed:
:# Determine winner of round (can be draw),
:# Determine if winner dominated round ,
:# Fouls then factored in (subtract one point per foul from fighter).
**Draws are acceptable in URCC matches.
* '''Disqualification'''
**A "warning" will be given in the form of a [[Yellow card (sport)|yellow card]] or a [[Red card (sports)|red card]] (any fighter who executes a foul technique shall be penalized with a talent fee reduction) when a fighter commits an illegal action or does not follow the referee's instruction. Two yellow cards shall lead to a disqualification "red card."
** The referee's decision will always depend upon the level of violation committed by a fighter whether it is intentional or unintentional. Therefore, the referee may execute the "red card" even without showing the first two "yellow cards" as a caution for a disqualification
** The referees are also authorized to execute the red "disqualification" card if a fighter has deliberately injured his opponent and can no longer compete.

===Fouls===
URCC considers the following to be fouls:

# [[headbutt|Head butting]].
# [[eye-gouging|Eye gouging]].
# Hair pulling.
# Biting.
# [[fish-hooking|Fish hooking]].
# [[groin attack|Any attacks to the groin]]
# Strikes to the back of the head, which includes the occipital region and the spine. The sides of the head and the area around the ears are not considered to be the back of the head. (see [[Rabbit punch]])
# [[Small joint manipulation]] (control of four or more fingers/toes is necessary).
# Intentionally throwing your opponent out of the ring.
# Running out of the ring.
# Purposely holding the ropes. Fighters cannot purposely hang an arm or leg on the ropes and it will result in an immediate warning.
# Putting a finger into any orifice or into any cut or laceration on an opponent.
# Striking downward using the point of the elbow.
# Throat strikes of any kind including without limitation, grabbing the trachea.
# Clawing, pinching or twisting the flesh.
# Grabbing the clavicle.
# Kicking the head of a grounded opponent.
# Kneeing the head of a grounded opponent.
# Stomping on a grounded opponent.
# Kicking to the kidney with a heel.
# Spiking an opponent to the canvas on his head or neck.
# Throwing an opponent out of the ring or fenced area.
# Holding the shorts or gloves of an opponent.
# Spitting at an opponent.
# Engaging in an unsportsmanlike conduct that causes an injury to an opponent.
# Using abusive language in the ring or fenced area.
# Attacking an opponent on or during the break.
# Attacking an opponent who is under the care of the referee.
# Attacking an opponent after the bell has sounded the end of the period of unarmed combat.
# Flagrantly disregarding the instruction of the referee.
# Timidity, including without limitation, avoiding contact with an opponent, intentionally or consistently dropping the mouthpiece or faking an injury.
# Interference by the corner.
# Throwing in the towel during competition.
# Exceeding numbers of cornermen.
# Unauthorized cornerman.
# Any lock which puts strain on the neck joint.

===Match conduct===
* If both fighters are on the verge of falling out of the ring or become entangled in the ropes, the referee will stop the action. The fighters must immediately stop their movements and will then be repositioned in the center of the ring in the same position. Once they are comfortably repositioned, they resume at the referee's instruction.

'''''World of the Living Dead''''' ''(WoTLD)'' : Resurrection was a real-time zombie survival strategy browser game developed using OpenStreetMap to provide the underlying game world, with in-depth gameplay features to make a browser-based [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] accessible on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

The game was set in a post-apocalyptic [[Los Angeles]], overrun by the zombie apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World of the Living Dead Wants Your Brainz|url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/59605/World-of-the-Living-Dead-Wants-Your-Brainz#comments|publisher=IGN.com|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players were  tasked with commanding, sustaining, and protecting one or more squads of survivors as they roamed the deserted streets and fought for survival. Players assumed the role of an operative taking a satellite view of the situation, and radioing in orders akin to classic early 90's of the National Emergency Control and Relief Agency (NECRA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About World of the Living Dead|url=http://gamingconsolenetwork.com/rkx/2011/03/23/about-world-of-the-living-dead/|work=Retro Kix|publisher=Gaming Console Network|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a government agency tasked with rebuilding civilization. Players couldn't control the survivors individually, but instead used squad-level controls to accomplish objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World of the Living Dead|url=http://www.mmorpg-info.org/browser-games/world-of-the-living-dead/|publisher=MMORPG Info|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game had player vs. player [[Player versus player|PvP]], Faction gameplay and player vs. environment [[Player versus environment|PvE]] elements.

''WoTLD'': Resurrection ran its first round of Closed Beta Testing in October 2013. The second test began in December 2013, with the game being released to the public on 21 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Beta Begins WotLD|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/newsroom.cfm/read/23863/Open-Beta-Begins.html|publisher=MMORPG.com|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''WoTLD'': Resurrection announced its permanent shutdown on 23 June 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World of the Living Dead permanently shutting down|url = http://blog.worldofthelivingdead.com/post/89641937659/world-of-the-living-dead-permanently-shutting-down|website = blog.worldofthelivingdead.com|accessdate = 2015-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the heading of the official website changed to 'World of the Living Dead book coming in 2016' along with the website name to 'World of the Living Dead - Do you love reading about zombies?'.

==Gameplay==
The interface of WoTLD made use of [[OpenStreetMap]] and was set in a post-Apocalyptic [[Los Angeles]] . Much of the gameplay consisted of moving around the game world, a grid made up of 500m x 500m squares with occasional skirmishes with the zombies and the injuries that occur from such battles. In each zone, players had options to engage "zeds" scavenge for items, engage opponents, collect research samples or construct safehouses.

There were several thousand locations on the map, once a player had moved his/her team onto these locations several actions became available. These actions ranged from scavenging the zone for resources to tagging the walls to mark your passing. Squads were marked with small icons on the map, and opposing players, as well as notable buildings are scattered around the map. Movement consisted of moving through the game world step by step. Combat was not "seen" first-hand, instead popping up as a series of combat reports, detailing any injuries, kills and/or deaths.&lt;ref name="CanardPC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://canardpc.com/news-52356-canard_pc_228___tentacules_et_saint_valentin.html | title = Death in Venice | accessdate=2011-03-21 | date=2011-02-15| author = Boulan, Omar | publisher = CanardPC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As your characters progress, fear, and fatigue start to take its toll, making your survivors less efficient.

With a complex system of needs, food and water became critical resources in the game and players had to manage hunger and thirst. After passing a certain number of days at maximum thirst or hunger, survivors would go AWOL, moving to a random location on the map, from which they needed to be recovered by the player. Hunger and dehydration would also hinder the survivor's performance, slowing him/her down in combat, making them an easier target. Thus, every expedition had to be carefully planned before ordering your people to leave the relative safety of your safehouse. Players who returned between gameplay sessions to their safehouse would see their health recover, and fear and fatigue drop, and these could be sped up through development of the appropriate skills.

Instead of defining hordes as specific beings, or even as a number, ''WoTLD'' used a unique definition of "z-density", defining the density of zombies within a block instead of the actual zombie count.&lt;ref name="Gnome's Lair Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnomeslair.com/2010/10/dave-barton-on-mmos-games-zombies.html | title = Dave Barton on MMOs, Games &amp; Zombies | accessdate=2011-03-21| date=2010-10-20| author=Gnome's Lair | publisher = gnomeslair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Level of density is defined by a scale of colors, providing a better visual at a first glance.

==Development==
World of the Living Dead: Resurrection was developed by Irish indie games developer Ballardia, which consisted of Dave Barton and Kulpreet Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World of the Living Dead: Ballardia Interview|url=http://www.mmorpgitalia.it/site/content.php?623-World-of-the-Living-Dead-Ballardia-Interview&amp;s=6da2e75195087f56cd71e6fb239b5128|work=MMORPGITALIA|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave and Kulpreet were both senior development staff at pre-GameStop ''Jolt Online'', then known as OMAC Industries, founded by ''Dylan Collins'', a successful Irish games and technology entrepreneur. He had previously sold ''Demonware'', to  ''Activision'', and secured a license to develop a game base on the ''Zork'' series. Dave Barton was Lead Designer for ''Legends of Zork'', and Kulpreet was ''CTO'', and Lead Developer on ''NationStates 2''.

''WoTLD'' was originally conceived by Dave Barton in 2007.  Development began in mid-2009 with the help of Kulpreet Singh.&lt;ref name="Gnome's Lair Interview"/&gt; Open beta was originally planned for December 2010,&lt;ref name="Gnome's Lair Interview"/&gt; and featured a game engine that incorporated [[Google Maps]]. It went into Closed Beta in late 2010, and Open Beta in 2012. However, the developers encountered a severe problem as the Google Maps API, which the game was built around, could not handle large numbers of concurrent players. This meant that the game, which was built around moving through the game's landscape, reacting in real time to noise and other players, did not scale well. Development of all the gameplay elements continued, and the game continued to receive updates until May 2013 when it was announced to be shutting down the following month, allowing the developers to bring the game forward on the new OpenStreetMap system. In June 2014, servers closed, allowing the developers to refocus all efforts to rerelease the game as World of the Living Dead: Resurrection.

In early 2013 the developers chose [[OpenStreetMap]] as a replacement. The first phase of Closed Beta Testing began on 10 October 2013 with over 300 testers, which ended in late November 2013 after initial bug fixes were rapidly deployed, and rebalancing of all metrics tweaked regularly. This shut down in November 2013, allowing the developers some time to address many issues, and re-boot the game to run a full cycle of the game, based on achieving a Faction-based end-game goal of researching a solution to the Zombocolypse.

The second round of Closed Beta Testing began on 1 December 2013, and ended on 21 February 2014, with the removal of the beta key requirement, a rebalancing of the cooldowns to allow regular solo sessions throughout the day, and updates to allow single players to win the game. The developer have promised a Championship Trophy, which will be webcast, and the winner(s) will have their name engraved on the trophy as Round 1 Winners.
