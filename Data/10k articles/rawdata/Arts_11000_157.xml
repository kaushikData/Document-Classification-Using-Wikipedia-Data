'''Acoustic jars''' are ceramic vessels found set into the walls, and sometimes into the sides of cavities beneath the floors, of medieval churches.  They are believed to have been intended to improve the sound of singing, and to have been inspired by the theories of [[Vitruvius]] .

==History==
Tuned bronze vases set in niches were used to modify the acoustics in Greek and Roman theatres. Their use is described by Vitruvius.&lt;ref name=god&gt;{{cite web|title=The enigma of Vitruvian Resonating Vases and the Relevance of the Concept for Today|author= Godman, Rob|url=http://www.philophony.com/pages/cr1470s.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   No original examples survive.&lt;ref name=isthere&gt;{{cite web|title=Is There an Acoustical Tradition in Western Architecture?|author=Crunelle, Marc| url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/skiathos2001/papers/102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages the idea of the acoustic vessel re-emerged.  Examples have been found in around 200 churches, half of them in France.&lt;ref name=isthere/&gt; They vary greatly in shape and positioning, but, unlike those described by Vitruvius they are ceramic, and are found enclosed within the fabric of building.&lt;ref name=isthere/&gt;  The function of the jars was established with the discovery of a reference in the  ''Chronicle of the Celestins  of Metz''.  The chronicler recorded that, in 1432: &lt;blockquote&gt; on the vigil of the Assumption, after brother Odo le Roy, the prior, had returned from the before-mentioned general chapter, it was ordered that pots should be put into the choir of the church of this place, he stating that he had seen such in a church elsewhere  thinking that they made the singing better, and resound more, they were put up there in one day, by taking as many workmen as were necessary.&lt;ref name=minns/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Modern experiments have indicated that their  effect would have been to absorb the resonance of certain frequencies, rather than to amplify sound.&lt;ref name=isthere/&gt;

They use of the jars was said to be common in [[Brittany]], and around  [[Clisson]], in the Loire Inferieure. In the Clisson area, they were usually found in horizontal rows at a height of about three metres above floor level.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt; In 1859 a correspondent to ''Archaeologia Cambrensis '' reported that at Pallet there was  "a  ''modern'' chapel, with earthenware vessels inserted in the walls of the choir, expressly for acoustic purposes".&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acoustic Contrivances in Churches And Other Buildings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qr41AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=|journal=Archaeologia Cambrensis|year=1859|pages=139–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, a set of eleven jars survives high on the chancel walls of St Andrews church at [[Lyddington]], Rutland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Andrew's Church|url=http://www.openairlib.net/auralizationdb/content/st-andrews-church|website=Openair|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At [[St Peter Mancroft]]  in [[Norwich]] two L-shaped trenches  accommodating a number of acoustic jars were discovered beneath  the wooden floor on which the choir stalls had previously stood. They had rubble walls  and concrete bottoms, and the surfaces were rendered over. Earthenware jars were built into the walls at intervals of about three feet, with the mouths facing into the trench. The jars were about 9 ½  inches long, and 8 inches across at their widest, narrowing to 6 inches at the mouth.  A similar discovery was made at [[St Peter Parmentergate, Norwich]] in the same city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acoustic Pottery|journal=The Builder|author= Phipson|first=Makilwane|year=1863|page=893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s21TAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+builder%22%22acoustic+pottery%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Fountains Abbey]], in [[Yorkshire]] several earthenware vessels were discovered mortared into the base of the choir screen, their necks protruding through the stonework.&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;{{cite book|pages=39–40|title=Antiquities and Curiosities of the Church|first=William|last=Andrews|location=London|publisher=William Andrews|year=1897|url=https://archive.org/details/antiquitiescurio00londrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the medieval jars has sometimes been doubted. The Chronicler of Metz, in the only medieval source for the purpose of the jars,  mocks the prior for believing  that they might have improved the sound of the choir,&lt;ref name=minns&gt;{{cite journal|page=96|author=Minns, G.W.|title=Acoustic Pottery in Norwich Churches|url=https://archive.org/details/norfolkarchaeol29socigoog|journal=Norfolk archaeology |year=1872|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the archaeologist [[Ralph Merrifield]] suggested that their use might  have owed more to a tradition of [[votive offering|votive deposits]] than to the  theories of Vitruvius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Folk-lore in London Archaeology. Part 2: The Post-Roman period|author=Merrrifield, Ralph|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-457-1/dissemination/pdf/vol01/vol01_03/01_03_066_069.pdf|journal=The London Archaeologist|pages=99–105|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, at [http://www.ancientacoustics2011.upatras.gr/index.html The Acoustics of Ancient Theatres] conference, held in Patra, Greece, P. Karampatzakis and V. Zafranas presented evidence that Vitruvius' theory was in fact correct, and that  the  reconstruction of an ancient  acoustic vase is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientacoustics2011.upatras.gr/index.html] Acoustics of Ancient Theatres  conference&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Karampatzakis P.

'''AeDES''' (Agibilità e Danno nell'Emergenza Sismica) is a printed Rapid Post-Earthquake Damage Evaluation form, from [[GDNT]] (Italian national seismic protection group). It is used by [[Italians|Italian]] qualified [[civil engineers]] to assess the structural damages of buildings after an [[earthquake]].
The AeDES Form is used from the civil protection technical staff since June 1998 to survey damages in the after-shock. The form has 9 sections. This tool allows for the definition of the conformity or non-conformity of a building. 
The form is scanned and digitized for further evaluations. Information about position of the building, classification, material, structural typology, damage of the current event and previous damages are object of this form.

'''Ariadne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|i|ˈ|æ|d|n|i}}; {{lang-el|Ἀριάδνη}}; {{lang-la|Ariadne}}), in [[Greek mythology]], was a [[Cretan]] princess. She is mostly associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of the [[Minotaur]] and [[Theseus]].

==Family==
Ariadne was the daughter of [[Minos]]—the King of [[Crete]]&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 11.320, Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 947, and later authors.&lt;/ref&gt; and a son of [[Zeus]]—and [[Pasiphaë]]—Minos' queen and a daughter of [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasiphaë is mentioned as Ariadne's mother in ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.1.2 (Pasiphaë, daughter of the Sun), in Apollonius' ''[[Argonautica]]'' iii.997, and in Hyginus ''[[Fabulae]]'', 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Others called her mother [[Crete (mythology)|Crete]], daughter of [[Asterion (king of Crete)|Asterius]], husband-king of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. Ariadne was the sister of [[Acacallis (mythology)|Acacallis]], [[Androgeus (son of Minos)|Androgeus]], [[Deucalion (Cretan)|Deucalion]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Glaucus (son of Minos)|Glaucus]], [[Xenodice (mythology)|Xenodice]] and [[Catreus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.1.2&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3.1.2.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Minos put Ariadne in charge of the labyrinth where sacrifices were made as part of reparations (either to Poseidon or to Athena, depending on the version of the myth); later, she helped Theseus overcome the Minotaur and save the potential sacrificial victims. In other stories, she became the bride of the god [[Dionysus]], with the question of her being mortal or a goddess varying in those accounts.&lt;ref&gt; In creating a "biography" for a historicized Ariadne, her presence on Naxos is accounted for by Theseus' having abandoned her there; in assembling a set of biographical narrative episodes, this would have had to be placed "after" her abduction from Knossos. In keeping with the role of Minos as Crete's king, Ariadne has come to bear the late designation of "princess". The endpoint of this rationalizing process is the realistic historicizing fiction of [[Mary Renault]], ''The Bull from the Sea'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidhe, Fiana. [http://www.matrifocus.com/BEL02/spotlight.htm "Goddess Ariadne in the Spotlight"],''[[MatriFocus]]'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minos and Theseus===
Since [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] myths are passed down through oral tradition, many variations of this and other myths exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia: Greek Mythology |url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570116/Greek_Mythology.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKdfeoI?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570116/Greek_Mythology.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an Athenian version of the legend, Minos attacked [[Athens]] after his son was killed there. The Athenians asked for terms, and were required to sacrifice [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur|seven young men and seven maidens]]  to the [[Minotaur]] every seven or nine years. One year, the sacrificial party included [[Theseus]], the son of King [[Aegeus]], who volunteered to come and kill the Minotaur. Ariadne fell in love at first sight, and helped him by giving him a sword and a ball of thread (μίτο της Αριάδνης 'Ariadne's thread'), so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth.

She eloped with Theseus after he achieved his goal, but according to [[Homer]] "he had no joy of her, for ere that, [[Artemis]] slew her in seagirt Dia because of the witness of [[Dionysus]]" (''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D321 XI, 321-5]). Most accounts claim that Ariadne was abandoned by Theseus, but in some versions she is mortally wounded by Perseus &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Ariadne.html|title=ARIADNE - Greek Goddess Wife of Dionysus (Roman Libera)|website=www.theoi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Homer does not expand on the nature of Dionysus's accusation, but the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' speculates that she was already married to Dionysus when she ran away with Theseus.

===Naxos===

[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]]: Dionysus discovers Ariadne on the shore of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. The painting also depicts the [[Corona Borealis|constellation named after Ariadne]].]]

In [[Hesiod]] and most other accounts, Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]], and [[Dionysus]] rediscovered and wedded her. In a few versions of the myth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] iv. 61, v. 51; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 20. § 2, ix. 40. § 2, x. 29. § 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysus appeared to Theseus as they sailed away from Crete, saying that he had chosen Ariadne as his wife and demanding that Theseus leave her on Naxos for him; this has the effect of absolving the Athenian culture-hero of desertion. The vase-painters of Athens often showed Athena leading Theseus from the sleeping Ariadne to his ship.

With Dionysus, she was the mother of [[Oenopion]], the personification of wine, [[Staphylus]] (related to grapes), [[Thoas (Tauri king)|Thoas]], Peparethus, Phanus, Eurymedon, [[Enyeus]], Ceramus, Maron, Euanthes, Latramys and Tauropolis.&lt;ref&gt;The classical references for these offspring are at [http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Ariadne.html TheoiProject:Ariadne] and [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosFamily.html Theoi Project: Dionysus family]. Euanthes, Latramys and Tauropolis are only mentioned in [[scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 3. 997&lt;/ref&gt; Her wedding [[diadem]] was set in the heavens as the constellation [[Corona Borealis]].

Ariadne remained faithful to Dionysus but was later killed by [[Perseus]] at [[Argos]]. In other myths she hanged herself from a tree, like [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] and the hanging [[Artemis]], a Mesopotamian theme. Some scholars have posited, due to her thread-spinning and winding associations, that she was a [[Weaving (mythology)|weaving goddess]], like [[Arachne]], supporting this theory with the [[mytheme]] of the Hanged Nymph (see [[weaving (mythology)|weaving in mythology]]). Dionysus descended into Hades and brought her and his mother [[Semele]] back. They then joined the gods in [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].

==As a goddess==

[[File:Dionysos Ariadne BM 311.jpg|thumb|left|Ariadne as the consort of Dionysos: bronze appliqué from [[Chalki]], [[Rhodes]], late fourth century BCE ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]])]]

[[Karl Kerenyi]] and [[Robert Graves]] theorize that Ariadne (whose name they derive from [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]'s listing of Άδνον, a Cretan-Greek form for ''arihagne'', "utterly pure") was a [[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]] of [[Crete]], "the first divine personage of Greek mythology to be immediately recognized in Crete",&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, ''Dionysos: archetypal image of indestructible life'', 1976, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; once archaeology had begun. Kerenyi observes that her name is merely an [[epithet]] and claims that she was originally the "Mistress of the [[Labyrinth]]", both a winding dance-ground and in the Greek view a prison with the dreaded [[Minotaur]] at its centre. Kerenyi notes a [[Linear B]] inscription from Knossos, "to all the gods, honey... to the mistress of the labyrinth honey" in equal amounts, suggesting to him that the Mistress of the Labyrinth was a Great Goddess in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1976, p 90f.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Barry Powell has suggested she was Minoan Crete's [[Snake Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Barry B. ''Classical Myth.'' Second ed. with new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]], in his ''vita'' of Theseus, which treats him as a historical individual, reports that in the Naxos of his day, an earthly Ariadne was separate from a celestial one:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the Naxians also have a story of their own, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, one of whom, they say, was married to Dionysos in Naxos and bore him Staphylos and his brother, and the other, of a later time, having been carried off by Theseus and then abandoned by him, came to Naxos, accompanied by a nurse named Korkyne, whose tomb they show; and that this Ariadne also died there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the painter Aison (c. 425&amp;nbsp;– c. 410 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;The kylix is conserved at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], [[Madrid]]; see [[:File:Kylix Theseus Aison MNA Inv11365 n1.jpg|image]].&lt;/ref&gt; Theseus drags the Minotaur from a temple-like labyrinth, but the goddess who attends him, in this Attic representation, is [[Athena]].

[[File:Sleeping Ariadne 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]] ''[[Sleeping Ariadne]]'', long called ''Cleopatra'', a Roman marble in late Hellenistic taste]]

An ancient cult of [[Aphrodite]]-Ariadne was observed at [[Amathus]], Cyprus, according to the obscure [[Hellenistic]] mythographer [[Paeon of Amathus]]; Paeon's works are lost, but his narrative is among the sources cited by [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Theseus (20.3-.5). According to the myth that was current at Amathus, the second most important Cypriote cult centre of Aphrodite, Theseus's ship was swept off course and the pregnant and suffering Ariadne put ashore in the storm. Theseus, attempting to secure the ship, was inadvertently swept out to sea, thus being absolved of abandonment. The Cypriote women cared for Ariadne, who died in childbirth and was memorialized in a shrine. Theseus, overcome with grief upon his return, left money for sacrifices to Ariadne and ordered two [[cult image]]s, one of silver and one of bronze, set up. At the observation in her honour on the second day of the month Gorpiaeus, one of the young men lay on the ground vicariously experiencing the throes of labour. The [[sacred grove]] in which the shrine was located was called the grove of Aphrodite Ariadne.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund P. Cueva, "Plutarch's Ariadne in Chariton's Chaereas and Callirhoe" ''American Journal of Philology'' '''117'''.3 (Fall 1996) pp. 473-484.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primitive aspect of the cult at Amathus in this account would appear to be much older than the Athenian-sanctioned shrine of Aphrodite, who has assumed ''Ariadne'' (''hagne'', "sacred") as an [[epithet]] at Amathus.

==In Etruscan culture==&lt;!--Areatha redirects here--&gt;
Ariadne (Etruscan: '''Areatha''') is paired with Dionysus (Etruscan: [[Fufluns]]) on engraved bronze Etruscan [[bronze mirror]]backs, where the Athenian culture-hero Theseus is absent, and [[Semele]] (Etruscan: [[Semla (mythology)|Semla]]), as mother of Dionysus, may accompany the pair,&lt;ref&gt;For example on the mirror engraving reproduced in Larissa Bonfante and Judith Swaddling, ''Etruscan Myths'' (Series The Legendary Past) University of Texas/British Museum, 2006, fig. 25 p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; lending a particularly Etruscan air&lt;ref&gt;"The married couple is ubiquitous in Etruscan art.  It is appropriate to the social situation of the Etruscan aristocracy, in which the wife's family played as important a role in the family's genealogy as that of the husband." (Bonfante and Swaddling 2006:51f.).&lt;/ref&gt; of family authority.

An '''art critic''' is a person who is specialized in analyzing, interpreting and evaluating [[art]]. Their written critiques or reviews contribute to [[art criticism]] and they are published in newspapers, magazines, books, exhibition brochures and catalogues and on web sites. Some of today's art critics use [[art blog]]s and other online platforms in order to connect with a wider audience and expand debate about [[art]].

Differently from art history, there is not an institutionalized training for art critics (with only few exceptions); art critics come from different backgrounds and they may or may not be university trained.&lt;ref&gt;James Elkins, ''What happened to art criticism'', Prickley Paradigm Press, 2003, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional art critics are expected to have a keen eye for art and a thorough knowledge of [[art history]]. Typically the art critic views art at [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], [[art gallery|galleries]], [[museum]]s or [[artist]]s' [[studio]]s and they can be members of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] which has national sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aica-int.org/spip.php?article3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212152149/http://www.aica-int.org/spip.php?article3 |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very rarely art critics earn their living from writing criticism.

The opinions of art critics have the potential to stir debate on art related topics. Due to this the viewpoints of art critics writing for art publications and newspapers adds to public discourse concerning art and culture. [[Art collector]]s and patrons often rely on the advice of such [[critic]]s as a way to enhance their appreciation of the art they are viewing. Many now famous and celebrated artists were not recognized by the art critics of their time, often because their art was in a style not yet understood or favored. Conversely, some critics, have become particularly important helping to explain and promote new [[art movements]] &amp;mdash; [[Roger Fry]] with the [[Post-Impressionist]] movement, [[Lawrence Alloway]] with [[Pop Art]] as examples.

== Controversies ==

According to James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;James Elkins, ''Introduction'' in ''Is Art History Global?'', dir. James Elkins, Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2007, pp. 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a distinction between art criticism and art history based on institutional, contextual and commercial criteria; the history of [[art criticism]] is taught in universities, but the practice of art criticism is excluded institutionally from academia. An experience-related article is Agnieszka Gratza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/oct/17/frieze-art-critic-academia-journalism|title=Frieze or faculty? One art critic's move from academia to journalism|first=Agnieszka|last=Gratza|date=17 October 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Always according to James Elkins in smaller and developing countries, newspaper art criticism normally serves as art history. James Elkins's perspective portraits his personal link to [[art history]] and [[art historians]] and in ''What happened to art criticism'' he furthermore highlights the gap between art historians and art critics by suggesting that the first rarely cite the second as a source and that the second miss an academic discipline to refer to.&lt;ref&gt;.

The '''Britannia Theatre''' (1841&amp;ndash;1900) was located at 115/117 High Street, [[Hoxton]], [[London]].&lt;ref name=Arthur&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Britannia.htm ''Britannia Theatre Hoxton''] (Arthur Lloyd theatre history) accessed 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was badly damaged by a fire in 1900. The site was reused as a [[Gaumont British|Gaumont]] cinema from 1913 to 1940, when this too was destroyed. The site is marked by a [[London Borough of Hackney]] historic plaque.

A typical night's entertainment would include 3&amp;ndash;4 plays, with variety acts in the intervals between. Many [[music hall]] acts would appear during the interval, and sometimes their acts were woven into the performance. The plays varied, from [[Shakespeare]], [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]] and comedy. During the winter season [[pantomime]] was performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/icons/playbills/londonbritannia.htm ''Playbills, productions and cast lists''] (Britannia Theatre Hoxton), in the Templeman collection of the [[University of Kent]] accessed 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually for a theatre, food and drink were served in the auditorium, in the style of contemporary [[music hall]]s.&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
Samuel Haycraft Lane was born in [[Lympstone]], [[Devon]] in 1803. In 1821, he decided to escape the life of a fisherman and walk to [[London]]. After living hand to mouth and educating himself, with the help of a friend, William Brian, he encountered a troupe of actors who he had previously met on his journey. He helped the leader of the troupe, Jack Adams, to find premises for performance at the Union Tavern in [[Shoreditch]]. This hall catered for 500&amp;ndash;seated and a similar number standing. Jack Adam's company performed a successful programme of drama, song, dance and acrobatics. Sam married Jack's daughter Mary, in 1835.&lt;ref name=Crauford&gt;Crauford, Alfred L. ''Sam and Sallie: A novel of the theatre'' (London: Cranley and Day, 1933).&lt;/ref&gt;

The troupe always had ambitions to perform serious drama, and in 1839, the company performed ''[[Othello]]'', breaking the law on theatrical performance, as they were not a [[patent theatre]]. Lane lost his licence and paid a substantial fine.&lt;ref name=making&gt;[http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart1.php ''The Making of the Britannia Theatre'' Alan D. Craxford and Reg Moore] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723024600/http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart1.php# |date=23 July 2012 }} (extracts from ''Sam and Sallie'' at a family history website) accessed 21 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in London's population, and the increasing popularity of live entertainment, the law was finally changed with the [[Theatres Act 1843]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Theatres Act 1843'' (6 &amp; 7 Vict., c. 68) (also known as the ''Theatre Regulation Act'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Lane and his colleagues thought they had identified a loophole whereby performances could be offered without charge, with profits made from the sale of programmes, food and drink. The Britannia Tavern in Hoxton was identified as suitable premises. This was the former ''Pimlico'' tea gardens, an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] tavern and had a large hall attached, holding about 1,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=Today&gt;''Ruling the Britannia'' Sian Mogridge 10 March 2008 ''Hackney Today'' pp 23&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Royal Britannia Saloon and Brittania Tavern'' was opened on [[Easter Monday]] 1841 by Sam Lane. The theatre was a success. Sadly, private life was more difficult, Mary became pregnant, and slipped and fell at a rehearsal, both she and the baby died.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; By 1858 having purchased the leases of surrounding properties, the theatre was rebuilt in larger form, with 3,000&amp;nbsp;seats.&lt;ref name=Crauford/&gt; This building designed by [[Finch Hill]], consisting of two circles, a pit and a gallery and had a reported record attendance of 4,790.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

The Britannia was notable for melodramas. These included ''The String of Pearls'' (1847), the first stage adaptation of the story of [[Sweeney Todd]], written specifically for this venue by [[George Dibdin Pitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mack (2007) "Introduction" to ''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre had a resident dramatist, C.H. Hazlewood, who wrote many melodramatic spectacles for it, often based on successful novels of the time, including an adaptation of ''[[Lady Audley's Secret]]'' (1863).&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt;

===Britannia Theatre in 1861===
[[Charles Dickens]] was a frequent visitor to the theatre, and noted in the ''Uncommercial Traveller'' (1861):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Magnificently lighted by a firmament of sparkling chandeliers, the building was ventilated to perfection. [...] The air of this theatre was fresh, cool, and wholesome. [...] It has been constructed from the ground to the roof, with a careful reference to sight and sound in every corner; the result is, that its form is beautiful, and that the appearance of the audience, as seen from the proscenium -- with every face in it commanding the stage, and the whole so admirably raked and turned to that centre, that a hand can scarcely move in the great assemblage without the movement being seen from thence -- is highly remarkable in its union of vastness with compactness. The stage itself, and all its appurtenances of machinery, cellarage, height, and breadth, are on a scale more like the Scala at Milan. or the San Carlo at Naples, or the Grand Opera at Paris, than any notion a stranger would be likely to form of the Britannia Theatre at Hoxton, a mile north of St Luke’s Hospital in the Old-street-road, London. The Forty Thieves might be played here, and every thief ride his real horse, and the disguised captain bring in his oil jars on a train of real camels, and nobody be put out of the way. This really extraordinary place is an achievement of one man’s enterprise, and was erected on the ruins of an inconvenient old building, in less than five months, at a round cost of five-and-twenty thousand pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, "The Uncommercial Traveller" (1861), 43--44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sarah Lane===
Sam married Sarah Borrow (1822&amp;ndash;1899) in 1843. She was the daughter of an old friend, William Borrow, who Lane had appointed to a managerial position in the Britannia. Sarah had begun her own career on the stage, at the age of 17, as a singer and dancer, under the stage name ''Miss Sarah Wilton''. On Lane's death in 1871, Sarah, succeeded him as proprietor and manager, and continued until her own death in August 1899. She appeared regularly as [[principal boy]], in the Britannia's annual [[pantomime]]s  and in the annual benefit night, appearing in a final tableaux as ''The Queen of Hoxton''. Sarah Lane made her last stage appearance at the Britannia's 1898 Christmas show, aged 76. ''Sallie'' was a well-respected and charitable member of the local community. Large crowds lined the route of her funeral procession from the theatre to [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. Her estate was valued at a quarter of a million pounds, a significant sum in 1889.&lt;ref name=Craxford&gt;[http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart2.php ''The Britannia comes to the Craxfords''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130420022030/http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart2.php# |date=20 April 2013 }} accessed 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britannia Theatre in 1900===
A review of ''King Doo-Dah'', the Christmas pantomime, 1900, at the Britannia Theatre, appeared in the ''[[News of the World]]'':
{{quote|Biggest, brightest best, and jolliest pantomime ever produced at "The Brit," is the Hoxtonian verdict upon Mr. Crauford's latest Christmas production, King Doo-Dah. Indeed, the fourteen scenes that are utilised in telling the story are so full of good things that it would be quite impossible to do justice to them in the space at our command. The ever-popular Albert and Edmunds troupe, assisted by Mr. Fred Lawrence and the Montrose Bros., very clever and humorous acrobats, keep the fun at boiling point from start to finish. Mr. H.G. Sharplin made an imposing figure as Cerberus, his magnificent voice delighting the vast audience. Miss Josephine Henley looked a dapper little Prince, and Miss Emmie Ames a charming Princess. Her first song, "Matilda," in which she introduces several mechanical toys with excellent effect, brought down the house. Miss Lily Sharplin's imitations of Marie Collins, Bessie Wentworth, and Billie Barlow, were the best we have seen. The same young lady also fetched the audience with a clever descriptive song, "The Language London Talks." The Imperial Russian Troupe of Singers and Dancers are an innovation in pantomime. Their singing and dancing were so excellent that they scored one of the greatest successes of the evening. Miss Emma Chambers, as a high class domestic, was quaint and humorous, and Miss Kate Sharplin sang sweetly as Titania. In fact, there was not a mediocre character in the whole show. The flying ballet, concluding with a shower of gold, was really magnificent, as was the grand transformation scene. The pantomime does the greatest credit to the talents of the Britannia's popular stage manager, Mr. Bigwood, and is a distinct score for Mr. Crauford.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[News of the World]]'', London, Sunday, 30 December 1900, p.4e&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:c1890 George Hook Lupino.jpg|thumb|150px|George Hook Lupino, c. 1890]]

===Lupino family===
The [[Lupino family|Lupinos]] were a theatrical family who often claimed that their scion arrived in England in 1620, as a penniless refugee. George William Lupino was a puppeteer and the family continued to earn a theatrical living becoming associated with the [[harlequinade]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]. George Lupino Hook (1820–1902) adopted the stage name Lupino from performing with the family&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Mander, Joe Mitchenson ''Pantomime : a story in pictures'' (London, 1973). In the 1881 census, the family are shown living at 50 Merrion Street, Leeds &amp;ndash; as performers, with the middle name Lupino (RG/11 4536/28 pp.9).&lt;/ref&gt; and was associated with the Britannia, performing in leading roles and taking the role of [[Harlequin]] in pantomime. A prolific man, reputed to have had 16 children, many became singers, dancers and actors, receiving their first experience in the company. The eldest son, civil registration as George Emanuel Samuel Hook (1853–1932) became both a clown and a prominent actor, amongst his grandchildren was the [[Hollywood]] actress [[Ida Lupino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0526946|name=Ida Lupino}} accessed 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lupino Lane]] was the son of Harry Charles Lupino (1825–1925), a favourite of Sarah Lane&lt;ref name=Craxford/&gt; and pursued a career in films and [[musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|name=Lupino Lane|id=0313449}} accessed 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|name=Lupino Lane|id=48871}} accessed 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Lupino Lane originated ''[[The Lambeth Walk]]'', in the 
1937 musical ''[[Me and My Girl]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0420771|title=Me and My Girl (1939 BBC broadcast)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0032688|title=The Lambeth Walk (1940)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of an era===
Soon after the 1900 pantomime, a serious fire damaged the building. The cost of bringing the building up to standard, forced the sale of the lease. It came into the hands of the [[Gaumont British|Gaumont]] organisation, and became a cinema in 1913. The original theatre was demolished to make way for a modern cinema which was never built because of the war. In 1940 the nearby Toy Theatre [Pollock's Toy Museum], was destroyed in [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Airstrike|bombing]] but the theatre building had already gone by this time.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Britannia plaque.JPG|thumb|right|150px|LBH heritage plaque, now attached to modern flats]]
The Britannia Theatre was unique amongst theatres of the time, for a number of reasons. Entry to the entertainment was always cheap, the income was made from sales of food and drink. There was an extraordinary continuity of management, the theatre was in the hands of the same family throughout its lifetime. The theatre also nurtured talent, many of the regular artistes were taken on at an early stage in their careers and remained with the theatre until retirement.&lt;ref name=Crauford/&gt; The theatre prospered with the increasing free time and prosperity of its audience, and declined with the introduction of the cinema and later, radio.

Author and critic [[Compton Mackenzie]] summed up the enduring legacy of the Britannia, in ''Echoes'' (1954):

{{quote|If I were asked to name the audience that expressed beyond any other the spirit of London I would say the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, at a pantomime. This was the apotheosis of the [[Cockney]]. This was the incarnation of his humour and gaiety and warm humanity. The women in their plumed hats! The costers in their pearlies! The oranges and nuts! That immense audience would seethe with enjoyment: it was a vast bubbling kettle of mirth. This was the stuff out of which came the London able to 'take it' forty years on.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to the London [[The Blitz|Blitz]] that would destroy the Britannia.&lt;/ref&gt; I used to have tears in my eyes just from the pleasure of being one in such a gathering.

The Britannia Theatre was the subject of a novel called ''Sam and Sallie: A novel of the theatre'' (1933) by Alfred L. Crauford. The Crauford's had a long association with the Britannia, and Alfred was one of Sarah Lane's many nephews.

In [[Sarah Waters]] novel, [[Tipping the Velvet]], her lead characters are engaged to play pantomime in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tipping the velvet|last = Waters|first = Sarah|publisher = Virago|year = 1998|isbn = 978-1-86049-524-3|location = |pages = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chariot clock''' is a type of [[Mantel clock|mantel]]/table figural [[clock]] in the form of a [[chariot]] whose dial is set into the wheel or elsewhere, its origins date back to the second half of the 16th century southern Germany.&lt;ref name="Drouot catalogue"&gt;[http://catalogue.drouot.com/ref-drouot/lot-ventes-aux-encheres-drouot.jsp?id=2141796 Drouot catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; Normally of classical mythology subject matter, it has been made in different periods and styles such as Renaissance, Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Napoleon III, Art Deco, etc.

==History==
===Renaissance===
In the historical context of the [[Renaissance]], the so-called chariot clocks born in South Germany, a centre for clockmaking in Europe that flourished between 1550-1650, the leading cities being [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]]. They were selfmoving wheeled tabletop clocks that included [[Automaton|automata]] figurines and some a musical movement too. The German examples have not the dial inserted in the wheel, but in the seat or some other place.

Most of them were fabricated in Augsburg, although several existing clocks cannot be located due to the lack of inscriptions or hallmarks and are therefore ascribed only to South German workshops. These rare and at those days very costly pieces were only afforded by the nobility and royal courts.

===The Golden Age: Empire style===

[[File:Austrian chariot clock.jpg|thumb|right|A rare Austrian chariot clock, which usually had cases made out of wood, not bronze, c. 1810. [[National Watch and Clock Museum]].]]
In the 18th century France, during the [[Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI]] reigns a small number of models,&lt;ref name="Richard Redding Antiques"&gt;[http://www.richardreddingantiques.com/collection/horology/a-superb-empire-apollo-clock-attributed-to-p-p-thomire Richard Redding Antiques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220130553/http://www.richardreddingantiques.com/collection/horology/a-superb-empire-apollo-clock-attributed-to-p-p-thomire |date=December 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following their respective styles, were made, but it was not until the late 1790s and particularly during the first quarter of the 19th century that this type of clock found true popularity.&lt;ref name="Drouot catalogue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Redding Antiques"/&gt; Its revival was largely inspired by [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon Bonaparte’s]] conquers and victories in battles,&lt;ref name="Richard Redding Antiques"/&gt; though it continued to be in vogue after his definitive fall in 1815, specifically until the mid 1820s.

Its popularity in much of Europe&lt;ref&gt;Yves and Marcel Gay and [[André Lemaire]], "Les Pendules au char", Bulletin of ANCAHA, No. 66, Spring 1993: p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to a wide diversity of models (and variations within each model), allowing the fullest opportunity for the sculptor and bronzier to express their creativity and the brilliance of their craft. The freedom of trade initiated by the [[French Revolution]] allowed many casters, who during the [[ancien régime]] worked in workshops strictly limited to making [[bronze]], to develop large factories. They took advantage of this opportunity to execute all stages of bronze making within one factory and drew, cast, gilded, assembled and sold objects of their own workshops.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20079738 Charlotte Vignon, ''Deverberie &amp; Cie: Drawings, Models, and Works in Bronze'' (2003): p. 170. Cleveland Studies in the History of Art. Vol. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; Artisans still benefited from pre-Revolution training and worked according to the standards of a luxury art from the ancien régime, but they had better means of production and organization. Once freed from the technical constraints, the artists were able to give free rein to their imagination and their fantasy to create a multitude of models.

This coincided in time with the golden age of the decorative bronze using the [[ormolu]] technique, with a whole series of celebrated bronziers creating masterpieces of design, craftsmanship and good taste, one of the most famous being [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]]. All followed the same basic design, featuring an ancient chariot (two or four wheeled) on top of a rectangular or oblong base made out of bronze or [[marble]], carrying figures of [[classical mythology]] deities, with the majority of them having the dial set into the wheel.

In common with the rest of the [[French Empire mantel clock|French Empire style mantel clocks]] of the period, the allegorical ''pendules au char'' (chariot clocks) also had a meaning, served a political ideology and often exalted moral values:&lt;ref name="artaujourdhui.info"&gt;[http://www.artaujourdhui.info/a5332-the-king-the-emperor-and-the-clock-masterworks-from-the-mobilier-national-at-the-musee-du-temps-in-besancon.html The King, the Emperor and the Clock Masterworks from the Mobilier National at the musée du Temps in Besançon]&lt;/ref&gt; Heroism, bravery, military virtues, love and fidelity, study and encouragement of arts and sciences, etc. They also have an educational power&lt;ref name="artaujourdhui.info"/&gt; with evocative themes and narrative scenes in relief at the base.

Apart from France, in the first quarter of the 19th century, although to a much lesser extent, Empire style chariot clocks were also fabricated in Austria, England and Italy.

===Variety of styles (second half of the 19th century until the present)===

During the second half of the 19th century and early 20th, this type of clock was produced again in France, some were replicas/versions of Empire and Louis XVI style preexisting models, while others were new designs crafted in the style of the day, like Napoleon III, or inspired in styles of the past, such as Louis XV or Rococo.

In the United States, the New Haven clock company produced a model in the early 20th century.

Among the range of models of the French company Berlot-Mussier (they used the trade name ODYV between 1927-1940) there were one in the [[Art Deco]] style with the case made out of [[faience]] they sold in the 1930s.

{{History of China}}
'''Chinese art''' is [[visual art]] that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists. The Chinese art in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and that of [[overseas Chinese]] can also be considered part of Chinese art where it is based in or draws on Chinese heritage and [[Chinese culture]]. Early "[[stone age]] art" dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple [[pottery]] and sculptures. After this early period Chinese art, like Chinese history, is typically classified by the succession of ruling [[Dynasty|dynasties]] of [[Chinese emperors]], most of which lasted several hundred years.

Chinese art has arguably the oldest continuous tradition in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].

Much of the best work in ceramics, textiles, [[carved lacquer]], and other techniques was produced over a long period by the various Imperial factories or workshops, which as well as being used by the court was distributed internally and abroad on a huge scale to demonstrate the wealth and power of the Emperors. In contrast, the tradition of [[ink wash painting]], practiced mainly by [[scholar-official]]s and court painters especially of [[landscape painting|landscapes]], flowers, and birds, developed [[aesthetic]] values depending on the individual imagination of and objective observation by the artist that are similar to those of the West, but long pre-dated their development there. After contacts with Western art became increasingly important from the 19th century onwards, in recent decades China has participated with increasing success in worldwide [[contemporary art]].

{{main|Chinese painting}}

Traditional Chinese painting involves essentially the same techniques as [[Chinese calligraphy]] and is done with a
[[Ink and wash painting|brush dipped in black or colored ink]]; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made of paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as [[hanging scroll]]s or [[handscroll]]s. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, [[lacquerware]], [[folding screen]]s, and other media.

The two main techniques in Chinese painting are:
* [[Gongbi|Gong-bi]] (工筆), meaning "meticulous", uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely. It is often highly coloured and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects.  It is often practised by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops. [[Bird-and-flower painting]]s were often in this style.
* [[Ink and wash painting]], in Chinese ''Shui-mo'' or (水墨&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese character "mo" means ink and "shui" means water&lt;/ref&gt;) also loosely termed watercolour or brush painting, and also known as "literati painting", as it was one of the "[[Four Arts]]" of the Chinese [[Scholar-official]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman, 222&lt;/ref&gt; In theory this was an art practised by gentlemen, a distinction that begins to be made in writings on art from the [[Song dynasty]], though in fact the careers of leading exponents could benefit considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 114–119; Sickman, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; This style is also referred to as "xie yi" (寫意) or freehand style.

Artists from the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] (202 BC) to the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] (618–906) dynasties mainly painted the human figure. Much of what is known of early Chinese figure painting comes from burial sites, where paintings were preserved on silk banners, lacquered objects, and tomb walls. Many early tomb paintings were meant to protect the dead or help their souls get to paradise. Others illustrated the teachings of the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]], or showed scenes of daily life.  Most Chinese portraits showed a formal full-length frontal view, and were used in the family in [[ancestor veneration]]. Imperial portraits were more flexible, but were generally not seen outside the court, and portraiture formed no part of Imperial propaganda, as in other cultures.

Many critics consider landscape to be the highest form of Chinese painting. The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (907–1127) is known as the "Great age of Chinese landscape". In the north, artists such as [[Jing Hao]], [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], [[Fan Kuan]], and [[Guo Xi]] painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough rocks.  In the south, [[Dong Yuan]], [[Juran (painter)|Juran]], and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork. These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.

[[Chinese ritual bronzes]] from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Western Zhou dynasties]] come from a period of over a thousand years from c. 1500, and have exerted a continuing influence over Chinese art. They are cast with complex patterned and [[zoomorphic]] decoration, but avoid the human figure, unlike the huge figures only recently discovered at [[Sanxingdui]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 1, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacular [[Terracotta Army]] was assembled for the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[emperor]] of a unified China from 221–210 BC, as a grand imperial version of the figures long placed in tombs to enable the deceased to enjoy the same lifestyle in the afterlife as when alive, replacing actual sacrifices of very early periods. Smaller figures in pottery or wood were placed in tombs for many centuries afterwards, reaching a peak of quality in the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 138-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Chinese religions do not usually use cult images of deities, or even represent them, and large religious sculpture is nearly all Buddhist, dating mostly from the 4th to the 14th century, and initially using [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] models arriving via the [[Silk Road]]. Buddhism is also the context of all large portrait sculpture; in total contrast to some other areas in medieval China even painted images of the emperor were regarded as private. Imperial tombs have spectacular avenues of approach lined with real and mythological animals on a scale matching Egypt, and smaller versions decorate temples and palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135–145; 145–163&lt;/ref&gt;  Small Buddhist figures and groups were produced to a very high quality in a range of media,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 163–165&lt;/ref&gt; as was relief decoration of all sorts of objects, especially in metalwork and [[Chinese jade|jade]].&lt;ref name="Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6"&gt;Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptors of all sorts were regarded as artisans and very few names are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery==
{{main|Chinese ceramics}}
{{see also|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery}}
Chinese ceramic ware shows a continuous development since the pre-dynastic periods, and is one of the most significant forms of Chinese art. China is richly endowed with the raw materials needed for making ceramics. The first types of ceramics were made during the [[List of Palaeolithic sites in China|Palaeolithic]] era, and in later periods range from construction materials such as bricks and tiles, to hand-built pottery vessels fired in bonfires or kilns, to the sophisticated Chinese porcelain wares made for the imperial court. Most later Chinese ceramics, even of the finest quality, were made on an industrial scale, thus very few individual potters or painters are known. Many of the most renowned workshops were owned by or reserved for the Emperor, and large quantities of ceramics were exported as diplomatic gifts or for trade from an early date.

As well as porcelain, a wide range of materials that were more valuable were worked and decorated with great skill for a range of uses or just for display.&lt;ref name="Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6"/&gt; [[Chinese jade]] was attributed with magical powers, and was used in the Stone and Bronze Ages for large and impractical versions of everyday weapons and tools, as well as the [[Bi (jade)|''bi'' disks]] and [[Cong (jade)|''cong'' vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 50–54&lt;/ref&gt;  Later a range of objects and small sculptures were carved in jade, a difficult and time-consuming technique. [[Bronze]], gold and silver, [[rhinoceros horn]], [[Chinese silk]], ivory, [[Chinese lacquerware|lacquer]] and [[carved lacquer]], [[cloisonne enamel]] and many other materials had specialist artists working in them.

[[Folding screen]]s ({{zh|c=屏風|p=píngfēng}}) are often decorated with beautiful art; major themes include mythology, scenes of palace life, and nature. Materials such as wood panel, paper and silk are used in making folding screens. They were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their [[Chinese painting|paintings]] and [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazurkewich|first1=Karen|first2=A.

==Historical development to 221 BC==

===Neolithic pottery===
{{main|Yangshao culture|Peiligang culture}}

Early forms of art in China are found in the [[Neolithic]] [[Yangshao culture]], which dates back to the 6th millennium BC. Archeological findings such as those at the [[Banpo]] have revealed that the Yangshao made pottery; early [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] were unpainted and most often cord-marked. The first decorations were fish and human faces, but these eventually evolved into [[Symmetry|symmetrical]]-[[Geometry|geometric]] abstract designs, some painted.

The most distinctive feature of Yangshao culture was the extensive use of painted pottery, especially human facial, animal, and geometric designs. Unlike the later [[Longshan culture]], the Yangshao culture did not use [[pottery wheel]]s in pottery making. Excavations have found that children were buried in painted pottery jars.

===Jade culture===
{{main|Liangzhu culture}}

The Liangzhu culture was the last Neolithic Jade culture in the [[Yangtze River Delta]] and was spaced over a period of about 1,300 years.  The Jade from this culture is characterized by finely worked, large ritual jades such as [[Cong (jade)|Cong]] cylinders, [[Bi (jade)|Bi]] discs, Yue axes and also pendants and decorations in the form of chiseled open-work plaques, plates and representations of small birds, turtles and fish. The Liangzhu Jade has a white, milky bone-like aspect due to its [[Tremolite]] rock origin and influence of water-based fluids at the burial sites.

=== Bronze casting ===
[[File:Ritual cooking vessel.jpg|thumb|left|Shang dynasty bronze ritual [[ding (vessel)|ding]]]]
{{main|Chinese ritual bronzes}}
{{further|Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng}}
The [[Bronze Age]] in China began with the [[Xia dynasty]]. Examples from this period have been recovered from ruins of the [[Erlitou culture]], in Shanxi, and include complex but unadorned utilitarian objects.  In the following [[Shang dynasty]] more elaborate objects, including many ritual vessels, were crafted.  The Shang are remembered for their [[bronze]] casting, noted for its clarity of detail. Shang bronzesmiths usually worked in [[Foundry|foundries]] outside the cities to make ritual vessels, and sometimes weapons and chariot fittings as well. The bronze vessels were receptacles for storing or serving various solids and liquids used in the performance of sacred ceremonies. Some forms such as the ''ku'' and ''jue'' can be very graceful, but the most powerful pieces are the ''[[ding (vessel)|ding]]'', sometimes described as having an "air of ferocious majesty".

It is typical of the developed Shang style that all available space is decorated, most often with stylized forms of real and imaginary animals. The most common motif is the ''[[taotie]]'', which shows a mythological being presented frontally as though squashed onto a horizontal plane to form a symmetrical design. The early significance of ''taotie'' is not clear, but myths about it existed around the late [[Zhou dynasty]]. It was considered to be variously a covetous man banished to guard a corner of heaven against evil monsters; or a monster equipped with only a head which tries to devour men but hurts only itself.

The function and appearance of bronzes changed gradually from the Shang to the Zhou. They shifted from been used in religious rites to more practical purposes. By the [[Warring States period]], bronze vessels had become objects of aesthetic enjoyment. Some were decorated with social scenes, such as from a banquet or hunt; whilst others displayed abstract patterns inlaid with gold, silver, or precious and semiprecious stones.

Bronze artifacts also have significant meaning and roles in Han Dynasty as well. People used them for funerary purposes which reflect the aesthetic and artistic qualities of Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zebin|first=Li|date=September 2013|title=FASHION AND RITUALS OF THE HAN DYNASTY: Cultural Relics of the Royal Houses of Jiangsu.|url=|journal=Orientations|volume=44|pages=5–7|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bronze vessels excavated from tombs in Jiangsu Province, China have various shapes like Ding, Hu, and Xun which represent traditional Chinese aesthete.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other than the vessels, bronze weapons, daily items, and musical instruments are also found in royal Han families' tomb in Jiangsu. The excavation of Bianzhong, a typical and royal instrument found in ancient China, emphasizes the development of complex music systems in Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Shang bronzes became appreciated as works of art from the [[Song dynasty]], when they were collected and prized not only for their shape and design but also for the various green, blue green, and even reddish patinas created by chemical action as they lay buried in the ground. The study of early Chinese bronze casting is a specialized field of art history.

=== Chu and Southern culture ===
A rich source of art in early China was the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], which developed in the Yangtze River valley. Excavations of Chu tombs have found painted wooden sculptures, jade disks, glass beads, musical instruments, and an assortment of [[lacquerware]]. Many of the lacquer objects are finely painted, red on black or black on red. A site in [[Changsha]], Hunan province, has revealed some of the oldest paintings on silk discovered to date.

All of them were one-third life size, smaller than the 8,000-some fully life size soldiers of the [[Terracotta Army]] buried alongside the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor of Qin]]. Smaller miniature figurines, on average 60 centimeters (24 in) in height, have also been found in various royal Han tombs where they were placed to guard the deceased tomb occupants in their afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, Ann.

The [[Terracotta Army]], inside the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, consists of more than 7,000 life-size tomb [[terra-cotta]] figures of warriors and horses buried with the self-proclaimed first [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] ([[Qin Shi Huang]]) in 210–209 BC. The figures were painted before being placed into the vault. The original colors were visible when the pieces were first unearthed. However, exposure to air caused the pigments to fade, so today the unearthed figures appear [[terracotta]] in color. The figures are in several poses including standing infantry and kneeling archers, as well as charioteers with horses. Each figure's head appears to be unique, showing a variety of facial features and expressions as well as hair styles. The spectacular realism displayed by the sculptures is an evidence of the advancement of art during the Qin Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953927607|title=Art history|last=1929-2016,|first=Stokstad, Marilyn,|others=Cothren, Michael Watt,|isbn=9780134475882|edition= Sixth|location=Upper Saddle River|oclc=953927607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A music instrument called Qin zither was developed during Qin Dynasty.

=== Han art ===
The [[Han dynasty]] was known for [[jade burial suit]]s. One of the earliest known depictions of a landscape in Chinese art comes from a pair of hollow-tile door panels from a Western Han dynasty tomb near [[Zhengzhou]], dated 60 BC.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 plate"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China'': Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3: Civil Engineering and Nautics. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Plate CCCXII&lt;/ref&gt; A scene of continuous depth recession is conveyed by the zigzag of lines representing roads and garden walls, giving the impression that one is looking down from the top of a hill.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 plate"/&gt; This artistic landscape scene was made by the repeated impression of standard stamps on the clay while it was still soft and not yet fired.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 plate"/&gt; However, the oldest known landscape art scene tradition in the classical sense of painting is a work by [[Zhan Ziqian]] of the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618).

Other than jade artifacts, bronze is another favorite medium for artists since it is hard and durable. Bronze mirrors have been mass produced in Han Dynasty(206 BC-220 AD), and almost every tomb excavated that has been dated as Han Dynasty has mirror in the burial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reflective side is usually made by a composition of bronze, copper, tin, and lead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yuejin|date=September 1994|title=Mirror, Death, and Rhetoric: Reading Late Han Chinese Bronze Artifacts|journal=Art Bulletin|volume=LXXVI|pages=511|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "mirror" means "to reflect" or "to look into" in Chinese, so bronze mirrors have been used as a trope for reflecting the reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ancient Chinese believe that mirror can act as a representation of the reality, which could make them more aware of the current situation; also, mirrors are used as a media to convey or present a reflection of the past events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The bronze mirrors made in Han Dynasty always have complex decorations on their non-reflective side; some of them consist narratives that tell stories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Influence of Buddhism ===
{{main|Buddhist art#China|l1=Buddhist art}}
[[Buddhism]] arrived in China around the 1st century AD (although there are some traditions about a monk visiting China during [[Asoka]]'s reign), and through to the 8th century it became very active and creative in the development of Buddhist art, particularly in the area of statuary. Receiving this distant religion, China soon incorporated strong Chinese traits in its artistic expression.

In the fifth to sixth century the [[Northern dynasties]], rather removed from the original sources of inspiration, tended to develop rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible, realistic manner, progressively led to a research towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

=== Calligraphy ===
In ancient China, painting and [[calligraphy]] were the most highly appreciated arts in court circles and were produced almost exclusively by amateurs, aristocrats and scholar-officials who alone had the leisure to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy was thought to be the highest and purest form of painting. The implements were the brush, made of animal hair, and black [[ink]] made from pine soot and animal glue. Writing as well as painting was done on silk. But after the invention of paper in the 1st century, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China's history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.

[[Wang Xizhi]] was a famous Chinese calligrapher who lived in the 4th century AD. His most famous work is the ''[[Lanting Xu]]'', the preface to a collection of poems. The script was often celebrated as the high point of the [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] "Running Style" in the history of Chinese calligraphy.

[[Wei Shuo]] was a well-known calligrapher of the [[Eastern Jin dynasty]] who established consequential rules about the [[Regular Script]].  Her well-known works include ''Famous Concubine Inscription'' (名姬帖 Ming Ji Tie) and ''The Inscription of Wei-shi He'nan'' (衛氏和南帖 Wei-shi He'nan Tie).

[[Gu Kaizhi]] is a celebrated painter of ancient China born in [[Wuxi]]. He wrote three books about painting theory: ''On Painting'' (畫論), ''Introduction of Famous Paintings of Wei and Jin Dynasties'' (魏晉名畫記) and ''Painting Yuntai Mountain'' (畫雲臺山記). He wrote, "In figure paintings the clothes and the appearances were not very important. The eyes were the spirit and the decisive factor."
Three of Gu's paintings still survive today: ''[[Admonitions Scroll|Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies]]'', ''Nymph of the Luo River'' (洛神賦), and ''Wise and Benevolent Women''.

There are other examples of Jin dynasty painting from tombs. This includes the ''Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove,'' painted on a brick wall of a tomb located near modern Nanjing and now found in the Shaanxi Provincial Museum. Each of the figures are labeled and shown either drinking, writing, or playing a musical instrument. Other tomb paintings also depict scenes of daily life, such as men plowing fields with teams of oxen.

=== Buddhist architecture and sculpture ===
Following a transition under the [[Sui dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. As a consequence of the dynasty's openness to foreign trade and influences through the [[Silk Road]], Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Greco-Buddhist art of Central Asia.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wu-Tsung]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the ulterior development of the religion and its arts in China.

Glazed or painted [[earthenware]] [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]] are famous, and well-represented in museums around the world. Most wooden Tang sculptures have not survived, though representations of the Tang international style can still be seen in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], Japan. The longevity of stone sculpture has proved much greater. Some of the finest examples can be seen at [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen]], near [[Luoyang]] ([[Henan]]), [[Yungang]] near [[Datong]] ([[Shanxi]]), and [[Bingling Temple]] in [[Gansu]].
One of the most famous Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]]s is the [[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]], built in 652 AD.

=== Painting ===
[[File:Dong Yuan Mountain Hall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Painting by [[Dong Yuan]] (c. 934–962).]]
Beginning in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the primary subject matter of painting was the landscape, known as [[shanshui]] (mountain water) painting. In these landscapes, usually monochromatic and sparse, the purpose was not to reproduce exactly the appearance of nature but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere so as to catch the "rhythm" of nature.

Painting in the traditional style involved essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and was done with a brush dipped in black or colored ink; oils were not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings were made were paper and silk. The finished works were then mounted on scrolls, which could be hung or rolled up. Traditional painting was also done in albums, on walls, [[lacquer]] work, and in other media.

[[Dong Yuan]] was an active painter in the Southern Tang Kingdom. He was known for both figure and landscape paintings, and exemplified the elegant style which would become the standard for brush painting in China over the next 900 years. As with many artists in China, his profession was as an official where he studied the existing styles of Li Sixun and Wang Wei. However, he added to the number of techniques, including more sophisticated perspective, use of pointillism and crosshatching to build up vivid effect.

[[Zhan Ziqian]] was a painter during the Sui dynasty. His only painting in existence is ''Strolling About In Spring'' arranged mountains perspectively. Because pure [[landscape paintings]] are hardly seen in Europe until the 17th century, ''Strolling About In Spring'' may well be the world's first landscape painting.

=== Song painting ===
During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), landscapes of more subtle expression appeared; immeasurable distances were conveyed through the use of blurred outlines, mountain contours disappearing into the mist, and impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. Emphasis was placed on the spiritual qualities of the painting and on the ability of the artist to reveal the inner harmony of man and nature, as perceived according to [[Taoist art|Taoist]] and [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] concepts.

[[Liang Kai]] was a Chinese painter who lived in the 13th century (Song dynasty). He called himself "Madman Liang", and he spent his life drinking and painting. Eventually, he retired and became a [[Zen]] monk. Liang is credited with inventing the Zen school of Chinese art. [[Wen Tong]] was a painter who lived in the 11th century. He was famous for [[ink paintings of bamboo]].  He could hold two brushes in one hand and paint two different distanced bamboos simultaneously. He did not need to see the bamboo while he painted them because he had seen a lot of them.

[[Zhang Zeduan]] was a notable painter for his horizontal ''[[Along the River During Qingming Festival]]'' landscape and cityscape painting. It has been quoted as "China's [[Mona Lisa]]" and has had many well-known remakes throughout Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradsher |first=Keith |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/arts/design/03pain.html?_r=2 |title=‘China's Mona Lisa’ Makes a Rare Appearance in Hong Kong |location=China;Hong Kong;Great Britain |work=The New York Times  |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous paintings include ''[[Gu Hongzhong|The Night Revels of Han Xizai]]'', originally painted by the [[Southern Tang]] artist [[Gu Hongzhong]] in the 10th century, while the well-known version of his painting is a 12th-century remake of the Song dynasty. This is a large horizontal handscroll of a domestic scene showing men of the [[Gentry (China)|gentry class]] being entertained by musicians and dancers while enjoying food, beverage, and wash basins provided by maidservants. In 2000, the modern artist Wang Qingsong created a parody of this painting with a long, horizontal photograph of people in modern clothing making similar facial expressions, poses, and hand gestures as the original painting.

=== Yuan painting ===
[[File:Emperor Taizu play Cuju.jpg|thumb|250px|A painting depicting [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] playing ''[[cuju]]'' (i.e. Chinese football) with his prime minister [[Zhao Pu]] (趙普) and other ministers, by the [[Yuan dynasty]] artist [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305)]]

With the fall of the Song dynasty in 1279, and the subsequent dislocation caused by the establishment of the [[Yuan dynasty]] by the [[Mongol]] conquerors, many court and literary artists retreated from social life, and returned to nature, through landscape paintings, and by renewing the "blue and green" style of the Tang era.&lt;ref name="Capon and Pang, pg. 12"&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Meng (artist)|Wang Meng]] was one such painter, and one of his most famous works is the ''Forest Grotto''. [[Zhao Mengfu]] was a Chinese scholar, painter and [[calligrapher]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. His rejection of the refined, gentle brushwork of his era in favor of the cruder style of the 8th century is considered to have brought about a revolution that created the modern Chinese landscape painting. There was also the vivid and detailed works of art by [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305), who had served the Song court, and out of patriotism refused to serve the Mongols, instead turning to painting. He was also famous for reviving and reproducing a more Tang dynasty style of painting.

The later Yuan dynasty is characterized by the work of the so-called "Four Great Masters". The most notable of these was [[Huang Gongwang]] (1269–1354) whose cool and restrained landscapes were admired by contemporaries, and by the Chinese literati painters of later centuries. Another of great influence was [[Ni Zan]] (1301–1374), who frequently arranged his compositions with a strong and distinct foreground and background, but left the middle-ground as an empty expanse. This scheme was frequently to be adopted by later [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing]] dynasty painters.&lt;ref name="Capon and Pang, pg. 12"/&gt;

===Pottery===
[[Chinese porcelain]] is made from a hard paste made of the [[clay]] [[kaolin]] and a [[feldspar]] called [[petuntse]], which cements the vessel and seals any [[Wiktionary:pore|pores]]. ''China'' has become synonymous with high-quality porcelain. Most china pots comes from the city of [[Jingdezhen]] in China's [[Jiangxi]] province. [[Jingdezhen porcelain]], under a variety of names, has been central to porcelain production in China since at least the [[Yuan dynasty]].

==Late imperial China (1368–1911)==

=== Ming painting ===
{{main|Ming dynasty painting}}
Under the [[Ming dynasty]], Chinese culture bloomed. Narrative painting, with a wider color range and a much busier composition than the Song paintings, was immensely popular during the time.

[[Wen Zhengming]] (1470–1559) developed the style of the Wu school in [[Suzhou]], which dominated Chinese painting during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

European culture began to make an impact on Chinese art during this period. The Jesuit priest [[Matteo Ricci]] visited [[Nanjing]] with many Western artworks, which were influential in showing different techniques of perspective and shading.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Early Qing painting ===
The early Qing dynasty developed in two main strands: the Orthodox school, and the Individualist painters, both of which followed the theories of Dong Qichang, but emphasizing very different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 90, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Four Wangs]]", including [[Wang Jian (17th-century painter)|Wang Jian]] (1598–1677) and [[Wang Shimin]] (1592–1680), were particularly renowned in the [[Six Masters of the early Qing period|Orthodox school]], and sought inspiration in recreating the past styles, especially the technical skills in brushstrokes and calligraphy of ancient masters. The younger [[Wang Yuanqi]] (1642–1715) ritualized the approach of engaging with and drawing inspiration from a work of an ancient master. His own works were often annotated with his theories of how his painting relates to the master's model.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The Individualist painters included [[Bada Shanren]] (1626–1705) and [[Shitao]] (1641–1707). They drew more from the revolutionary ideas of transcending the tradition to achieve an original individualistic styles; in this way they were more faithfully following the way of Dong Qichang than the Orthodox school (who were his official direct followers.)&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Painters outside of the literati-scholar and aristocratic traditions also gained renown, with some artists creating paintings to sell for money. These included [[Ma Quan]] (late 17th–18th century), who depicted common flowers, birds, and insects that were not typical subject matter among scholars. Such painters were, however, not separated from formal schools of painting, but were usually well-versed in artistic styles and techniques. Ma Quan, for example, modelled her brushwork on Song dynasty examples.&lt;ref name=zhao&gt;{{cite|last=Zhao |first=Yanqing 赵燕青|title=浅议马荃的花鸟画风 |trans-title=Discussion of Ma Quan's bird and flower paintings style|language=Chinese|journal=Dazhong Wenyi (Lilun)|date=2009 | issue=3|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the boneless technique ({{zh|c=沒骨畫}}), thought to have originated as a preparatory step when painting gold-line images during the Tang, was continued by painters like [[Yun Shouping]] (1633–1690) and his descendent [[Yun Bing]].&lt;ref name=briessen&gt;{{cite |title=The Way of the Brush: Painting Techniques of China and Japan|last=van Briessen|first=Fritz|place=Vermont|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|date=1998|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the techniques of color printing were perfected, illustrated manuals on the art of painting began to be published. ''[[Jieziyuan Huazhuan]]'' (Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden), a five-volume work first published in 1679, has been in use as a technical textbook for artists and students ever since.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Late Qing Art ===
[[Nianhua]] were a form of [[colored]] woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the [[Chinese New Year]]. In the 19th century Nianhua were used as news mediums.

=== Shanghai School ===
The [[Shanghai School]] is a very important Chinese school of traditional arts during the [[Qing dynasty]] and the 20th century. Under efforts of masters from this school, traditional Chinese art reached another climax and continued to the present in forms of "[[Chinese painting]]" (中國畫), or ''guohua'' (國畫) for short.  The Shanghai School challenged and broke the literati tradition of Chinese art, while also paying technical homage to the ancient masters and improving on existing traditional techniques. Members of this school were themselves educated literati who had come to question their very status and the purpose of art, and had anticipated the impending modernization of Chinese society. In an era of rapid social change, works from the Shanghai School were widely innovative and diverse, and often contained thoughtful yet subtle social commentary. The best known figures from this school are [[Ren Xiong]], [[Ren Bonian]], [[Zhao Zhiqian]], [[Wu Changshuo]], [[Sha Menghai]], [[Pan Tianshou]], [[Fu Baoshi]], [[He Tianjian]], and [[Xie Zhiliu]].  Other well-known painters include [[Wang Zhen (painter)|Wang Zhen]], [[XuGu]], [[Zhang Xiong (painter)|Zhang Xiong]], [[Hu Yuan]], and [[Yang Borun]].

== New China art (1912–1949) ==
[[File:Sanmaonewspaper1948.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sanmao (comic book character)|Sanmao]], one of the most well-known comic book characters in China]]

===Transformation===
With the end of the last dynasty in China, the [[New Culture Movement]] began and defied all facets of traditionalism. A new breed of 20th-century cultural philosophers like [[Xiao Youmei]], [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Feng Zikai]] and [[Wang Guangqi]] wanted Chinese culture to modernise and reflect the New China. The [[Chinese Civil War]] would cause a drastic split between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]. Following was the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in particular. The [[Battle of Shanghai]] would leave the major cultural art center borderline to a humanitarian crisis.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Painting===
[[Ong Schan Tchow]] ({{zh|c=[[:zh:翁占秋|翁占秋]]}}) (1900–1945), artist and friend of [[Cai Yuanpei]] accomplished the subtle integration of Western art techniques and perspectives into traditional Chinese painting. Ong was one of the first few batches of Chinese scholars and artists who studied in France in the early 20th century.

Western style oil painting was introduced to China by painters such as [[Xiao Tao Sheng]]. Another important influential artist in the 1940s was [[Tai Ping Meijing]] who incorporated nature in all his art and mixed traditional Asian art with realism.

==Communist and socialist art (1950–1980s)==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:HavocinHeaven1964.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Havoc in Heaven]]'', made in 1964 and considered as a noted example of [[Chinese animation]]]] --&gt;

===Selective art decline===
The Communist Party of China gained full control of the government with [[Mao Zedong]] heading the People's Republic of China. Artists were heavily promoted if their art was presented in a manner that favored the government. Vice versa, any clash with communist party beliefs would force artists to become farmers via "re-education" processes under the regime. The peak era of governmental control came during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The most notable event was the [[Four Olds|Destruction of the Four Olds]], which had major consequences for pottery, painting, literary art, architecture, and more.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Painting===
Artists were encouraged to employ [[socialist realism]]. Some Soviet Union socialist realism was imported without modification, and painters were assigned subjects and expected to mass-produce paintings. This regimen was considerably relaxed in 1953 and, after the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] of 1956–57, traditional Chinese painting experienced a significant revival. Along with these developments in professional art circles, there was a proliferation of peasant art depicting everyday life in the rural areas on wall murals and in open-air painting exhibitions. Notable modern Chinese painters include [[Huang Binhong]], [[Qi Baishi]], [[Xu Beihong]], [[Cai Jin]], [[Chang Ta Chien]], [[Pan Tianshou]], [[Wu Changshi]], [[Fu Baoshi]], [[Wang Kangle]], and [[Zhang Chongren]].

==Redevelopment (Mid-1980s – 1990s)==

===Contemporary art===
Contemporary Chinese art ({{lang|zh|中國當代藝術}}, Zhongguo Dangdai Yishu) often referred to as Chinese avant-garde art, continued to develop since the 1980s as an outgrowth of modern art developments post-Cultural Revolution. 
[[File:Chinese-han-yajuan-FashionEnsemble.jpg|450px|thumb|left|[[Han Yajuan]]: Fashion Ensemble. Oil on Canvas, 2010 (180 cm x 360 cm).]]
Contemporary Chinese art fully incorporates painting, film, video, photography, and performance. Until recently, art exhibitions deemed controversial have been routinely shut down by police, and performance artists in particular faced the threat of arrest in the early 1990s. More recently there has been greater tolerance by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], though many internationally acclaimed artists are still restricted from media exposure at home or have exhibitions ordered closed. Leading contemporary visual artists include [[Ai Weiwei]], [[Cai Guoqiang]], [[Cai Jin]], [[Chan Shengyao]], [[Fang Lijun]], [[Fu Wenjun]], [[He Xiangyu]], [[Huang Yan (artist)|Huang Yan]], [[Huang Yong Ping]], [[Han Yajuan]], [[Kong Bai Ji]], [[Li Hongbo]], [[Li Hui (artist)|Li Hui]], [[Liu Bolin]], [[Lu Shengzhong]], [[Ma Liuming]], [[Qiu Shihua]], [[Shen Shaomin]], [[Shi Jinsong]], [[Song Dong]], [[Li Wei (artist)|Li Wei]], [[Wang Guangyi]], [[Wenda Gu]], [[Xu Bing]], [[Yang Zhichao]], [[Zhan Wang]], [[Zheng Lianjie]], [[Zhang Dali]], [[Zhang Xiaogang]], [[Zhang Huan]], [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]], [[Ma Kelu]], [[Ding Fang]], [[Shang Yang (artist)|Shang Yang]], [[Gao Minglu]] and [[Guo Jian]].

===Visual art===
Beginning in the late 1980s there was unprecedented exposure for younger Chinese visual artists in the west to some degree through the agency of curators based outside the country such as [[Hou Hanru]]. Local curators within the country such as [[Gao Minglu]] and critics such as [[Li Xianting]] (栗憲庭) reinforced this promotion of particular brands of painting that had recently emerged, while also spreading the idea of art as a strong social force within Chinese culture. There was some controversy as critics identified these imprecise representations of contemporary Chinese art as having been constructed out of personal preferences, a kind of programmatized artist-curator relationship that only further alienated the majority of the avant-garde from Chinese officialdom and western art market patronage.

==Art market==
[[File:AllTheMountainsBlanketedinred.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''All The Mountains Blanketed in Red'' by Li Keran]]

For centuries largely made-up of European and American buyers, the international buying market for Chinese art has also begun to be dominated by Chinese dealers and collectors in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/arts/03iht-melik3.html "Chinese Bidders Conquer Market"] article by Souren Melikian in ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in 2011, China has become the world's second biggest market for art and antiques, accounting for 23 percent of the world's total art market, behind the United States (which accounts for 34 percent of the world's art market).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AFP |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/china-overtakes-britain-as-second-biggest-art-market-2245587.html |title=China overtakes Britain as second biggest art market |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another transformation driving the growth of the Chinese art market is the rise of a clientele no longer mostly European or American. New fortunes from countries once thought of as poor often prefer non-Western art; a large gallerist in the field has offices in both New York and Beijing, but clients mainly hailing from Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Genis|first1=Daniel|title=Eli Klein on Riding the Wave of China's Contemporary Art Scene|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/04/24/riding-wave-chinas-contemporary-art-scene-321621.html|website=www.Newsweek.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Emmy Coer is a computer scientist obsessed with Countess [[Ada Lovelace]], author of the first computer [[algorithm]], written for [[Charles Babbage]]'s "[[Analytical Engine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is upset to discover she is pregnant believing that the pregnancy will interfere with her work. Afraid of losing her boyfriend she decides to keep the baby. Emmy tries to work on a way of communicating with Lovelace in the past by way of "undying information waves". She eventually succeeds and is able to communicate with Ada and learn about her studies, her work and how she felt that in many ways her work was hampered by her children and by the time she lived in. Emmy wants to bring Ada into the present by allowing her to inhabit her body. A dying Ada refuses, insisting that Emmy needs to live her own life. However, by 2002 Emmy is raising a daughter who has been embedded with Ada's consciousness and who already shows a precociousness with computers despite the fact that Emmy is trying to raise her to have a normal childhood.

==Reception==
Upon its February 1999 premiere in New York City, [[Stephen Holden]] called its [[premise (filmmaking)|premise]] "intriguing" though the film is "much better at throwing out ideas than at telling a story or at creating compelling characters"; it has a "overall air of woodenness and shrill [[didacticism]]."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/022699ada-film-review.html | title= ''Conceiving Ada'': Calling Byron's Daughter, Inventor of a Computer | work= The New York Times | date= February 26, 1999 | first= Stephen|last= Holden| authorlink=Stephen Holden| accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, Edward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it a "film without category or precedent. A meditation on memory, feminism, immortality and the horizons of [[virtual reality]], it's got enough ideas and intellectual fodder for a dozen films&amp;mdash;which is its virtue and its defect at the same time. Directed by local video artist Lynn Hershman Leeson, ''Conceiving Ada'' is a fanciful, multilayered experiment about two women who connect through [[cyberspace]] across the divide of time and discover some remarkable parallels between their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Complex-Ada-Crosses-Divides-of-Time-Cyberspace-2946477.php| title= Complex ''Ada' Crosses Divides of Time, Cyberspace| work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date= February 19, 1999 | first= Edward |last= Guthmann| accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy''''' ({{lang-de|Faust. Der Tragödie zweiter Teil in fünf Akten.}}), is the second part of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. It was published in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Because of its complexity in form and content, it is usually not read in German schools, although the first part commonly is.

Only part of Faust I is directly related to the legend of [[Johann Georg Faust|Johann Faust]], which dates to at latest the beginning of the 16th century (thus preceding [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s [[Doctor Faustus (play)|play]]). The "Gretchen" subplot, although now the most widely known episode of the Faust legend, was of Goethe's own invention. In Faust II, the legend  (at least in a version of the 18th century, which came to Goethe's attention) already contained Faust's marriage with Helen and an encounter with an Emperor. But certainly Goethe deals with the legendary material very freely in both parts.

==Acts==

===Act I===

* ''Graceful area. Faust, bedded on flowery turf, weary, restless, seeking sleep. Dusk. Ghost circle, floating moves, graceful little figures.''

The first act opens with an appeal by Ariel to forgive Faust and ease the cares of his suffering.

* ''Hall of the Throne. State Council in anticipation of the emperor. Trumpets. Servants of all kinds, beautifully dressed, step forward. The emperor ascends the throne, to his right the astrologer.''

The first act sees Mephistopheles (playing the role of a fool) saving the imperial finances of the Emperor – and so the [[Holy Roman Empire]] – by introducing the use of [[paper money]] instead of gold to encourage spending (and economic recovery).

* ''Spacious room with side chambers, decorated and dressed up for the masquerade.''

This is by far the most extensive section of the first act, describing the Florentine carnival from the perspective of Goethe, above all based on [[Antonio Francesco Grazzini]]'s ''[[Tutti i Trifoni]]'' (1559) – a collection of contemporary "songs and hard lifts". A parade of Florentine notables, including Dante and [[Gianni Schicchi]], pass by.

* ''Lustgarten, morning sun. Faust, Mephistopheles, decent, not remarkable, according to custom, dressed, and both knees exposed.''

The "Emperor of Thumb" (to use a devilish term of Mephistopheles) describes how much he enjoyed the recent celebrations, and wants more "dergleichen Scherze" (5988). The Emperor appears and blesses the newly introduced paper money from Mephisto, which is adorned with pictures of [[Simon Magus]]. The Emperor begins to understand its meaning and to squander it, as do his advisors. Goethe here satirizes the introduction of paper money during the [[French Revolution]], with various advisors possibly representing [[Georges Danton|Danton]], [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]] and other figures.

* ''Dark gallery. Faust. Mephistopheles.''

Faust enters the "realm of the mothers" – variously described as the depths of the psyche or the womb – in order to bring back the "ideal form" of beauty for the Emperor's delight. In this case, the ideal forms are [[Helen of Troy]] and her lover [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. Faust summons their spirits from [[Hades]], but the emperor and the male members of his court criticize Paris's appearance, while the women of the court criticize Helen's appearance. Faust falls in love with Helen. In a fit of jealously toward Paris, who is now abducting Helen, Faust destroys the illusion and the act ends in darkness and tumult.

===Act II===
Mephistopheles transports the unconscious Faust into his old study. Mephistopheles, donning Faust's robe once again, resumes his conversation with the freshman, who is now a cynical baccalaurus. The [[Homunculus]], an artificial human being created by Wagner, Faust's former famulus, by means of an alchemical process, leads Faust and [[Mephistopheles]] to the "Classical [[Walpurgisnacht]]", where they encounter gods and monsters from Greek [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Faust, still searching for Helen, is led by the sybil [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]] into the Underworld. Mephistopheles, meanwhile, meets the Phorkyads or Phorcydes (another name for the [[Graeae]]) three hideous hags who share one tooth and one eye between them, and he disguises himself as one of them. Guided by the sea-god [[Proteus]], the Homunculus is initiated into the process of becoming fully human.

===Act III===
The third act begins with Helen's arrival at the palace of [[Menelaus]] in Sparta, accompanied by women, who, as in [[Classical drama]], constitute the chorus. The hideous Phorkyas appears at the hearth, and warns Helen that Menelaus means to sacrifice her and her attendants. Distraught at this new knowledge, Helen implores Phorkyas to save them. Phorkyas transports Helen and the chorus to Faust's fortress, where Helen and Faust declare their love for each other. After defeating Menelaus' army, Faust proclaims the pastoral beauty of the [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] countryside.

The scene changes in time and space: a range of rocky caverns, with a shadowy grove extending to the foot of the rocks. Phorkyas, now Faust and Helen's attendant, explains to the newly-woken chorus that during the past interval Faust and Helen have had a spirited son named Euphorion, who charms all with his beauty and gift for music. The wild Euphorion, becoming increasingly bold in his flight, falls to his death (in allusion to [[Icarus]]), whereupon the sorrowful Helen disappears in a mist to Hades  (in allusion to the legend of [[Orpheus]]). The chorus of women, undesirous of joining their mistress in the Underworld, revert to nature, which they extol in songs of praise. As the act ends, Phorkyas is revealed to be Mephistopheles in disguise.

===Act IV===
In the fourth act, Faust returns to the Emperor, who is at war with a rival Emperor. With the help of Mephistopheles' ordered ranks of Daemons they achieve victory.

===Act V===
An indefinite interval of time has passed since the end of the previous act, and Faust is now an old but powerful man favored by the king. Using dikes and dams to push back the sea, Faust has built a castle on the reclaimed land. Upon seeing the hut of an old peasant couple ([[Baucis and Philemon]]) and a nearby chapel, Faust becomes irritated that these two structures do not belong to him, and orders to have them removed. Mephistopheles overinterprets Faust's orders by murdering the old couple. The personification of Care breathes upon Faust's eyes, and he becomes blind. Upon disclosing his plans to better the lives of his subjects, motivated perhaps out of guilt, he recognizes the moment of sheer bliss which he would seek to prolong and drops dead. Mephistopheles believes Faust has lost his wager and tries to claim his soul. Angels suddenly appear, dropping rose-petals on the demons, who flee from the burning petals. Mephistopheles, however, stands his ground, and, under the aphrodisiac influence of the roses, lusts after the angels, who meanwhile make off with Faust's soul.

The scene abruptly changes to a wilderness inhabited by holy [[anchorite]]s: "Mountain-gorges, Forest, Rock, Desert". ''Pater Profundus'' discloses the parable of nature, which is a harbinger of divine love. The angels bearing Faust's soul appear in heaven. After the enraptured Doctor Marianus extols the [[eternal feminine|Eternal Feminine]], the virgin Mary, ''Mater Gloriosa'', appears from on high. Three biblical holy women, ''Magna Peccatrix'' (the Great Sinneress, Luke 7:36), ''Mulier Samaritana'' (the Samaritan woman, John 4), and ''Maria Aegyptiaca'' (''Acta Sanctorum''), plead for Faust's soul, while ''Una Paenitentium'' (previously Gretchen), also pleading for grace, offers to lead the reborn Faust into the higher spheres of heaven. ''Mater Gloriosa'' grants her wish.

The ''Chorus Mysticus'' ends the drama:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;All that must disappear
Is but a parable;
What lay beyond us, here
All is made visible;
Here deeds have understood
Words they were darkened by;
Eternal Womanhood
Draws us on high.&lt;/poem&gt;

[[File:1903UncleTomFilm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Still from [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the first "full length" movies. The still shows Eliza telling Uncle Tom that she has been sold and that she is running away to save her child.]]

A number of film adaptations of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' have been made over the years. Most of these movies were created during the [[silent film]] era (with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' being the most-filmed story of that time period).&lt;ref name="UTCFilm"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1930s, [[Hollywood]] studios have considered the story too controversial for another adaptation (although one foreign film and a made-for-TV movie have been created). Characters, themes and plot elements from ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' have also influenced a large number of other movies, including ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), while also inspiring numerous [[animated cartoon]]s.

==Silent film versions==

[[File:Uncle Tom's Cabin featuring Irving Cummings LCCN2005679771.jpg|thumb|Poster for the [[World Film Company]] production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (1914), part of the [[National Film Registry]]]]
''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the most-filmed story of the [[silent film]] era&lt;ref name="UTCFilm"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with at least nine known adaptations between 1903 – 1927. This popularity was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and "[[Tom shows]]", meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.&lt;ref name="UTCFilm"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was one of the earliest "full-length" movies (although "full-length" at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv03hp.html The First Uncle Tom's Cabin Film: Edison-Porter's Slavery Days (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This film, directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]], used white actors in [[blackface]] in the major roles and black performers only as [[Extra (actor)|extras]]. This version was evidently similar to many of the "Tom Shows" of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;
*Another film version from 1903 was directed by [[Siegmund Lubin]] and starred Lubin as [[Simon Legree]]. While no copies of Lubin's film still exist, according to accounts the movie was similar to Porter's version and reused the sets and costumes from a "Tom Show."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/lubinhp.html "Duping" Porter: Sigmund Lubin's Production (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1910, a 3-Reel Vitagraph Company of America production was directed by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to ''The Dramatic Mirror,'' this film was "a decided innovation" in motion pictures and "the first time an American company" released a dramatic film in 3 reels. Until then, "full-length" movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred [[Florence Turner]], [[Mary Fuller]], Edwin R. Phillips, [[Flora Finch]], [[Genevieve Tobin]], and Carlyle Blackwell Sr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv10hp1.html The 3-Reel Vitagraph Production (1910)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1910 Thanhouser film)|Another 1910 version by the Thanhouser Company]] was directed by Barry O'Neil, starred Frank Hall Crane as Uncle Tom, Anna Rosemond as Eliza, [[Marie Eline]] as Little Eva, and Grace Eline as Topsy.
*A 1913 release was directed by Otis Turner and adapted by [[Allan Dwan]]. It starred [[Edward Alexander (actor)|Edward Alexander]], [[Margarita Fischer]], [[Harry A. Pollard]], [[Iva Shepard]] and Gertrude Short.
*Another 1913 release was directed by [[Sidney Olcott]] and starred [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].
*A 1914 version was directed by William Robert Daly. It was adapted Edward McWade from the play adaptation by George L. Aiken. It starred [[Sam Lucas]], Teresa Michelena, Marie Eline (again), Royce D. Applegate and Boots Wall. This was the first "white" film to have an African-American star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gevinson|first=Alan|title=American Film Institute catalog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsoUXGZSxZcC&amp;pg=PA1079|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-20964-8|page=1079}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was added to the [[National Film Registry]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;King, Susan. [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-national-film-registry-20121217,0,1057524.story "National Film Registry selects 25 films for preservation "] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (December 19, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) deliberately used a cabin similar to Uncle Tom's home in the film's dramatic climax, where several white Southerners unite with their former enemy (Yankee soldiers) to defend what the film's caption says is their "[[Aryan race|Aryan]] birthright." According to scholars, this reuse of such a familiar cabin would have resonated with, and been understood by, audiences of the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Playing the Race Card: Melodramas of Black and White from Uncle Tom to O. J. Simpson'' by Linda Williams, Princeton Univ. Press, 2001, page 115. Also [http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/griffithhp.html H. B. Stowe's Cabin in D. W. Griffith's Movie], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1918 film)|1918 version]] was directed  and adapted by J. Searle Dawley. It starred [[Marguerite Clark]] (as both Little Eva '''''and''''' Topsy), [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]], Florence Carpenter, Frank Losee and Walter P. Lewis.
*A [[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1927 film)|1927 version]] was directed by [[Harry A. Pollard]] (who'd played Uncle Tom in the 1913 release of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''). This two-hour movie spent more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era (at a cost of $1.8 million). Black actor [[Charles Sidney Gilpin|Charles Gilpin]] was originally cast in the title role, but was fired after the studio decided his "portrayal was too aggressive." James B. Lowe then took over the character of Tom. One difference in this film from the novel is that after Tom dies, he returns as a [[vengeful spirit]] and confronts Simon Legree before leading the slave owner to his death. Black media outlets of the time praised the film, but the studio&amp;mdash;fearful of a backlash from Southern and white film audiences&amp;mdash;ended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film's opening at a slave auction (where a mother is torn away from her baby). The story was adapted by Pollard, Harvey F. Thew and A.P. Younger, with titles by Walter Anthony. It starred James B. Lowe, [[Virginia Grey]], [[George Siegmann]], Margarita Fischer, [[Mona Ray]] and [[Madame Sul-Te-Wan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv27hp.html Universal Super Jewel Production (1927)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematic mentions and later films ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Babbuncletomscabin.jpg|right|thumb|A movie poster from [[Kroger Babb]]'s 1965 production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.]] --&gt;
A number of movies have utilized characters, plots, and themes from ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', including ''An Uncle Tom's Cabin Troupe'' (1913); the Duncan Sisters' ''Topsy and Eva'' (1927); "Uncle Tom's Uncle," a 1926 [[Our Gang]] episode which has the kids creating their own "Tom Show"&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1938's ''[[Everybody Sing (film)|Everybody Sing]]'' (which features [[Judy Garland]] in [[blackface]]).&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But for several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation. In 1946, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] considered filming the story, but ceased production after protests led by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Versions of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were featured in a number of [[animated cartoon]]s, including [[Walt Disney]]'s "[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]" (1933), which features Mickey performing the play in [[blackface]] with exaggerated, orange lips; "[[Uncle Tom's Bungalow]]" (1937), a Warner Brother's cartoon supervised by [[Tex Avery]]; "Eliza on Ice" (1944), one of the earliest [[Mighty Mouse]] cartoons produced by [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]]; "Uncle Tom's Cabana" (1947), a six-minute cartoon directed by [[Tex Avery]], and the [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon "[[Southern Fried Rabbit]]" (1953), wherein Bugs disguises himself as Uncle Tom and sings "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" in order to cross the [[Mason-Dixon line]].&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dimples (1935 film)|Dimples]]'', a 1936 [[Shirley Temple]] film, is a humorous look at the opening night of the 1853 play version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in New York. The film's last scene features a [[minstrel show]] starring Temple and [[Stepin Fetchit]].&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the final scene of the [[Abbott and Costello]] film ''[[The Naughty Nineties]]'' (1945), Costello is seen comically in drag as Little Eva in a showboat performance of the novel. He "ascends" to Heaven on a wire that gets caught.
* A highlight of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951) is a ballet, "Small House of Uncle Thomas", in traditional Siamese style which has been organized by Tuptim, on the subversive theme of Eliza's escape.
* ''[[:pt:A Cabana do Pai Tomás|A Cabana do Pai Tomás]]'' was a 1969-70 Brazilian television serial adaptation of the Harriet Beecher Stowe story. 
* A 1971 Italian pseudo-documentary film called ''[[Goodbye Uncle Tom]]'' recreated historical events from the slave era. It was generally thought at the time to be exploitive and racist.
* A German language version under the title ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1965 film)|Onkel Toms Hütte]]'', appeared in 1965, directed by [[Géza von Radványi]] (1907-1986). It was screened in the United States by [[exploitation film]] presenter [[Kroger Babb]].
* The most recent film version was a [[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1987 film)|television broadcast in 1987]] directed by [[Stan Lathan]] and adapted by [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]]. It starred [[Avery Brooks]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Edward Woodward]], [[Jenny Lewis]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and Endyia Kinney.
* In ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]'s characters attend an imagined wartime adaptation of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' with a [[deus ex machina]] ending. An actor portraying Abraham Lincoln is suspended in mid-air as he speaks consolingly to the [[blackface]] actors portraying Stowe's characters. The [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] audience members respond by shouting racist epithets, throwing objects at "Lincoln," and rioting to calls of "Down with the Union!" (It should be noted that ''Gangs of New York'', the film, took great liberties with its source, ''Gangs of New York'', the book, so much so that the book is not officially acknowledged.)
*In a deleted scene of the Indian film ''Rang De Basanti'' (India's official entry to the Oscar 2007), Indian revolutionaries are shown opting to watch the film while they were starving.

==Evolution of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in film==
Edwin S. Porter’s 1903 film production, ''Uncle Tom’s Cabin; or, Slavery Days'', was based largely off of the theatrical productions of the same story common during that time. The movie lived up to racial stereotypes in wide circulation, and scenes were included to showcase slave dances. While African-American extras made appearances, white actors in blackface played the main slave characters. The film storyline strays widely from the plot of the novel, as exemplified by a scene completely independent of the novel depicting a steamboat race. The film assumes the audience is generally familiar with the plot due to the story’s long running popularity.&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;
 
Universal Studio’s 1927 release of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1927 film)|Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'' was an epic film and a step forward for Stowe's work. While certain stigmatic similarities remained, such as scenes depicting outlandish slave dances and Topsy’s flamboyant unruliness, this version was less outmoded in its characterization of slaves. More than earlier adaptations, this film took care to accurately follow the book, and some lines in the movie are direct quotes from the text. Integral characters omitted from previous films were brought to the forefront, such as George Harris. While the overall story remained intact, the writers did take some liberties. For instance, after escaping to freedom, Eliza and Harry are captured by the lawyer Marks and runaway slave tracker Tom Loker and sold down the river as opposed to receiving aid from kindly Quakers. Harry is separated from his mother when purchased by a nameless slave-owner before eventually being reunited with his father. Eliza is sold off to Simon Legree at the same auction as Uncle Tom. This alteration omits the entire subplot involving the Harris family’s escape to Canada, weaving the story into one coherent plot. Another twist in the storyline occurs when Union soldiers on the march through the south liberate hundreds of slaves along the way, including the residents of Legree’s plantation. The director moved the story forward historically to capitalize on the public’s patriotic sympathies.
 
Socially, this film was more progressive than previous versions. Fewer characters were portrayed in blackface (Topsy is an outstanding exception) and less of an emphasis was put on exotic slave customs. Still, the majority of the screen time is dedicated to the white actors. African American actor James B. Lowe played the character Uncle Tom, but was on screen for less than 9 minutes and speaks less than a dozen lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv27hp.html Universal Super Jewel Production (1927)], ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flash Art''''' is a [[bimonthly]] magazine founded in [[Rome]] in 1967 by Italian publisher and [[art critic]] [[Giancarlo Politi]] focused on [[contemporary art]]. It has been based in [[Milan, Italy]] since 1971. Originally a [[bilingual]] publication, it was split in two separate editions, ''Flash Art Italia'' (in Italian) and ''Flash Art International'' (in English) in 1978 when [[Helena Kontova]] joined the editorial team.

''Flash Art'' extensively covered the [[Arte Povera]] artists in the 1960s, before they became known in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;Suzaan Boettger, ''Earthworks: Art and the Landscape of the Sixties'' ([[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2002): p. 261. {{ISBN|0-520-24116-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially known for featuring [[Andy Warhol]]'s final interview before his death in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-last-interview-2.html|title=Andy Warhol's Final Interview|website=www.warholstars.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also publishes ''Flash Art Czech &amp; Slovak Edition'' and ''Flash Art Hungary''.

==Key historical moments ==
The first issue of ''Flash Art International'' featured the seminal text "The Italian Transavantgarde" by [[Achille Bonito Oliva]], whose ‘Ideology of the Traitor’ introduces the art of [[Enzo Cucchi]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Sandro Chia]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], among others.

In the November 1967 issue, "prime mover of the Arte Povera movement" [[Germano Celant]] published a [[manifesto]] entitled "Notes for a Guerrilla War," engaging political issues with the art of [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Giulio Paolini]], [[Giovanni Anselmo]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Luciano Fabro]], and [[Jannis Kounellis]] among others.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2013/02/01/arte-povera-how-an-ambitious-art-historian-simulated-a-revolution/#7cb546de5645] In 1977 the Committee for the [[Artists Space]] hosted the exhibition “Pictures”. On its occasion, ''Flash Art'' published texts by [[Douglas Crimp]] and artists [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] and [[David Salle]], highlighting the birth of the [[Pictures Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Eklund (ed.), The Pictures Generation, 1974-1984, exhibition catalogue the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 4/21/09 – 8/2/09, (Yale University Press, New Haven, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-300-14892-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, ''Flash Art'' dedicated an entire issue, on the occasion of [[Documenta 5|Documenta V]], with a cover by [[Hans Haacke]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1980 the editorial board started to give increasing attention to the [[New York City]] art scene; [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] reviewed on [[David Salle]] at [[Larry Gagosian]] Gallery / Nosei-Weber / [[The Kitchen]] as well as the famous "Three Cs" (Chia, Clemente and Cucchi) at [[Sperone Westwater Gallery|Sperone Westwater Fisher]], helping to bring the central figures of the [[Transavanguardia]] to public attention.&lt;ref&gt;David Rimanelli "Time capsules: 1980-1985 - Calendar," Artforum (March 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Koons]] independently published his iconic, color lithograph advertisements in 1988 in ''Flash Art'' along with ''[[Artforum]] and [[Art in America]]'', advertisements that later became famous for being "deliberately provocative, questioning the merits of 'high art', whilst also endorsing popular culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/114735/art-magazine-ads-arts-1988-1989?artists%5B26788%5D=26788&amp;search_set_offset=17|title=Art Magazine Ads (Arts) (1988 - 1989)|website=www.nationalgalleries.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artspace.com/jeff_koons/art-magazine-ads-flashart-art-in-america-artforum-arts|title=Art Magazine Ads (Flashart, Art in America, Artforum, Arts), Jeff Koons {{!}} Artspace.com|website=Artspace|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With slogans such as "Exploit the Masses / Banality as Saviour", the ads reflected Koons desire to 'remove bourgeois guilt and shame in responding to banality'".

During his tenure as ''Flash Art'' U.S. Editor [[Massimiliano Gioni]] started to collaborate more and more with [[Maurizio Cattelan]]. The latter continued his special relationship with ''Flash Art International'' in a series of sardonic interviews with young and promising artists. Years later, ''Flash Art International'' was featured in the form of a social-art experiment in the documentary "Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back" released in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deejay.it/eventi/maurizio-cattelan-be-right-back-il-film-sul-genio-del-nostro-tempo-in-sala-solo-30-e-31-maggio/520376/|title="Maurizio Cattelan: Be right back" il film sul genio del nostro tempo, in sala solo 30 e 31 maggio {{!}} Radio Deejay|date=2017-05-22|work=Radio Deejay|access-date=2017-06-20|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 [[ARTnews]] feature, [[MoMA PS1]] founder [[Alanna Heiss]] revealed that "[t]he people hired by Flash Art were always interesting because they really liked art. I was interested in their peculiar hiring policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/05/02/the-artnews-accord-alanna-heiss-and-massimiliano-gioni-in-conversation/|title=The ARTnews Accord: Alanna Heiss and Massimiliano Gioni in Conversation {{!}} ARTnews|website=www.artnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
It was described by Tony Stankus as "the confident, international journal of European and North American contemporary art" and by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' as a "distinguished by a cacophony of voices and congenial chaos".&lt;ref&gt;Tony Stankus, ''Journals of the Century'', ([[Haworth Press]], Philadelphia, 2002): p. 125. {{ISBN|0-7890-1134-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-262-16119-0|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Flash Art: Two Decades of History - XXI Years by Giancarlo Politi|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
''Flash Art'' acquired a magazine format in 1974. The magazine was published in three languages: [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] and was divided in two main parts. In 1979 it split into two editions: ''Flash Art International'' and ''Flash Art Italia''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} After ''Flash Art Russia'', the brand new Czech and Slovak Republic edition of the magazine underlined the former USSR satellite as the new epicenter of ''Flash Art'' Eastern Europe activities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Books ==
Besides its magazine activities, Flash Art publishes books, [[monograph]]s and catalogues, including ''Art Diary International'', a directory that lists addresses and phone numbers of artists, critics, galleries, and museums. In 2016, ''Flash Art International'' published Chinese artist Wang Yuyang's monograph ''Tonight I shall meditate upon that which I am.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/tech-design/article/2008451/breaking-tradition-new-generation-chinese-artists&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hiddengarments.com/index.php/2015/08/wang-yuyang-tonight-i-shall-meditate-on-that-which-i-am/#more-52941&lt;/ref&gt;

This invariance does not distinguish between [[inertial frames]] (and therefore satisfies the [[principle of relativity]]) but it allows for a varying [[speed of light]] in space, ''c''; indeed it allows for a non-invariant ''c''. According to [[Maxwell's equations]], the speed of light satisfies

      <comment>/* Genius of place */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5287">{{Original research|date=December 2010}}
The concept of '''genius,''' in [[literary theory]] and [[literary history]], derives from the later 18th century, when it began to be distinguished from ''ingenium'' in a discussion of the ''genius loci,'' or "spirit of the place."  It was a way of discussing [[essence]], in that each place was supposed to have its own unique and immutable nature, but this essence was determinant, in that all persons of a place would be infused or inspired by that nature.  In the early [[nationalism|nationalistic]] literary theories of the Augustan era, each nation was supposed to have a nature determined by its climate, air, and fauna that made a nation's [[poetry]], manners, and art singular.  It created national character.

T.V.F. Brogan argues that "genius" is a middle term in the evolution of the idea of [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] and poetic ability from a belief in an external source (''[[afflatus]],'' or divine infection, and poetic phrenzy, or divine madness) and an internal source ([[imagination]] and the [[subconscious]]).  However, the concept became nearly identical with poetic madness and divine madness in later [[Romanticism]].  The word itself was conflated with the Latin ''ingenium'' (natural ability) by the time of the [[Renaissance]], and it thereby becomes a natural spirit or natural essence unique to the individual and yet derived from the place.  In this sense, it is still a term synonymous with skill.

==Romanticism and genius==

[[Edward Young]]'s ''Conjectures on Original Composition'' (1759) was the most significant reformulation of "genius" away from "ability" and toward the Romantic concept of "genius" as seer or visionary.  His essay influenced the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' [[German literature|German]] theorists, and these influenced [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Biographia Literaria]].''  The Romantics saw genius as superior to skill, as being far above ability.  [[James Russell Lowell]] would say "talent is that which is in a man's power: genius is that in whose power a man is" (quoted in Brogan).  The emphasis on [[Gothic literature]], on the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] in general, and the poet as spokesman of a nation's consciousness allowed the declining meaning of "genius" as "natural spirit of the place" and the emergent meaning of "genius" as "inherent and irrational ability" to combine.  At the same time, Romanticism's definition of genius as a person driven by a force beyond his or her control and as an ability that surpasses the natural and exceeds the human mind makes it virtually identical with the Classical notion of divine madness or frenzy.

With the incorporation of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theories of poetic madness and the irrationality of imagination deriving from the subconscious, "genius" in poetry entered 20th century critical parlance as, again, something inherent in the writer.  The writer was special and set aside from others by "genius," which might be a psychic wound or a particular formation of the ego but which was nonetheless unique to that particular person and was the critical feature that made that person an artist.  [[Irving Babbitt]]'s writings discuss the genius in the [[Modernism|Modernist]] view.  Again, genius is something above skill, something that cannot be explained, contained, or diagnosed.

Since Modernism's decline, "genius" has faded somewhat from critical discussions.  As writing has focused on its own media and writers have focused on process (e.g. the [[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] and [[post-modernism]]), the belief in a special trait that makes the artist above the run of humanity, and more particularly the view that skill is inferior to imagination, has been in decline. However, there is an [http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx?ref=519082 emergent concept of genius] associated with the culture of certain contemporary literary circles. Such an image of genius is often [[dialectic|defined in opposition]] to the figure of the [[critic]], the former being more independent and spontaneous in their thought, the latter being more self-reflective but consequently restricted to responding to, rather than creating, enduring cultural artifacts. The earliest version of this formulation is to be found in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s commentary on Kant's notion of genius. Kant scholar Jane Kneller articulates the subtlety of his distinction by explaining "genius demonstrates its autonomy not by ignoring all rules, but by deriving the rules from itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Paul Guyer | title=Kant's Critique of the Power of Judgement: Critical Essays| publisher= Rowman and Littlefield| year=2003 | isbn=0-7425-1419-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''graphic designer''' is a professional within the [[graphic design]] and [[graphic arts]] industry who assembles together images, [[typography]], or motion graphics to create a piece of design. A graphic designer creates the graphics primarily for [[published media|published]], [[print media|printed]] or [[electronic media]], such as [[brochure]]s (sometimes) and [[advertising]]. They are also sometimes responsible for [[typesetting]], [[illustration]], user interfaces, and [[web design]]. A core responsibility of the designer's job is to present information in a way that is both accessible and memorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications==
A Bachelor's degree  or certificate  from an accredited trade school is usually considered essential for a graphic design position. After a career history has been established, though, the graphic designer's experience and number of years in the business are considered the primary qualifications.  A [[Career portfolio|portfolio]], which is the primary method for demonstrating these qualifications, is usually required to be shown at job interviews, and is constantly developed throughout a designer's career.

One can obtain an [[Associate's degree|AAS]], [[Bachelor's degree#BA, AB, BDes, BS, BSc, SB, ScB, BAAS,|BA]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]], BCA,  [[Master's degree|MFA]] or an [[Master of Philosophy|MPhil]] / [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in graphic design. Degree programs available vary depending upon the institution, although typical U.S. graphic design jobs may require at least some form of degree.

Current graphic designer jobs demand proficiency in one or more graphic design software programs. A common software package used in the graphic design industry is [[Adobe Creative Cloud]]. This software package contains the three main programs used by graphic designers, which are Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator are the industry standard applications for many graphic design positions. Another example of a common software package is [[CorelDraw Graphics Suite]].

Outside the graphic design industry, many people use [[Microsoft Word]] or [[Microsoft Publisher]] to create a layout or design. However, depending on the job at hand, most designers create the layout in either InDesign, CorelDRAW or QuarkXPress. Specifically, the designer will type or import the text in the layout program, also importing the graphics and images they created in Photoshop or Illustrator. There are a couple of reasons a designer builds a layout in this fashion:

*Files going to press are generally printed at 300 dots per inch. As a result, the file size can become very large, depending upon the photos and graphics used in it. By using a layout program and linking these graphics and images (but not saving all of them in the file itself), the working file is a fraction of the file size. When the designer is ready to go to press, s/he will either create a press-ready PDF; or use the "Package" function in InDesign, or the "Collect For Output" function in QuarkXpress or CorelDRAW (which gathers the layout document, plus all fonts and images used therein, and saves them in one folder which can be provided to a commercial printing company for final output).
*InDesign, CorelDRAW, or QuarkXPress make it possible to work with large multiple page layouts, such as catalogs and booklets.
*Since InDesign, CorelDRAW, and QuarkXPress the original file, linking to the graphics and images, the designer can change the "original file" and it will update all instances throughout the document to save time.

A web designer should understand how to work with [[XML]], [[HTML]], and basic web programming [[Javascript|scripts]]. A print designer should understand the processes involved in printing (including, notably, [[offset printing]]) to be able to produce press-ready artwork.

Designers should be able to solve visual communication problems or challenges. In doing so, the designer must identify the communications issue, gather and analyze information related to the issue, and generate potential approaches aimed at solving the problem.  Iterative [[Prototype|prototyping]] and [[user testing]] can be used to determine the success or failure of a visual solution. Approaches to a communications problem are developed in the context of an audience and a media channel.  Graphic designers must understand the social and [[Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]] of that audience in order to develop visual solutions that are perceived as relevant, understandable and effective.&lt;ref name="nasad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/110496132/NASAD-Competencies-Summary-Degree-The-BFA-in-Graphic|title=NASAD Competencies Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic designers should also have a thorough understanding of production and rendering methods. Some of the technologies and methods of production are drawing, offset printing, photography, and time-based and interactive media (film, video, computer multimedia). Frequently, designers are also called upon to manage color in different media.&lt;ref name="nasad"/&gt;

==Career portfolio==
50 years ago, the graphic designer's [[Career portfolio|portfolio]]  was usually a black book or large binder in which samples of the artist's best printed pieces were carried to show prospective clients or employers. Printed pieces are often protected inside by being mounted on boards or slipped into Acetate sleeves.

Since the 1990s, portfolios have become increasingly computer digitized and now may be entirely digitized and available on the Internet, or on [[CD]], [[DVD]], or via [[email]].

==Branding==
Graphic design relates heavily to [[corporate identity]], the [[brand management|branding]], and "persona" of a corporation. Branding originated in the late 1890s and not only did it emerge as corporate identity, but it also signified corporate quality. Many might recognize the process of "branding" a hot iron symbol or logo onto an animal's body to differentiate other cattle. Branding your business or any other type of asset that requires an identity does help one to be recognized in a commercialized industry. Exceptional graphic designers can easily create a brand that fits the company as well as define it through one simple logo.

'''Irving &amp; Casson''' was a Boston, Massachusetts, firm of interior designers and furniture makers, founded in 1875. 
[[File:FullSizeRender-6.jpg|thumb|left|Company badge of Irving &amp; Casson.]]
Its specialty was interior woodwork and mantels, but it also made furniture, primarily in the styles of the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1914 or 1916, the firm merged with [[A. H. Davenport Company]], a furniture company also located in Boston (both had factories in East Cambridge). After the merger, the company executed a number of commissions for [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] churches, including the chapels at [[Duke University]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. The company’s last major design commission was for the interiors for the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City, executed in the 1950s. Irving &amp; Casson–A. H. Davenport Co. went out of business in 1974.&lt;ref name="W1"&gt;The Winterthur Library, Col. 752, 8G 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leaf v International Galleries''''' [1950] 2 KB 86 is an [[English contract law]] case concerning [[misrepresentation]], [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]] and [[breach of contract]], and the limits to the [[equity (law)|equitable]] [[Equitable remedy|remedy]] of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]].

==Facts==
"[[Salisbury Cathedral]]" by [[John Constable]] was what Ernest Louis Leaf thought he was buying on 8 March 1944 from International Galleries. International Galleries said it was a Constable. Leaf paid £85. Five years later when he tried to auction it, Leaf was told that it was not a Constable. He claimed rescission of the contract against International Galleries, to get back his money.

==Judgment==
[[Denning LJ]] held that Mr Leaf was barred because too much time had lapsed. He held that in the event of lapse of too much time between the making of the contract and the decision to rescind, the right to rescind is lost. He held there was a mistake about the quality of the subject matter because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable, and that mistake was fundamental. But it was not enough to void the contract, because there was no mistake about the essential subject matter (a painting). The painter's identity was a term of the contract, which could either be classified as a condition (breach of which allows termination of the contract) or a warranty (which allows damages only). Here the painter's identity was a condition, but after hanging it in one's house for five years it is far too late to reject the painting for breach of condition.

{{Cquote|The question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to rescind the contract on the ground that the painting in question was not painted by Constable. I emphasize that it is a claim to rescind only: there is no claim in this action for damages for breach of condition or breach of warranty. The claim is simply one for rescission. At a very late stage before the county court judge counsel did ask for leave to amend by claiming damages for breach of warranty, but it was not allowed. No claim for damages is before us at all. The only question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to rescind.

The way in which the case is put by Mr. Weitzman, on behalf of the plaintiff, is this: he says that this was an innocent misrepresentation and that in equity he is, or should be, entitled to claim rescission even of an executed contract of sale on that account. He points out that the judge has found that it is quite possible to restore the parties to their original position. It can be done by simply handing back the picture to the defendants.

In my opinion, this case is to be decided according to the well known principles applicable to the sale of goods. This was a contract for the sale of goods. There was a mistake about the quality of the subject-matter, because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable; and that mistake was in one sense essential or fundamental. But such a mistake does not avoid the contract: there was no mistake at all about the subject-matter of the sale. It was a specific picture, "Salisbury Cathedral." The parties were agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter, and that is sufficient to make a contract: see ''[[Solle v Butcher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 K.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Solle v Butcher]]'' has been [[Mechanisms of the English common law|disapproved]] in ''[[The Great Peace]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a term in the contract as to the quality of the subject-matter: namely, as to the person by whom the picture was painted – that it was by Constable. That term of the contract was, according to our terminology, either a condition or a warranty. If it was a condition, the buyer could reject the picture for breach of the condition at any time before he accepted it, or is deemed to have accepted it; whereas, if it was only a warranty, he could not reject it at all but was confined to a claim for damages.

I think it right to assume in the buyer's favour that this term was a condition, and that, if he had come in proper time he could have rejected the picture; but the right to reject for breach of condition has always been limited by the rule that, once the buyer has accepted, or is deemed to have accepted, the goods in performance of the contract, then he cannot thereafter reject, but is relegated to his claim for damages: see s. 11, sub-s. 1 (c), of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]], and ''[[Wallis, Son &amp; Wells v Pratt &amp; Haynes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1910] 2 K. B. 1003 , [1911] A. C. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances in which a buyer is deemed to have accepted goods in performance of the contract are set out in s. 35 of the Act, which says that the buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods, amongst other things, "when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them." In this case the buyer took the picture into his house and, apparently, hung it there, and five years passed before he intimated any rejection at all. That, I need hardly say, is much more than a reasonable time. It is far too late for him at the end of five years to reject this picture for breach of any condition. His remedy after that length of time is for damages only, a claim which he has not brought before the court.

Is it to be said that the buyer is in any better position by relying on the representation, not as a condition, but as an innocent misrepresentation? I agree that on a contract for the sale of goods an innocent material misrepresentation may, in a proper case, be a ground for rescission even after the contract has been executed...

Although rescission may in some cases be a proper remedy, it is to be remembered that an innocent misrepresentation is much less potent than a breach of condition; and a claim to rescission for innocent misrepresentation must at any rate be barred when a right to reject for breach of condition is barred. A condition is a term of the contract of a most material character, and if a claim to reject on that account is barred, it seems to me a fortiori that a claim to rescission on the ground of innocent misrepresentation is also barred.}}

Jenkins LJ and Lord Evershed MR concurred.

* '''Summary'''
In essence, the court held that there was no breach of contract, no "operative mistake", but there WAS misrepresentation. However, after a period of five years the right to rescission had lapsed, leaving the claimant with no remedy at all.

The '''long poem''' is a literary genre including all [[poetry]] of considerable length.  Though the definition of a long poem is vague and broad, the genre includes some of the most important poetry ever written.

With more than 220000 (100000 [[shloka]] or couplets) verses and about 1.8 million words in total, the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' is the longest [[epic poetry|epic poem]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Spodek|Spodek, Howard]]. Richard Mason. The World's History. Pearson Education: 2006, New Jersey. 224, 0-13-177318-6&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly ten times the size of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined, roughly five times longer than Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', and about four times the size of the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]''. 

In English, ''[[Beowulf]]'' and [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' are among the first important long poems. The long poem thrived and gained new vitality in the hands of experimental [[Modernism|Modernists]] in the early 1900s and has continued to evolve through the 21st century.

The long poem has evolved into an umbrella term, encompassing many subgenres, including [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[verse novel]], verse narrative, [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] sequence, lyric series, and [[collage]]/[[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]]. 
==Definitions==

===Length and meaning===
Lynn Keller describes the long poem as being a poem that is simply "book length," but perhaps the simplest way to define "long poem" is this: a long poem is long enough that its bulk carries meaning.  Susan Stanford Friedman describes the long poem as a genre in which all poems that are not considered to be short can be a considered a part. These overly inclusive definitions, though problematic, serve the breadth of the long poem, and have fueled its adaptation as a voice for [[cultural identity]] among [[Marginalization|marginalized persons]] in [[History of poetry#Modern developments|Modern]] and [[Contemporary poetry]].  Only a broad definition can apply to the genre as a whole. In general, a poem is a "long poem" when its length enhances and expands upon the thematic, creative, and formal weight of the poem.

Though the term "long poem" may be elusive to define, the term is now finally getting the attention it deserves.  The genre has gained importance both as a [[literary form]], and as a means of collective expression. Lynn Keller solidifies the genre's importance in her essay, "Pushing the Limits," by stating that the long poem will always be recognized as a notable genre of importance in early twentieth-century [[American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keller|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==

===Tale of the tribe===

A long poem often functions to tell a "tale of the tribe," or a story that encompasses a whole culture's values and history.  Ezra Pound coined the phrase, referring to his own long poem ''The Cantos.''  The long poem's length and scope can contain concerns of a magnitude that a shorter poem cannot address. The poet may see himself or herself as the "bearer of the light," to use Langston Hughes' term, who leads the journey through a culture's story, or as the one who makes known the light already within the tribe. The poet may also serve as a poet-prophet with special insight for their own tribe.

In Modern and Contemporary long poems the "tale of the tribe" has frequently been retold by culturally, economically, and socially marginalized persons.  Thus, pseudo-epic narratives, such as Derek Walcott's "Omeros," have emerged to occupy voids where post colonial persons, racially oppressed persons, women, and other people who have been ignored by classic epics, and denied a voice in the prestigious genre.

===Revisionary mythopoesis===

Various poets have undertaken a "revisionary mythopoesis" in the long poem genre.  Since the genre has roots in forms that traditionally exclude poets who have minimal cultural authority, the long poem can be a "fundamental re-vision," and function as a discourse for those poets (Friedman).  These "re-visions" may include neglected characters, deflation of traditionally celebrated characters, and a general reworking of standards set by the literary tradition. This revision is noted especially by feminist critical work that analyzes how women are given a new voice and story through the transformation of a previously "masculine" form.

===Cultural commentary===

Lynn Keller notes that the long poem enabled modernists to include sociological, anthropological, and historical material.  Many long poems deal with history not in the revisionary sense but as a simple re-telling in order to prove a point.  Then there are those who go a step further and recite a place's or people's history in order to teach.  Like revisionary mythopoesis, they may attempt to make a point or demonstrate a new perspective by exaggerating or editing certain parts of a history.

==Concerns and controversies==

===Fears of the writer===

Long poem authors sometimes find great difficulty in making the entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. [[Ezra Pound]] is an example of this dilemma, with his poem ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref name="Keller 1993"&gt;Keller 1993&lt;/ref&gt; As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. [[Walt Whitman]] tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in ''[[Song of Myself]]''. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.

Poets attempting to write a long poem often struggle to find the right form or combination of forms to use. Since the long poem itself cannot be strictly defined by one certain form, a challenge lies in choosing the most effective form.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generic conundrums===

'''Inclusivity'''

The long poem has been considered a problematic genre for women writers. Its roots in epic make the genre appear to be non-inclusive of female writers. This is due to the epic's long history of being primarily a realm of writing for men.&lt;ref name="Friedman 1990"&gt;Friedman 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyric intensity'''

Some critics, most emphatically [[Edgar Allan Poe]], consider poetry as a whole to be more closely tied to the lyric.  They complain that the emotional intensity involved within a lyric is impossible to maintain in the length of the long poem, thus rendering the long poem impossible or inherently a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Poe 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "The long poem: sequence or consequence?" Ted Weiss quotes a passage from M. L. Rozenthal and Sally M. Gall's "The Modern Poetic Sequence" inspired by Poe's sentiments, "What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones.... It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such, only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating, the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal-necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one half of the Paradise Lost is essentially prose—a succession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably,with corresponding depressions—the whole being deprived, through the extremities of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity, of effect. In short, a poem to be truly a poem should not exceed a half hour's reading. In any case, no unified long poem is possible."&lt;ref&gt;Weiss 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multivocality'''

One genre theory claims that once a poem takes on multiple voices, it becomes a novel.  Many long poems do make use of multiple voices, while still maintaining all the element of a poem, and therefore cause even more confusion when trying to define their genre.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

'''Naming and subgenres'''

Critic Lynn Keller also expresses concerns about the genre in her essay "Pushing the Limits." Keller states that because of the debate over and prevalence of subgenres and forms within the overarching genre of long poem, critics and readers tend to choose one subgenre, typically the epic form, as being the "authentic" representative form of the genre. Therefore, this causes the other equally important subgenres to be subject to criticism for not adhering to the more "authentic" form of long poem.&lt;ref name="Keller 1997 p"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keller|1997|p=???}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics of the long poem sometimes hold the belief that with long poems, there is no "middle ground."  They view long poems as ultimately being either epics or lyrics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Many critics refer to the long poem by various adjective-filled subgenre names that often are made of various components found within the poem. These can lead to confusion about what a long poem is exactly. Below you will find a list describing the most common (and agreed upon) subgenre categories.&lt;ref name="Keller 1993"/&gt;

==Advantages of the genre==
{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}
The long poem genre has several advantages over prose and strictly lyric poetry.  The most obvious difference between the long poem and other literary genres is the sheer difficulty of composing a long work entirely in verse.  Poets who undertake the long poem face the serious problem of creating a work that is consistently poetic, sometimes taking strict forms and carrying them through the whole poem.  However, the poets who do choose the long poem turn this liability into an advantage—if a poet can write a long poem, they prove themselves to be worthy.  The very difficulty gives the genre an implicit prestige.  Long poems have been among the most influential texts in the world since Homer.  By writing a long poem, a poet participates in this tradition and must prove their virtuosity by living up to the tradition. As discussed below, the traditionally difficult long poem's prestige can be revised to serve radical purposes.

Additional benefits of the long poem:

*The long poem provides the artist with a greater space to create great meaning.
*A long poem allows the author to be encyclopedic in their treatment of the world, as opposed to the potentially narrow focus of the lyric.
*A long poem poet can work on a long poem their entire life, weaving in their impressions gleaned from the span of several generations (and historical events); it can be an ongoing work.
*A long poem can encapsulate not just traditional poetry, but incorporate dialogue, prose passages, and even scripting.
*A reader can absorb an entire world view from a long poem.

==Female authors in the genre==

Critic Lynn Keller voices the concerns of female poets writing within the genre of the long poem.  In her essay "Pushing the Limits", she discusses the long poem in regards to its female contributors, a group often forgotten or marginalized in favor of the more privileged white male author. Not only does Keller discuss women and their place in the authorship of the long poem, but she also talks about the tendency of the genre to forget authors who are not white and male, therefore leaving out minority writers, foreign writers, and writers of different sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Keller 1997 p"/&gt;

Keller explains the long poem as being a "generic hybrid".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keller|1997|p=??}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Keller means that the form, in large part because of its indefinable nature, gives authors creative leeway to mold and form the genre of long poem to fit their creative needs. The long poem's flexibility should not only be open to include women and minority writers, but should be a haven in which these writers can use their writing to voice their identity, a primary topic for the long poem genre.

As stated above in "Concerns and Controversies", many female writers have felt that they have no place within the long poem genre because of its epic roots. The epic is a historically masculine genre and has not welcomed female writers or other authors who are not male and white. The long poem is often understood as the epic reborn, making it seem like a genre inaccessible to women. Women who did participate within the long poem and epic forms were often highly criticized or overlooked until recently, as there has been increasing interest in such authors as H.D.

Keller also discusses a primary critic of the long poem, Kamboureli, in her essay. Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also equally important to say that one type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual "betweeness", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms.  This lack of restriction should be the very reason that the genre should be open to all.  Its hybridisms and variety will only be enhanced by the presence of women and other writers.

Keller states that this new perspective on long poem and reexamination of forgotten long poems has revived the form as a realm of possibilities for upcoming female writers. Female writers are seeing the long poem as a genre that should not only be open and inclusive to them, but also as a genre that theoretically could benefit the female writer as much if not more than the male writers the form previously favored. Women writers are now able to combat the "dominant traditions" at play within the long poem genre to mold the genre into their own, creating what critic Susan Friedman terms a "re-vision" of the form.

[[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] was one of the first female authors to attempt an epic poem.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In her article "Written in blood: the art of mothering epic in the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning", Olivia Gatti Taylor explores Browning's attempt to write an authentically feminine epic poem titled ''Aurora Leigh''. Taylor posits that Browning began this process with the structure of her poem, "While earlier epics like the ''[[Aeneid]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' have twelve books, [[Aurora Leigh]] was conceived as a nine-book epic; thus, the very structure of the work reveals its gestational nature. According to Sandra Donaldson, Barrett Browning's own experience at age forty-three of "giving birth and nurturing a child" greatly influenced her poetry "for the better", deepening her "sensitivity".

==Genealogy==

The most important "parent genre" to the long poem is the [[Epic poetry#cite note-0|epic]].  As stated on the page of the main article on the epic, "An epic is a lengthy, revered narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation."  The term "long poem" includes all the generic expectations of epic and the reactions against those expectations.  Many long poem subgenres share characteristics with the epic, including: telling the tale of a tribe or a nation, quests, history (either recitation or re-telling in order to learn from the past), a hero figure, or prophecies.

Other subgenres of the long poem include lyric sequence, series, collage, and verse-novel.  What unites each of these subgenres under the heading of long poem is that their length has importance in their meaning. Each subgenre, however, is unique in its style, manner of composition, voice, narration, and proximity to outside genres.

Sequence poetry uses the chronological linking of poems to construct meaning, as each lyric builds on the poems previous to it.  Examples include [[Louise Glück]]'s ''The Wild Iris'', and older sonnet cycles, such as [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'' or [[Dante]]'s ''[[Vita Nuova]]''.  Serial lyrics similarly depend on the juxtaposition and dialogue between individual lyrics to build a greater depth of meaning. Narrative poems rely heavily on

Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or overlapped to create second-generation subgenres. The blurring between the lines of the subgenres is what makes the long poem so hard to define, but it also marks the growing creativity in the use of the form.

==Subgenres==

===Epic===

[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|right|The first page of the Beowulf manuscript. Beowulf was one of the first long poems in English.]]
Critic Joseph Conte describes the [[Epic poetry|epic]] as a long poem that "has to have grand voice and purpose. . . it has to say something big."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conte|1992|p=??}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn Keller describes one of the epic's aspects as including a "quasi-circular quest-journey structure" that she says is present in the long poem ''Song of Myself'' by Whitman.  Yet that long poem, Keller notes, does not have a "specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed," unlike a more traditional long poem.  Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic.  A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in ''Helen In Egypt'' by H.D.  Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, ''Helen In Egypt'' is about the psychological journey of Helen.

Other characteristics of the epic include a hero figure, myths, and quests for the characters. Many such characteristics are seen in various long poems, but with some changes.  For example, ''Helen In Egypt'' brings mythic revision, or revisionary mythopoesis, into play. Even though it includes the myth from the epic, the revised telling of the myth makes the long poem stand out as its own form.  Additionally, one cannot look at the epic as a single, unified form of inspiration for long poems.  As Keller points out, certain long poems can have roots in very specific epics instead of the overall epic category.

The long poem ''Omeros'' by Derek Walcott has drawn mixed criticism on whether it should or should not be tied to the traditional epic form.  Those against that idea say that the poem's story is not as important as those found in traditional epics.  ''Omeros'' tells the tale of fishermen in the Caribbean fighting over and lusting after a waitress instead of a typically heroic tale of battles and quests.  On the other side of the argument lies the point that it is important to keep in mind that ''Omeros'' has ties to the epic genre, if only as a contrast.  By putting more simple characters in the forefront as opposed to warriors, Walcott revises the traditional epic form, which these critics say is something to notice as opposed to cutting off ''Omeros'' from any ties to the epic whatsoever.  Furthermore, these critics say that one cannot ignore the epic influence on the poem since its characters' names are taken from Homer.  In ''Omeros'' there are distinct elements obviously influenced by traditional epics, such as a trip to the underworld, talk of a muse, etc.

In interviews, Walcott has both affirmed and denied that ''Omeros'' is tied to the epic form.  In one interview he stated that it was a type of epic poem, but in another interview he said the opposite, stating as part of his evidence that there are no epic-like battles in his poem.  In ''Omeros'' Walcott implies that he has never read Homer, which is probably untrue based on the character names derived from Homer. Walcott's denial of his poem being tied too heavily to the epic form may stem from his concern that people might only think of it as being an epic-influenced poem instead of transcending the epic genre.

Based on this criticism of ''Omeros'' it is clear that the generic identity of a long poem greatly contributes to its meaning.  Because long poems are influenced by many more strictly defined genres, a long poem revising strict generic rules creates striking contrast with epic-genre expectations.

Keller also notes that she agrees with critic Susan Friedman when Friedman expresses her concern that the long poem associated with the epic has been "the quintessential male territory whose boundaries enforce women's status as outsiders on the landscape of poetry."  Considering that there are many long poem authors that are women, one cannot fully associate the long poem with the epic genre.

However, the typical exclusion of women in the epic tradition is for many female authors what makes the long poem an appealing form for laying cultural claim to the epic.

Control of or at least inclusion in the creation of a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like ''The Odyssey'' or Virgil’s ''Aeneid'' is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines the good and the bad of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.

If the long poem is considered an epic or invokes an epic in its length as many critics and readers aver then breaching its traditional exclusivity by using the epic to tell the story of marginalized peoples such as women rather than the victors is essentially an opportunity for the poet to rewrite history. Walcott’s ''Omeros'' is an excellent example of a long poem recording the untold history of a marginalized people.

Likewise H.D.’s revision of the story of Helen of Troy in ''Helen'' is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to the reader that the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way is unacceptable and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility of tradition and history paired with the obvious dependence on them.

===Lyric sequence===

A lyric sequence is a collection of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme. A defining characteristic of this subgenre is that each lyric enhances the meaning of the other lyrics in the work, creating an enhanced collective metaphor, that opens the lyric sequence to unique adaptations of dialogue and other narrative/theatrical characteristics.
	
Critic Lynn Keller lends some insight to the lyric sequence by placing it in opposition to the epic: “At the opposite end of the critical spectrum are the treatments of the long poem that do not consider issues of quest, hero, community, nation, history and the like, and instead regard the form as essentially lyric.

===Lyric series===

The lyric series is a genre of poetry in which the seriality of short (but connective) lyric poems enhances the long poem's meaning. Seriality may contribute narrative coherence or thematic development, and it is often read in terms of the poem's productive process, i.e. how the poem "produces its own experience"(Shoptaw). Each lyric poem is distinct and has meaning in itself, yet it functions as an integral part of the series, giving it a greater meaning as within the long poem as well.

Deborah Sinnreich-Levi and Ian Laurie examine the work of Oton de Grandson in the lyric series, or "ballad series" form.  Grandson wrote several sets of short love lyrics, using the series form for narrative coherence and thematic construction, as well as to examine different aspects of a single narrative.  George Oppen's ''Discrete Series'' relates its poetic seriality to the mathematic concept of a discrete series.  Langston Hughes' ''Montage of a Dream Deferred'' qualifies as a serial lyric as well as a montage.

===Collage/Montage===

The best-known and most highly regarded example of a collage long poem is [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''. Critic Philip Cohen describes Eliot's use of the collage in his article "The Waste Land, 1921: Some Developments of the Manuscript's Verse":

"Eliot gradually created a more modernist poem, one which resembles a cubist collage: [[satiric narrative]]s were abandoned in favor of first of [[dramatic poetry]] and then of a bold amalgamation of genres. The speakers shifted from omniscient narrators to a variety of separate-person voices and then to different voices of one shadowy character."{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The collage combines seemingly disparate parts or "fragments" of different voices, pieces of mythology, popular song, speeches, and other utterances in an attempt to create a somewhat cohesive whole.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The best known Bengali long poem is JAKHAM (The Wound) written by [[Malay Roy Choudhury]] of India during the famous [[Hungryalist]] movement in 1960s.

A montage is similar to a collage in that it consists of many voices, most famously portrayed in [[Langston Hughes]]' ''[[Montage of a Dream Deferred]]''. The poet provides a comprehensive portrait of 20th century [[Harlem]] through the use of numerous different voices and thus creates a cohesive whole through this fragmentary lens.

What is perhaps the most debatable characteristic of this collage/montage form is the question of what is added to the message or content of the poem by using a more fragmented view. This debate is clearly visible within Langston Hughes' ''Montage'' in the question of who the primary voice belongs to and what is added by having Harlem shown through multiple people, as opposed to Hughes simply speaking from his own understanding of what makes Harlem.

===Verse-narrative===

A verse narrative, as one might expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to its place in the flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to ''Gilgamesh'', which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.

As one of the main subgenres, Verse-Narrative gets the least attention because it so effortlessly overlaps the other subgenres. It does not necessarily have the components of an Epic, nor the lyricism and shifting scope of a Lyric Sequence or a Lyric Series, nor the close relation to narrative of Verse Novel. It exists for critics generally as an accepted part of the long poem Tradition.

The Greek poet Vasileios Vasileiadis(1958-) with his two long poems &lt;Blind to see the Darkness&gt; and &lt;Point Zero&gt; is an example for the Verse-Narrative long poetry.

===Romantic long poem===

The critic Lilach Lachman describes the Romantic long poem as one that, "questioned the coherence of the conventional epic's plot, its logic of time and space, and its laws of interconnecting the narrative through action."  Examples of the Romantic long poem is Keats' long poem [[Hyperion (poem)|Hyperion: A Fragment]] (1820), William Wordsworth's [[Recluse (Wordsworth)|Recluse]] (Including the [[The Prelude|Prelude]] (1850), and [[Excursion (poem)|The Excursion]]), and Percy Bysshe Shelley's [[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]].

The Romance long poem contains many of the same components of the Romance Lyric. Michael O'Neil suggests that "much romantic poetry is torn out of its own despair" and, in fact, can exist as the tremulous fusion between "self-trust and self-doubt."

===Meditations===

Meditations are reflective thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can be somewhat fragmented, yet their connectivity is what makes the long poem a coherent and cohesive idea. This subgenre is based on meditations (or thoughts). Wallace Stevens believes, as do other writers in this genre, that the work does not rely on the use of multiple voices.

In her essay "The Twentieth Century Long Poem," Lynn Keller states that a more philosophical influence on these meditative long poems deals with relating imagination to reality, specifically in long poems by Wallace Stevens.  Keller notes, "Uninterested in American landscape, American history, modern mechanical triumphs, or the urban scene, his process-oriented long poems are speculative philosophical works exploring the relation of imagination to reality and the imagination's role in compensating for the loss of religious belief."

[[W. H. Auden]]'s ''New Year Letter'' is an example of a long-form meditative poem.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Collectanea''''', or '''''Magna glossatura''''' as it came to be known, is a collection of commentaries on the [[Psalms]] and the [[Pauline Epistles]] written by [[Peter the Lombard]] between 1139 and 1141.

==Origin and characteristics==

The ''Magna glossatura'' is a set of [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es written beside passages from the [[Latin Vulgate Bible]]. These glosses were written by Peter the Lombard during his teaching career and before he became the bishop of Paris (1159–1160). His gloss of Psalms and his gloss of the Pauline Epistles (referred to as the ''Collectanea'') were compiled and became a part of the official gloss on the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of glosses would take on the name of ''Magna glossatura'' and would, during the 12th century, replace the ''Glossa ordinaria'' as the most frequently studied and copied exegetical gloss of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colish|first1=Marcia L.|title=Peter Lombard|date=1994|publisher=Brill's Studies in Intellectual History|location=New York|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other works included the ''Libri Quatuor Sententiarum'' (or the ''[[Sentences|Four Books of Sentences]]'') and his commentaries in the ''glossa Ordinaria''. The ''Magna glossatura'', along with other systematic glosses, would have been developed at theological schools such as Laon and St.-Victor of Paris, and would have been used for the research conducted by theologians as well as the teaching of students in biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouchard|first1=Constance B.|title=The Cistercians and the "glossa Ordinaria"|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|date=2000|volume=86 |issue=2|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout of text in the ''Magna glossatura'', is written in the ''intercisum'' (or intercut) format, which was developed by Peter Lombard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Lesley|title=The Glossa Ordinaria : The Making of a Medieval Bible Commentary|date=2009|publisher=Brill|location=Boston|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a way of distinguishing scripture from the commentaries by writing the biblical verses in a larger script and on alternate lines next to the commentary, which would be ordered into columns. Blocks of scripture were then placed on the left edge of the columns to balance the biblical verses with the commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''intercisum'' method, from ca.1160, began to be applied to glosses on all the books of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layout also gave glosses and their commentators greater influence in their relationship with the Word of God, as these glosses played a larger role in theological books by forming an essential reading in connection with the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Lombard's gloss of the Pauline Epistles features not only commentaries concerning the traditional mode of reflection on the Christian faith, which regards the biblical text as ''sacra pagina'', but also commentaries of systematic theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lombard writes on specific theological themes which deal with issues such as the nature of the Trinity. Lombard's glosses also include references to the works of other ecclesiastical figures and theologians, [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] to name a few. The biblical commentaries and ideas present in the ''Magna glossatura'' are also present in the various sermons given by Peter Lombard to his peers and to his cathedral's congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Missoni''' is a high-end Italian fashion house based in [[Varese, Italy|Varese]], and known for its colorful knitwear designs. The company was founded by [[Ottavio Missoni|Ottavio]] ("Tai") and Rosita Missoni in 1953.

==History==
The business was founded in 1953, when Ottavio and Rosita Missoni set up a small knitwear workshop in [[Gallarate]], Italy.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; They presented their first collection under the Missoni label in [[Milan]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The business prospered, with the support of fashion editor [[Anna Piaggi]], then at ''Arianna'' magazine.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Rosita met the French stylist [[Emmanuelle Khanh]] in New York in 1965, which led to a collaboration and a new collection the following year.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In April 1967, they were invited to show at the [[Pitti Palace]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Rosita told the models to remove their [[Brassiere|bras]], supposedly because they were the wrong color, and showed through the thin [[lamé (fabric)|lamé]] blouses. The material became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] under the lights and caused a sensation.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The Missonis were not invited back the following year, but the business grew; a new factory in [[Sumirago]] was built in 1969.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Missoni designs were championed in the USA by [[Diana Vreeland]], editor of American [[Vogue magazine|''Vogue'']], and a Missoni boutique was opened in [[Bloomingdales]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Missoni reached the peak of its influence in the fashion world in the early 1970s (though has since been the subject of revivals in interest as new generations of fashion writers discovered the appeal of its core knitwear). Tai Missoni then became more interested in other projects, designing [[costumes]] for [[La Scala]], carpets and [[tapestries]]. Rosita Missoni lost interest in fashion in the 1990s and was succeeded by her daughter Angela in 1998 while Rosita took over Missoni Home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Suzy Menkes |author-link=Suzy Menkes |date=2 December 2003 |title=Missoni's family mosaic |periodical=International Herald Tribune |place=London |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/12/02/missoni_ed3_.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210073149/http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/12/02/missoni_ed3_.php |archivedate=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2011, Missoni made headlines briefly when [[Target Stores]] offered low-cost variants of Missoni products in their stores and on their website. Most items sold out within 24 hours, there were long queues outside stores and the Target website was overloaded. Some items appeared at higher prices on [[eBay]] within hours and Target did not restock.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra M. Jones (13 September 2011).

''Chicago Tribune''. Accessed May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Angela Missoni hired [[Rossella Jardini]], former creative director of [[Moschino]], as a consultant.&lt;ref name=zar&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/helping-hand-7507728?src=nl/mornReport/20140225 | title=Rossella Jardini to Lend a Hand at Missoni | publisher=WWD | date=25 February 2014 | accessdate=May 2014 | author=Luisa Zargani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Jennifer Lopez]] teamed up with Missoni along with Women’s Cancer Research Fund and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] to set a fund raise for cancer research. Lopez will help promote the $35 limited-edition Missoni tees, and the profits will go to 12 different cancer charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/chica/jennifer-lopez-missoni-saks-fifth-avenue-women-cancer-research-fund-collaboration-tshirt/|title=Jennifer Lopez Teams Up With Missoni and Saks Fifth Avenue for Women’s Cancer Research Fund|date=2017-09-14|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Missoni and the [[Rezidor Hotel Group]] signed an agreement to create Hotel Missoni, with plans to have 30 hotels open or in development by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lifetime Achievement Award for Kurt Ritter at European Hospitality Awards 2012|url=http://www.rezidor.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=223433&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_Print&amp;ID=1755351|website=The Rezidor Hotel Group|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centrally located property in [[Edinburgh]] is patronised by artists attending the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and other arts events held in the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">{{unref|date=June 2013}}The '''North American Nature Photography Association''' or '''NANPA''' is an organization dedicated to [[photography]] of nature. Its headquarters were in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, and are now in Alma, Illinois. Established in 1994, the association has 2,500 members. Several categories of membership are available, including discounts for students. The association annually sponsors a variety of activities, such as regional events, meetups, workshops, tours, and webinars throughout the United States. The NANPA Foundation [www.nanpafoundation.org], established in 1997, awards scholarships, operates blinds for [[wildlife photography]], and organizes funds in memory of deceased photographers and others. NANPA also markets books of interest to members, including those by members, through [[Amazon.com]]. 

In 2006, NANPA initiated June 15 as Nature Photography Day. This designated day was spearheaded by the association’s History Committee. Its purpose is to promote the art and science of nature photography. NANPA looks to esthetic elements and practical ones, too. Photography has been used to rescue animals, plants, and habitats locally and worldwide. Participation in Nature Photography Day has since extended worldwide. June 15 is a day that encourages exploring, with a camera, the natural world within walking, hiking, biking, or rowing distance--to avoid leaving a carbon footprint. Among the numerous ways to celebrate the day is to experiment with taking photographs of a familiar subject, turning the ordinary into something extraordinary. NANPA also encourages participants to learn about the experiences of nature photographers--legends of the past and today.            

NANPA's Summits, begun in 1995, bring together nature photography professionals from throughout the continent and the world. Recent Summits have been held in Jacksonville, Florida (2013 and 2017); and San Diego, California (2015). The event is scheduled for Las Vegas in 2019. Each Summit features major presentations by distinguished people in the nature photography profession, an awards celebration, a trade show, portfolio reviews, workshops (breakout sessions), and vendor demonstrations. Lightning talks were a recent feature at Summits: a series of six-minute presentations by NANPA members on techniques, anecdotes, and related information.

'''Octavian''' or '''Octav Smigelschi''' (last name also '''Smigelski''',  '''Smighelschi''', '''Szmigelszki''', or '''Szmigelschi'''; {{lang-hu|Szmigelszki Oktáv}}; March 21, 1866 &amp;ndash; November 10, 1912) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] painter and printmaker, one of the leading [[Romanians|culturally Romanian]] artists in his native [[Transylvania]]. Of mixed [[Poles|Polish]], [[Aromanians|Aromanian]], and possibly [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]], background, he identified mainly with the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian-speaking Greek-Catholics]], although some of his most important work was also done for the rival [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Smigelschi graduated from the [[Hungarian University of Fine Arts|Drawing School and Art Teachers' College]] in [[Budapest]], working on and off at high schools in [[Upper Hungary]] and Transylvania. His European journeys with [[Arthur Coulin]] took him to [[Cervara di Roma]], where he studied [[Renaissance art]], while moving away from [[academic art]] and into [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Art Nouveau]].

Modernizing themes from [[Romanian folklore]] and [[Byzantine art]], from 1903 Smigelschi focused his effort mainly on [[Christian art]] and ''[[Modello|modelli]]'', including initial work for decorating [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Blaj|Blaj Cathedral]]. He was among those commissioned to paint [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Sibiu|Sibiu Orthodox Cathedral]], which required him to study religious art in the neighboring [[Kingdom of Romania]]. His "new vision" combined elements of Symbolism into the Orthodox tradition—a synthesis also found in his murals for smaller churches throughout Transylvania, and in his work on [[icon]]s. His contribution was relatively ignored in Romania, but well-liked in Transylvania and [[Transleithania]] at large, earning Smigelschi the [[Vilmos Fraknói]] prize in 1907. He died of a heart disease while he was preparing to focus his work on Hungarian churches.

==Biography==

===Background and early life===
The artist's father, Mihail Śmigielski, came from [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|Partitioned Poland]]. According to historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], the family descended from ''[[chorąży]]'' (standard-bearers) to the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish king]].&lt;ref name="gog15"&gt;Gogâlea, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer suggests a [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] background; Mihail was an [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern-rite Catholic]], and the [[Austrian Partition]] of Poland was home to numerous [[Union of Uzhhorod|Ruthenian Greek-Catholics]]. However, he does allow for the possibility that the elder Smigelschi adopted the faith after arriving in Transylvania.&lt;ref name="gog15"/&gt; Octavian Smigelschi's own ethnic identity has been subject to some debate, with both Polish and Hungarian suggested, but he considered himself as Romanian,&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, pp. 7, 10. See also Iorga, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by Transylvanians as the region's "only Romanian painter."&lt;ref name="fppictor"&gt;"Cronică. Pictor român", in ''Foaia Poporuluĭ'', Nr. 28/1896, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mihail was a member of the ''[[szlachta]]'' noble class who fled Poland following the [[Greater Poland uprising (1848)|1848 Revolution]] and arrived in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Principality of Transylvania]] in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p. 816; Păcurariu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Initially settling in [[Șelimbăr|Bungard]], he married Ana Sebastian, an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and also a Greek-Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 15. See also Oprescu, p. 816&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he moved to Nagyludas in [[Szeben County]], now [[Ludoș]], [[Sibiu County]], to work as a notary. There, he had four sons. One of them, Victor, obtained a Theology doctorate from the [[University of Vienna]], teaching the subject and serving as a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Blaj]]. Another, Vasile, became an architect and was influenced by [[Romanian nationalist|Romanian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 15. See also Iorga, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Mihail's other son, Cornel Smigelschi, died in 1892, an event which inspired Octavian to paint a number of portraits from memory, and also to produce a series of drawings and canvasses of [[Abaddon]].&lt;ref&gt;Vida, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Cornel is depicted in the 1892 "Young Man Reading".&lt;ref name="s-al&amp;d-rh110"&gt;Sabin-Adrian Luca, Dana-Roxana Hrib, ''Marile muzee ale lumii, 15: Muzeul Național Brukenthal, Sibiu/Hermannstadt'', p. 110. Bucharest: [[Adevărul Holding]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-606-539-253-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian began school in his native village, and in 1880 enrolled at the [[Gheorghe Lazăr National College (Sibiu)|state Hungarian high school]] in [[Sibiu]]. There, he became close friends with [[Fritz Schullerus]], and the two took art classes from [[Carl Dörschlag]], a German immigrant. Following graduation in 1884, he obtained a public scholarship to study at the [[Hungarian University of Fine Arts|Drawing School and Art Teachers' College]] in [[Budapest]], headed by [[Bertalan Székely]], together with Schullerus.&lt;ref name="gog16"/&gt; He completed his work there in 1889.&lt;ref name="pac27"&gt;Păcurariu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he applied for a scholarship in Romania, explaining that Hungary was stifling his creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally integrated by the Hungarian education system, and named art teacher in the [[Upper Hungary|Upper Hungarian]] ([[Slovakia|Slovak]]) town of [[Banská Štiavnica]].&lt;ref name="gog16"&gt;Gogâlea, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also in 1890, he held his first exhibition in Sibiu, alongside Schullerus and another [[Transylvanian Saxon]] colleague. In 1892, he was hired to teach art at the state high school in [[Dumbrăveni]]. He held this position until 1911, when he retired in order to focus on painting, although from 1905, when he moved to Sibiu, he was on a leave of absence for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; During that interval, he began painting [[icon]]s, which he advertised as "the only ones befitting our canon."&lt;ref name="fppictor"/&gt; Together with his brother Victor, Smigelschi also joined the Blaj chapter of [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Society]], a Romanian nationalist association.&lt;ref&gt;"Consemnarea membrilor 'Asociațiunii pentru literatura română și cultura poporului român'. Starea dela 1 Iulie 1903", in ''Analele Asociațiunii pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român'', Nr. IV, July 1903, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

As described by art historian Gheorghe Vida, Smighelschi's other work of the period is a transition from [[Romanticism]] to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with frequent lapses into [[Naturalism (painting)|Naturalism]] and [[academic art]]. Specifically, he belongs to the branch of Symbolism cultivated by Dörschlag, [[Hans von Marées]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Max Klinger]], and [[Béla Iványi-Grünwald]].&lt;ref&gt;Vida, pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Mihai Ispir views Dörschlag and Smigelschi as the two benchmarks of a transition from "the neoclassical 'ideal' to Symbolist 'idealism'."&lt;ref&gt;Ispir, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Curators Sabin-Adrian Luca and Dana-Roxana Hrib describe Smigelschi's painting as bridging "temperate naturalism" and "influences from that branch of Symbolism which descends from [[German romanticism]]."&lt;ref name="s-al&amp;d-rh110"/&gt; As the 1890s went on, Smigelschi also became increasingly drawn to [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name="gog11"/&gt; Beginning in 1898, he undertook trips to [[Munich]], [[Dresden]], [[Vienna]], Budapest, [[Florence]], [[Rome]] and [[Ravenna]], studying the local [[Renaissance art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 17; Păcurariu, p. 27; Vida, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He bunked with [[Robert Wellman]] and [[Arthur Coulin]] at [[Cervara di Roma]] art colony.&lt;ref&gt;Vida, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Following this sojourn, Smigelschi expanded his Symbolist range. Initially, his paintings of Abbadon became more macabre; circa 1900, however, Smigelschi introduced a merrier derivation of Symbolism, exploring the motif of "wicked fairies", which has roots in [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Vida, pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, he held his second exhibition in Blaj, featuring exclusively religious works, including ''[[Modello|modelli]]'' for painting [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Blaj|the Greek-Catholic cathedral]]. That October, his third exhibition took place in Sibiu, with 71 secular paintings and drawings.&lt;ref name="gog18"&gt;Gogâlea, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Among the displays was a 7 x 5 m carpet woven by peasant women from [[Maramureș]] based on his indications. The show drew universal acclaim due to the newness of his style and the combination of popular Romanian motifs and peasant folk art he employed. The fourth exhibition occurred the same year in Budapest, and was praised as well, including by [[Octavian Goga]] in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sibiu cathedral and later years===
Meanwhile, the old [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] cathedral in Sibiu had been demolished in 1902 and [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Sibiu|a new building]] begun.&lt;ref name="gog18"/&gt; A competition for the painting opened in November 1903, with fifteen Romanian, German and Hungarian participants.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; A committee composed of [[George Demetrescu Mirea]], [[Ion Mincu]] and [[Friedrich Miess]] narrowed the field down to three finalists. In April 1904, Smigelschi was selected to execute the interior painting.&lt;ref name="gog20"&gt;Gogâlea, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He was paid 32,000 [[Hungarian korona|crowns]] for the cupola, the [[pendentive]]s and the [[iconostasis]].&lt;ref name="gog21"&gt;Gogâlea, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, he began to focus on traditional styles of painting, seeking to strike a balance between large-scale murals and the architectural surroundings which they were not supposed to overshadow. Accordingly, in 1904, he crossed into the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] as well as the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] in order to study the churches and monasteries where the Romanians' spiritual heritage is expressed,&lt;ref name="gog20"/&gt; familiarizing himself with the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] that came to complement his knowledge of Renaissance painting.&lt;ref name="pac27"/&gt; Reportedly, his interest in Byzantine art had first manifested itself in Italy, when he sketched after the monuments of [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Tăslăuanu, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In this second creative period, Smigelschi nearly abandoned all other genres in favor of monumental work.&lt;ref name="s-al&amp;d-rh110"/&gt; He analyzed old painted churches at [[Tismana Monastery|Tismana]], [[Cozia Monastery|Cozia]], [[Bistrița Monastery|Bistrița]], [[Horezu Monastery|Horezu]], [[Curtea de Argeș Cathedral|Curtea de Argeș]], [[Bucharest]], [[Snagov Monastery|Snagov]], [[Sinaia Monastery|Sinaia]], [[Iași]], [[Suceava]], [[Sucevița Monastery|Sucevița]], [[Dragomirna]], [[Putna Monastery|Putna]], [[Bogdana Monastery|Rădăuți]], [[Humor Monastery|Humor]], [[Voroneț Monastery|Voroneț]] and [[Cernăuți]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; His own work, in churches at [[Șanț]], [[Rădești, Alba|Rădești]], Sibiu, [[Ciacova]] and elsewhere, reflects attention to tradition but not a mere reproduction thereof. From Byzantine models he took the monumental size and decorative look; this was infused with the Renaissance and German schools, in particular [[Arnold Böcklin]], to create a neo-Byzantine style most evident in the Sibiu cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, pp. 21, 34&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of Transylvanian churches, particularly in the [[Năsăud]] area, he painted icons and sometimes entire iconostases.&lt;ref name="pac27"/&gt;

After moving to Sibiu in 1905,&lt;ref name="gog21"/&gt; he was able to complete his commission there by the time the new cathedral was dedicated in May 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; As a speaker of German and Hungarian, he fit easily into the city's artistic milieu.&lt;ref name="gog11"&gt;Gogâlea, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Features of his cathedral work, which he himself published as prints in ''Luceafărul'',&lt;ref name="oct184–5"&gt;Tăslăuanu, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; include [[Christ Pantocrator]] in the cupola, the [[Four Evangelists]] on the pendentives and the painted iconostasis. Romanian folk motifs are used in the clothing worn by the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]], [[Adoration of the shepherds|the shepherds]] and [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the child angels with the star]], while the [[Nativity of Jesus]] is transposed to a Romanian setting.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 13; Păcurariu, pp. 28, 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Păcurariu]] suggests that the Magi are each inspired by a ruler of the Romanian provinces ([[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]] and Transylvania): [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]] is taken from Sucevița, [[Neagoe Basarab]] from Curtea de Argeș and [[Matthias Corvinus]] from a period engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Păcurariu, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Iorga, Smigelschi persisted in his goal to paint a church of his own in Romania-proper, and presented his designs during the 1906 national exhibit in Bucharest, "the Capital of his People." He was sidelined in favor of "others, better seen and better connected."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; However, the icons he presented at the exhibit did earn Smigelschi a state prize, worth 250 [[Romanian leu|lei]].&lt;ref&gt;"Din România. Știri dela expoziție", in ''Tribuna'', Nr. 132/1906, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, along with painting at Ciacova, he donated funds to the families of those killed during [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|the peasants' revolt]]. The following year, Smigelschi won a competition for the [[Vilmos Fraknói]] prize, guaranteeing him 3000 crowns annually, a studio and a residence in Fraknói's Rome house. He also organized an exhibit in Budapest, drawing favorable mentions in the local press.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, Smigelschi painted the Greek-Catholic church in Rădești. During this time, he began to show symptoms of heart disease that grew progressively worse. He received an order for painting the altar in a Rákóczi chapel in Hungary, which remained unfilled, while painting for the Blaj cathedral and the remainder of the Sibiu cathedral was left in the planning stages.&lt;ref name="gog23"&gt;Gogâlea, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years, Smigelschi returned to ''modelli'' and created a series of [[mannequin]]s, possibly intending to extend into sculpture. As noted by historian Nicolae Sabău, no buyer encouraged his work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; He also intended to execute a [[triptych]] for the 1911 [[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|International Exhibition of Art]] in Rome, but this remained undone due to a heart attack. In 1912, with his disease worsening, he left for treatment at [[Bad Nauheim]]. He then traveled to Budapest, where he took part in a contest for painting a chapel in [[Košice]]. Smigelschi died in Budapest in November 1912.&lt;ref name="gog23"/&gt; His brother Victor claimed the remains and he was buried in Blaj.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 23. See also Iorga, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iorga, in his obituary piece, claimed that both Catholics and Orthodox Transylvanians felt "undying sorrow, [sensing] that a century may pass and another painter like him [...] may still not be born." The deceased, he argued, had instilled a "new vision of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Octavian Codru Tăslăuanu]] of ''Luceafărul'' writes that Smigelschi's "innovation created a school", although withholding judgment on "whether the innovation was for the better."&lt;ref name="oct184–5"/&gt; As asserted by Ispir, Smigelschi's neo-Byzantine approach was a "perishable tear into the threads of tradition". It replaced the "post-Byzantine customs" of traditional church art with a more academic and "[[Historicism (art)|historicist]]" approach.&lt;ref&gt;Ispir, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospective exhibitions before World War I include an October 1913 show at the [[Hall of Art, Budapest|Budapest Kunsthalle]], also honoring Coulin and [[Bertalan Bartolomaus Papp]].&lt;ref&gt;"Művészet és zene. 1913", in ''Kincses Kalendáriom 1915-re'', p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Smigelschi's works were bought and preserved by the [[ASTRA National Museum Complex|ASTRA Museum]], then transferred to [[Brukenthal National Museum|Brukenthal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, pp. 32, 33&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar [[Virgil Vătășianu]], the sketches are the artist's most important contributions, and as such the most important artworks produced by a Transylvanian Romanian in the pre-1914 era.&lt;ref&gt;Gogâlea, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The other Smigelschis continued to be active in Romania, following the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Transylvanian union]]. Smigelschi's son, Victor, was an architect noted for designing Blaj's Palace of Culture in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170616115506/http://www.rri.ro/en_gb/the_culture_palace_in_blaj-2564830 ''The Culture Palace in Blaj''], [[Radio Romania International]], May 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and for his contribution to the Romanian pavilion at [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|EXPO Paris 1937]].&lt;ref&gt;Luminița Machedon, ''Romanian Modernism: The Architecture of Bucharest, 1920–1940'', pp. 301–303.

[[File:Autograph score of part of Act2 (Wolf's Glen) of 'Der Freischütz' - NGO4p1116.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A hand-written [[Sheet music|musical score]] for Act 2 of the [[opera]] ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], written in the 1820s. The score contains all the parts for the singers and the [[accompaniment]] parts and melodies for the [[orchestra]].]]
'''Orchestration''' is the study or practice of writing [[music]] for an [[orchestra]] (or, more loosely, for any [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[concert band]]) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Also called "instrumentation", orchestration is the selection of different instruments to play the different parts (e.g., [[melody]], [[bassline]], etc.) of a musical work. For example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra.

Only gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. In [[classical music]], most [[composer]]s write the [[melody|melodies]], [[chord progression]] and [[musical form]] for a piece and, then, if they want the piece to be played by an orchestra, they orchestrate the piece themselves. In [[musical theatre]], however, the composer typically writes the [[melody|melodies]] and then hires a professional [[arranger]] or orchestrator to devise the parts for the [[pit orchestra]] to play.

Similarly, when a film company is making a film score, a composer thinks up the main melodies and themes for the score, and then one or more orchestrators are hired to "flesh out" these basic melodies by adding [[accompaniment]] parts, [[bassline]]s, backing chords, and so on. In jazz [[big band]]s, the composer or [[songwriter]] writes the [[lead sheet]], which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers "flesh out" these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the [[rhythm section]] (bass, piano/[[jazz guitar]]/[[Hammond organ]], drums).

An '''orchestrator''' is a trained musical professional who assigns instruments from an [[orchestra]] or other [[musical ensemble]] to a piece of music written by a [[composer]], or who adapts music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Orchestrators may work for [[musical theatre]] productions, [[film production]] companies or [[recording studio]]s. Some orchestrators teach at colleges, conservatories or universities. The training done by orchestrators varies. Most have completed formal postsecondary education in music, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] (B.Mus.), [[Master of Music]] (M.Mus.) or an artist's diploma. Orchestrators who teach at universities, colleges and conservatories may be required to hold a master's degree or a Doctorate (the latter may be a Ph.D. or a D.M.A). Orchestrators who work for film companies, musical theatre companies and other organizations may be hired solely based on their orchestration experience, even if they do not hold academic credentials. In the 2010s, as the percentage of faculty holding [[terminal degree]]s and/or Doctoral degrees is part of how an institution is rated, this is causing an increasing number of postsecondary institutions to require terminal and/or Doctoral degrees.

==In practice==
The term ''orchestration'' in its specific sense refers to the way instruments are used to portray any musical aspect such as [[melody]], [[harmony]] or [[rhythm]]. For example, a C [[major chord]] is made up of the notes [[C (musical note)|C]], [[E (musical note)|E]], and [[G (musical note)|G]]. If the notes are held out the entire duration of a [[bar (music)|measure]], the composer or orchestrator will have to decide what instrument(s) play this chord and in what [[Register (music)|register]]. Some instruments, including [[woodwinds]] and [[brass]] are [[Monophony|monophonic]] and can only play one note of the chord at a time. However, in a full orchestra there are more than one of these instruments, so the composer may choose to outline the chord in its basic form with a group of [[clarinets]] or [[trumpets]] (with separate instruments each being given one of the three notes of the chord). Other instruments, including the [[string instrument|strings]], [[piano]], [[harp]], and pitched [[percussion]] are [[polyphonic]] and may play more than one note at a time. As such, if the composer/orchestrator wishes to have the strings play the C major chord, she could assign the low C to the cellos and basses, the G to the violas, and then a high E to the second [[violin]]s and an E an octave higher to the first violins. If the composer/orchestrator wishes the chord to be played only by the first and second violins, she could give the second violins a low C and give the first violins a [[double stop]] of the notes G (an open string) and E.

Additionally in orchestration, notes may be placed into another register (such as transposed down for the [[string bass|basses]]), doubled (both in the same and different octaves), and altered with various levels of dynamics.  The choice of instruments, registers, and dynamics affect the overall [[timbre|tone color]].  If the C major chord was orchestrated for the [[trumpet]]s and [[trombone]]s playing [[fortissimo]] in their upper registers, it would sound very bright; but if the same chord was orchestrated for the [[cello|celli]] and [[string bass]]es playing [[sul tasto]], doubled by the [[bassoon]]s and [[bass clarinet]], it might sound heavy and dark.

Note that although the above example discussed orchestrating a chord, a melody or even a single note may be orchestrated in this fashion. Also note that in this specific sense of the word, ''orchestration'' is not necessarily limited to an orchestra, as a composer may ''orchestrate'' this same C major chord for, say, a [[woodwind quintet]], a [[string quartet]] or a [[concert band]]. Each different ensemble would enable the orchestrator/composer to create different tone "colours" and timbres.

A [[melody]] is also orchestrated. The composer or orchestrator may think of a melody in her head, or while playing the piano or organ. Once she has thought of a melody, she has to decide which instrument (or instruments) will play the melody. One widely used approach for a melody is to assign it to the first violins. When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part (often in thirds and sixths). Sometimes, for a forceful effect, a composer will indicate in the score that all of the strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses) will play the melody in unison, at the same time. Typically, even though the instruments are playing the same note names, the violins will play very high-register notes, the violas and cellos will play lower-register notes, and the double basses will play the deepest, lowest pitches.

As well, the [[woodwinds]] and [[brass instrument]]s can effectively carry a melody, depending on the effect the composer/orchestrator desires. The [[trumpet]]s can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While the [[cello]]s are often given an [[accompaniment]] role in orchestration, there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody (e.g., the high-register double bass solo in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kije Suite]]'').

While assigning a melody to a particular section, such as the string section or the woodwinds will work well, as the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well, some composers give the melody to one section and then have the melody doubled by a different section or an instrument from a different section. For example, a melody played by the first violins could be doubled by the [[glockenspiel]], which would add a sparkling, chime-like colour to the melody. Alternatively, a melody played by the piccolos could be doubled by the [[celesta]], which would add a bright tone to the sound.

In the 20th and 21st century, [[contemporary composer]]s began to incorporate [[music technology (electric)|electric]] and [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic]] instruments into the orchestra, such as the [[electric guitar]] played through a [[guitar amplifier]], the [[electric bass]] played through a [[bass amplifier]], the [[Theremin]] and the [[synthesizer]]. The addition of these new instruments gave composers new options for creating tonal "colours" in their orchestration. For example, in the late 20th century and onwards, a composer could have a melody played by the first violins doubled by a futuristic-sounding [[synthesizer]] or a [[theremin]] to create an unusual effect.

Orchestral instrumentation is denoted by an abbreviated formulaic convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orchestral Music a Handbook|last=Daniels|first=David|publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]]- horn, [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[tuba]]. More details can be contained in brackets. A dot separates one player from another, a slash indicates doubling. Timpani and percussion are denoted 2Tmp+ number of percussion.

For example, 3[1.2.3/pic] 2[1.Eh] 3[1.2.3/Ebcl/bcl] 3[1.2/cbn.cbn] tmp+2 is interpreted as:

* 3 flautists, the 3rd doubling on piccolo ("doubling" means that the performer can play flute and piccolo)
* 
* 2 oboists, the 2nd playing English horn throughout
* 
* 3 clarinetists, the 3rd doubling also on E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet
* 
* 3 bassoonists, the 2nd doubling on contrabassoon, the 3rd playing only contra
* 
* Timpani+ 2 percussion.

As an example, Mahler Symphony 2 is scored: 4[1/pic.2/pic.3/pic.4/pic] 4[1.2.3/Eh.4/Eh] 5[1.2.3/bcl.4/Ebcl2.Ebcl] 4[1.2.3.4/cbn]- 10 8 4 1- 2tmp+4-2&amp;nbsp;hp- org- str.

==Examples from the repertoire==

===J.S Bach===
During the [[Baroque]] era, composers showed increasing awareness of the expressive potential of orchestration.  While some early Baroque pieces have no indication of which instruments should play the piece, the choice of instruments being left to the musical group's leader or [[concertmaster]], there are Baroque works which specify certain instruments. The orchestral accompaniment to the aria 'et misericordia' from J.S.Bach’s ''[[Magnificat]]'', BWV243 (1723) features muted strings [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] by flutes, a subtle combination of mellow instrumental [[timbres]].[[File:Et misericordia.png|thumb|center|500px|Orchestral introduction to 'et misericordia' from Bach's Magnificat, BWV 243. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om6FA-8Rs5I Listen]]]

The orchestral introduction to the opening chorus of J.S.Bach’s [[epiphany (holiday)|epiphany]] Cantata [[Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen, BWV 65|''Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen'']] BWV65, which [[John Eliot Gardiner]] (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;328) describes as “one of the crowning glories of Bach’s first Christmas season” demonstrates the composer’s mastery of his craft.  Within a space of eight bars, we hear recorders, [[oboe da caccia|oboes da caccia]], horns and strings creating a “glittery sheen” of contrasted timbres, sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against a string [[pedal point]] in the first bar to a “restatement of the octave unison theme, this time by all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves” in bars 7-8:&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, J.E. (2013, p. 328) ''Music in the Castle of Heaven''.  London, Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.wav|thumb|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.]][[File:Sie werden aus Saba Alle kommen opening bars.png|thumb|center|600px|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65. ]]

Igor Stravinsky (1959, p45) marvelled at Bach’s skill as an orchestrator: “What incomparable instrumental writing is Bach's. You can smell the resin [(rosin)] in his violin parts, [and] taste the reeds in the 
oboes.”&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky I. and Craft, R. ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky''.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rameau===
Jean Philippe [[Rameau]] was famous for "the eloquence of [his] orchestral writing which was something entirely new... - with a feeling for colour [(i.e., tone colour or timbre)] that is altogether 'modern'."&lt;ref&gt;Pincherle, M. (1967, p.122) ''An Illustrated History of Music''.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 'The Entrance of Polymnie' from his opera ''[[Les Boréades]]'' (1763), the predominant string texture is shot through with descending scale figures on the bassoon, creating an exquisite blend of timbres:[[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.wav|thumb|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]][[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.png|thumb|center|500px|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]]

===Mozart===
Another important technique of orchestration was [[call and response (music)|antiphony]], the "call and response" exchange of musical motifs or "ideas" between different groups in the orchestra. In an antiphonal section, the composer may have one group of instruments introduce a melodic idea (e.g., the first violins), and then have the woodwinds "answer" by restating this melodic idea, often with some type of variation. In the trio section of the minuet from Mozart’s [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 41]] (1788), the flute, bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings, with the first violin line [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] at the [[octave]] by the first oboe:[[File:Mozart Jupiter Symphony Trio.wav|thumb|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41.]] [[File:Mozart Jupiter Trio.png|thumb|center|500px|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41. ]] Charles Rosen (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;240) admires Mozart’s skill in orchestrating his piano concertos, particularly the [[Piano Concerto No. 22 (Mozart)|Concerto in E flat major, K482]], a work that introduced clarinets into the mix.  “This concerto places the greatest musical reliance on tone colour, which is, indeed, almost always ravishing.  One lovely example of its sonorities comes near the beginning.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mozart Piano Concerto 22 first movement opening.wav|thumb|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars  1-12]][[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6]] 
 
The orchestral [[tutti]] in the first two bars is answered by just horns and bassoon in bars 2-6.  This passage repeats with fresh orchestration: [[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12. ]]“Here we have the unusual sound on the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets.  The simplicity of the sequence concentrates all our interest on tone-colour, and what follows – a series of woodwind solos – keeps it there.  The orchestration throughout, in fact, has a greater variety than Mozart had wished or needed before, and fits the brilliance, charm, and grace of the first movement and the finale.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beethoven===
A demonstration of Beethoven’s consummate skill at obtaining the maximum variety out of seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can be found in the first movement of the [[Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5|Piano Concerto No. 5]] in E flat (‘The Emperor’) Opus 73 (1810). The [[sonata form|second subject of the sonata form]] is a deceptively simple tune that, according to Fiske (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;41) “is limited to notes playable on the horns for which it music have been specially designed.”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme appears in five different orchestrations throughout the movement, with changes of [[Mode (music)|mode]] (major to minor), [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] ([[forte (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]]) and a blending of instrumental [[Timbre|colour]] that ranges from boldly stated [[tutti]] passages to the most subtle and differentiated episodes, where instrumental sounds are combined often in quite unexpected ways:[[File:Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor).wav|thumb|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]][[File:Subsidiary theme from the first movement of beethoven's Piano Conxcert No. 5 (Emperor).png|thumb|center|600px|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]]

The theme first appears in the minor mode during the orchestral introduction, performed using [[staccato]] articulation and orchestrated in the most delicate and enchanting colours:[[File:Minor version of the theme.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme]][[File:Minor version 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor version of the theme. ]]This is followed by a more straightforward version in the major key, with horns accompanied by strings.  The theme is now played [[legato]] by the horns, accompanied by a sustained [[pedal point]] in the bassoons.  The violins simultaneously play an elaborated version of the theme.  (See also [[heterophony]].)  The timpani and [[pizzicato]] lower strings add further colour to this variegated palette of sounds. “Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference in effect is extraordinary”:&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.41), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody.wav|thumb|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody]][[File:Major version of the theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody. ]]When the solo piano enters, its right hand plays a variant of the minor version of the theme in a [[Tuplet|triplet]] rhythm, with the backing of pizzicato (plucked) strings on the off-beats:[[File:Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets]][[File:Minor version 2 - piano.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor key version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets. ]]This is followed by a bold [[Tutti|''tutti'']] statement of the theme, "with the whole orchestra thumping it out in aggressive semi-[[staccato]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Tutti statement of the theme.wav|thumb|Tutti statement of the theme]]:[[File:Tutti version in major.png|thumb|center|500px|Tutti statement of the theme. ]]The minor version of the theme also appears in the [[cadenza]], played staccato by the solo piano:[[File:Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza.wav|thumb|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza]][[File:Cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza. ]]This is followed, finally, by a restatement of the major key version, featuring horns playing legato , accompanied by pizzicato strings and [[filigree]] arpeggio figuration in the solo piano:[[File:Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza.wav|thumb|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza]][[File:Major version in cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza. ]] Fiske (1970) says that Beethoven shows “a superb flood of invention” through these varied treatments.  “The variety of moods this theme can convey is without limit” .”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlioz===

The most significant orchestral innovator of the early 19th century was Hector [[Berlioz]].  (The composer was also the author of a ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation]]''.) “He was drawn to the orchestra as his chosen medium by instinct … and by finding out the exact capabilities and [[timbres]] of individual instruments, and it was on this raw material that his imagination worked to produce countless new sonorities, very striking when considered as a totality, crucially instructive for later composers, and nearly all exactly tailored to their dramatic or expressive purpose.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p5) ''Berlioz Orchestral Music''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous examples of Berlioz’s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.  The opening of the fourth movement, entitled “March to the Scaffold” features what for the time (1830) must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds.  The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass: [[File:March to the Scaffold bars 1-4.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, March to the Scaffold from the Symphonie [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXHrHQ5ZEHo Fantastique. Listen]]]

“Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.44) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlioz was also capable of conveying great delicacy in his instrumental writing.  A particularly spectacular instance is the “[[Queen Mab]]” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM scherzo] from the ''[[Romeo et Juliette]]'' symphony, which [[Hugh Macdonald]] (1969, p51) describes as “Berlioz’s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, [[prestissimo]] and [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] almost without pause: [[File:Queen Mab main theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, Queen Mab scherzo from Romeo et Juliette]]

Boulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands on conductors and orchestras of the time (1830), “Because of the rapid and precise rhythms, the staccatos which must be even and regular in all registers, because of the isolated notes that occur right at the end of the bar on the third quaver…all of which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.37) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where “The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p51) Berlioz orchestral Music.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Queen mab scherzo p218.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, orchestral texture from  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM&amp;t=6m0s Queen Mab Scherzo. Listen]]] The [[New Grove Dictionary]] says that for Berlioz, orchestration “was intrinsic to composition, not something applied to finished music...in his hands [[timbre]] became something that could be used in free combinations, as an artist might use his palette, without bowing to the demands of line, and this leads to the rich orchestral resource of Debussy and Ravel.”&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H., (2001) “Berlioz”, article in Sadie, S. (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner===

After Berlioz, [[Richard Wagner]] was the major pioneer in the development of orchestration during the 19th century.  [[Pierre Boulez]] speaks of the “sheer richness of Wagner’s orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Latham says that Wagner had a “unique appreciation of the possibilities for colour inherent in the instruments at his disposal, and it was this that guided him both in his selection of new recruits for the orchestral family and in his treatment of its established members. The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.” Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera ''[[Lohengrin]]'', where “the ethereal quality of the music” is due to the violins being “divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.”&lt;ref&gt;Latham, P. (1926) “Wagner: Aesthetics and Orchestration.” Gramophone, June 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Prelude to Lohengrin condensed score.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Prelude to Lohengrin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk4bcnBqls Listen]]]

As he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|''The Ring'']] Wagner made “increasing use of the contrast between pure and mixed [[Timbre|colours]], bringing to a fine point the art of transition from one field of sonority to another.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first act of his final opera ''[[Parsifal]]'', Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings, showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families of instruments:[[File:Parsifal contrasting groups.png|thumb|center|500px|Contrasting orchestral groups from the first Act of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Q-dl2RYyA&amp;t=0m54s Parsifal]]]

On the other hand, the prelude to the opera ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'' exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different [[Orchestra|orchestral families]] with his precise markings of [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[Articulation (music)|articulation]].  In the opening phrase, the cellos are supported by wind instruments: [[File:Tristan prelude bars 1-7.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan prelude, opening. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA Listen]]]

When this idea returns towards the end of the prelude, the [[Timbre|instrumental colors]] are varied subtly, with sounds that were new to the 19th century orchestra, such as the [[cor anglais]] and the [[bass clarinet]].  These, together with the ominous rumbling of the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere: [[File:Wagner, Tristan prelude closing bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan Prelude, closing bars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA&amp;t=9m45s Link to passage]]]

“It’s impressive to see how Wagner… produces balance in his works.  He is true genius in this respect, undeniably so, even down to the working out of the exact number of instruments.”  Boulez is “fascinated by the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance, [which] … contains a multiplicity of details that he achieved with astonishing precision.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (2003, p.52) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Seldom since Bach's inspired use of [[obbligato]] parts in his cantatas have the instruments of the orchestra been so meticulously and lovingly adapted to their expressive role by Wagner in his later operas." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. (2016, p147) ''The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner's'' Ring of the Nibelung.  Penguin Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahler===
William Austin (1966) says “[[Mahler]] expanded the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax in the direction already marked by [[Beethoven]], [[Berlioz]] and [[Wagner]]… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but a greater variety of sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as loud.  Its colours were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adorno]] (1971) similarly describes Mahler’s symphonic writing as characterised by “massive tutti effects” contrasted with “chamber-music procedures”.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1971, p.53) ''Mahler, a musical physiognomy''.  Trans. Jephcott.  University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this:[[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.wav|thumb|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Fig 5]][[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Figure 5. ]] Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble.  The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments.  Mahler’s experienced conductor’s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics.  For example, in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked [[Dynamics (music)|''forte'']], the clarinets, [[Dynamics (music)|''mezzo-forte'']] and the horns [[Dynamics (music)|''piano'']].  Austin (1966) says that “Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler’s imagination for sonority is exemplified in the closing bars of the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony, where there occurs what [[Walter Piston]] (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;140) describes as “an instance of inspired orchestration… To be noted are the sudden change of mode in the harmonic progression, the unusual spacing of the chord in measure 5, and the placing of the perfect fourth in the two flutes. The effect is quite unexpected and magical.”&lt;ref&gt;Piston, W. (1969) ''Orchestration''.  London, Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mahler 4 3rd movement Fig 13.wav|thumb|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]][[File:Mahler 4 third movement.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]]

===Debussy===

Apart from Mahler and [[Richard Strauss]], the major innovator in orchestration during the closing years of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century was Claude [[Debussy]].  According to Pierre [[Boulez]] (1975, p20) “Debussy’s orchestration… when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries as Strauss and Mahler… shows an infinitely fresher imagination.”  Boulez said that Debussy’s orchestration was “conceived from quite a different point of view; the number of instruments, their balance, the order in which they are used, their use itself, produces a different climate.”  Apart from the early impact of [[Wagner]], Debussy was also fascinated by music from Asia that according to Austin “he heard repeatedly and admired intensely at the Paris World exhibition of 1889”.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p20) ''Music in the 20th century''. London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both influences inform Debussy’s first major orchestral work, ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune|Prelude a l’après-midi d’un faune]]'' (1894).  Wagner’s influence can be heard in the strategic use of [[silence]], the sensitively differentiated orchestration and, above all in the striking [[half-diminished seventh]] chord spread between oboes and clarinets, reinforced by a [[glissando]] on the harp. Austin (1966, p.&amp;nbsp;16) continues “Only a composer thoroughly familiar with the [[Tristan chord]] could have conceived the beginning of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYyK922PsUw ''Faune''].”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.16) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi opening.png|thumb|center|600px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, opening bars]]

Later in the ''Faune'', Debussy builds a complex texture, where, as Austin says, “[[Polyphony]] and orchestration overlap...He adds to all the devices of [[Mozart]], [[Weber]], [[Berlioz]] and Wagner the possibilities that he learned from the [[heterophonic]] music of the Far East.... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost the same way that the smallest bells of a [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]] vary the slower basic melody.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.20) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi, from Fig 7- short score version.png|thumb|center|700px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, Figure 7, bars 11-13]]

Debussy’s final orchestral work, the enigmatic ballet ''[[Jeux]]'' (1913) was composed nearly 20 years after the ''Faune''.  The opening bars feature divided strings, spread over a wide range, a harp doubling horns with the addition of the bell-like [[celesta]] in the 5th bar and the sultry voicing of the [[whole tone scale|whole tone]] chords in the woodwind:[[File:Jeux opening bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8qP_2i3HYA Jeux opening bars]]]

Jensen (2014, p.&amp;nbsp;228) says “Perhaps the greatest marvel of ''Jeux'' is its orchestration.  While working on the piano score, Debussy wrote: ‘I am thinking of that orchestral colour which seems to be illuminated from behind, and for which there are such marvellous displays in ''[[Parsifal]]''’  The idea, then, was to produce timbre without glare, subdued… but to do so with clarity and precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Jensen, E.F. (2014) ''Debussy''.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As adaptation==
In a more general sense, ''orchestration'' also refers to the re-adaptation of existing music into another medium, particularly a full or reduced orchestra. There are two general kinds of adaptation: [[Transcription (music)|transcription]], which closely follows the original piece,  and [[arrangement]], which tends to change significant aspects of the original piece. In terms of adaptation, ''orchestration'' applies, strictly speaking, only to writing for orchestra, whereas the term ''[[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]'' applies to instruments used in the texture of the piece. In the study of orchestration&amp;nbsp;– in contradistinction to the practice&amp;nbsp;– the term ''instrumentation'' may also refer to consideration of the defining characteristics of individual instruments rather than to the art of combining instruments.

In commercial music, especially musical theatre and film music, independent orchestrators are often used because it is difficult to meet tight deadlines when the same person is required both to compose and to orchestrate. Frequently, when a stage musical is adapted to film, such as ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' or ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones. In other cases, such as ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', they are not, and are simply expanded versions from those used in the stage production.

Most orchestrators often work from a draft (sketch), or [[Sheet music#Types|short score]], that is, a score written on limited number of independent [[musical staff|musical staves]]. Some orchestrators, particularly those writing for the [[opera]] or [[music theatre]]s, prefer to work from a piano [[vocal score]] up, since the singers need to start rehearsing a piece long before the whole work is fully completed. That was, for instance, the method of composition of [[Jules Massenet]]. In other instances, simple cooperation between various creators is utilized, as when [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrates [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s songs, or when orchestration is done from a [[lead sheet]] (a simplified music notation for a song which includes just the melody and the [[chord progression]]). In the latter case, arranging as well as orchestration will be involved.

==Film orchestration==
Due to the enormous time constraints of film scoring schedules, most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves, although these orchestrators work under the close supervision of the composer. Some [[Film score|film composers]] have made the time to orchestrate their own music, including [[Bernard Herrmann]] (1911-1975), [[Georges Delerue]] (1925-1992), [[Ennio Morricone]] (1928-), [[John Williams]] (1932-) (his very detailed sketches are 99% orchestrated), [[Howard Shore]] (1946-), [[James Horner]] (1953-2015) (on Braveheart), [[Bruno Coulais]] (1954-), [[Rachel Portman]] (1960-), [[Philippe Rombi]] (1968-) and [[Abel Korzeniowski]] (1972-).

Although there have been hundreds of orchestrators in film over the years, the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half of the 20th century were [[Jack Hayes (composer)|Jack Hayes]], [[Herbert W. Spencer]], [[Edward B. Powell (orchestrator)|Edward Powell]] (who worked almost exclusively with [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]), [[Arthur Morton (composer)|Arthur Morton]], Greig McRitchie, and [[Alexander Courage]].  Some of the most in-demand orchestrators today (and of the past 30 years) include [[Jeff Atmajian]], [[Pete Anthony]], [[Brad Dechter]] (James Newton Howard, Christopher Young, Theodore Shapiro, Teddy Castellucci, Danny Elfman, John Powell, Marco Beltrami, John Debney, Marc Shaiman, Michael Giacchino), [[Conrad Pope]] (John Williams, Alexandre Desplat, Jerry Goldsmith, James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Mark Isham, John Powell, Michael Convertino, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore), [[Eddie Karam]] (John Williams, James Horner), [[Bruce Fowler]] (Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, Harry Gregson-Williams, Steve Jablonsky, Mark Mothersbaugh, John Powell), [[John Ashton Thomas]] (John Powell, John Debney, Alan Silvestri, James Newton Howard, Henry Jackman, Lyle Workman, Theodore Shapiro, John Ottman, John Paesano), [[Robert Elhai]] (Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Kamen, Ed Shearmur, Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, Ilan Eshkeri ) and [[J.A.C. Redford]] (James Horner, Thomas Newman). 

[[Conrad Salinger]] was the most prominent orchestrator of MGM musicals from the 1940s to 1962, orchestrating such famous films as ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''. In the 1950s, film composer [[John Williams]] frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft of orchestration. [[Robert Russell Bennett]] (George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein) was one of America's most prolific orchestrators (particularly of Broadway shows) of the 20th century, sometimes scoring over 80 pages a day.

===Process===
Most films require 30 to 120 minutes of musical score. Each individual piece of music in a film is called a "cue". There are roughly 20-80 cues per film. A dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while an action film may require 80 cues of highly active music. Each cue can range in length from five seconds to more than ten minutes as needed per scene in the film. After the composer is finished composing the cue, this sketch score is delivered to the orchestrator either as hand written or computer generated. Most composers in Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software (e.g. [[Digital Performer]], [[Logic Pro]], or [[Cubase]]). A sketch score can be generated through the use of a [[MIDI]] file which is then imported into a [[scorewriter|music notation program]] such as [[Finale (software)|Finale]] or [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]]. Thus begins the job of the orchestrator.

Every composer works differently and the orchestrator's job is to understand what is required from one composer to the next. If the music is created with sequencing software then the orchestrator is given a MIDI sketch score and a synthesized recording of the cue. The sketch score only contains the musical notes (e.g. eighth notes, quarter notes, etc.) with no phrasing, articulations, or dynamics. The orchestrator studies this synthesized "mockup" recording listening to dynamics and phrasing (just as the composer has played them in).  He or she then accurately tries to represent these elements in the orchestra. However some voicings on a synthesizer ([[synthestration]]) will not work in the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra.

The sound samples are often doubled up very prominently and thickly with other sounds in order to get the music to "speak" louder. The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings to traditional orchestral voicings in order to make the music flow better. He or she may move intervals up or down the octave (or omit them entirely), double certain passages with other instruments in the orchestra, add percussion instruments to provide colour, and add Italian performance marks (e.g. Allegro con brio, Adagio, ritardando, dolce, staccato, etc.). If a composer writes a large action cue, and no woodwinds are used, the orchestrator will often add woodwinds by doubling the brass music up an octave. The orchestra size is determined from the music budget of the film.

The orchestrator is told in advance the number of instruments he or she has to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a [[Romantic music era]]-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget [[independent film]] may only be able to afford a 20 performer [[chamber orchestra]] or a [[jazz quartet]]. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically extracted, printed, and delivered to the scoring stage.

The major film composers in Hollywood each have a lead orchestrator. Generally the lead orchestrator attempts to orchestrate as much of the music as possible if time allows. If the schedule is too demanding, a team of orchestrators (ranging from two to eight) will work on a film. The lead orchestrator decides on the assignment of cues to other orchestrators on the team. Most films can be orchestrated in one to two weeks with a team of five orchestrators. New orchestrators trying to obtain work will often approach a film composer asking to be hired. They are generally referred to the lead orchestrator for consideration. At the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer in the recording booth giving suggestions on how to improve the performance, the music, or the recording. If the composer is conducting, sometimes the orchestrator will remain in the recording booth to assist as a producer. Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator [[conducting]] and the composer producing from the booth.

A '''production company''', '''production house''', '''production studio''', or a '''production team''' provides the physical basis for works in the realms of the [[performing arts]], [[new media art]], [[film]], [[television show|television]], [[radio]], [[comics]], [[interactive art]]s, [[video game]]s, [[website]]s, and [[video]]. Production teams are a group of technical staff who produce the media, generally the term refers to all individuals responsible for the technical aspects of creating of a particular product, regardless of where in the process their expertise is required, or how long they are involved in the project.  For example, in a theatrical performance, the production team includes not only the [[running crew]], but also the [[theatrical producer]], [[designer]]s and [[theatre direction]].

== Tasks and functions ==
The production company may be directly responsible for fundraising for the production or may accomplish this through a [[parent company]], partner, or private investor. It handles budgeting, scheduling, scripting, the [[Casting (performing arts)|supply with talent and resources]], the organization of staff, the production itself, [[post-production]], distribution, and [[marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://production-companies.net/what-is-a-production-company/ |title=What is a Production Company and Why Do I Need One?|publisher=Production-Companes.net |accessdate =26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production companies are often either owned or under contract with a [[media conglomerate]], [[film studio]], [[entertainment]] [[company]], or Motion Picture Company, who act as the ''production company'''s partner or [[parent company]]. This has become known as the "studio system". Independent studios usually prefer ''production house'' (see [[Lionsgate]]), and sometimes as a ''production studio'' or ''production team'' (see [[Amazon Studios]] or [[Rooster Teeth]]). In the case of television, a production company would serve under a [[television network]]. Production companies can work together in [[co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]]s. In music, the term production team typically refers to a group of individuals filling the role of "[[record producer]]" usually reserved for one individual. Some examples of musical production teams include [[Matmos]] and [[D-Influence]]

== Type ==
Entertainment companies operate as mini [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], operating many divisions or subsidiaries in many different industries. [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]] and [[Lionsgate Entertainment]] are two companies with this corporate structure. It allows for a single company to maintain control over seemingly unrelated companies that fall within the ranges of entertainment, which increases and centralises the revenue into one company (example: a film production company, TV production company, video game company, and comic book company are all owned by a single entertainment company). A motion picture company, such as [[Paramount Pictures]], specializing "only" in motion pictures is only connected with its other counterpart industries through its parent company. Instead of performing a corporate reorganization, many motion picture companies often have sister companies they collaborate with in other industries that are subsidiaries owned by their parent company and is often not involved in the making of products that are not motion picture related. [http://www.spcinecorp.com A film production company] can either operate as an affiliate (under a contract) or as a subsidiary for an entertainment company, motion picture company, television network, or all, and are generally smaller than the company they are partnered with.

===Book to film unit===
A book to film unit is a unit of a book publishing company for the purposes of getting books that they published [[Film adaptation|adapted into film]].

====Background====
Films have been using books as a prime source for films for years. In 2012, six out of the nine best picture Oscar nominees were originally books. Previously, publishers did not develop their books into movie nor receive any of the profits. Neither Scholastic or Little Brown, get any box office revenue from the [[Harry Potter]] and [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]] movies just through book sales. As the publishers faced decreasing revenue due to increased competition from self-published e-books, or [[Amazon.com]] moving into the publishing field, publishers have started to enter the film and TV production business to boost their net income&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Andy|title=How Publishers Bolster Their Bottom Line by Retaining Film Rights|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lay-the-favorite-bruce-willis-twilight-harry-potter-book-rights-294627|accessdate=February 27, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Amazon attempting to compete there too.

====History====
Publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] has been owned by media companies lately by [[CBS Corporation]] while the publisher is not involved with film and TV, S&amp;S shares with CBS for possible film or TV deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trachtenberg|first=Jeffrey A.|title=Publisher Makes TV Play |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323455104579017242094248698 |accessdate=February 27, 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alloy Entertainment]] while not a unit of a publisher started using a book packaging to film model of film and TV development by developing the property in-house, hire authors for the books and films, so as to own the property. Random House was the first big six book publisher to establish a book to film unit, [[Random House Studio|Random House Films]], in 2005 with a [[Focus Features]] deal under a development and co-finance plan.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

[[Thomas Dunne Books#Macmillan Entertainment|Macmillan Films]] was launched by [[Thomas Dunne Books]] in October 2010 under the packaging model similar to Alloy while also moving to get film rights from Dunne's published author.&lt;ref name=dl0&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|title=Macmillan Publishers Starts Film/TV Unit| url= http://www.deadline.com/2010/10/macmillan-starts-filmtv-division-to-produce-book-based-fare/ |accessdate=February 11, 2014|newspaper=Deadline|date=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Random House changed their strategy to film development and packaging only.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

==Operation and profit==
A production company is usually run by a producer or director, but can also be run by a career executive. In entertainment, a production company relies highly on [[celebrity|talent]] or a well known entertainment franchise to raise the value of an entertainment project and draw out larger audiences. This gives the [[entertainment industry]] a democratized power structure to ensure that both the companies and talent receive their fair share of pay and recognition for work done on a production. The entertainment industry is centered on funding (studio investments, private investments, or self investments either from earnings from previous productions or personal wealth), projects (scripts and entertainment franchises), and talent ([[actor]]s, directors, [[screenwriters]], and crew). Production companies are judged and ranked based on the amount of funding it has, as well the productions it has completed or been involved with in the past. If a production company has major funding either through earnings, studio investors, or private investors, and has done or been involved with big budget productions in the past, it is considered to be a major production company. These companies often work with well-known and expensive talent. If a production company does not have much funding and has not done or been involved with any big budget productions, it is considered to be a small production company. These companies often work with up and coming talent. Small production companies will either grow to become a major production company, a [[subsidiary]] completely owned by another company, or remain small. The success of an entertainment production company is centered on the projects it produces, the talent it can acquire, and the performance of the talent. [[Marketing]] is also a major factor. All films, as a tradition, are often marketed around the image and the performance of the actors; with an option of marketing the behind the scenes crew such as the directors and screenwriters. Unlike many other businesses, a production company does not rely on an ongoing [[revenue stream]], they operate on ongoing investments; this often requires a parent company or a private corporate investment entity (see [[Legendary Pictures]]). Their only source of profit comes from the productions they produce. Because entertainment and media are currently in "high demand", a production company can profit if its [[management]] is capable of using its resources to supply good quality products and services to the public. Many entertainment production companies [[brand]] their entertainment projects. An entertainment project can either become a "one time hit" or an ongoing "entertainment [[Media franchise|franchise]]" that can be continued, remade, [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed, or expanded into other sister industries; such as the video game industry (see ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]''). Entertainment projects can be either an original or an adaptation from another industry.

In rare occasional cases, a few troubled major studios would also shed their distribution and/or marketing staffs, mainly due to reduced resources, and resort to co-investing and/or co-distributing film projects with larger studios, operating as virtual, production-only movie studios. Notable examples include legendary studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which, after many years of box office flops (mostly with low budgets), bad management and distribution, and bankruptcy, was restructured at the end of 2010 under new management and currently struck deals with some of the Big Six studios (most notably the [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group]] and [[Warner Bros.]]); [[Miramax]], which was downsized by former owner [[Disney]] into a smaller division after the Weinstein brothers' 2005 divestment and, after 17 years under Disney ownership, was sold to a group of investors at the end of 2010 who eventually struck deals to co-finance the studio's projects with other independent companies; and [[DreamWorks Pictures]], the independently-run live action studio, which currently releases many projects through [[Universal Pictures]] and formerly released their projects through Disney after spinning off from [[Paramount Pictures]] (which purchased the studio in 2006 and stripped it of its independent distributor status) in 2008.

==Staffing, funds, and equipment==
Because a production company is only operational when a production is being produced and most of the talent and crew are [[freelance]]rs, many production companies are only required to hire [[management]] staff that helps to oversee the company's daily activities. In some cases, a production company can be run by only a handful of people. The company's funds are mainly committed towards employing talent, crew, and acquiring new updated production equipment on a regular basis. Many productions often require at least one to two cameras and lighting equipment for on location shooting. Production equipment is either leased or purchased from another production company or directly from the manufacturer. In the entertainment industry, in order to secure experienced professional talent and crew, production companies often become a signatory company to that talent or crew members "guild". By becoming a signatory company, it agrees to abide by the guild regulations. All big budget guild productions are exclusive to guild members and non guild members are not allowed to participate in these productions unless authorized by the guild.  Productions with smaller budgets are allowed to use both guild talent and talent from the public. The majority of the talent and crew working in the entertainment industry are members of their professions guild. Most productions in the entertainment industry are guild productions.

==Production==
A production company is responsible for the development and filming of a specific production or media broadcast. In entertainment, the production process begins with the development of a specific project. Once a final script has been produced by the screenwriters, the production enters into the [[pre-production]] phase, most productions never reach this phase for financing or talent reasons. In pre-production, the actors are signed on and prepared for their roles, crew is signed on, shooting locations are found, sets are built or acquired, and the proper shooting permits are acquired for on location shooting. Actors and crew are hand picked by the producer, director, and casting director, who often use collaborators or referenced personnel to prevent untrusted or unwelcomed people from gaining access to a specific production and compromising the entire production through leaks. Once a production enters into principal photography, it begins filming. Productions are almost never cancelled once they reach this phase. Codenames are often used on bigger productions during filming to conceal the production's shooting locations for both privacy and safety reasons. In many cases, the director, producers, and the leading actors are often the only people with access to a full or majority of a single script. Supporting actors, background actors, and crew often never receive a full copy of a specific script to prevent leaks. Productions are often shot in secured studios, with limited to no public access, but they are also shot on location on secured sets or locations. Due to the exposure, when shooting in public locations, major productions often employ security to ensure the protection of the talent and crew working on a specific production. After filming is completed, the production enters into post production, which is handled by a post production company and overseen by the production company. The editing, musical score, visual effects, re-recording of the dialog, and sound effects are "mixed" to create the final film, which is then screened at the final screening. Marketing is also launched during this phase, such as the release of trailers and posters. Once a final film has been approved, the film is taken over by the distributors, who then release the film.

==Other details==
For legal reasons, it is common within the entertainment industry for production companies not to accept unsolicited materials from any other company, talent, or the general public. It is also common for [[filmmaking|filmmakers]] or producers to become [[entrepreneur]]s and open their own production companies so that they can have more control over their careers and pay, while acting as an "in-house" creative and business driving force for their company but continuing to freelance as an artist for other companies, if desired.

==Deals==
* '''Overall deal''' where a distributor has the rights to all the output of a production company.&lt;ref name=escape&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmescape.com/whats-the-difference-between-an-overall-deal-and-a-first-look-deal |title=What’s the Difference Between an Overall Deal and a First Look Deal? |date=October 31, 2015 |accessdate=2017-09-20 |quote= |publisher=Filmescape.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[First look deal]] where a network has the right of refusal to all the output of a production company, after which the production company is free to shop the project to other distributors.&lt;ref name=escape/&gt;

tribal painting is a style of wall [[mural painting]]s associated with the [[Sauda people|Sauda tribals]] of the [[Odisha|state of Odisha]] in [[India]].

== The Saura tribe ==
[[File:Saura Lady.JPG|thumb|A Saura woman]]

Sauras are among the most ancient of [[Tribes of India|tribes in India]] and find mention in the [[Hindu epic]]s of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. Savari, [[Lord Rama|Rama’s]] devotee in the Ramayana and Jara, the hunter who mortally wounded [[Lord Krishna|Krishna]] with an arrow, are thought to have been members of this tribe. Jara’s body is believed to have flowed into the sea near [[Puri]] as a wooden log and the idol [[Jagannath]] at [[Puri Jagannadh|Puri]] is believed to have been sculpted from it.&lt;ref name="orissa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=C B|title=The Sauras and Their Panoramic Paintings|journal=Orissa Review|date=January 2005|page=53|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jan2005/englishPdf/Souras_Paintings.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saura paintings are an integral part of the religious ceremonies of the Saura tribals and are found in the southern Odisha districts of [[Rayagada district|Rayagada]], [[Ganjam district|Ganjam]], [[Gajapati district|Gajapati]] and [[Koraput district|Koraput]].&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting workshop for school dropouts|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/painting-workshop-for-school-dropouts/article1166748.ece?textsize=large&amp;test=1|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saura paintings were first studied by the famous anthropologist [[Verrier Elwin]].&lt;ref name="orissa" /&gt;

== Paintings ==
The Saura [[wall painting]]s are called ''italons'' or ''ikons'' (or ''ekons'') and are dedicated to [[Idital]] (also ''edital'') the main deity of the Sauras. These paintings draw upon tribal folklore and have ritualistic importance. Ikons make extensive use of symbolically pregnant icons that mirror the quotidian chores of the Sauras. People, [[horses]], [[elephants]], the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] and the [[tree of life]] are recurring [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] in these ikons. Ikons were originally painted on the walls of the Saura's adobe huts. The paintings' backdrop is prepared from red or [[yellow ochre]] earth which is then painted over using brushes fashioned from tender [[Bamboo Shoots|bamboo shoots]]. Ekons use natural dyes and chromes derived from ground white stone, hued earth, and [[vermilion]] and mixtures of [[tamarind]] seed, flower and leaf extracts.&lt;ref name="deccanherald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeless images|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/191569/timeless-images.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikons are worshipped during special religious and cultural occasions such as child-birth, harvest, marriage and the construction of a new house. Ikons are not commissioned frequently and an existing one can be regularly used for mundane rituals. The building of a new dwelling however necessitates the commissioning of an ekon, which is painted in a dark corner inside the home where its creation is accompanied by the recital of a specific set of prayers. Traditionally, Kudangs, the priestly class among the Sauras, painted the ikons since they also had the expertise to explain the symbolic import of the images contained therein to the villagers. Thus the ikons also became a part of the aural tradition of the Sauras that linked them to their traditions and customs. Today the Kudangs have been supplanted by artists and paintings are often executed in non-traditional locales.&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deccanherald" /&gt;

== Comparison with Warli paintings ==
[[File:A Warli painting by Jivya Soma Mashe, Thane district.jpg|thumb|200px|Warli painting from [[Thane district]]]]

Saura paintings have a striking visual semblance to [[Warli painting|Warli art]] and both use clear geometric frames for their construction but they differ in both their style and treatment of subjects. In Saura paintings, a fish-net approach - of painting from the border inwards - is used while this not the case with Warli paintings.&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt; Although both are examples of tribal [[pictograph]]s that employ [[stick figures]], Warli paintings use conjoint triangles to depict the human body while the figures are not as sharply delineated in Saura paintings. Also, unlike the Warli paintings where male and female icons are clearly distinguishable, in Saura art there is no such physical differentiation.&lt;ref name="deccanherald" /&gt;

== Saura paintings today ==
[[File:Idital Wall Painting.jpg|thumb|200px|Idital-Soura Painting]]
Their diversity, detail and unique style have given ikons an 'in-vogue-appeal' and increasing popularity in recent years. The influence of markets and increasing awareness about the other’s forms have led to both Saura and Warli paintings picking up details of technique and style from the other.&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt; They have also been popularised in recent times as an avenue for skill and job creation&lt;ref name="thehindu" /&gt; and have increasingly been used to decorate items like T-shirts, greeting cards, stationery and items of clothing.&lt;ref name="thehindu_a" /&gt;

The '''Societaetstheater''' is the oldest popular theatre in [[Dresden]], Germany. Founded in 1776 as an amateur theatre by a society of friends from both the nobility and the middle class, it was initially respected and influential but declined in the early 19th century after the fashion shifted to elaborate historical and verse dramas and the national theatre movement grew in importance, and was eventually dissolved in 1832. The [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] building on Hauptstraße in the [[Innere Neustadt (Dresden)|Innere Neustadt]] was abandoned for many years in the second half of the 20th century, but beginning in 1979, a movement grew to restore it. The theatre reopened in 1999 and is now operated by the city.

==History==
===Foundation and heyday===
[[File:Societaetstheater Dresden Schlussstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Keystone over the theatre entrance, by Jürgen Mehlhorn, 1979]]
After the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, the theatrical landscape in Dresden shifted, with French actors being replaced by German, "partly to save money, partly out of patriotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iffland |first=August Wilhelm |editor-last=Košenina |editor-first=Alexander |title=Beiträge zur Schauspielkunst: Briefe über die Schauspielkunst; Fragmente über Menschendarstellung auf den deutschen Bühnen |series=Theatertexte |volume=20 |location=Hanover |publisher=Wehrhahn |year=2009 |isbn=9783865251213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=WoOgU_6CKIXooATeg4CYCg&amp;id=FbAsAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Iffland%2C+theils+aus+Oekonomie%2C+theils+aus+Patriotismus&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=theils+aus+Oekonomie%2C+theils+aus+Patriotismus |page=33 |quotation=theils aus Oekonomie, theils aus Patriotismus }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Reformed" theatre groups such as that of [[Abel Seyler]] gained in respect against the court theatre, which was felt to be too focussed on spectacle, and the educated middle class began to emulate the amateur theatre of the aristocracy. 

On 19 May 1776, a group of fifteen friends founded a society for the purpose of creating a private theatre in their leisure time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vom Societäts-Theater in Dresden |work=Theater-Kalender auf das Jahr 1785 |location=Gotha |year=1785 |pages=83&amp;ndash;84 |quotation=[eine] Gesellschaft längst verbundner Freunde, [die] bey gleichem Geschmacke an Kunst, und bey ähnlichen Trieben zur geselligen Freude&amp;nbsp;... mit vereinten Kräften an [der] Errichtung einer Privatbühne arbeiteten. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hübler |first=Jan |title=Dresden: 66 Lieblingsplätze und 11 Erlebnistouren |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRBzSQo8w30C&amp;pg=PA91 |year=2012 |location=Meßkirch |publisher=Gmeiner |language=German |isbn=3-8392-3891-9 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gruber |first=Eckhard |contribution=Sittlicher Bürger Abendschule.

In 1777, with the assistance of the publisher Conrad Georg Walter, the theatre moved to a larger building in Borngasse (near the current location of the [[German Hygiene Museum]]), but after Walter's death the following year, it moved again on 7 December 1779 to its current home, a garden building in the courtyard behind the residence of the government secretary Johann Christoph Hoffmann at Hauptstraße 19.&lt;ref name=Neustadt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dresden-neustadt.de/archiv/themen/societaetstheater/inhalt.htm |title=Junges Theater mit alter Tradition |publisher=Dresden Neustadt Online |date=26 March 2004 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had been built in 1740 in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, intended for masquerades, but never used.

The design for the curtain in 1779 was by [[Johann Eleazar Zeissig]], known as Schenau, a director of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]; it depicted, amongst genii and garlands of roses, scenes from Greek mythology, such as [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]], the [[muse]] of comedy, showing a youth the way to the temple of virtue while a [[maenad|bacchante]] tried to draw him towards the temple of lust.&lt;ref name=86f/&gt;

The society of friends of the theatre grew to fifty members, and by the end of the 18th century to more than 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gruber |first=Eckhard |title=Der Mensch hascht unaufhörlich nach Vergnügen. Zur Geschichte des Societätstheaters und anderer 'Bühnen im Taschenformat' |location=Berlin |publisher=Alexander |year=1998 |oclc=40371593 |page=97 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; They belonged to both the nobility and the middle class and agreed to a 25-article constitution which included equality of members. Decisions and assignment of positions were voted on; five board members, a secretary and a cashier were elected, whose duties included determining the list of plays and assignment of roles.

The constitution divided the society's membership into active and passive members.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The active members were overwhelmingly attached to the court of Saxony. For example, the privy advisor of the privy council, [[Hans Ernst von Teubern]], translated scripts into German. The poet [[August Gottlieb Meißner]] used his influence within the society to secure performances of works by his friend [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Other members wrote plays themselves or, like the painter [[Ernst Ferdinand Oehme]] in the 19th century, performed on stage. Altogether between 20 and 30 of the members were active as performers, leading to frequent doubling of roles.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The passive members included aristocratic patrons who funded needs such as costumes or the upkeep of the theatre. Such benefactors included Prince [[Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland|Charles of Saxony]], Count [[Alois Friedrich von Brühl]] and Count [[Hans Moritz von Brühl]].

Productions took place mainly in the winter season, between September and early May.&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"/&gt; Like almost all other theatres, the Societaetstheater closed for [[Lent]]. However, performances also took place on Fridays and Sundays, which out of respect for religion were avoided by public theatres in Dresden until the early 19th century. Performances of the Societaetstheater were usually restricted to members' family, friends and acquaintances;&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"/&gt; a 1792 announcement speaks of each member receiving three tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Dresdner Merkwürdigkeiten gemeinnützigen Inhalts |volume=VIII |date=24 February 1792 |page=61 |quotation=Jedes Mitglied erhält drei Billets, die es an seine Freunde und Bekannte vertheilen kann. Blos mittels eines solchen Billets kann man den theatralischen Vorstellungen dieser Gesellschaft beiwohnen. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsiders were admitted only in exceptional cases and after presenting a [[Visiting card|calling card]].

Nonetheless, the theatre soon acquired a reputation extending outside Saxony. Productions were reported on in theatrical publications alongside those of the established court theatres and tours by well known companies. The persistence of the theatre was remarked on, since similar associations were at the time usually short-lived. It became a model which was emulated in various cities. In Dresden itself, where there were also two public theatres, a summer theatre, and touring productions, a second theatrical association, the Freundschaftliche Theater, was founded in 1787; since some of the members belonged to both, this was combined with the Societaetstheater in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1802, there were a total of twelve other theatres in Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bericht aus Dresden vom 15.5.1802 |newspaper=Journal des Luxus und der Moden |date=July 1802 |page=403 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing===
The Societaetstheater was originally entirely amateur. There is no record of any appearances by actors from public theatres until 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century this began to change, as upcoming actors increasingly discovered the theatre as a place to hone their talent. Actresses including Demoiselle Hartmann, the Weinhold sisters and [[Luise Wagner]], sister of [[Richard Wagner]], used the theatre to make the transition to professional careers. The years around 1800 also saw a generational shift from the founders to their successors, who chose the stage as their profession while retaining close ties to the Societaetstheater, where they had begun theur association with the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bourgeois drawing-room dramas which dominated the repertoires of theatres of all sizes at the beginning of the 19th century made few demands in casting, time, settings or props. However, the general movement towards grand historical dramas, such as those by [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]], with their demanding costumes, complex verse which was difficult to memorise and to recite, and large casts, once more opened a gulf between professional and amateur drama. Dilettantism had a negative connotation; Goethe and Schiller themselves collaborated in the summer of 1799 on a compilation with that as its theme, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Über den Dilettantismus|de}}''. The Societaetstheater produced simple dramas and comedies, some slapstick; no production of Goethe or Schiller there is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's reputation waned, and as the national theatre movement gained in importance, it was excluded from the mainstream. Many of the upper middle class regarded amateur theatre as at best a "harmless pleasure" with no particular moral or aesthetic merit.&lt;ref name=Neustadt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=Reinhard |contribution=Limitierte Aufklärung.

===Reopening===
[[File:Theater alt.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Theatre building before restoration]]

In 1837 a building was erected beside the theatre, covering almost half the façade.&lt;ref name=Magirius&gt;{{cite book |last=Magirius |first=Heinrich |contribution=Zur Bau- und Kunstgeschichte des Societätstheaters in Dresden-Neustadt |editor-last=Gruber |editor-first=Eckhard |work=Der Mensch hascht unaufhörlich nach Vergnügen |year=1998 |page=222 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second storey and more windows were added to the building itself, and beginning in the second half of the 19th century, it was used as a residence. In the early 20th century, small handwork businesses moved into what had been the foyer; traces of metalworking remain.&lt;ref name=Magirius/&gt; The premises were also reportedly used by a photographic studio and by the post office.
[[File:Knöfflers Pavillon.JPG|thumb|Pavilion in Baroque garden]]
The building was not destroyed in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden on 13 February 1945]], but fell into increasing disrepair after the war. In the 1950s and 60s, urgently needed repairs were not made, and from the 1970s on, the building was abandoned. Despite the renovation of the Hauptstraße beginning in 1978, the intention was to gut and demolish the building.&lt;ref name=Weg&gt;{{cite book |last=Gruber |first=Eckhard |contribution='Der Weg entsteht beim Gehen'. Ein Bericht über die Geschichte und Ziele des Societätstheater-Vereins |title=Der Mensch hascht unaufhörlich nach Vergnügen |year=1998 |page=235 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect Jürgen Mehlhorn, who had become interested in the building while still a student and was now using it to store material for the reconstruction of other buildings on the street, in 1979 designed a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] for the main entrance at Hauptstraße 19 depicting two theatrical masks and with the inscription "Societaetstheater 1715 1779 1979".&lt;ref name=Weg/&gt; The association "Interessengemeinschaft Societaetstheater" was then founded; in 1992 this became "Societaetstheater e.V." The association worked to preserve the building and raised money for urgent repairs such as roof work and provisional safety measures. In 1985, the building became a registered landmark of the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998). "'Der Weg entsteht beim Gehen'". p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; More extensive repairs were made in 1989. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, [[Dresdner Bank]] sponsored the building's restoration. The Dresden city council decided in October 1994 that the theatre would be operated by the city once restored, and work began in 1996.

The building was restored based on its original state, with the addition of an annexe containing a cellar theatre, a restaurant and five guest rooms. The adjoining Baroque garden, which had belonged to the sculptor Johann Benjamin Thomae amongst others, was also restored, and a restored pavilion by Thomae placed in the centre. The theatre had its ceremonial reopening on 19 February 1999.

==Current uses==
The Societaetstheater today is a modern chamber theatre,&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"/&gt; accommodating spoken word, dance, music and puppet performances. Resident productions evolve by a workshop process harking back to the theatre's origins.&lt;ref name=Neustadt/&gt; Independent performers from the region as well as guest performers from Germany and other countries have appeared there. In addition to the main theatre and the cellar stage, performances may take place in the foyer and in the garden. It has served as one of the venues for the [[Jazztage Dresden]] festival.

The '''Society of Animal Artists''' is an international organization for [[artist]]s who paint, sculpt, or draw animals and wildlife, founded in 1960.

The Society of Animal Artists, Inc. (SAA) is "devoted to promoting excellence in the portrayal of the creatures sharing our planet, and to the education of the public through its informative [[art]] seminars, lectures and teaching demonstrations. Some of the finest animal artists from the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, Japan, and Australia are represented in the Society's membership." &lt;ref name="object of society"&gt;[http://www.societyofanimalartists.com/info.html Society of Animal Artists Official Website: Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society holds an annual exhibition, "Art &amp; the Animal", which premieres at museum venues. &lt;ref name="society exhibition"&gt;[http://uknow.uky.edu/content/art-and-animal-captures-uk-art-museum-spotlight Article: 'Art and the Animal' Captures UK Art Museum Spotlight]&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the exhibition is shown on tour around the United States.  [http://www.davidjwagnerllc.com/ Dr. David J. Wagner] is the current Tour Director and Curator for the Society of Animal Artists.  The Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 with their exhibition at the San Diego Natural History Museum in San Diego, CA. A complete history of the SAA's exhibition can be found on their website.

The Society of Animal Artists is recognized as a 501(c)3 charitable organization by the I.R.S. and all contributions to the Society are tax-deductible''

==Introduction==
The Society of Animal Artists is an organization of artists who produce the best animal art in the world. The mission of the Society of Animal Artists is to promote excellence in the portrayal of domesticated and wild animals in art. The upshot of this nexus of talent and mission, is that artworks created by members of the Society of Animal Artists have established new standards of excellence in fine art, and that the Annual Exhibition of the Society of Animal Artists and its traveling exhibition, Art and the Animal, have become the standard by which all others are measured. The Society of Animal Artists has an historical affinity with organizations that grew out of a movement to form associations and clubs dedicated to art in the 19th century. Like the National Academy of Design and other such organizations, the Society of Animal Artists is mandated by its bylaws to organize annual exhibitions to ensure new, strong and fresh artwork and afford its members with ample display opportunities. It is also worth noting that the Society of Animal Artists was founded in response to an exhibition entitled Animals in the Bronx Zoo, held at Burr Galleries in New York, because this established an historical affinity with the conservation movement, which various members have supported ever since, not only through the ecological message of their artwork but also through generous contributions and sales.

==History==

===Founding and early years===
In the 1950s, individuals from the New York metropolitan area who liked to meet and paint at the Bronx Zoo &lt;ref&gt;Bronx Zoo https://bronxzoo.com/&lt;/ref&gt; together staged "Animals in the Bronx Zoo" at the Burr Gallery sponsored by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;New York Zoological Society https://www.wcs.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Allen Bott and Guido Borghi were inspired to form the organization after an enthusiastic reception to this exhibition. The fledgling Society soon became a member of the renowned [[Salmagundi Club]], and established an office in their building at 47 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY. Early Exhibitions were held in various galleries such as Sportsman’s Edge, Grand Central Art Galleries and the Alder Gallery (All in New York City). 
In addition to Bott and Borghi, early members included: Elizabeth Rungius Felda [Sister of Carl Rungius], Paul Bransom, John Clymer, Gifford Cochran, Brenda Frey, Anna Hyatt Huntington, Gertude K. Lathrop, Robert Lougheed, Ugo Mochi, Clement Weisbecker and Walter Wilwerding.

===Catalogs and exhibitions===
The first SAA catalog, produced in 1978 for the exhibition at Sportsman’s Edge Gallery, consisted of 8 pages and was black and white. In 1979, the SAA had its first actual Annual Exhibition opening (again at Sportsman’s Edge), with formal programs and events. A 20 page black and white catalog was produced. In 1980, the "Society of Animal Artists Exhibition/Convention" was hosted by Game Conservation International at the Four Seasons Plaza Nacional Hotel, San Antonio, TX. A 28 page, black and white catalog was produced. The first four-color catalog (44 pages) was produced in 1990, for the 30th Annual Exhibition at St. Hubert’s Giralda, NJ.

The SAA has hosted annual exhibitions since 1960 with the exhibition first being named "Art and the Animal" in 1988. The first museum venue was the Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia in 1981. In 1988 the Society recruited David J. Wagner to create and manage tours of artworks selected from annual exhibitions and to secure hosts for its annual exhibitions. SAA exhibitions have been displayed throughout the United States, with approximately 70% of hosting venues having been art museums or general museums that have included art as an integral dimension of their core mission. Over the years, the SAA’s work has been on display at more than 100 different institutions across the United States—and once in Canada in 1995 at the Old Algonquin Museum, Algonquin Park, Ontario.

'''South Australian Film Corporation''' (SAFC) is a [[South Australia]]n Government statutory corporation that was established in 1972.&lt;ref name="SAFC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.safilm.com.au/about/history/ | title=A Short History of the SAFC | publisher=South Australian Film Corporation | accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}

=== Origin ===
The South Australian Film Corporation was founded as a production company in 1972.&lt;ref name="afci"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afci.org/film-commissions/south-australian-film-corporation | title=South Australian Film Corporation | publisher=Association of Film Commissioners International | accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 it became the first state film corporation established in Australia. The success of its business model led other State Governments to establish similar bodies charged with the promotion of film production and fostering industry development. At the time of the Corporation's establishment, the Australian film industry was stagnating, and the Corporation played a significant role in the revival of Australian film making. Former State Premier [[Don Dunstan]] played an instrumental role in the foundation of the Corporation and its early film production activities.&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1980 p17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation ===
From its genesis, the SAFC collaborated with various government departments and agencies in the production of short documentaries and educational films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mirror, mirror .. girls [videorecording]. - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37803572|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included co-productions with the South Australian Department of Agriculture and Fisheries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Food from the reluctant Earth - Details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11937022|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soil erosion [videorecording] / [presented by] The South Australian government [and] The South Australian Dept. of Agriculture. - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15434924|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Department of Marine &amp; Harbors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Port of Adelaide - Details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21778183|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Education Department,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parent involvement in schools : Education Department of South Australia.

[videorecording] / - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17322594|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

In the 1980s, the SAFC shifted its focus to television production. It relocated to a disused Philips factory in [[Hendon, South Australia#History|Hendon]] in the north-west suburbs of [[Adelaide]]. [[Jock Bair]] was head of drama.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Hawker, "Going South: the Adelaide Connection", ''Cinema Papers'' January 1987 p21- 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;Albert Moran, ''Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series'', AFTRS 1993 p 548-550&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1994, the Corporation was involved in the production of films and television programs. The television mini-series ''[[The Battlers (TV series)|The Battlers]]'' was the last production produced by the SAFC. Since then, it has focused on supporting the production of films and television in South Australia, including providing funding and support, as well as making production and post-production facilities available.

Since 1994, the role of the Corporation has changed to that of a production facilitator, so that it no longer engages in the production process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.safilm.com.au/Content.aspx?p=208|title =A Short History of the SAFC|date =|accessdate =22 May 2015|website =www.safilm.com.au/|publisher =|last =|first =|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150818062117/http://www.safilm.com.au/Content.aspx?p=208|archive-date =18 August 2015|deadurl =yes|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It facilitated the production of the [[Nine Network]] program ''[[McLeod's Daughters]]'' (2001-2009), which was filmed on location in rural South Australia.

In 2017, the Corporation announced that a new TV Series "Soccer Swap" was a co-production with Australia's [[57 Films]] and China’s [[Qingdao TV Tower|Qingdao TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/soccer-swap-series-australia-china-co-production-1202421907/|title=‘Soccer Swap’ Series set as Australia-China Co-Production|last=Frater|first=Patrick|date=2017-05-10|work=Variety|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relocation ===
In 2008, SA Premier and Arts Minister [[Mike Rann]] secured cabinet approval to fund the relocation of the SAFC, at a cost of A$43 million. The project included new sound stages and mixing suites, as well as a major refurbishment of a historic 19th century building as a high-tech film hub.

It moved its headquarters to [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]], in the eastern suburbs, having taken over buildings previously occupied by a mental hospital. Its new Adelaide Studios have been the recipient of major funding from the South Australian Government. The new Adelaide Studios were opened by Premier Mike Rann on 20 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Protesters mar Mike Rann's last engagement as Premier, The Advertiser, 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the Corporation continues to operate post-production facilities which have been used for a broad range of productions.

==Influence on Australian film making==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The Corporation's activities contributed to the rebuilding process undertaken by Australia's film industry. Besides its productions that had critical and commercial success, the Corporation's productions helped to launch the careers of many artists, including [[Peter Weir]], [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Scott Hicks]], [[Rolf de Heer]], [[Mario Andreacchio]], [[Bryan Brown]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Bruce Beresford]].

"'''The Blessed Damozel'''" is perhaps the best known poem by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] as well as the title of some of his best known paintings. The poem was first published in 1850 in the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] journal ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]''. Rossetti subsequently revised the poem twice and republished it in 1856, 1870 and 1873. &lt;ref name="Rarchive"&gt;{{cite web

  | year =2005 | url =http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s244.rap.html
  | doi = | accessdate =February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was partially inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem "[[The Raven]]",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/VICTORIAN/topic_3/damozel.htm The Painterly Image in Poetry]." ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Victorian Age''. 2009. Norton and Company. 3 Jun 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with its depiction of a lover grieving on Earth over the death of his loved one. Rossetti chose to represent the situation in reverse. The poem describes the [[wiktionary:damsel|damozel]] observing her lover from heaven, and her unfulfilled yearning for their reunion in heaven. 

The poem also was the inspiration for [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Damoiselle élue]]'' (1888), a cantata for two soloists, female choir, and orchestra.

The first four stanzas of the poem are inscribed on the frame of the painting.

{{quote|
The blessed damozel leaned out &lt;br&gt;
From the gold bar of Heaven; &lt;br&gt;
Her eyes were deeper than the depth &lt;br&gt;
Of waters stilled at even; &lt;br&gt;
She had three lilies in her hand, &lt;br&gt;
And the stars in her hair were seven. 

Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem, &lt;br&gt;
No wrought flowers did adorn, &lt;br&gt;
But a white rose of Mary's gift, &lt;br&gt;
For service meetly worn;  &lt;br&gt;
Her hair that lay along her back &lt;br&gt;
Was yellow like ripe corn. 

Herseemed she scarce had been a day &lt;br&gt;
One of God's choristers; &lt;br&gt;
The wonder was not yet quite gone &lt;br&gt;
From that still look of hers; &lt;br&gt;
Albeit, to them she left, her day &lt;br&gt;
Had counted as ten years. 

(To one, it is ten years of years. &lt;br&gt;. . . Yet now, and in this place, &lt;br&gt;Surely she leaned o'er me—her hair &lt;br&gt;Fell all about my face. . . . &lt;br&gt; Nothing: the autumn fall of leaves. &lt;br&gt;The whole year sets apace.)&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt;}}

''The Blessed Damozel'' is the only one of Rossetti's paired pictures and poems in which the poem was completed first. Friends and patrons repeatedly urged Rossetti to illustrate his most famous poem,&lt;ref name="Treuherz100"&gt;Treuherz et al. (2003), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and he finally accepted a commission from William Graham in February 1871. After the work was completed Graham requested a [[predella]], the lower part of the painting, on December 31, 1877.  His total cost was £1157.  [[Alexa Wilding]] modelled the damozel in Paradise, Wilfred John Hawtrey modelled the child–angel, and the probable model for the left–hand angel was [[May Morris]].
Another, later version is in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]].

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

[[Frederick Richards Leyland]] commissioned eighteen paintings from Rossetti, not counting unfulfilled commissions.  Soon after Leyland acquired his first Rossetti painting, he and Rossetti explored the idea of a Rossetti [[triptych]], which was eventually formed with ''[[Mnemosyne (Rossetti)|Mnemosyne]]'', an 1879 replica of ''The Blessed Damozel'' painted by Rossetti himself, and ''Proserpine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional Rossetti paintings were then hung in Leyland's drawing room, all of which Leyland called "stunners."&lt;ref name=figure&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 26 (figure 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Several pieces of music were based on the poem, including those for orchestra by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Granville Bantock]] (1891), [[Edgar Bainton]] (1907), [[Ernest Farrar]] (1907); for piano by [[Arnold Bax]] (1906); for string quartet by [[Benjamin Burrows]] (1927); and a 1928 choral by [[Julius Harrison]].  A 2007 modern popular song of the same name by [[Tangerine Dream]] appears on their album ''[[Madcap's Flaming Duty]]''.

'''''The Harvesters''''' is an [[oil painting|oil]] painting on wood completed by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in 1565. It depicts the harvest time which most commonly occurred within the months of August and September. [[Nicolaes Jonghelinck]], a merchant banker and art collector from Antwerp, commissioned this painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Painting==
The painting is one in a series of six works, five of which are still extant, that depict different times of the year. As in many of his paintings, the focus is on peasants and their work. Notably, some of the peasants are shown eating while others are harvesting wheat, a diachronic (relating to phenomena such as ideas, language, or culture, as they occur or change over a period of time) depiction of both the production and consumption of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07w9jg5|title=The Harvesters by Pieter Bruegel the Elder|last=BBC Radio 4|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pears can be seen on the white cloth in front of the upright sitting woman who eats bread and cheese while a figure in the tree to the far right picks pears. The painting shows a large number of activities representative of the 16th-century Belgian rural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripimprover.com/blog/the-harvesters-by-pieter-bruegel-the-elder|title=A discussion of The Harvesters by Pieter Bruegel the Elder|website=TripImprover - Get more out of your museum visits!|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on the far right a person is shaking apples from the tree. In the center left of the painting, a group of villagers can be seen participating in the [[blood sport]] of [[cock throwing]].&lt;ref name="Brown 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/01/google-art-project-classic-works|title=Google Art Project aims to shed new light on classic works of art|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=2011-02-01|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has been at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] since 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/435809|title=Pieter Bruegel the Elder: The Harvesters|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906193643/http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/435809|archive-date=6 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] calls this painting a “watershed in the history of Western art”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/19.164 |title=Pieter Bruegel the Elder: ''The Harvesters'' (19.164) |date=2014 |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |oclc=49730187 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905081140/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/19.164 |archive-date=2015-09-05 |dead-url=no |quote=Through his remarkable sensitivity to nature’s workings, Bruegel created a watershed in the history of Western art, suppressing the religious and iconographic associations of earlier depictions of the seasons in favor of an un-idealised vision of landscape. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the “first modern landscape”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/metmedia/video/collections/ep/the-harvesters |title=MetMedia: ''The Harvesters'' |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091408/http://www.metmuseum.org/metmedia/video/collections/ep/the-harvesters |archive-date=2015-10-03 |dead-url=no |quote=It’s a landscape that’s really the first modern landscape in Western art.

{{Avicenna sidebar}}
'''''The Incoherence of the Philosophers''''' (تهافت الفلاسفة ''Tahāfut al-Falāsifaʰ'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is the title of a landmark 11th-century work by the Persian theologian [[Al-Ghazali]] and a student of the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] school of [[Islamic theology]] criticizing the [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] school of [[early Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{Citation|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=Avicenna |year=| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=2007-12-30|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-i}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Muslim philosophers|Muslim philosophers]] such as [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) and [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius) are denounced in this book. The belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present Will of God, underlies the work.{{cn|date=June 2016}} The text was dramatically successful, and marked a milestone in the ascendance of the Asharite school within [[Islamic philosophy]] and theological discourse.

The book favors [[faith]] over [[philosophy]] in matters specifically concerning [[metaphysics]] or knowledge of the divine.

==Background==
This book was preceded by a summary of [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophical]] thought titled: [[The Aims of the Philosophers|Aims of the philosophers]] (''[[Maqasid al Falasifa]]''). This book is the summary of [[Avicennism|Avicenna's philosophical doctrine]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] stated that one must be well versed in the ideas of the philosophers before setting out to refute their ideas.

[[Al-Ghazali]] also stated that he did not find other branches of philosophy including physics, logic, astronomy or mathematics problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Al|title=The Incoherence of the Philosophers|year=2000|publisher=Brigham Young UP|isbn=0-8425-2466-5 |pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only dispute was with metaphysics, in which he claimed that the philosophers did not use the same tools, namely logic, which they used for other sciences. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Contents==
The work is organized into 20 chapters in which al-Ghazali attempts to refute Avicenna's doctrines.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

He states that Avicenna and his followers have erred in seventeen points (each one of which he addresses in detail in a chapter, for a total of 17 chapters) by committing heresy. But in three other chapters, he accuses them of being utterly irreligious. Among the charges that he leveled against the philosophers is their inability to prove the existence of God and inability to prove the impossibility of the existence of two gods.

The twenty points are as follows:
#Refuting the doctrine of the world's pre-eternity.
#Refuting the doctrine of the world's post-eternity.
#Showing their equivocation of the following two statements: God is the creator of the world vs. the world is God's creation.
#The inability of philosophers to prove the existence of the Creator. 
#The inability of philosophers to prove the impossibility of the existence of two gods.
#The philosopher's doctrine of denying the existence of God's attributes.
#Refutation of their statement: "the essence of the First is not divisible into genus and species".
#Refutation of their statement: "the First is simple existent without quiddity".
#Their inability to demonstrate that the First is not a body.
#Discussing their materialist doctrine necessitates a denial of the maker. 
#Their inability to show that the First knows others.
#Their inability to show that the First knows Himself.
#Refuting that the First does not know the Particulars.
#Refuting their doctrine that states: "the heavens are an animal that moves on its own volition".
#Refuting what they say regarding the reason that the heavens move.
#Refuting their doctrine that the heavens are souls that know the particulars.
#Refuting their doctrine that disruption of causality is impossible.
#Refuting their statement that the human soul is a self-sustaining substance that is neither a body nor an accident.
#Refuting their assertion of the impossibility of the annihilation of the human soul.
#Refuting their denial of bodily resurrection and the accompanying pleasures of Paradise or the pains of Hellfire.

===Beyond heresy===
Among the twenty points, al-Ghazali called out three which he charges not only constitute heresy, but also disbelief in Islam.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver |title=An Introduction to Classical Islamic Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=em9zwASotOkC|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79757-3|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The theory of a pre-eternal world. Ghazali wrote that God created the world in time and just like everything in this world time will cease to exist as well, but God will continue on existing.
# God only knows the universal characteristics of particulars - namely Platonic forms.
# Bodily resurrection will not take place in the hereafter, only human souls are resurrected.

===Occasionalism===
''The Incoherence of the Philosophers'' propounds the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] theory of [[occasionalism]]. Al-Ghazali wrote that when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned directly by God rather than by the fire, a claim which he defended using [[logic in Islamic philosophy]].

He explained that because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behavior in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) – in other words, his rational will.

===Cosmology and astronomy===
{{see also|Islamic cosmology|Astronomy in medieval Islam}}

Al-Ghazali expresses his support for a [[scientific method]]ology based on [[Scientific demonstration|demonstration]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], while discussing astronomy. After describing the [[solar eclipse]] and the [[lunar eclipse]], he writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Anwar|first=Sabieh|date=October 2008|title=Is Ghazālī really the Halagu of Science in Islam?|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=18|issue=10|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=1016|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Whosoever thinks that to engage in a [[disputation]] for refuting such a theory is a religious duty harms religion and weakens it. For these matters rest on demonstrations, geometrical and arithmetical, that leave no room for doubt.}}

In his defense of the Asharite doctrine of a [[Islamic creationism|created universe]] that is [[Temporal finitism|temporally finite]], against the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine of an eternal universe, Al-Ghazali proposed the [[Modal realism|modal]] theory of [[possible world]]s, arguing that their actual world is the [[best of all possible worlds]] from among all the [[alternate timeline]]s and [[World history|world histories]] that God could have possibly created. His theory parallels that of [[Duns Scotus]] in the 14th century. While it is uncertain whether Al-Ghazali had any influence on Scotus, they both may have derived their theory from their readings of [[Avicenna]]'s ''Metaphysics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Main|The Incoherence of the Incoherence|Hayy ibn Yaqdhan}}

[[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes) wrote a refutation of Al-Ghazali's work entitled ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]'' (''Tahāfut al-Tahāfut'') in which he defends the doctrines of the philosophers and criticizes al-Ghazali's own arguments.  It is written as a sort of dialogue: Averroes quotes passages by al-Ghazali and then responds to them.  This text was not as well received by the wider Islamic audience.{{clarification needed|date=July 2016}} In the 15th century, a refutation of Ibn Rushd’s arguments in ''Tahāfut al-Tahāfut'' was written by a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] scholar [[Mustafā Ibn Yūsuf al-Bursawī]], also known as Khwājah Zādā (d. 1487), who defended al-Ghazali's views. This once again indicated to Islamic scholars the weakness of human understanding and the strength of faith.&lt;ref name=Ahmad&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Jamil|date=September 1994|title=Ibn Rushd|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=4|issue=9|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=744|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another less critical response to Al-Ghazali's arguments was written by Ibn Rushd's predecessor [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer) as part of his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqzan]]'' (later translated into [[Latin]] and [[English language|English]] as ''Philosophus Autodidactus''). Ibn Tufail cites al-Ghazali as an influence on his novel, especially his views on Sufism, but was critical of his views against Avicennism. [[Ibn al-Nafis]] later wrote another novel, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', defending some of al-Ghazali's views.

==Legacy==
Al-Ghazali's insistence on a radical divine [[immanence]] in the natural world has been posited&lt;ref&gt;"Myth 4. That Medieval Islamic Culture was Inhospitable to Science" in Ronald L. Numbers (ed.): ''Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion'', Harvard University Press, 2009, esp. pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the reasons that the spirit of [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] later withered in Islamic lands.  If "Allah's hand is not chained", then there was no point in discovering the alleged laws of nature.  For example:

{{Quote | ...our opponent claims that the agent of the burning is the fire exclusively; this is a natural, not a voluntary agent, and cannot abstain from what is in its nature when it is brought into contact with a receptive substratum. This we deny, saying: The agent of the burning is God, through His creating the black in the cotton and the disconnexion of its parts, and it is God who made the cotton burn and made it ashes either through the intermediation of angels or without intermediation.  For fire is a dead body which has no action, and what is the proof that it is the agent? Indeed, the philosophers have no other proof than the observation of the occurrence of the burning, when there is contact with fire, but observation proves only a simultaneity, not a causation, and, in reality, there is no other cause but God.}}

The Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (a.k.a. ''el-Fatih'') once commissioned two of the realm's scholars to write a book summarizing the ideas of the two great philosophers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Learman|first=Oliver|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Islamic Philosophy|year=2006|publisher=Thoemmes|isbn=1843711486 |pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; as to who won the debate across time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Islam And Scientific Debate: Searching For Legitimacy | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7U2mS6QHVkkC&amp;lpg=PA29 | publisher = Global Vision | first =Sakir | last = Kocabas|authorlink=Islam and Science |location=India|page=29|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trafalgar Square''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|ə|ˈ|f|æ|l|ɡ|ər}} {{respell|trə|FAL|gər}}) is a [[public square]] in the [[City of Westminster]], [[Central London]], built around the area formerly known as [[Charing Cross]]. Its name commemorates the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]].

The site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]]. After [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved the mews to [[Buckingham Palace]], the area was redeveloped by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The {{convert|169|ft|adj=on}} [[Nelson's Column]] at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the [[Fourth Plinth]], left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.

The square has been used for community gatherings and political [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], including [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1887, the culmination of the first [[Aldermaston March]], anti-war protests, and campaigns against [[climate change]]. A [[Christmas tree]] has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on [[New Year's Eve]]. It was well known for its [[feral pigeon]]s until their removals in the early 21st century.

The site of Trafalgar Square has been a significant location since the 13th century. During [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]'s reign, the area was the site of the [[King's Mews]], running north from the original [[Charing Cross]], where the [[Strand, London|Strand]] from [[City of London|the City]] met [[Whitehall]] coming north from [[Westminster]].{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}} From the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] to that of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], the mews was at the western end of the Strand. The name "Royal Mews" comes from the practice of keeping [[hawk]]s here for [[moulting]]; "mew" is an old word for this. After a fire in 1534, the mews were rebuilt as stables, and remained here until [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved them to [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/royalmews/about/the-history-of-the-royal-mews|title=The History of the Royal Mews|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clearance and development ===
After 1732, the King's Mews were divided into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of [[William Kent]]. Its site is occupied by the National Gallery.{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=29}} 

In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent's stable block, and as far east as St Martin's Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin's Lane and the Strand and the construction of a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=37}} The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named for [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=176}} Around 1835, it was decided that the square would be named after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] as suggested by architect [[George Ledwell Taylor]], commemorating [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9TBOcU1WXEcC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=%22trafalgar+square|title=Wanderlust: Based on the true-life journals of Sydney Taylor|first=Marc|last=Cardinal|publisher=AuthorHouse|p=209|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4490-7907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the clearance, development progressed slowly. The National Gallery was built on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]],&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=68408&amp;strquery=wilkins%20trafalgar%20square%20national |title=Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery |author=G.

He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area to the level of the footway between Cockspur Street and the Strand,&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1840|title=Public Buildings &amp;c Trafalgar Square|journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal |volume=3 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and constructing a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side, and steps at each end leading to the main level.&lt;ref name=report /&gt; Wilkins had proposed a similar solution with a central flight of steps.&lt;ref name=am /&gt; Plinths were provided for sculpture and pedestals for lighting.

Trafalgar Square was opened to the public on 1 May 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=Peter|title=Handbook of London Past and Present|date=1849|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=lxv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yKoxAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR65&amp;dq|chapter=London Occurrences 1837–1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nelson's Column ===
[[File:Lion-nelson-column-trafalgar-london-uk.jpg|thumb|left|The lions at [[Nelson's Column]] were not finished until nearly 30 years after the square opened.| alt=The lions at Nelson's Column]]
[[Nelson's Column]] was planned independently of Barry's work. In 1838 a Nelson Memorial Committee had approached the government proposing that a monument to the victor of Trafalgar, funded by public subscription, should be erected in the square. A competition was held and won by the architect [[William Railton]], who proposed a {{convert|218|ft|3|in|m}} [[Corinthian order|Corinthinan]] column topped by a statue of Nelson and guarded by four sculpted lions. The design was approved, but received widespread objections from the public. Construction went ahead beginning in 1840 but with the height reduced to {{convert|145|ft|3|in|m}}.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=177}} The column was completed and the statue raised in November 1843.{{sfn|Mace|1976|page= 90}}

The last of the bronze reliefs on the column's pedestals was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although part of the original design, were only added in 1867.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=107–8}} Each lion weighs seven tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bow Bells - A Magazine of General Literature|year=1867 |publisher=John Dicks|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=5M0aAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Landseer+seven+tons&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo04T8-YPTAhWM1ywKHSVhD00Q6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Landseer%20seven%20tons&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Opening of Trafalgar Square |newspaper=The Times |date=31 July 1839 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the [[London Zoo]] to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to [[decomposition|decompose]] and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/11268400/Londons-secret-sights-16-more-odd-attractions-you-never-knew-were-there.html?frame=3155177|title=The faulty lions of Trafalgar Square|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry was unhappy about Nelson's Column being placed in the square. In July 1840, when its foundations had been laid, he told a parliamentary select committee that "it would in my opinion be desirable that the area should be wholly free from all insulated objects of art".&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{Citation |title=Report from the Select Committee on Trafalgar Square together with the Minutes of Evidence|year=1840 |publisher=Printed by the House of Commons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xFcAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to [[Berlin]]{{efn|Hitler had specifically requested that all of [[Rembrandt]]'s paintings in the National Gallery be seized as part of the move, as he particularly admired the artist's work.{{sfn|Longmate|2012|p=137}}}} after an expected [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]], as related by [[Norman Longmate]] in ''If Britain Had Fallen'' (1972).{{sfn|Longmate|2012|p=137}}

The square has been Grade I listed on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]] since 1996.&lt;ref name=NHLEGarden&gt;{{NHLE|num=1001362|desc=Trafalgar Square|access-date=11 July 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redevelopment ===
A major 18-month redevelopment of the square led by [[Atkins (company)|W.S. Atkins]] with [[Foster and Partners]] as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides of the square, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafalgar Square redevelopment|publisher=Foster+Partners|url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/trafalgar-square-redevelopment/|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}}

Barry's scheme provided two plinths for sculptures on the north side of the square.&lt;ref name=gn /&gt; A bronze [[equestrian statue]] of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] by Sir [[Francis Chantrey]], originally intended to be placed on top of the [[Marble Arch]],&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until late in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=gn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/270_suggestions_for_trafalgar_squares_vacant/40121.html|title=Suggestions for Trafalgar Square's Vacant Plinth|publisher=Government News|date=27 December 1999|accessdate=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208134336/http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/270_suggestions_for_trafalgar_squares_vacant/40121.html|archive-date=8 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir [[Charles James Napier]] by [[George Cannon Adams]] in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir [[Henry Havelock]] by [[William Behnes]] in the south-east in 1861.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; In 2000, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Kelso|title=Mayor attacks generals in battle of Trafalgar Square|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,385413,00.html|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 October 2000|accessdate=25 May 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth plinth ====
{{Main|Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square}}
In the 21st century, the empty plinth in the north-west corner of the square, the "Fourth Plinth", has been used to show specially commissioned temporary artworks. The scheme was initiated by the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and continued by the Fourth Plinth Commission, appointed by the Mayor of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/arts-and-culture/art-and-design/fourth-plinth|title=Fourth Plinth|publisher=Greater London Council|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other sculptures ===
There are three busts of admirals against the north wall of the square. Those of [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] (by Sir [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]]) and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]] (by [[William McMillan (sculptor)|William MacMillan]]) were installed in 1948 in conjunction with the square's fountains, which also commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Discovering London Statues and Monuments |last=Baker |first=Margatet |year=2008 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=McMillan,_William_(1887–1977),_sculptor|title=McMillan, William (1887–1977)|publisher=Your Archives, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third, of the [[World War II|Second World War]] [[First Sea Lord]] [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Cunningham]] (by [[Franta Belsky]]) was unveiled alongside them on {{Nowrap|2 April}} 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=|first=|title=Bust of Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope by Franta Belsky|url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Bust_of_Viscount_Cunningham_of_Hyndhope_by_Franta_Belsky|volume=|pages=|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#"Your Archives"|Your Archives, The National Archives]]|accessdate=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the south side of Trafalgar Square, on the site of the original Charing Cross, is a bronze [[Equestrian statue of Charles I, Charing Cross|equestrian statue of Charles I]] by [[Hubert Le Sueur]]. It was cast in 1633, and placed in its present position in 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gorton (writer)|John Gorton]]: ''A Topographical Dictionary of Great Britain and Ireland'', 1833, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

The two statues on the lawn in front of the National Gallery are the [[Statue of James II, Trafalgar Square|statue of James II]] by [[Grinling Gibbons]] to the west of the portico, and of one [[George Washington]], a [[George Washington (Houdon)|replica of a work]] by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], to the east.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} The latter was a gift from the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]], installed in 1921.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=875}}

Two statues erected in the 19th century have since been removed. One of [[Edward Jenner]], pioneer of the [[smallpox vaccine]], was set up in the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by [[William Calder Marshall]], it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. It was moved to [[Kensington Gardens]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1858 |title=The Jenner Monument |journal=Dublin Hospital Gazette |volume=5 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45228 |title=Kensington Gardens |author=Edward Walford |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1878 |work=Old and New London: Volume 5 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other, of General [[Charles George Gordon]] by [[Hamo Thornycroft]], was erected on an 18-foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the [[Victoria Embankment]] ten years later.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=125–126}}

== Fountains ==
[[File:Trafalgar square fountain, June 7 2014.JPG|thumb|Fountain at Trafalgar Square, 2014|alt=Fountain at Trafalgar Square, 2014]]
In 1841, following suggestions from the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly.{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=87}} The fountains were fed from two wells, one in front of the National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

In the late-1930s it was decided to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], were memorials to [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]], although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=130–1}} The fountains cost almost £50,000. The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in [[Ottawa]]'s [[Confederation Park]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]'s [[Wascana Centre]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20090529"&gt;{{citation|title=Trafalgar Square fountain spurts to new heights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/29/trafalgar-square-fountains-reopen|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2009 | location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GardenFoundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafalgar Square fountains|url=http://www.garden-fountain.co.uk/trafalgar.asp|year=2003|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A programme of restoration was completed by {{Nowrap|May 2009}}. The pump system was replaced with one capable of sending an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} jet of water into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/29/trafalgar-square-fountains-reopen|title=Trafalgar Square fountain spurts to new heights|first=Maev|last=Kennedy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting system that can project different combinations of colours on to the fountains was installed to reduce the cost of lighting maintenance and to coincide with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20090529" /&gt;

The square was once famous for [[feral pigeon]]s and feeding them was a popular activity. Pigeons began flocking to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became well known in the Victorian era.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=181}} The desirability of the birds' presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a [[Rock pigeon#Human health|health hazard]].&lt;ref name=pidgeons /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=House Guests, House Pests: A Natural History of Animals in the Home|first=Richard|last=Jones|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2015|p=85|isbn=978-1-4729-0624-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices.&lt;ref name=ipidgeon&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-pigeons-have-gone-but-visitors-are-flocking-to-trafalgar-square-2041675.html|title=The pigeons have gone, but visitors are flocking to Trafalgar Square|first=Andy|last=McSmith|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== New Year ===
For many years, revellers celebrating the [[New Year]] have gathered in the square despite a lack of celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the [[London Eye]] and [[South Bank]] of the [[River Thames|Thames]] has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity [[Unicef]], who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/events/london-nye-2015-fireworks|title=London New Year's Eve with Unicef.|work=Greater London Authority|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christmas ===

A [[Christmas]] ceremony has been held in the square every year since 1947.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; A [[Norway spruce]] (or sometimes a [[fir]]) is presented by Norway's capital city, [[Oslo]] as London's [[Christmas tree]], a token of gratitude for Britain's support during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; (Besides war-time support, Norway's [[Olav V of Norway|Prince Olav]] and the country's government lived in exile in London throughout the war.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt;)

The tree is selected by the Head Forester from Oslo's [[municipal forest]] and shipped, across the [[North Sea]] to the [[Port of Felixstowe]], then by road to Trafalgar Square. The first tree was {{convert|48|ft|m}} tall, but more recently has been around {{convert|75|ft|m}}. In 1987, protesters chained themselves to the tree.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; In 1990, a man sawed into the tree with a chainsaw a few hours before a New Year's Eve party was scheduled to take place. He was arrested and the tree was repaired by [[Arborist|tree surgeons]] who removed gouged sections from the trunk while the tree was suspended from a crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-31/news/mn-5771_1_tree-square-trafalgar|title=Man Takes Chain Saw to Trafalgar Square Tree, but Tannenbaum Stands|author=Associated Press|date=31 December 1990|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners, developing over its history from "an [[esplanade]] peopled with figures of national heroes, into the country's foremost ''place politique''", as historian Rodney Mace has written. Since its construction, it has been a venue for political demonstrations.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} The great [[Chartism|Chartist]] rally in 1848, a campaign for social reform by the working class began in the square.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} A ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging [[Labour movement]], particularly the [[Social Democratic Federation]], began holding protests. On {{Nowrap|8 February}} 1886 (also known as "Black Monday"), protesters rallied against unemployment leading to a riot in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. A larger riot (''"[[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]]"'') occurred in the square on {{Nowrap|13 November}} 1887.{{sfn|Crick|1994|p=47}}

The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]'s first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]], protesting against the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE), began in the square in 1958.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on {{Nowrap|19 September}} 1961 by the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], which included the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. In March 1968, a crowd of 10,000 demonstrated against US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] before marching to the [[Embassy of the United States, London|American Embassy]] in [[Grosvenor Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/17/newsid_2818000/2818967.stm |title=On This Day – 17 March – 1968: Anti-Vietnam demo turns violent |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, a continuous anti-[[apartheid]] protest was held outside South Africa House. In 1990, the [[Poll Tax Riots]] began by a demonstration attended by 200,000 people and ultimately caused rioting in the surrounding area.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} More recently, there have been anti-war demonstrations opposing the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] and the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Keith Flett|title=The Committee of 100: Sparking a new left|url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=5114|journal=[[Socialist Worker]]|issue=1933|date=8 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large vigil was held shortly after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|terrorist bombings in London]] on Thursday, {{Nowrap|7 July}} 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=London falls silent for bomb dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4679681.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=14 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, participants from the Camp for Climate Action occupied the square for the two weeks during which the UN Conference on Climate Change took place in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/actions/copenhagen-2009/cop15-out |title=COP OUT CAMP OUT Âť Camp for Climate Action |publisher=Climatecamp.org.uk |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929120826/http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/actions/copenhagen-2009/cop15-out |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was billed as a UK base for direct action on climate change and saw various actions and protests stem from the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/12/443493.html?c=on#c239066 |title=UK Indymedia – Climate protestors scale Canadian Embassy and deface flag |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/12/443706.html |title=UK Indymedia – Climate Camp Trafalgar- Ice Bear action |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/12/443698.html |title=UK Indymedia – Thur Dec 17 protest outside Danish Embassy, London |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the square was occupied by a crowd protesting against the UK Budget and proposed budget cuts. During the night the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged portions of the square.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinews:Battle for Trafalgar Square, London as violence breaks out between demonstrators and riot police]]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 a vigil against the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|terrorist attacks in Paris]] was held. Crowds sang the French [[national anthem]], ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', and held banners in support of the city and country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/paris-attacks-thousands-attend-vigil-in-trafalgar-square-a6734926.html|title=Paris terror attacks|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 November 2015|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year on the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar ({{Nowrap|21 October}}), the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] holds a parade in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson and the British victory over the combined fleets of Spain and France at Trafalgar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9624106/Sea-Cadets-in-Battle-of-Trafalgar-parade.html|title=Sea Cadets in Battle of Trafalgar parade|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=21 October 2012|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal British Legion]] holds a Silence in the Square event on [[Armistice Day]], 11 November, in remembrance of those who died in war. The event includes music and poetry readings, culminating in a [[bugler]] playing the [[Last Post]] and a [[two-minute silence]] at 11 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34783337|title=Armistice Day: Nation remembers war dead|work=BBC News|date=11 November 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sport ===
In the 21st century, Trafalgar Square has been the location for several sporting events and [[victory parade]]s. In June 2002, 12,000 people gathered to watch the [[England national football team]]'s [[FIFA World Cup 2002|World Cup]] quarter-final against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on giant video screens which had been erected for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=England fans mourn defeat|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/england_v_brazil/newsid_2055000/2055509.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=21 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The square was used by the [[England national rugby union team]] on {{Nowrap|9 December}} 2003 to celebrate their victory in the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/3300061.stm|title=England honours World Cup stars|work=BBC Sport|date=9 December 2003|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on {{Nowrap|13 September}} 2005 for the [[England national cricket team]]'s victory in [[the Ashes]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/ashes_2005/4239254.stm|title=Fans hail England's Ashes heroes|work=BBC News|date=13 September 2005|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satan Exulting over Eve.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Satan Exulting Over Eve'' by [[William Blake]]. The subject of the bull deals with the devil and his corruption of innocents through fornication.]]

'''''Vox in Rama''''' ({{lang-la|A voice in [[Ramah in Benjamin|Rama]]}}) is a [[papal bull]] issued by [[Pope Gregory IX]] in either 1232, 1233 or 1234 condemning a German heresy known as ''Luciferian'', a form of [[Satanism|devil worship]].&lt;ref name="Deane2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Kolpacoff Deane|title=A History of Medieval Heresy and Inquisition|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6811-2|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bull was issued to [[Henry (VII) of Germany|King Henry]], son of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], in June 1233 and subsequently to [[Siegfried III (Archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Siegfried III]] of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]] demanding they use all efforts to stop the practice.

==Background==
[[File:Konrad von Marburg.jpg|thumb|left|The inquisitor Konrad of Marburg, detail of a 13th-century church window, [[Elisabeth Church (Marburg)|Elisabeth Church]], Marburg. It was likely Konrad's report on the cult that inspired ''Vox in Rama''.]]

The 13th century was a time of great superstition and saw the start of the "demonisation of heretics"&lt;ref name=Kors&gt;{{cite book |last=|first=|editor-first=Alan Charles |editor-last=Kors |title=Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700: A Documentary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=2|date=2000|page=114 |chapter=IV: Popes, Theologians, Preachers, Lawyers and Judges |isbn=0812217519}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Church, attributing their lack of belief in the Catholic faith to the devil. Barber claims that it was during this time that there was a great zeal for the sending out of inquisitors by the [[pope]] and local bishops with the aim of seeking out potential [[Heresy|heretics]].&lt;ref name=Barber1&gt;{{cite book |last=Barber|first=Malcolm|editor-first= |editor-last=|title=The Trial of the Templars |publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=2|date= 2006 |page=114 |chapter=10: Conclusion |isbn= 0521672368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1233, [[Konrad von Marburg]] (sometimes anglicized as Conrad of [[Marburg]]) began an inquisition in Mainz at the behest of either the Pope or the [[archbishop]].&lt;ref name=Barber2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Malcolm|year=1973 |title=Propaganda in the Middle Ages |journal=Nottingham Mediæval Studies |volume=17 |issue= |pages=42–57 |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly through torture and terror, Konrad reported he had uncovered a satanic cult which worshiped devils in the forms of a demonic man and of a diabolical black cat.&lt;ref name=Engels&gt;{{cite book |last=Engles |first=Donald W. |editor-first= |editor-last=|title=Classical Cats: The Rise and Fall of the Sacred Cat |publisher= Routledge|date=2001|page=183 |chapter=Appendix III: Pope Gregory and the ''Vox in Rama'' |isbn= 0415261627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquisition of Konrad was controversial: shortly after Konrad arrived in Mainz, a papal official called Bernard wrote to Gregory stating that Konrad had been forcing innocent people to confess by threatening them with burning at the stake if they refused to do so.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell|first=Jeffery Burton |title= Witchcraft in the Middle Ages |publisher=Cornell University Press|date=1984 |page=160 |chapter=Antinomianism, Scholasticism, and the Inquisition |isbn= 0801492890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Konrad was assassinated, possibly by the servants of [[Henry II, Count of Sayn]], whom Konrad had accused of fostering heresy.

The issue of the bull was a response to Konrad's allegations, urging Siegfried III and King Henry, representing the ecclesiastical and temporal authorities respectively, to seek out and destroy the heretics.&lt;ref name=Barber2 /&gt;

==Contents==

The bull describes in detail the initiation rites of the sect, claiming that the potential initiate is first approached by a mysterious [[toad]] as large as a dog.&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert|first=Malcolm D. |title=The Cathars|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=1998 |pages=|chapter= |isbn= 063120959X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards an emaciated pale man would appear, whom the initiate would kiss and thereby forget all memory of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=Russell /&gt; Members of the sect would then meet for a meal.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt; When the meal had ended, the sect would arise and a statue of a black cat would come to life, walking backwards with its tail erect.&lt;ref name=Barber1 /&gt; First the new initiate and then the master of the sect would kiss the cat on the buttocks.&lt;ref name=Barber2 /&gt;

After the ritual was completed, the bull claims that the candles in the room would be extinguished and the sect would engage in wild orgies which were sometimes homosexual in nature. Once the candles are re-lit, a man from a dark corner of the room “comes forth from the loins upward, shining like the sun. His lower part is shaggy like a cat.” After a brief [[litany]]-like dialogue between the cat and the cult members, the meeting ends.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rodenberg, ''Epistolae saeculi XIII e regestis pontificum Romanorum selectae'', MGH, Berlin, Weidmann, 1883, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory also claims that the sect committed various [[Host desecration|crimes against the Eucharist]]:

{{Quote|text=They even receive the body of the Lord every year at [[Easter]] from the hand of the priest and, carrying it in their mouths home, they throw it into the latrine in contempt of the Saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rodenberg, ''Epistolae saeculi XIII e regestis pontificum Romanorum selectae'', MGH, Berlin, Weidmann, 1883, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In conclusion, Gregory condemns the practice and calls upon the religious and secular authorities in the [[diocese]] to take action against the cult's participants.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt;
