The '''Abbeystead disaster''' occurred on the evening of 23 May 1984 when a [[methane]] gas explosion destroyed a waterworks' [[pumping station|valve house]] at [[Abbeystead]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="hse"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Abbeystead Explosion: a report of the investigation by the Health and Safety Executive into the explosion on 23 May 1984 at the valve house of the Lune/Wyre Water Transfer Scheme at Abbeystead|author=HSE|authorlink=Health and Safety Executive|isbn=0-11-883795-8|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of 44 visitors was inside the underground building at the time attending a public presentation by [[North West Water|North West Water Authority]] (NWWA) to demonstrate the operations of the station. Eight were killed instantly by the explosion, and the others were severely injured.&lt;ref name=hse /&gt; The explosion also caused the concrete roof to fall down on to the group, destroying the steel mesh floor and throwing some of the victims into the water chambers below which rapidly filled with river water.&lt;ref name=hse /&gt; Another eight people subsequently died of their injuries in hospital. An 11-year-old boy and his mother were among the dead. The official inquiry into the disaster concluded that the methane had seeped from coal deposits 3,937 feet (1,200 m) below ground and had built up in an empty pipeline.&lt;ref name="balmer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/runner-up-richard-balmers-account-of-the-abbeystead-explosion/756249.article|title=Abbeystead explosion|work=[[New Civil Engineer]]|first=Richard|last=Balmer|date=20 February 2008|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gas was then ejected into the valve house by the sudden pressure of water as the pumps were switched on.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Blowing the roof off Abbeystead|first=Fred|last=Pearce|date=23 May 1985|journal=[[New Scientist]]|issue=1457|issn=0028-6664|location=London|pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of ignition has never been determined.&lt;ref name=hse /&gt;

==Background==
The Abbeystead valve house was constructed as part of NWWA's 'Lancashire conjunctive use scheme,' a water supply project "to help in meeting the region's expected increases in water demand during the 1980s." The scheme involved the daily extraction of up to {{convert|62|e6impgal|m3}} of water from the [[River Lune]] near [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] which was then pumped through Abbeystead into the [[River Wyre]]. From here it would be extracted to a treatment works to augment the drinking water supply for south Lancashire.&lt;ref name=seton/&gt;

==Explosion==
The visitors were from the village of [[St Michael's on Wyre|St. Michael's on Wyre]], situated approximately 10 miles from the valve house and which had previously suffered flooding which residents believed was caused by the station pumping water from the River Lune to the River Wyre. The tour of the valve house had been arranged by NWWA to alleviate public concern about the flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Times]]|date=24 May 1984|location=London|page=1|issue=61839|title=Explosion kills six during villagers' water plant visit}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Mann, chairman of NWWA, said that the tour was intended to have a "family flavour."&lt;ref name="seton"&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=25 May 1984|page=1|issue=61840|title=Lethal build-up of methane gas blamed for Abbeystead disaster|first1=Craig|last1=Seton|first2=Robin|last2=Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour commenced at 7.20pm and the explosion occurred approximately 10 minutes later, with the first telephone call to the emergency services logged at 7.37pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=25 May 1984|page=1|issue=61840|title=The roofless chamber of death; A stunned village flies its flag at half mast|first=Ronald|last=Faux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Chippendale, the supervisor of a pumping station on the River Lune had received a telephone call from George Lacey, the NWWA district manager conducting the tour, asking him to commence pumping, and a second call 5 minutes later saying that no water was coming through and to activate a second, larger, pump. Twenty minutes later Chippendale called Abbeystead to check water was coming through and the telephone was answered by water engineer John Nelson who shouted "Get help! There has been a terrible disaster!"&lt;ref name=seton/&gt; The force of the blast had lifted 30 concrete roof beams, each weighing 2½ tons, upwards through the soil landscaping above them before they fell into the chamber below.

Independent geological and seismic surveys commissioned by NWWA later identified the source of the methane gas as coal seams 3,937 feet (1,200 m) below the pipeline. The gas had collected over millions of years in a natural limestone reservoir, from which it seeped towards the surface through a complex network of geological faults. The cutting of the tunnel had intersected these faults and allowed the gas to seep in through its concrete lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Source of Abbeystead blast found|first=Peter|last=Davenport|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=11 March 1986|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquest==
An [[inquest]] into the deaths was held at Lancaster in October 1984. The jury returned a majority verdict of [[accidental death]] on all 16 victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=31 October 1984|page=3|issue=61974|title=Abbeystead witness tells of blast and victims with hair and clothes burnt off}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health and Safety Executive]] investigated this incident and produced a special report in accordance with the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]].&lt;ref&gt;The Abbeystead Explosion.

==Liability==
In March 1987, at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster High Court]], the building's designers Binnie &amp; Partners were found to be 55 per cent liable in negligence for failing to exercise "reasonable care" in assessing the risk of methane. NWWA was found to be 30 per cent to blame for failing to ensure the plant was safe for visitors and employees by testing for methane and Nuttall's Ltd., who constructed the works, were found 15 per cent liable for failing to carry out systematic tests for methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abbeystead disaster &amp;ndash; 20 years on|work=The Visitor|location=Morecambe|date=19 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three appealed, and ultimately Binnie &amp; Partners were found solely liable. Leave to appeal to the [[House of Lords]] was refused.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;TE Eckersley and Others v Binnie &amp; Partners and Others [1988] CILL 388&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1989 most of the injured survivors and relatives of those who died accepted out-of-court settlements from Binnie &amp; Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Abbeystead victims to get £2.5m payout|last=Morris|first=Michael|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=10 February 1989|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aerial cable''' or '''air cable''' is an insulated cable usually containing all [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s required for an electrical distribution system (typically using [[aerial bundled cable]]s) or a telecommunication line, which is suspended between [[utility pole]]s or [[electricity pylon]]s.  As aerial cables are completely insulated there is no danger of [[electric shock]] when touching them and there is no requirement for mounting them with [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] on pylons and poles.
A further advantage is they require less right of way than overhead lines for the same reason.  They can be designed as [[shielded cable]]s for telecommunication purposes. If the cable falls, it may still operate if its insulation is not damaged.  

As aerial cables are installed on pylons or poles, they may be cheaper to install than [[undergrounding|underground cable]]s, as no work for digging is required, which can be very expensive in rocky areas.

== Use ==
Aerial cables are mostly used for telecommunication systems or for power transmissions with voltages below 1000 volts. Aerial cable for voltages up to 69,000 volts has also been built,  for the supply of farms, waterworks, transmitters and other facilities outside of urban areas. Aerial cables are not often used in transmission circuits because of the difficulty in insulating such high voltage wire. Because of the proven reliability benefits of insulated aerial cables over traditional air-insulated wire, the Electric Power Institute has been working with utility companies to develop better insulating materials. In 1996 they were able to successfully convert one lower-voltage transmission circuit to insulated cable. &lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/756159/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Astrocaryum vulgare''''' ([[common name]]s Tucum or Tucumã-do-Pará in [[Brazil]], Awara and wara in [[French Guiana]], Wara awara in [[Guyana]], awarra in [[Suriname]], Chontilla in [[Ecuador]]) is a [[Arecaceae|palm]] native to [[Amazon Rainforest]] [[List of plants of Amazon Rainforest vegetation of Brazil|vegetation]], typical of the [[Pará]] state in Brazil. This plant has [[Eating|edible]] [[fruit]], which are also used for [[biodiesel]] production. This plant is cited in ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'' by [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]].
This species is native to the Amazonian region, possibly to the state of Pará, where it has its center of distribution, and reaches French Guiana and Suriname. It is a characteristic palm of terra firme, low vegetation cover, or even open fields. The tree is 10 to 15 m in height and regenerates easily by growing multiple stems. The tucumã palm is considered a pioneer plant of aggressive growth, has the ability to grow new shoots after a fire, and mainly inhabits secondary forests and pastures. Seeds take up to 2 years to germinate, the plants grow slowly in cultivation, and start to produce fruits after eight years. Its resistance to diseases and high productivity make this species an alternative for the production of biodiesel, since the operating costs of an orderly plantation is much less than that of the oil palm.&lt;ref name="Morais"&gt;Morais, Luiz Roberto Barbosa Química de oleaginosas : valorização da biodiversidade amazônica = Chemistry of vegetable oils : valorization of the amazon biodiversity. — Belém, PA : Ed. do Autor, 2012. — (Oleaginosas). CDD-633.850981&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Awarra-Small.jpg|thumb|Awarra-Small|Astrocaryum vulgare palm]]

The seed is covered externally with an orange oily pulp. On average, the fruit weighs 30 g; 34% of this weight corresponds to the external pulp that has 14% to 16% of the oil when it is raw. A mature tree can produce up to 50&amp;nbsp;kg of fruits per year (25&amp;nbsp;kg per tree on average), which corresponds to 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg of pulp oil and 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg of seed oil. In one hectare, 400 palm clusters can be planted, each cluster with three trunks. In total, this equals 1200 palm trunks and will result in 4.8 tons of fatty material per hectare. It forms clusters that do not need to be replanted.&lt;ref name="Morais"/&gt;

==Oil==

The fruit is composed of a woody core almost black in color, containing a white almond paste, oilseed, very hard and covered with a yellow-orange pulp, little consistency and oily. Two types of oils are produced by this fruit: the oil of external pulp and almond oil. The oil is found in the fruit, as follows.&lt;ref&gt;PESCE, Celestino.

[[File:Tucuma-oleo-frut4.JPG|thumb|Oil from the Tucumã pulp|Astrocaryum vulgare (Tucumã) oil]]

==Cuisine==

In [[French Guiana]], at Easter, Guianans eat a traditional dish made with awara dough called [[Awara broth]].

==The tucum ring==
{{Main|Tucum ring}}

The seed in the fruit is notably used by [[Amazonian indian|indigenous Amazonians]] to make black [[Ring (jewellery)|rings]]. In the 1800s, this ring was used as a symbol of marriage for the slaves and natives, who could not afford to purchase gold. In addition, the ring was also a symbol of friendship and of resistance to the established order – the freedom fighters. Now these rings are worn by [[Catholic]] [[Missionaries#Catholic missions|missionaries]] as a symbol of solidarity with the poor and support in the struggle for equality, [[social justice]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordmadeflesh.org/brazil/2009/03/story-of-the-tucum-ring/ Story of the Tucum ring « Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404090841/http://www.wordmadeflesh.org/brazil/2009/03/story-of-the-tucum-ring/ |date=April 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJKVjWes7g 'O Anel De Tucum'] (1994) Conrado Berning, 70 mins in Português,[http://www.verbofilmes.org.br/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=63&amp;category_id=22&amp;keyword=anel&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=79 Verbo Filmes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eneida Duarte Gaspar 'O Caminho da cruz' 2001 ({{ISBN|8534702969}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.tucum.org/site/2493/nota/154498 en.tucum.org - Ceará’s Community Tourism Network receives the To Do!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15205">{{short description|Strucural fibres spun from melted basalt}}
'''Basalt fiber ''' is a material made from extremely fine [[fiber]]s of [[basalt]], which is composed of the [[mineral]]s [[plagioclase]], [[pyroxene]], and [[olivine]].  It is similar to [[fiberglass]], having better physicomechanical properties than fiberglass, but being significantly cheaper than carbon fiber.  It is used as a [[Fireproofing|fireproof]] [[textile]] in the [[aerospace]] and [[automotive]] industries and can also be used as a [[Composite material|composite]] to produce products such as [[Tripod (photography)|camera tripods]].

==Manufacture==
The technology of production of BNV{{clarify|reason=The only non-wikipedia-circular reference to BNV I can find is for "Basalt from Nevada, USA (NV)", which would not require manufacturing.|date=August 2018}} is a one-stage process: melting, homogenization of basalt and extraction of fibers. Basalt is heated only once, which allows you to get the desired product: BNV. Further processing of BNV into materials is carried out using "cold technologies" with low energy costs.

Basalt fiber is made from a single material, crushed basalt, from a carefully chosen quarry source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://basalt.pro/activities/materials/|title=Research surveys for basalt rock quarries {{!}} Basalt Projects Inc. {{!}} Engineering continuous basalt fiber and CBF-based composites|work=Basalt Projects Inc.|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basalt of high acidity (over 46% silica content&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enea.it/it/pubblicazioni/EAI/anno-2011/indice-world-view-3-2011/basalt-fiber-from-earth-an-ancient-material-for-innovative-and-modern-application&lt;/ref&gt;) and low iron content is considered desirable for fiber production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/composites-higher-properties-lower-cost|title=Composites: Higher Properties, Lower Cost|last=Schut|first=Jan H.|website=www.ptonline.com|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with other composites, such as glass fiber, essentially no materials are added during its production.

The manufacture of basalt fiber requires the melting of the crushed and washed basalt rock at about {{convert|1500|°C|°F}}. The molten rock is then [[Extrusion|extruded]] through small nozzles to produce continuous filaments of basalt fiber. 

The basalt fibers typically have a filament diameter of between 10 and 20 [[micrometre|µm]] which is far enough above the respiratory limit of 5&amp;nbsp;µm to make basalt fiber a suitable replacement for [[asbestos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://basalt-fiber.com/|title=Basalt Fibers from continuous-filament basalt rock|last=|first=|date=|website=basalt-fiber.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thin fiber is usually used for textile applications mainly for production of woven fabric. Thicker fiber is used in filament winding, for example, for production of CNG cylinders or pipes. The thickest fiber is used for pultrusion, geogrid, UD, multiaxial fabric production and in form of chopped strand for concrete reinforcement. One of the most prospective applications for continuous basalt fiber and the most modern trend at the moment is production of basalt rebar that more and more substitutes traditional steel rebar on construction market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://novitsky1.narod.ru/basalt_fiber.technology.html|title=Some aspects of the technological process of continuous basalt fiber|website=novitsky1.narod.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first attempts to produce basalt fiber were made in the [[United States]] in 1923 by Paul Dhe who was granted {{US patent|1,462,446}}. These were further developed after [[World War II]] by researchers in the USA, [[Europe]] and the [[Soviet Union]] especially for [[military]] and aerospace applications. Since declassification in 1995 basalt fibers have been used in a wider range of civilian applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://basfiber.com|title=Basalt fiber|website=basfiber.com|language=ru, en, de, ko, ja|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Schools===
#RWTH Aachen University. Every two year Aachen University hosts International Glass Fibers Symposium where basalt fiber is devoted a separate section. The university conducts regular research to study and improve basalt fiber properties. Textile concrete is also more corrosion-resistant and more malleable than conventional concrete. Replacement of carbon fibers with basalt fibers can significantly enhance the application fields of the innovative composite material that is textile concrete, says Andreas Koch.

The Peter Offermann covers the range from the beginning of fundamental research work at the TU Dresden in the early 90s to the present. The idea that textile lattice structures made of high-performance threads for constructional reinforcement could open up completely new possibilities in construction was the starting point for today's large research network.

Design rules, "which eliminated the legal vacuum in the design of basalt reinforced fiber reinforced concrete. According to paragraph 1.1. the standard extends to all types of non-metallic fibers (polymers, polypropylene, glass, basalt and carbon). When comparing different fibers, it can be noted that polymer fibers are inferior to mineral strengths, but their use makes it possible to improve the characteristics of building composites.

'''Batoning''' is the technique of cutting or splitting wood by using a [[club (weapon)|baton]]-sized stick or [[mallet]] to repeatedly strike the spine of a sturdy [[knife]], [[chisel]] or [[blade]] in order to drive it through wood, similar to how a [[froe]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tjs85I4_TWwC Field &amp; Stream]'' Mar 2006, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4WiaMCK0kJcC&amp;pg=PA110 Field &amp; Stream]'' Dec 2008 - Jan 200, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfc_M6bXNv8C&amp;pg=PA175 98.6 Degrees: The Art of Keeping Your Ass Alive!]'', Cody Lundin, Russ Miller, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mPfo9ect6fsC Fundamentals of search and rescue]'', Donald C. Cooper, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leevalley.com/en/wood/page.aspx?p=67735&amp;cat=51&amp;ap=2 |title=Batoning Chisel - Lee Valley Tools |publisher=Leevalley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The batoning method can be used to make kindling or desired forms such as boards, slats or notches. The practice is most useful for obtaining dry wood from the inside of logs for the purpose of [[fire making]].

==Tools==
Tools used in batoning are: a strong, fixed-blade, preferably full tang knife or [[machete]] with a thick spine, and a club-sized length of dense or [[green wood]] for striking the knife's spine and tip.

==Technique==
The basic method involves repeatedly striking the spine of the knife to force the middle of the blade into the wood. The tip is then struck, to continue forcing the blade deeper, until a split is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, John D.. Stay Alive: Survival Skills You Need. Krause Publications (24 Oct 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and advantages==
This technique is useful for the simple splitting of wood for kindling, to access dry wood within a wet log, and for the production of shingles, slats, or boards. It is also useful for cutting notches, or making clean crosscuts against the grain of the wood.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The technique is also especially useful when a chopping tool is not available.

==Hazards==
Care must be taken to avoid damage to the knife. Breakage of the blade is a common result of striking the spine of the knife at an angle. If this happens the broken blade can become irretrievably embedded within the split. In a survival situation, this can be catastrophic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://shilohtv.com/?p=6494 |title=Batoning: How to Safely Baton With Your Knife (With Video) |publisher=ShilohTV |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parent material ==
The [[Franciscan Assemblage|Franciscan Complex]] is the [[bedrock]] from which blue goo is derived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It stretches along the coastline from [[Central Coast (California)|Central California]] up to Southern [[Oregon]] and contains sheared materials from both the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[North American Plate]]s that have accumulated in the [[accretionary wedge]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Common features ==
Clay soils like blue goo have the highest water-holding capacity when compared with other soils, giving them a low draining capacity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This kind of habitat is unsuitable for most plants,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but the [[North Coast (California)|Northern California coastline]] maintains high levels of vegetation year round.

Due to blue goo's clayey texture, it slips when overly saturated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This slippage is increased in heavy rainfall areas and in shallow soils; deep soils have more total [[Porosity|pore space]] and are not as prone to slippage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These features contribute to the landslide-ridden environments found along the Northern Californian coast.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Franciscan Complex, from which blue goo is derived, extends from Central California up the coast through parts of Southern Oregon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But blue goo has only been found in two Northern Californian regions located in [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]]: the [[Trinidad, California|Trinidad]] region and the [[Orick, California|Orick]] region. Blue goo is thought to also be found in the [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] region and along the Southern Oregon coastline.

The '''Chatter Telephone''' is a pull toy for toddlers 12 to 36 months of age.&lt;ref name="FP1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/brands/babytoys/products/5663|title=Brilliant Basics™ Chatter Telephone®|work=Fisher-Price|accessdate=8 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603020849/http://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/brands/babytoys/products/5663#|archive-date=2013-06-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in 1962 by the [[Fisher-Price]] company as the "Talk Back Phone" for infants and children, the Chatter Telephone is a roll along pull toy. It has a smiling face, and when the toy is pulled, it makes a chattering sound and the eyes move up and down. The toy has a [[rotary dial]] that rings a bell, and was conceived as a way to teach children how to dial a phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Chatter Phone from Fisher-Price (1962)|url=https://toytales.ca/chatter-phone-fisher-price-1962/|website=ToyTales.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This gave him the idea of adding wheels, which with a bent axle permitted the movement of eyes, adding to the "whimsical" nature, that [[Herman Fisher]] desired of all Fisher-Price toys (from phone conversation with Ernie Thornell and recollections of Herm Fisher by John Smith). 

From its introduction through the 1970s, the Chatter Telephone was Fisher-Price's best selling product.&lt;ref name="MW1"&gt;

In the field of [[astronomy]] the term '''chord''' typically refers to a line crossing an object which is formed during an [[occultation]] event. By taking accurate measurements of the start and end times of the event, in conjunction with the known location of the observer and the object's [[orbit]], the length of the chord can be determined giving an indication of the size of the occulting object. By combining observations made from several different locations, multiple chords crossing the occulting object can be determined giving a more accurate shape and size model. This technique of using multiple observers during the same event has been used to derive more sophisticated shape models for [[asteroid]]s, whose shape can be highly irregular. A notable example of this occurred in 2002 when the asteroid [[345 Tercidina]] underwent a stellar occultation of a very bright star as seen from [[Europe]]. During this event a team of at least 105 observers recorded 75 chords across the asteroid's surface allowing for a very accurate size and shape determination.&lt;ref name=euraster&gt;{{cite web | date = 2002-09-17 | title = 2002 European Asteroidal Occultation Results | publisher = euraster.net (a website for Asteroidal Occultation Observers in Europe) | url = http://www.euraster.net/results/2002/index.html#0917-345 | accessdate = 2008-12-03}} [http://www.euraster.net/results/2002/20020917-Tercidina-cbf2.gif (Chords)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to using a known orbit to determine an objects size, the reverse process can also be used. In this usage the occulting object's size is taken to be known and the occultation time can be used to determine the length of the chord the background object traced across the foreground object. Knowing this chord and the foreground object's size, a more precise orbit for the object can be determined.

This usage of the term "chord" is similar to the geometric concept (see: [[Chord (geometry)]]). The difference being that in the geometric sense a chord refers to a line segment whose ends lie on a circle, whereas in the astronomical sense the occulting shape is not necessarily circular.

==Observation process==

Because an occultation event for an individual object is quite rare, the process of observing occultation events begins with the creation of a list of candidate targets.  The list is generated from a computer by analyzing the orbital motions of a large collection of objects with known orbital parameters.  Once a candidate event has been chosen whose [[ground track]] passes over the site of an observer, the preparations for the observation begin.  A few minutes before the event is expected to happen the observing telescope is targeted to the target [[star]] and the star's [[lightcurve]] is recorded.  The recording of the lightcurve continues during and for a short time after the predicted event.  This extra recording time is due in part to uncertainties in the occulting objects orbit but also due to the possibility of detecting other objects orbiting the primary object (for example in the case of a [[binary asteroid]], also the [[Planetary ring|ring]] system around the planet [[Uranus]] was detected this way&lt;ref name="Elliot-1977"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The rings of Uranus | last = Elliot | first = J. L. | last2 = Dunham | first2 = E. | last3 = Mink | first3 = D. | publisher = [[Cornell University]] | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v267/n5609/abs/267328a0.html |date = 1977 | accessdate=2010-07-11 | volume=267 | issue=5609 | doi=10.1038/267328a0|bibcode = 1977Natur.267..328E }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The exact method of lightcurve determination is dependent on the specific equipment available to the observer and the goals of the observation, however in all occultation events accurate timing is an essential component of the observation process.  The exact time that the foreground object eclipses the other can be used to work out a very precise position along the occulting object's orbit.  Also, since the duration of the drop in the measured lightcurve gives the object's size and since occultation events typically only last somewhere on the order of a few seconds, very fast [[Shutter speed|integration times]] are required to allow for high [[temporal resolution]] along the lightcurve.  A second method of achieving very high temporal accuracy is to actually use a long exposure and allow the target star to drift across the CCD during the exposure.  This method, known as the trailed image method, produces a streak along the photograph whose thickness corresponds to the brightness of the target star with the distance along the streak direction indicates time; this allows for very high temporal accuracy even when the target star may be too dim for the method described above using high frequency short exposures.&lt;ref name="Kravtsov-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Observations of Asteroid Occultations by the Trailed-Image Method | first = F. I. | last = Kravtsov |author2=Lukyanik, I. V. | journal = Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies | date = 2008 | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 317–322 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/4u5j048k85422063/ | doi = 10.3103/S0884591308060081|bibcode = 2008KPCB...24..317K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With high enough temporal resolution even the angular size of the background star can be determined.&lt;ref name="Kravtsov-2007"/&gt;

Once the lightcurve has been recorded the chord across the occulting object can be determined via calculation.  By using the start and end times of the occultation event the position in space of both the observer and the occulting object can be worked out (a process complicated by the fact that both the object and the observer are moving).  Knowing these two locations, combined with the direction to the background object, the two endpoints of the chord can be determined using simple [[geometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8908">In [[materials research|materials]] and [[electric battery]] research, '''cobalt oxide nanoparticles''' usually refers to particles of [[cobalt(II,III) oxide]] {{chem|Co|3|O|4}} of nanometer size, with various shapes and crystal structures.

Cobalt oxide nanoparticles have potential applications in [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]&lt;ref name=DuN/&gt;&lt;ref name=WuZS/&gt; and electronic [[gas sensor]]s.&lt;ref name=ParkJS/&gt;&lt;ref name=LiW/&gt;

==Applications==
===Lithium-ion Battery===
The [[anode]]s of [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] are often made of oxides of [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], or [[iron]], that can readily and reversibly incorporate lithium ions in their molecular structure.  Cobalt oxide nanoparticles, such as [[inorganic nanotube|nanotubes]],&lt;ref name=DuN&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=N.|last2=Zhang|first2=H.|last3=Chen|first3=B. D.|last4=Wu|first4=J. B.|last5=Ma|first5=X. Y.|last6=Liu|first6=Z. H.|last7=Zhang|first7=Y. Q.|last8=Yang|first8=D. R.|last9=Huang|first9=X. H.|last10=Tu|first10=J. P.|title=Porous Co3O4 Nanotubes Derived From Co4(CO)12 Clusters on Carbon Nanotube Templates: A Highly Efficient Material For Li-Battery Applications|journal=Advanced Materials|date=17 December 2007|volume=19|issue=24|pages=4505–4509|doi=10.1002/adma.200602513}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer high surface-to-volume ratio and short path length for [[lithium]] cation transport, leading to high reversible capacity and good cycle life.   The particles may incorporate other substances, asfor example [[diphenylalanine]]/cobalt oxide hybrid nanowires.&lt;ref name=RyuJK&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryu|first1=Jungki|last2=Kim|first2=Sung-Wook|last3=Kang|first3=Kisuk|last4=Park|first4=Chan Beum|title=Synthesis of Diphenylalanine/Cobalt Oxide Hybrid Nanowires and Their Application to Energy Storage|journal=ACS Nano|date=26 January 2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=159–164|doi=10.1021/nn901156w}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Cobale oxide graphene composite white background.tif|thumb|Cobalt oxide (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles anchored on a single sheet of graphene.]]
Cobalt oxide particles may be anchored on substrates such as [[graphene]] to improve the dimensional stability of the anode and to prevent particle aggregation during lithium charge and discharge processes.&lt;ref name=WuZS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Zhong-Shuai|last2=Ren|first2=Wencai|last3=Wen|first3=Lei|last4=Gao|first4=Libo|last5=Zhao|first5=Jinping|last6=Chen|first6=Zongping|last7=Zhou|first7=Guangmin|last8=Li|first8=Feng|last9=Cheng|first9=Hui-Ming|title=Graphene Anchored with CoO Nanoparticles as Anode of Lithium Ion Batteries with Enhanced Reversible Capacity and Cyclic Performance|journal=ACS Nano|date=22 June 2010|volume=4|issue=6|pages=3187–3194|doi=10.1021/nn100740x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas Sensor===
Hollow nanospheres of cobalt oxide have been investigated as materials for [[gas sensor]] electrodes, for the detection of toluene, acetone, and other organic vapors.&lt;ref name=ParkJS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Jinsoo|last2=Shen|first2=Xiaoping|last3=Wang|first3=Guoxiu|title=Solvothermal synthesis and gas-sensing performance of Co3O4 hollow nanospheres|journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical|date=March 2009|volume=136|issue=2|pages=494–498|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2008.11.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Cobalt oxide nanoparticles anchored on single-walled [[carbon nanotube]]s have been investigated for sensing [[nitrogen oxide]]s {{chem|NO|''x''}} and [[hydrogen]]. This application takes advantage of the reactivity between the gas and the oxide, as well as the electrical connection with the substrate (both being [[p-type semiconductor]]s).  Nitrogen oxides react with the oxide as [[electron acceptor]]s, reducing the electrode's resitance; whereas hydrogen acts as an [[electron donor]], increasing the resistance.&lt;ref name=LiW&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Wei|last2=Jung|first2=Hyuck|last3=Hoa|first3=Nguyen Duc|last4=Kim|first4=Dojin|last5=Hong|first5=Soon-Ku|last6=Kim|first6=Hyojin|title=Nanocomposite of cobalt oxide nanocrystals and single-walled carbon nanotubes for a gas sensor application|journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical|date=September 2010|volume=150|issue=1|pages=160–166|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2010.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
Cobalt oxide nanoparticles have been observed to readily enter [[cell (biology)|cells]], a property that conceivably could lead to applications in hyperthermic treatment, gene therapy and drug delivery.  However, their toxicity is an obstacle that would have to be overcome.&lt;ref name=PapisE&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papis|first1=Elena|last2=Rossi|first2=Federica|last3=Raspanti|first3=Mario|last4=Dalle-Donne|first4=Isabella|last5=Colombo|first5=Graziano|last6=Milzani|first6=Aldo|last7=Bernardini|first7=Giovanni|last8=Gornati|first8=Rosalba|title=Engineered cobalt oxide nanoparticles readily enter cells|journal=Toxicology Letters|date=September 2009|volume=189|issue=3|pages=253–259|doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.06.851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

===Hydrothermal===
Cobalt oxide is often obtained by [[hydrothermal synthesis]] in an autoclave.&lt;ref name=Witt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whittingham|first1=M Stanley|title=Hydrothermal synthesis of transition metal oxides under mild conditions|journal=Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science|date=April 1996|volume=1|issue=2|pages=227–232|doi=10.1016/S1359-0286(96)80089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[One-pot synthesis|One-pot]] hydrothermal synthesis of metal oxide hollow spheres starts with carbohydrates and metal salts dissolved in water at 100-200&amp;nbsp;°C.  The reaction produces carbon spheres, with metal ions integrated into the hydrophobic shell.  The carbon cores are removed by [[calcination]], leaving hollow metal oxide spheres.

A drawback of this approach is a smaller yield compared to other methods.

Another route to the synthesis of cobalt oxide nanoparticles is the thremaldecomposition of organometallic compounds.

Like most reactive cobalt compounds, cobalt oxide nanoparticles are toxic to humans and also aquatic life.

The '''colloidal probe technique''' is commonly used to measure interaction forces acting between [[colloid|colloidal particles]] and/or planar surfaces in air or in solution. This technique relies on the use of an [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM). However, instead of a [[cantilever]] with a sharp AFM tip, one uses the ''colloidal probe''. The colloidal probe consists of a colloidal particle of few micrometers in diameter that is attached to an AFM cantilever. The colloidal probe technique can be used in the ''sphere-plane'' or ''sphere-sphere'' geometries (''see figure''). One typically achieves a force resolution between 1 and 100 pN and a distance resolution between 0.5 and 2 [[nanometers|nm]].

The colloidal probe technique has been developed in 1991 independently by Ducker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ducker|first1=William A.|last2=Senden|first2=Tim J.|last3=Pashley|first3=Richard M.|title=Direct measurement of colloidal forces using an atomic force microscope|journal=Nature|volume=353|issue=6341|year=1991|pages=239–241|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/353239a0|bibcode=1991Natur.353..239D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Butt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butt|first1=Hans-Jürgen|title=Measuring electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydration forces in electrolyte solutions with an atomic force microscope|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=60|issue=6|year=1991|pages=1438–1444|issn=0006-3495|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(91)82180-4|bibcode=1991BpJ....60.1438B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its development this tool has gained wide popularity in numerous research laboratories, and numerous reviews are available in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=butt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butt|first1=Hans-Jürgen|last2=Cappella|first2=Brunero|last3=Kappl|first3=Michael|title=Force measurements with the atomic force microscope: Technique, interpretation and applications|journal=Surface Science Reports|volume=59|issue=1-6|year=2005|pages=1–152|issn=0167-5729|doi=10.1016/j.surfrep.2005.08.003|bibcode=2005SurSR..59....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ralston&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralston|first1=John|last2=Larson|first2=Ian|last3=Rutland|first3=Mark W.|last4=Feiler|first4=Adam A.|last5=Kleijn|first5=Mieke|title=Atomic force microscopy and direct surface force measurements (IUPAC Technical Report)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=77|issue=12|year=2005|issn=1365-3075|doi=10.1351/pac200577122149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=borkovec&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borkovec|first1=Michal|last2=Szilagyi|first2=Istvan|last3=Popa|first3=Ionel|last4=Finessi|first4=Marco|last5=Sinha|first5=Prashant|last6=Maroni|first6=Plinio|last7=Papastavrou|first7=Georg|title=Investigating forces between charged particles in the presence of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes with the multi-particle colloidal probe technique|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=179-182|year=2012|pages=85–98|issn=0001-8686|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2012.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative techniques to measure force between surfaces involve the [[surface forces apparatus]], [[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|total internal reflection microscopy]], and [[optical tweezers]] techniques to with video microscopy.

==Purpose==
The possibility to measure forces involving particles and surfaces directly is essential since such forces are relevant in a variety of processes involving colloidal and polymeric systems. Examples include [[particle aggregation]], suspension rheology, [[particle deposition]], and adhesion processes. One can equally study similar biological phenomena, such as deposition of [[bacteria]] or the infection of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] by [[virus]]es. Forces are equally most informative to investigate the mechanical properties of [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]], [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]], capsules, [[membrane]]s, or [[cell wall]]s. Such measurements permit to make conclusions about the elastic or plastic deformation or eventual rupture in such systems.

The colloidal probe technique provides a versatile tool to measure such forces between a colloidal particle and a planar substrate or between two colloidal particles (see figure above). The particles used in such experiments have typically a diameter between 1–10 μm. Typical applications involve measurements of electrical [[double layer forces]] and the corresponding surface potentials or [[surface charge]], [[van der Waals force]]s, or forces induced by adsorbed polymers.&lt;ref name=butt /&gt;&lt;ref name=borkovec /&gt;&lt;ref name=larson&gt;I. {{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Ian|last2=Drummond|first2=Calum J.|last3=Chan|first3=Derek Y. C.|last4=Grieser|first4=Franz|title=Direct Force Measurements between Dissimilar Metal Oxides|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=99|issue=7|year=1995|pages=2114–2118|issn=0022-3654|doi=10.1021/j100007a048}}; {{cite journal|last1=Toikka|first1=Gary|last2=Hayes|first2=Robert A.|last3=Ralston|first3=John|title=Surface Forces between Spherical ZnS Particles in Aqueous Electrolyte|journal=Langmuir|volume=12|issue=16|year=1996|pages=3783–3788|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la951534u}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
The colloidal probe technique uses a standard [[atomic force microscope|AFM]] for the force measurements. But instead the AFM cantilever with an attached sharp tip one uses the ''colloidal probe''. This colloidal probe is normally obtained by attaching a colloidal particle to a cantilever. By recording the deflection of the cantilever as a function of the vertical displacement of the AFM scanner one can extract the force acting between the probe and the surface as a function of the surface separation. This type of AFM operation is referred to as the ''force mode''. With this probe, one can study interactions between various surfaces and probe particles in the ''sphere-plane geometry''. It is also possible to study forces between colloidal particles by attaching another particle to the substrate and perform the measurement in the ''sphere-sphere geometry'', see figure above.
[[File:Colloidal Probe Force Measurement.png|thumb|left|350px|Principle of the force measurements by the colloidal probe technique. Illustration of the scanner displacement ''D'', cantilever deflection ''ξ'', and lever signal ''S''.]]

The force mode used in the colloidal probe technique is illustrated in the figure on the left. The scanner is fabricated from [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric crystals]], which enable its positioning with a precision better than 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm. The scanner is lifted towards the probe and thereby one records the scanner displacement ''D''. At the same time, the deflection of the cantilever ''ξ'' is monitored as well, typically with a comparable precision. One measures the deflection by focusing a light beam originating from a non-coherent laser diode to the back of the cantilever and detecting the reflected beam with a split [[photodiode]]. The lever signal ''S'' represents the difference in the photocurrents originating from the two halves of the diode. The lever signal is therefore proportional to the deflection ''ξ''.

During an approach-retraction cycle, one records the lever signal ''S'' as a function of the vertical displacement ''D'' of the scanner. Suppose for the moment that the probe and the substrate are hard and non-deformable objects and that no forces are acting between them when they are not in contact. In such a situation, one refers to a ''hard-core repulsion''. The cantilever will thus not deform as long not being in contact with the substrate. When the cantilever touches the substrate, its deflection will be the same as the displacement of the substrate. This response is referred to as the ''constant compliance'' or contact region. The lever signal ''S'' as a function of the scanner displacement ''D'' is shown in the figure below. This graph consists of two straight lines resembling a hockey-stick. When the surfaces are not in contact, the lever signal will be denoted as ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This value corresponds to the non-deformed lever. In the constant compliance region, the lever signal is simply a linear function of the displacement, and can be represented as a straight line
: ''S'' = ''a'' ''D'' + ''b''
The parameters ''a'' and ''b'' can be obtained from a least-squares fit of the constant compliance region. The inverse slope ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is also referred to as the optical lever sensitivity. By inverting this relation for the lever signal ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which corresponds to the non-deformed lever, one can accurately obtain the contact point from ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''b'')/''a''. Depending on the substrate, the precision in determining this contact point is between 0.5–2&amp;nbsp;nm. In the constant compliance region, the lever deformation is given by
: ''ξ'' = (''S'' − ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/''a''
In this fashion, one can detect deflections of the cantilever with typical resolution of better than 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm.

[[File:Colloidal Probe Response Forces.png|thumb|right|500px|Response of the colloidal probe to different force profiles. The forces profiles are shown in top row, and the cantilever response in the bottom. From left to right: Hard-core repulsion, soft repulsion, and attraction.]]
Let us now consider the relevant situation where the probe and the substrate interact. Let us denote by ''F''(''h'') the force between the probe and the substrate. This force depends on the surface separation ''h''.
In equilibrium, this force is compensated by the restoring force of the spring, which is given by the [[Hooke's law]]
: ''F'' = ''k'' ''ξ''
where ''k'' is the spring constant of the cantilever. Typical spring constants of AFM cantilevers are in the range of 0.1−10 N/m. Since the deflection is monitored with a precision better 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm, one typically obtains a force resolution of 1−100 pN. The separation distance can be obtained from the displacement of the scanner and the cantilever deflection
: ''h'' = ''ξ'' + ''D'' − ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
Figure below illustrates how the cantilever responds to different force profiles. In the case of a soft repulsive force, the cantilever is repelled from the surface and only slowly approaches the constant compliance region. In such situations, it might be actually difficult to identify this region correctly. When the force is attractive, the cantilever is attracted to the surface and may become unstable. From stability considerations one finds that the cantilever will be unstable provided
: ''dF''/''dh'' &gt; ''k''
This [[instability]] is illustrated in the right panel of the figure on the right. As the cantilever approaches, the slope of the force curve increases. When the slope becomes larger than the spring constant of the cantilever, the cantilever jumps into contact when the slope of the force curve exceeds the force constant of the cantilever. Upon retraction, the same phenomenon happens, but the point where the cantilever jumps out is reached at a smaller separation. Upon approach and retraction, the system will show a [[hysteresis]]. In such situations, a part of the force profile cannot be probed. However, this problem can be avoided by using a stiffer cantilever, albeit at the expense of an inferior force resolution.

==Extensions==
The colloidal probes are normally fabricated by gluing a colloidal particle to a tip-less cantilever with a [[micromanipulator]] in air. The subsequent rewetting of the probe may lead to the formation of nanosized bubbles on the probe surface. This problem can be avoided by attaching the colloidal particles under wet conditions in AFM fluid cell to appropriately [[Surface modification|functionalized]] cantilevers.&lt;ref name=borkovec /&gt; While the colloidal probe technique is mostly utilized in the sphere-plane geometry, it can be also used in the sphere-sphere geometry.&lt;ref name=larson /&gt; The latter geometry further requires a lateral centering of the two particles, which can be either achieved with an optical microscope or an AFM scan. The results obtained in these two different geometries can be related with the [[Derjaguin approximation]].

The force measurements rely on an accurate value of the spring constant of the cantilever. This spring constant can be measured by different techniques.&lt;ref name=butt /&gt;&lt;ref name=ralston /&gt; The ''thermal noise'' method is the simplest to use, as it is implemented on most AFMs. This approach relies on the determination of the mean square amplitude of the cantilever displacement due to spontaneous [[thermal fluctuations]]. This quantity is related to the spring constant by means of the [[equipartition theorem]]. In the ''added mass method'' one attaches a series of metal beads to the cantilever and each case one determines the resonance frequency. By exploiting the relation for an [[harmonic oscillator]] between the resonance frequency and the mass added one can evaluate the spring constant as well. The ''frictional force method'' relies on measurement of the approach and retract curves of the cantilever through a viscous fluid. Since the hydrodynamic [[Drag (physics)|drag]] of a sphere close to a planar substrate is known theoretically, the spring constant of the cantilever can be deduced. The ''geometrical method'' exploits relations between the geometry of the cantilever and its elastic properties.

The separation is normally measured from the onset of the constant compliance region. While the relative surface separation can be determined with a resolution of 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm or better, the absolute surface separation is obtained from the onset of the constant compliance region. While this onset can be determined for solid samples with a precision between 0.5–2&amp;nbsp;nm, the location of this onset can be problematic for soft repulsive interactions and for deformable surfaces. For this reason, techniques have been developed to measure the surface separation independently (e.g., [[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|total internal reflection microscopy]], [[Interference reflection microscopy|reflection interference contrast microscopy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Walz|first2=John Y.|last3=Ducker|first3=William A.|title=Atomic Force Microscopy Colloid−Probe Measurements with Explicit Measurement of Particle−Solid Separation|journal=Langmuir|volume=20|issue=18|year=2004|pages=7616–7622|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la0497752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By scanning the sample with the colloidal probe laterally permits to exploit [[friction]] forces between the probe and the substrate.&lt;ref name=ralston /&gt; Since this technique exploits the [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] of the cantilever, to obtain quantitative data the torsional spring constant of the cantilever must be determined.

A related technique involving similar type of force measurements with the AFM is the [[force spectroscopy|single molecular force spectroscopy]]. However, this technique uses a regular AFM tip to which a single polymer molecule is attached. From the retraction part of the force curve, one can obtain information about stretching of the polymer or its peeling from the surface.

A '''composite material''' (also called a '''composition material''' or shortened to '''composite,''' which is the common name) is a material made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different [[Physical property|physical]] or [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] that, when combined, produce a material with characteristics different from the individual components. The individual components remain separate and distinct within the finished structure, differentiating composites from [[mixture]]s and [[solid solution]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazeli|first1=M.|last2=Florez|first2=J.|last3=Simão|first3=R.|title=Improvement in adhesion of cellulose fibers to the thermoplastic starch matrix by plasma treatment modification|journal=Composites Part B: Engineering|date=9 November 2018|volume=163|doi=10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.11.048|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359836818327793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

common examples include materials which are stronger, lighter, or less expensive when compared to traditional materials.

More recently, researchers have also begun to actively include sensing, actuation, computation and communication into composites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6228/1261689.abstract |first1=M.

Composite materials are generally used for [[building]]s, [[bridge]]s, and [[structure]]s such as [[boat hulls]], [[swimming pool panels]], [[racing car]] bodies, [[shower]] stalls, [[bathtub]]s, [[storage tanks]], [[imitation]] [[granite]] and [[cultured marble]] [[sink]]s and countertops.

The most advanced examples perform routinely on [[spacecraft]] and [[aircraft]] in demanding environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazeli|first1=M.|last2=Keley|first2=M.|last3=Biazar|first3=E.|title=Preparation and characterization of starch-based composite films reinforced by cellulose nanofibers|journal=international Journal of Biological Macromolecules|date=2 May 2018|volume=116|doi=10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.04.186|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813018308754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest  man-made composite materials were [[straw]] and [[mud]] combined to form [[brick]]s for [[building]] [[construction]]. Ancient [[Brick#Mud bricks|brick-making]] was documented by [[Art of Ancient Egypt#Painting|Egyptian tomb paintings]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Vitruvius specifies a ratio of 1 part lime to 3 parts pozzolana for cements used in buildings and a 1:2 ratio of lime to pulvis Puteolanus for underwater work, essentially the same ratio mixed today for concrete used at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Lechtman and Linn Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution", ''Ceramics and Civilization Volume 3: High Technology Ceramics: Past, Present, Future'', edited by W.D.

* One of the most common and familiar composite is [[fibreglass]], in which small glass fibre are embedded within a polymeric material (normally an epoxy or polyester). The glass fibre is relatively strong and stiff (but also brittle), whereas the polymer is ductile (but also weak and flexible). Thus the resulting fibreglass is relatively stiff, strong, flexible, and ductile.

===Composite materials ===
[[File:Concrete aggregate grinding.JPG|thumb|Concrete is a mixture of cement and aggregate, giving a robust, strong material that is very widely used.]]
[[File:Spruce plywood.JPG|thumb|Plywood is used widely in construction]]

[[Concrete]] is the most common artificial composite material of all and typically consists of loose stones (aggregate) held with a matrix of [[cement]]. Concrete is an inexpensive material, and will not compress or shatter even under quite a large compressive force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constructionknowledge.net/concrete/concrete_basics.php |title=Slabs On Grade |publisher=Construction Knowldegs.net |accessdate=January 3, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002174044/http://www.constructionknowledge.net/concrete/concrete_basics.php |archivedate=October 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, concrete cannot survive tensile loading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconstructor.org/practical-guide/concrete-under-tension/6805/ |title=Behaviour of Concrete Under Tension |publisher=The Constructor |accessdate=January 3, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104192350/https://theconstructor.org/practical-guide/concrete-under-tension/6805/ |archivedate=January 4, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;(i.e., if stretched it will quickly break apart). Therefore, to give concrete the ability to resist being stretched, steel bars, which can resist high stretching forces, are often added to concrete to form [[reinforced concrete]].

[[Fibre-reinforced plastic|Fibre-reinforced polymers]] (FRP)s include [[carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer]] (CFRP) and [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP). If classified by matrix then there are [[thermoplastic composites]], [[short fiber thermoplastics|short fibre thermoplastics]], [[long fibre thermoplastic]]s or long fibre-reinforced thermoplastics. There are numerous [[thermoset]] composites, including [[paper composite panels]]. Many advanced [[thermoset polymer matrix]] systems usually incorporate [[aramid]] [[fibre]] and [[carbon fibre]] in an [[epoxy resin]] matrix.

[[Shape memory polymer]] composites are high-performance composites, formulated using fibre or fabric reinforcement and shape memory polymer resin as the matrix. Since a shape memory polymer resin is used as the matrix, these composites have the ability to be easily manipulated into various configurations when they are heated above their [[activation temperature]]s and will exhibit high strength and stiffness at lower temperatures.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} They can also be reheated and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} These composites are ideal{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} for applications such as lightweight, rigid, deployable structures; rapid manufacturing; and dynamic reinforcement.

[[High strain composite structure|High strain composites]] are another type of high-performance composites that are designed to perform in a high deformation setting and are often used in deployable systems where structural flexing is advantageous.{{citation needed|date =August 2017}} Although high strain composites exhibit many similarities to shape memory polymers, their performance is generally dependent on the fibre layout as opposed to the resin content of the matrix.

Composites can also use metal fibres reinforcing other metals, as in [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMC) or [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|ceramic matrix composites]] (CMC), which includes [[bone mineral|bone]] ([[hydroxyapatite]] reinforced with [[collagen]] fibres), [[cermet]] (ceramic and metal) and [[concrete]]. Ceramic matrix composites are built primarily for [[fracture toughness]], not for strength. Another class of composite materials involve woven fabric composite consisting of longitudinal and transverse laced yarns. Woven fabric composites are flexible as they are in form of fabric.

Organic matrix/ceramic aggregate composites include [[asphalt concrete]], [[polymer concrete]], [[mastic asphalt]], [[mastic roller hybrid]], [[dental composite]], [[syntactic foam]] and [[nacre|mother of pearl]]. [[Chobham armour]] is a special type of [[composite armour]] used in military applications.

Additionally, thermoplastic composite materials can be formulated with specific metal powders resulting in materials with a density range from 2 g/cm³ to 11 g/cm³ (same density as lead). The most common name for this type of material is "high gravity compound" (HGC), although "lead replacement" is also used. These materials can be used in place of traditional materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, brass, bronze, copper, lead, and even tungsten in weighting, balancing (for example, modifying the centre of gravity of a tennis [[racquet]]), vibration damping, and radiation shielding applications. High density composites are an economically viable option when certain materials are deemed hazardous and are banned (such as lead) or when secondary operations costs (such as machining, finishing, or coating) are a factor.

A [[sandwich-structured composite]] is a special class of composite material that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff skins to a lightweight but thick core. The core material is normally low strength material, but its higher thickness provides the sandwich composite with high [[bending]] [[stiffness]] with overall low [[density]].

Wood is a naturally occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] matrix. [[Engineered wood]] includes a wide variety of different products such as wood fibre board, [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]], [[wood plastic composite]] (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), [[Pykrete]] (sawdust in ice matrix), Plastic-impregnated or [[Plastic-coated paper|laminated paper]] or textiles, [[Arborite]], [[Formica (plastic)]] and [[Micarta]]. Other engineered laminate composites, such as [[Mallite]], use a central core of end grain [[balsa wood]], bonded to surface skins of light [[alloy]] or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.

Particulate composites have particle as filler material dispersed in matrix, which may be nonmetal, such as glass, epoxy. Automobile tire is an example of particulate composite.

Advanced diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated polymer composites have been reported&lt;ref name="ZiaShah2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zia|first1=Abdul Wasy|last2=Shah|first2=Atta Ur Rehman|last3=Lee|first3=Seunghun|last4=Song|first4=Jung Il|title=Development of diamond-like-carbon coated abaca-reinforced polyester composites for hydrophobic and outdoor structural applications|journal=Polymer Bulletin|volume=72|issue=11|year=2015|pages=2797–2808|issn=0170-0839|doi=10.1007/s00289-015-1436-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the coating increases the surface hydrophobicity, hardness and wear resistance.

=== Products ===

Fibre-reinforced composite materials have gained popularity (despite their generally high cost) in high-performance products that need to be lightweight, yet strong enough to take harsh loading conditions such as [[aerospace]] components ([[empennage|tail]]s, [[wing]]s, [[fuselage]]s, [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s), boat and [[scull]] hulls, [[bicycle]] frames and [[racing car]] bodies. Other uses include [[fishing rod]]s, [[storage tank]]s, swimming pool panels, and [[Composite baseball bat|baseball bats]]. The [[Boeing 787]] and [[Airbus A350]] structures including the wings and fuselage are composed largely of composites. Composite materials are also becoming more common in the realm of [[orthopedic surgery]], and it is the most common hockey stick material.

Carbon composite is a key material in today's launch vehicles and [[heat shield]]s for the [[re-entry]] phase of [[spacecraft]]. It is widely used in solar panel substrates, antenna reflectors and yokes of spacecraft. It is also used in payload adapters, inter-stage structures and heat shields of [[launch vehicle]]s. Furthermore, [[disk brake]] systems of [[airplane]]s and racing cars are using [[carbon/carbon]] material, and the [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|composite material]] with [[carbon fibre]]s and [[silicon carbide]] matrix has been introduced in [[luxury vehicle]]s and [[sports car]]s.

In 2006, a fibre-reinforced composite pool panel was introduced for in-ground swimming pools, residential as well as commercial, as a non-corrosive alternative to galvanized steel.

In 2007, an all-composite military [[Humvee]] was introduced by TPI Composites Inc and Armor Holdings Inc, the first all-composite [[military vehicle]]. By using composites the vehicle is lighter, allowing higher payloads. In 2008, carbon fibre and [[DuPont]] Kevlar (five times stronger than steel) were combined with enhanced thermoset resins to make military transit cases by ECS Composites creating 30-percent lighter cases with high strength.

Pipes and fittings for various purpose like transportation of potable water, fire-fighting, irrigation, seawater, desalinated water, chemical and industrial waste, and sewage are now manufactured in glass reinforced plastics.

Composite materials used in tensile structures for facade application provides the advantage of being translucent. The woven base cloth combined with the appropriate coating allows better light transmission. This provides a very comfortable level of illumination compared to the full brightness of outside.

== Overview ==
[[File:Cfk heli slw.jpg|thumb|upright| Carbon fibre composite part.]]

Composites are made up of individual materials referred to as constituent materials. There are two main categories of constituent materials: '''matrix''' ([[binder (material)|binder]]) and '''reinforcement'''. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials, while the wide variety of matrix and strengthening materials allows the designer of the product or structure to choose an optimum combination.

Engineered composite materials must be formed to shape. The matrix material can be introduced to the reinforcement before or after the reinforcement material is placed into the [[Molding (process)|mould]] cavity or onto the mould surface. The matrix material experiences a melding event, after which the part shape is essentially set. Depending upon the nature of the matrix material, this melding event can occur in various ways such as chemical [[polymerization]] for a [[thermoset polymer matrix]], or solidification from the melted state for a thermoplastic polymer matrix composite.

A variety of moulding methods can be used according to the end-item design requirements. The principal factors impacting the methodology are the natures of the chosen matrix and reinforcement materials. Another important factor is the gross quantity of material to be produced. Large quantities can be used to justify high capital expenditures for rapid and automated manufacturing technology. Small production quantities are accommodated with lower capital expenditures but higher labour and tooling costs at a correspondingly slower rate.

Many commercially produced composites use a [[polymer]] matrix material often called a resin solution. There are many different polymers available depending upon the starting raw ingredients. There are several broad categories, each with numerous variations. The most common are known as [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], [[epoxy]], [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]], [[polyimide]], [[polyamide]], [[polypropylene]], [[PEEK]], and others. The reinforcement materials are often fibres but also commonly ground minerals. The various methods described below have been developed to reduce the resin content of the final product, or the fibre content is increased. As a rule of thumb, lay up results in a product containing 60% resin and 40% fibre, whereas vacuum infusion gives a final product with 40% resin and 60% fibre content. The strength of the product is greatly dependent on this ratio.

Martin Hubbe and Lucian A Lucia consider [[wood]] to be a natural composite of [[cellulose fibre]]s in a [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] of [[lignin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327013842/http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-27 |title=The "love-hate" relationship present in lignocellulosic materials |last1=Hubbe |first1=Martin A. |last2=Lucia |first2=Lucian A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Hon and Nobuo Shiraishi, eds. (2001) Wood and cellulose chemistry, 2nd ed. (New York: Marcel Dekker), p. 5 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituents==

===Matrices===

====Organic====

Polymers are common matrices (especially used for fibre reinforced plastics). Road surfaces are often made from [[asphalt concrete]] which uses [[bitumen]] as a matrix. Mud (wattle and daub) has seen extensive use. Typically, most common polymer-based composite materials, including [[fibreglass]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[Kevlar]], include at least two parts, the substrate and the resin.

Polyester resin tends to have yellowish tint, and is suitable for most backyard projects. Its weaknesses are that it is UV sensitive and can tend to degrade over time, and thus generally is also coated to help preserve it. It is often used in the making of surfboards and for marine applications. Its hardener is a peroxide, often MEKP (methyl ethyl ketone peroxide).  When the peroxide is mixed with the resin, it decomposes to generate free radicals, which initiate the curing reaction.  Hardeners in these systems are commonly called catalysts, but since they do not re-appear unchanged at the end of the reaction, they do not fit the strictest chemical definition of a catalyst.

[[Vinyl ester resin]] tends to have a purplish to bluish to greenish tint. This resin has lower viscosity than polyester resin and is more transparent. This resin is often billed as being fuel resistant, but will melt in contact with gasoline. It tends to be more resistant over time to degradation than polyester resin and is more flexible. It uses the same hardeners as polyester resin (at a similar mix ratio) and the cost is approximately the same.

Epoxy resin is almost transparent when cured. In the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material or as a structural glue.

[[Shape memory polymer]] (SMP) resins have varying visual characteristics depending on their formulation. These resins may be epoxy-based, which can be used for auto body and outdoor equipment repairs; cyanate-ester-based, which are used in space applications; and acrylate-based, which can be used in very cold temperature applications, such as for sensors that indicate whether perishable goods have warmed above a certain maximum temperature.  These resins are unique in that their shape can be repeatedly changed by heating above their [[glass transition]] temperature (T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''). When heated, they become flexible and elastic, allowing for easy configuration. Once they are cooled, they will maintain their new shape. The resins will return to their original shapes when they are reheated above their T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''. The advantage of shape memory polymer resins is that they can be shaped and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties. These resins can be used in fabricating shape memory composites.

Traditional materials such as glues, muds have traditionally been used as matrices for [[papier-mâché]] and [[adobe]].

====Inorganic====

Cement (concrete), metals, ceramics, and sometimes glasses are employed. Unusual matrices such as ice are sometime proposed as in [[pykecrete]].

===Reinforcements===

====Fiber====
[[File:Glass reinforcements.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Differences in the way the fibres are laid out give different strengths and ease of manufacture]]
Reinforcement usually adds rigidity and greatly impedes crack propagation. Thin fibers can have very high strength, and provided they are mechanically well attached to the matrix they can greatly improve the composite's overall properties.

[[Fibre]]-reinforced composite materials can be divided into two main categories normally referred to as [[Short Fiber Reinforced Blends|short fibre-reinforced materials]] and continuous fiber-reinforced materials. Continuous reinforced materials will often constitute a layered or laminated structure. The woven and continuous fiber styles are typically available in a variety of forms, being pre-impregnated with the given matrix (resin), dry, uni-directional tapes of various widths, plain weave, harness satins, braided, and stitched.

The short and long fibres are typically employed in compression moulding and sheet moulding operations. These come in the form of flakes, chips, and random mate (which can also be made from a continuous fibre laid in random fashion until the desired thickness of the ply / laminate is achieved).

Common fibres used for reinforcement include [[glass (fiber)|glass fibres]],  carbon fibres, cellulose (wood/paper fibre and straw) and high strength polymers for example [[aramid]]. [[Silicon carbide]] fibers are used for some high temperature applications.

'''Particle'''

Particle reinforcement adds a similar effect to [[precipitation hardening]] in metals and ceramics.  Large particles impede dislocation movement and crack propagation as well as contribute to the composite's [[Young's modulus|Young's Modulus]].  In general, particle reinforcement effect on Young's Modulus lies between values predicted by

&lt;math&gt;E_c = \frac{E_\alpha E_\beta}{(V_\alpha E_\beta + V_\beta E_\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;

as a lower bound and

&lt;math&gt;E_c = V_\alpha E_\alpha + V_\beta E_\beta &lt;/math&gt;

as an upper bound.

Therefore it can be expressed as a linear combination of contribution from the matrix and some weighted contribution from the particles.

&lt;math&gt;E_c = V_m E_m + K_c V_p E_p&lt;/math&gt;

Where K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is an experimentally derived constant between 0 and 1.  This range of values for K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; reflects that particle reinforced composites are not characterized by the isostrain condition.

Similarly, the tensile strength can be modeled in an equation of similar construction where K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is a similarly bounded constant not necessarily of the same value of K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41932585|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|last=H.|first=Courtney, Thomas|date=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0070285942|edition= 2nd |location=Boston|oclc=41932585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(T.S.)_c = V_m (T.S.)_m + K_s V_p (T.S.)_p&lt;/math&gt;

The true value of K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; vary based on factors including particle shape, particle distribution, and particle/matrix interface. Knowing these parameters, the mechanical properties can be modeled based on effects from [[grain boundary strengthening]], [[Work hardening|dislocation strengthening]], and [[Precipitation hardening|Orowan strengthening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=24 December 2013|title=Effects of particle/matrix interface and strengthening mechanisms on the mechanical properties of metal matrix composites|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15685543.2014.872914|journal=Composite Interfaces|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common particle reinforced composite is concrete, which is a mixture of gravel and sand usually strengthened by addition of small rocks or sand.  Metals are often reinforced with [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics]] to increase strength at the cost of [[ductility]].  Finally polymers and rubber are often reinforced with carbon black, commonly used in auto tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/bohr/mse209/chapter17.htm|title=Chapter 17. Composites|website=www.virginia.edu|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cores===
Many composite layup designs also include a co-curing or post-curing of the prepreg with various other media, such as honeycomb or foam. This is commonly called a [[Sandwich structured composite|sandwich structure]]. This is a more common layup for the manufacture of radomes, doors, cowlings, or non-structural parts.

Open- and closed-cell-structured [[foam]]s like [[polyvinylchloride]], [[polyurethane]], [[polyethylene]] or [[polystyrene]] foams, [[balsa|balsa wood]], [[syntactic foam]]s, and [[composite honeycomb|honeycomb]]s are commonly used core materials. Open- and closed-cell [[metal foam]] can also be used as core materials. Recently, 3D graphene structures ( also called graphene foam) have also been employed as core structures. A recent review by Khurram and Xu et al., have provided the summary of the state-of-the-art techniques for fabrication of the 3D structure of graphene, and the examples of the use of these foam like structures as a core for their respective polymer composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khurram|first1=Shehzad|last2=Xu|first2=Yang|last3=Chao|first3=Gao|last4=Xianfeng|first4=Duan|title=Three-dimensional macro-structures of two-dimensional nanomaterials|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=45|issue=20|pages=5541|date=2016|doi=10.1039/C6CS00218H|pmid=27459895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fabrication methods ==
Fabrication of composite materials is accomplished by a wide variety of techniques, including: 
*[[Advanced fiber placement|Advanced fibre placement]] (Automated fibre placement)
*[[Tailored fiber placement|Tailored fibre placement]]
*[[Fiberglass spray lay-up process|fibreglass spray lay-up process]]
*[[Filament winding]]
*[[Lanxide process]]
*[[Tufting (composites)|Tufting]]
*[[Z-pinning]]

Composite fabrication usually involves wetting, mixing or saturating the [[Composite reinforcement|reinforcement]] with the [[Composite matrix|matrix]], and then causing the matrix to bind together (with heat or a chemical reaction) into a rigid structure. The operation is usually{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} done in an open or closed forming mold, but the order and ways of introducing the ingredients varies considerably.

===Mold overview===
Within a mold, the reinforcing and matrix materials are combined, compacted, and cured (processed) to undergo a melding event. After the melding event, the part shape is essentially set, although it can deform under certain process conditions. For a [[thermoset polymer matrix]] material, the melding event is a curing reaction that is initiated by the application of additional heat or chemical reactivity such as an organic peroxide. For a thermoplastic polymeric matrix material, the melding event is a solidification from the melted state. For a metal matrix material such as titanium foil, the melding event is a fusing at high pressure and a temperature near the melting point.

For many moulding methods, it is convenient to refer to one mould piece as a "lower" mould and another mould piece as an "upper" mould. Lower and upper refer to the different faces of the moulded panel, not the mould's configuration in space. In this convention, there is always a lower mould, and sometimes an upper mould. Part construction begins by applying materials to the lower mould. Lower mould and upper mould are more generalized descriptors than more common and specific terms such as male side, female side, a-side, b-side, tool side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc. Continuous manufacturing uses a different nomenclature.

The moulded product is often referred to as a panel. For certain geometries and material combinations, it can be referred to as a casting. For certain continuous processes, it can be referred to as a profile.

===Vacuum bag moulding===
Vacuum bag moulding uses a flexible film to enclose the part and seal it from outside air. Vacuum bag material is available in a tube  shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure  compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging  materials, the edges of the vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould.  When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a [[Aspirator (pump)|venturi vacuum]] and air compressor.

A vacuum bag is a bag made of strong [[rubber]]-coated [[fabric]] or a polymer film used to compress the part during cure or hardening.  In some applications the bag encloses the entire material, or in other applications a [[mold]] is used to form one face of the laminate with the bag being a single layer to seal to the outer edge of the mold face.
When using a tube shaped bag, the ends of the bag are sealed and the air is drawn out of the bag through a nipple using a [[vacuum pump]].  As a result, uniform pressure approaching one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] is applied to the surfaces of the object inside the bag, holding parts together while the [[adhesive]] [[Curing (chemistry)|cures]].  The entire bag may be placed in a temperature-controlled oven, oil bath or water bath and gently heated to accelerate curing.

Vacuum bagging is widely used in the composites industry as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/what-is-vacuum-bagging/|title=What is Vacuum Bagging?|publisher=Coventive Composites|accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[carbon (fibre)|Carbon fibre]] fabric and [[glass (fibre)|fibreglass]], along with resins and epoxies are common materials laminated together with a vacuum bag operation.

;Woodworking applications
In commercial woodworking facilities, vacuum bags are used to laminate curved and irregular shaped workpieces.

Typically, polyurethane or vinyl materials are used to make the bag. A tube shaped bag  is open at both ends. The piece, or pieces to be glued are placed into the bag and the ends sealed. One method of sealing the open ends of the bag is by placing a clamp on each end of the bag. A plastic rod is laid across the end of the bag, the bag is then folded over the rod. A plastic sleeve with an opening in it, is then snapped over the rod. This procedure forms a seal at both ends of the bag, when the vacuum is ready to be drawn.

A "platen" is sometimes used inside the bag for the piece being glued to lie on. The platen has a series of small slots cut into it, to allow the air under it to be evacuated. The platen must have rounded edges and corners to prevent the vacuum from tearing the bag.

When a curved part is to be glued in a vacuum bag, it is important that the pieces being glued be placed over a solidly built form, or have an air bladder placed under the form. This air bladder has access to "free air" outside the bag. It is used to create an equal pressure under the form, preventing it from being crushed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Vacuum_Systems_pg_4_-_Vacuum_bags.html|title=  Vacuum Bags For Woodworking|deadurl=  no|archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20100928231703/http://prowoodworkingtips.com/Vacuum_Systems_pg_4_-_Vacuum_bags.html|archivedate=  2010-09-28|df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pressure bag moulding ===
This process is related to vacuum bag molding in exactly the same way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a flexible male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite [[helmets]] due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.

=== Autoclave moulding ===
A process using a two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include continuous fibre forms fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin in the form of [[Pre-preg|prepreg]] fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The upper mould is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]]. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.

=== Resin transfer moulding (RTM) ===
RTM is a process using a rigid two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. The mould is typically constructed from aluminum or steel, but composite molds are sometimes used.  The two sides fit together to produce a mould cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin transfer moulding is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the mould set is closed prior to the introduction of matrix material. Resin transfer moulding includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity. These variations include everything from the RTM methods used in [[out of autoclave composite manufacturing]] for high-tech aerospace components to vacuum infusion (for resin infusion see also [[boat building]]) to vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding (VARTM). This process can be performed at either [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] or elevated temperature and is suitable for manufacturing high performance composite components in medium volumes (1,000s to 10,000s of parts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/resin-transfer-moulding-rtm/|accessdate=2018-10-01||title=What is Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)?|publisher=Coventive Composites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light Resin Transfer Molding (LRTM) ===
Similar to the methods performed in Resin Transfer Molding, Light Resin Transfer Molding (Light RTM) involves a closed mold process. A vacuum holds mold A and mold B together to result in two finished sides with fixed thickness levels. Vacuum rings around the tools hold the molds together for this process after dry fiber reinforcements are loaded into mold A before joining with mold B. The air is vacuumed out of the molds with a lower vacuum level, separate from the tooling. After the air is removed the resin is injected into the part. The vacuum remains in effect into the resin is cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coppsindustries.com/epoxy-products/composite-materials|title=Composite Epoxy Resin Manufacturing - Copps Industries|work=Copps Industries|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other fabrication methods===
Other types of fabrication include press moulding, [[transfer moulding]], [[pultrusion]] moulding, [[filament winding]], [[casting]], centrifugal casting, [[continuous casting]] and [[slip forming]]. There are also forming capabilities including [[Numerical control|CNC]] filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, [[compression moulding]], and [[thermoplastic]] moulding, to name a few. The use of curing ovens and paint booths is also needed for some projects.

==== Finishing methods====
The finishing of the composite parts is also critical in the final design.  Many of these finishes will include rain-erosion coatings or polyurethane coatings.

=== Tooling ===
The mold and mold inserts are referred to as "tooling." The mold/tooling can be constructed from a variety of materials. Tooling materials include [[invar]], steel, [[aluminium]], reinforced [[silicone rubber]], [[nickel]], and [[carbon fibre]]. Selection of the tooling material is typically based on, but not limited to, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]], expected number of cycles, end item tolerance, desired or required surface condition, method of cure, [[glass transition temperature]] of the material being moulded, moulding method, matrix, cost and a variety of other considerations.

== Physical properties ==
[[File:Composite elastic modulus.svg|thumb|Plot of the overall strength of a composite material as a function of fiber volume fraction limited by the upper bound (isostrain) and lower bound (isostress) conditions.]]
The physical properties of composite materials are generally not [[isotropic]] (independent of direction of applied force) in nature, but they are typically [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] (different depending on the direction of the applied force or load). For instance, the stiffness of a composite panel will often depend upon the orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The strength of a composite is bounded by two loading conditions as shown in the plot to the right. If both the fibres and matrix are aligned parallel to the loading direction, the deformation of both phases will be the same (assuming there is no delamination at the fibre-matrix interface). This isostrain condition provides the upper bound for composite strength, and is determined by the rule of mixtures:
[[File:Isostress and isostrain conditions for composite materials.gif|thumb|Figure a) shows the isostress condition where the composite materials are perpendicular to the applied force and b) is the isostrain condition that has the layers parallel to the force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyoung Seop|date=2000-09-30|title=On the rule of mixtures for the hardness of particle reinforced composites|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921509300009096|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: A|volume=289|issue=1|pages=30–33|doi=10.1016/S0921-5093(00)00909-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
&lt;math&gt;E_C = \sum_{i=1} V_iE_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the effective composite [[Young's modulus|Young’s modulus]], and ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the volume fraction and Young’s moduli, respectively, of the composite phases.

For example, a composite material made up of α and β phases as shown in the figure to the right under isostrain, the Young's modulus would be as follows:&lt;math display="block"&gt;E_C=V_\alpha E_\alpha+V_\beta E_\beta&lt;/math&gt;where V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; are the respective volume fractions of each phase.

The lower bound is dictated by the isostress condition, in which the fibres and matrix are oriented perpendicularly to the loading direction:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{E_C} = \sum_{i=1}\frac{V_i}{E_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Following the example above, if one had a composite material made up of α and β phases under isostress conditions as shown in the figure to the right, the composition Young's modulus would be:&lt;math display="block"&gt;E_C=(E_\alpha E_\beta)/(V_\alpha E_\beta+V_\beta E_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;The isostrain condition implies that under an applied load, both phases experience the same strain but will feel different stress. Comparatively, under isostress conditions both phases will feel the same stress but the strains will differ between each phase.
Though composite stiffness is maximized when fibres are aligned with the loading direction, so is the possibility of fibre tensile fracture, assuming the tensile strength exceeds that of the matrix. When a fibre has some angle of misorientation θ, several fracture modes are possible. For small values of θ the stress required to initiate fracture is increased by a factor of (cos θ)&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; due to the increased cross-sectional area (''A'' cos θ) of the fibre and reduced force (''F/''cos θ) experienced by the fibre, leading to a composite tensile strength of ''σ&lt;sub&gt;parallel &lt;/sub&gt;/''cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; θ where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;parallel &lt;/sub&gt;'' is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres aligned parallel with the applied force.

Intermediate angles of misorientation θ lead to matrix shear failure. Again the cross sectional area is modified but since shear stress is now the driving force for failure the area of the matrix parallel to the fibres is of interest, increasing by a factor of 1/sin θ. Similarly, the force parallel to this area again decreases (''F/''cos θ) leading to a total tensile strength of ''τ&lt;sub&gt;my&lt;/sub&gt; /''sinθ cosθ where ''τ&lt;sub&gt;my&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the matrix shear strength.

Finally, for large values of θ (near π/2) transverse matrix failure is the most likely to occur, since the fibres no longer carry the majority of the load. Still, the tensile strength will be greater than for the purely perpendicular orientation, since the force perpendicular to the fibres will decrease by a factor of 1/sin θ and the area decreases by a factor of 1/sin θ producing a composite tensile strength of ''σ&lt;sub&gt;perp&lt;/sub&gt; /''sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;perp &lt;/sub&gt;'' is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres align perpendicular to the applied force.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Composite Strength as a Function of Fiber Misalignment.png|thumb|The graph depicts the three fracture modes a composite material may experience depending on the angle of misorientation relative to aligning fibres parallel to the applied stress.]]

The majority of commercial composites are formed with random dispersion and orientation of the strengthening fibres, in which case the composite Young’s modulus will fall between the isostrain and isostress bounds. However, in applications where the strength-to-weight ratio is engineered to be as high as possible (such as in the aerospace industry), fibre alignment may be tightly controlled.

Panel stiffness is also dependent on the design of the panel. For instance, the fibre reinforcement and matrix used, the method of panel build, thermoset versus thermoplastic, and type of weave.

In contrast to composites, isotropic materials (for example, aluminium or steel), in standard wrought forms, typically have the same stiffness regardless of the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures for an isotropic material can be described with the following material properties: Young's Modulus, the [[shear Modulus]] and the [[Poisson's ratio]], in relatively simple mathematical relationships. For the anisotropic material, it requires the mathematics of a second order tensor and up to 21 material property constants. For the special case of orthogonal isotropy, there are three different material property constants for each of Young's Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson's ratio—a total of 9 constants to describe the relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures.

Techniques that take advantage of the anisotropic properties of the materials include [[mortise and tenon]] joints (in natural composites such as wood) and [[Pi Joints]] in synthetic composites.

=== Failure ===
Shock, impact, or repeated cyclic stresses can cause the laminate to separate at the interface between two layers, a condition known as [[delamination]]. Individual fibres can separate from the matrix e.g. [[fiber pull-out|fibre pull-out]].

Composites can fail on the [[microscopic]] or [[macroscopic]] scale. Compression failures can occur at both the macro scale or at each individual reinforcing fibre in compression buckling. Tension failures can be net section failures of the part or degradation of the composite at a microscopic scale where one or more of the layers in the composite fail in tension of the matrix or failure of the bond between the matrix and fibres.

Some composites are brittle and have little reserve strength beyond the initial onset of failure while others may have large deformations and have reserve energy absorbing capacity past the onset of damage. The variations in fibres and matrices that are available and the [[mixture]]s that can be made with blends leave a very broad range of properties that can be designed into a composite structure.
The best known failure of a brittle ceramic matrix composite occurred when the carbon-carbon composite tile on the leading edge of the wing of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] fractured when impacted during take-off. It led to catastrophic break-up of the vehicle when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003.

Compared to metals, composites have relatively poor bearing strength.

=== Testing ===
To aid in predicting and preventing failures, composites are tested before and after construction. Pre-construction testing may use [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) for ply-by-ply analysis of curved surfaces and predicting wrinkling, crimping and dimpling of composites.&lt;ref name="Waterman"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:F-15E CFT.jpg|thumb|Ground crew handling the CFT of an F-15E.]]

'''Conformal fuel tanks''' (CFTs) are additional [[fuel tank]]s fitted closely to the profile of an aircraft that extend either the range or "time on station" of the aircraft. CFTs have a reduced aerodynamic penalty compared to external [[drop tank]]s, and do not significantly increase an aircraft's [[radar cross-section]]. Another advantage of CFTs provide is that they do not occupy ordnance [[hardpoint]]s like drop tanks, allowing the aircraft to carry its full payload.

Conformal fuel tanks have the disadvantage that, unlike drop tanks, they cannot be discarded in flight, because they are [[plumbing|plumbed]] into the aircraft and so can only be removed on the ground. As a result, they will impose a slight drag-penalty and minor weight gain on the aircraft even when the tanks are empty, without any benefit. They can also impose slight g-load limits, although not always an absolute issue, the CFTs on the F-15E actually allow the same maneuverability without g-limitations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15146">'''Digital image correlation and tracking''' is an optical method that employs tracking and image registration techniques for accurate 2D and 3D measurements of changes in images. This method is often used to measure full-field [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]] and [[strain (materials science)|strain]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and it is widely applied in many areas of science and engineering, with new applications being found all the time.  Compared to strain gages and extensometers, the amount of information gathered about the fine details of deformation during mechanical tests is increased manifold. 

==Overview==
Digital image correlation (DIC) techniques have been increasing in popularity, especially in [https://www.researchmicrospeckle.com/ micro- and nano-scale mechanical testing] applications due to its relative ease of implementation and use.  Advances in computer technology and digital cameras have been the enabling technologies for this method and while white-light optics has been the predominant approach, DIC can be and has been extended to almost any imaging technology.

The concept of using [[cross-correlation]] to measure shifts in datasets has been known for a long time, and it has been applied to digital images since at least the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;P. E. Anuta, "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4043437 Spatial registration of multispectral and multitemporal digital imagery using fast Fourier transform techniques]", IEEE Trans. Geosci. Electron., vol. GE-8, p. 353–368, Oct. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Keating, P. R. Wolf, and F. L. Scarpace, "An Improved Method of Digital Image Correlation", ''Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing'' 41(8): 993–1002, (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The present-day applications are almost innumerable and include image analysis, image compression, velocimetry, and strain estimation. Much early work in DIC in the field of mechanics was led by researchers at the University of South Carolina in the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Chu, W. F. Ranson, M. A. Sutton, W. H. Peters, Exp. Mech. 25 (1985), 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Bruck, S. R. McNeill, M. A. Sutton, W. H. Peters III, Exp. Mech. 29 (1989), 261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Peters, W. F. Ranson, Opt. Eng. 21 (1982), 427.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been optimized and improved in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. M. A. Sutton, J.-J. Orteu, H. W. Schreier, Book - Image Correlation for Shape, Motion and Deformation Measurements, Hardcover {{ISBN|978-0-387-78746-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, DIC relies on finding the maximum of the correlation array between pixel intensity array subsets on two or more corresponding images, which gives the integer translational shift between them. It is also possible to estimate shifts to a finer resolution than the resolution of the original images, which is often called "subpixel" registration because the measured shift is smaller than an integer pixel unit. For subpixel interpolation of the shift, there are other methods that do not simply maximize the correlation coefficient. An iterative approach can also be used to maximize the interpolated correlation coefficient by using nonlinear optimization techniques. The nonlinear optimization approach tends to be conceptually simpler, but as with most nonlinear optimization techniques {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, it is quite slow, and the problem can sometimes be reduced to a much faster and more stable linear optimization in phase space. 

The two-dimensional discrete cross correlation &lt;math&gt;r_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined several ways, one possibility being:

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{ij} = \frac{\sum_m \sum_n [f(m+i,n+j)-\bar{f}][g(m,n)-\bar{g}]}{\sqrt{\sum_m \sum_n {[f(m,n)-\bar{f}]^2} \sum_m \sum_n {[g(m, n)-\bar{g}]^2}}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''f''(''m'', ''n'') is the pixel intensity or the gray-scale value at a point (''m'', ''n'') in the original image, ''g''(''m'', ''n'') is the gray-scale value at a point (''m'', ''n'') in the translated image, &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; are mean values of the intensity matrices ''f'' and ''g'' respectively. 

However, in practical applications, the correlation array is usually computed using Fourier-transform methods, since the [[fast Fourier transform]] is a much faster method than directly computing the correlation.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \mathcal{F}\{f\}, \quad \mathbf{G} = \mathcal{F}\{g\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then taking the [[complex conjugate]] of the second result and multiplying the [[Fourier transform]]s together elementwise, we obtain the Fourier transform of the correlogram, &lt;math&gt;\ R&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; R = \mathbf{F} \circ \mathbf{G}^*,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hadamard_product_(matrices)|Hadamard product]] (entry-wise product). It is also fairly common to normalize the magnitudes to unity at this point, which results in a variation called ''[[phase correlation]]''.

Then the cross-correlation is obtained by applying the inverse Fourier transform:

:&lt;math&gt;\ r = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{R\}.&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, the coordinates of the maximum of &lt;math&gt;r_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; give the integer shift:

:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta x, \Delta y) = \arg\max_{(i, j)}\{r\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Deformation mapping==

For deformation mapping, the mapping function that relates the images can be derived from comparing a set of subwindow pairs over the whole images. (Figure 1). The coordinates or grid points (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) are related by the translations that occur between the two images. If the deformation is small and perpendicular to the optical axis of the camera, then the relation between (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) can be approximated by a 2D affine transformation such as:

:&lt;math&gt;x^* = x + u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\Delta x + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\Delta y,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y^* = y + v + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\Delta x + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\Delta y.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''u'' and ''v'' are translations of the center of the sub-image in the ''X'' and ''Y'' directions respectively. The distances from the center of the sub-image to the point (''x'', ''y'') are denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the correlation coefficient ''r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a function of displacement components (''u'', ''v'') and displacement gradients 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y},\frac{\partial v}{\partial x},\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:dic fundamentals.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Basic concept of deformation mapping by DIC]]

DIC has proven to be very effective at mapping deformation in macroscopic mechanical testing, where the application of specular markers (e.g. paint, toner powder) or surface finishes from machining and polishing provide the needed contrast to correlate images well.  However, these methods for applying surface contrast do not extend to the application of freestanding thin films for several reasons.  First, vapor deposition at normal temperatures on semiconductor grade substrates results in mirror-finish quality films with RMS roughnesses that are typically on the order of several nanometers.  No subsequent polishing or finishing steps are required, and unless electron imaging techniques are employed that can resolve microstructural features, the films do not possess enough useful surface contrast to adequately correlate images.  Typically this challenge can be circumvented by applying paint that results in a random speckle pattern on the surface, although the large and turbulent forces resulting from either spraying or applying paint to the surface of a freestanding thin film are too high and would break the specimens.  In addition, the sizes of individual paint particles are on the order of μms, while the film thickness is only several hundred nanometers, which would be analogous to supporting a large boulder on a thin sheet of paper.

Very recently, advances in pattern application and deposition at reduced length scales have exploited small-scale synthesis methods including nano-scale chemical surface restructuring and photolithography of computer-generated random specular patterns to produce suitable surface contrast for DIC.  The application of very fine powder particles that electrostatically adhere to the surface of the specimen and can be digitally tracked is one approach.  For Al thin films, fine alumina abrasive polishing powder was initially used since the particle sizes are relatively well controlled, although the adhesion to Al films was not very good and the particles tended to agglomerate excessively.  The candidate that worked most effectively was a silica powder designed for a high temperature adhesive compound (Aremco, inc.), which was applied through a plastic syringe.  A light blanket of powder would coat the gage section of the tensile sample and the larger particles could be blown away gently.  The remaining particles would be those with the best adhesion to the surface.  While the resulting surface contrast is not ideal for DIC, the high intensity ratio between the particles and the background provide a unique opportunity to track the particles between consecutive digital images taken during deformation.  This can be achieved quite straightforwardly using digital image processing techniques. Subpixel tracking can be achieved by a number of correlation techniques, or by fitting to the known intensity profiles of particles.  Photolithography and Electron Beam Lithography can be used to create micro tooling for [https://www.researchmicrospeckle.com/ micro speckle stamps], and the [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309285995_Micro_Speckle_Stamping_High_Contrast_No_Basecoat_Repeatable_Well-Adhered stamps can print speckle patterns onto the surface of the specimen].  Stamp inks can be chosen which are appropriate for optical DIC, SEM-DIC, and [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321494116_Selectively_Electron-Transparent_Microstamping_Toward_Concurrent_Digital_Image_Correlation_and_High-Angular_Resolution_Electron_Backscatter_Diffraction_EBSD_Analysis simultaneous SEM-DIC/[[Electron backscatter diffraction|EBSD]] studies] (the ink can be transparent to EBSD)&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles TJ,Bomarito GF, Cannon AH, and Hochhalter JD, "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321494116_Selectively_Electron-Transparent_Microstamping_Toward_Concurrent_Digital_Image_Correlation_and_High-Angular_Resolution_Electron_Backscatter_Diffraction_EBSD_Analysis Selectively Electron-Transparent Microstamping Toward Concurrent Digital Image Correlation and High-Angular Resolution Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) Analysis]", Microscopy and Microanalysis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Digital volume correlation==

Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) is a related analysis method with close ties to 2D-DIC. 3D-DIC successfully maps 3D deformations, but it does so by capturing planar images of the surface of a body only. The DVC algorithm is able to track full-field displacement information in the form of voxels instead of pixels. The theory is similar to above except that another dimension is added: the z-dimension. Instead of minimizing a coefficient based on the summed difference of intensity values in a subset of a planar image, minimization is done in a 3D-subset where intensity values corresponding to (x,y,z) values are compared to a standard and the summed difference minimized using predictive, 3D displacement fields.&lt;ref name="Bay"&gt;Bay BK, Smith TS, Fyhrie DP, Saad M (1999) Digital volume correlation: Three-dimensional strain mapping using X-ray Tomography. Exp Mech 39(3):217–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

DVC can be done on any image dataset that represents a volume. The most popular way to do this currently is to use a sectioning microscope to take consecutive images at incremental depths. These images can then be reconstructed into a 3D matrix of intensity values representing the volume. For accurate calculation, it is required that a distinctly original 3D voxel pattern be captured so that minimization will settle on the proper values. This requires low noise levels and unique markers within the imaged volume.&lt;ref name="Jianyong"&gt;Jianyong Huang, Xiaochang Pan, Shanshan Li, Xiaoling Peng, Chunyang Xiong, and Jing Fang (2011) A Digital Volume Correlation Technique for 3-D Deformation Measurements of Soft Gels. International Journal of Applied Mechanics 3(2) 335-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental DVC method is still being developed and optimized for speed and reliability. The first proposition of DVC was in 1999 by the authors Bay, Smith, Fyhrie, and Saad.&lt;ref name="Bay" /&gt; This group used [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray Tomography]] to image volumes that could then be correlated using the DVC algorithm which they developed in theory. Since then the method has grown in acceptance and has expanded to different imaging techniques. To date it has been used with [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|Computer Tomography]] (CT), and [[X-ray microtomography|microCT]]. Recently, the technique has been expanded by the development of [[confocal microscopy]], which allows for the imaging and testing of live tissue samples with techniques such as [[Second-harmonic generation|Second-Harmonic Generation]] (SHG) and [[Two-photon excitation microscopy]]. DVC is currently considered to be ideal in the research world for 3D quantization of local displacements, strains, and stress in biological specimens. It is preferred because of the non-invasiveness of the method over traditional experimental methods.&lt;ref name="Jianyong" /&gt;

'''Crustal evolution''' involves the formation, destruction and renewal of the rocky outer shell at the [[Earth]]'s surface.

The variation in composition within the Earth's crust is much greater than other [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial planets]]. [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and other planetary bodies have relatively quasi-uniform crusts unlike that of the Earth which contains both oceanic and continental plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albarède|first=Francis|last2=Blichert-Toft|first2=Janne|date=2007-12-19|title=The split fate of the early Earth, Mars, Venus, and Moon|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642761|journal=Geochemistry (Cosmochemistry)|volume=339|issue=14–15|pages=917–927|doi=10.1016/j.crte.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique property reflects the complex series of crustal processes that have taken place throughout the planet's history, including the ongoing process of [[plate tectonics]].

The proposed mechanisms, regarding Earth's crustal evolution, take a theory-orientated approach. Fragmentary geologic evidence and observations provide the basis for hypothetical solutions to problems relating to the early Earth system. Therefore a combination of these theories creates both a framework of current understanding and also a platform for future study.

== Early crust ==

=== Mechanisms of early crust formation ===
The early Earth was entirely molten. This was due to high temperatures created and maintained by the following processes:

* Compression of the early atmosphere
* Rapid axial rotation
* Regular impacts with neighbouring planetesimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EIrwxgpc9GsC|title=Historical Geology: Understanding Our Planet's Past|last=Erickson|first=Jon|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438109640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] remained hotter than modern day temperatures throughout the [[Archean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-01|title=A great thermal divergence in the mantle beginning 2.5 Ga: Geochemical constraints from greenstone basalts and komatiites|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116000311|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=543–553|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.01.006|issn=1674-9871|last1=Condie|first1=Kent C.|last2=Aster|first2=Richard C.|last3=Van Hunen|first3=Jeroen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the Earth began to cool as [[planetary accretion]] slowed and heat stored within the [[magma ocean]] was lost to space through [[radiation]].

A theory for the initiation of magma solidification states that once cool enough, the cooler base of the magma ocean would begin to crystallise first. This is because pressure of 25GPa at the surface cause the [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] to lower.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-09-15|title=Early Earth differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X04004285|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=225|issue=3–4|pages=253–269|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.07.008|issn=0012-821X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a thin 'chill-crust' at the extreme surface would provide thermal insulation to the shallow sub surface, keeping it warm enough to maintain the mechanism of crystallisation from the deep magma ocean.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Phasediagram.png|thumb|310x310px|A phase diagram showing the order of crystallisation within the early mantle to form the early crust. 

An [[Adiabatic process|adiabat]] represents a change of temperature with pressure if no heat was lost through convection.

The early mantle adiabats show crystallisation took place from from the base; above approximately 25GPa (deep mantle) perovskites would begin to crystallise, below 25GPa (upper mantle) olivine would crystallise.]]

The composition of the crystals produced during the crystallisation of the magma ocean varied with depth. Experiments involving the melting of [[peridotite]] magma show that deep in the ocean (&gt;≈700m), the main mineral present would be Mg-[[perovskite]]. Whereas [[olivine]] would dominate in the shallower areas along with its high pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s e.g. [[garnet]] and [[majorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-06-15|title=Melting experiments of mantle materials under lower mantle conditions with implications for magma ocean differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920104000718|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=143-144|pages=397–406|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2003.09.016|issn=0031-9201|last1=Ito|first1=E.|last2=Kubo|first2=A.|last3=Katsura|first3=T.|last4=Walter|first4=M.J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing theory to the formation of the first continental crust is through intrusive [[pluton]]ic volcanism. The product of these eruptions formed a hot, thick lithosphere which underwent regular cycling with the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=Generation of felsic crust in the Archean: A geodynamic modeling perspective|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030192681500337X|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=271|pages=198–224|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2015.10.005|issn=0301-9268|last1=Sizova|first1=E.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.|last3=Stüwe|first3=K.|last4=Brown|first4=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat released by this form of volcanism, as well as assisting [[mantle convection]], increased the geothermal gradient of the early crust.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-01|title=Early Earth plume-lid tectonics: A high-resolution 3D numerical modelling approach|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370716300503|journal=Journal of Geodynamics|language=en|volume=100|pages=198–214|doi=10.1016/j.jog.2016.03.004|issn=0264-3707|last1=Fischer|first1=R.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crustal dichotomy ==
Crustal dichotomy represents the distinct contrast in composition and nature of the oceanic and continental plates, which together form the overall crust.

=== Timing ===
Oceanic and continental crusts are, at the present day, produced and maintained through plate tectonic processes. However the same mechanisms are unlikely to have produced the crustal [[dichotomy]] of the early lithosphere. This is thought to be true on the basis that sections of the thin, low density continental lithosphere could not have been sub-ducted under each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequently, a proposed relative timing for crustal dichotomy is put forward stating that dichotomy took place before the commencement of global plate tectonics. This is so a difference in crustal density could be established to facilitate plate subduction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1980-02-01|title=Crustal evolution of the early earth: The role of major impacts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301926880900121|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=3–4|pages=195–216|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(80)90012-1|issn=0301-9268|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert|hdl=2060/19790015389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation ===
[[File:Complex Impact Crater Formation.png|thumb|Development of a the base of an impact crater on the Earth's surface showing infill of basaltic partial melts from mantle. This solidified to form the early differentiated oceanic crust.|317x317px]]
==== Impact cratering ====
Large and numerous impact craters can be recognised on planetary bodies across the Solar System. These craters are thought to date back to a period where there was an increased frequency and intensity of asteroid impacts with terrestrial planets, known as the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which terminated approximately 4Ga.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/collections/pjfmznbgbx|title=Bombardment of the early Solar System : Nature Geoscience|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal goes on, claiming the Earth would have also sustained the same relative intensity of cratering as other planetesimals in the [[Solar System]]. It is therefore only due to Earth's high erosional rates and constant plate tectonics that the craters are not visible today. By scaling up the number and size of impact craters seen on the Moon to fit the size of Earth, it is predicted that at least 50% of the Earth's initial crust was covered in impact basins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This estimate provides a lower limit of the effect impact cratering had on the Earth's surface. 

======&lt;small&gt;Effects&lt;/small&gt;======
The main effects of impact cratering on the early lithosphere were:

* Formation of large craters. [[Isostasy|Isostatic rebound]] would adjust the depth of the craters making them relatively shallow in comparison to their diameter;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1977-10-01|title=Origin of the Earth's ocean basins|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103577900641|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=235–250|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(77)90064-1|issn=0019-1035|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; some reaching 4&amp;nbsp;km deep and 1000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Topography|Topographic]] division between the low-lying impact basins and the now elevated surface.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Release in pressure at the surface from the removal of [[overburden]]. This produced a greater increase in temperature with depth below the surface. Increased surface temperatures caused the [[partial melting]] of mantle which erupted and deposited within the surface basins. The [[pyrolite]] mantle would have produced [[basalt]]ic partial melts, compositionally contrasting to the existing [[sial]]ic crust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The magnitude of these impacts is interpreted, with a high level of uncertainty, to have converted roughly half of the 'continental' crust into terrestrial [[Lunar mare|maria]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Stuart Ross|date=1989-04-20|title=Growth of planetary crusts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195189901510|journal=Tectonophysics|language=en|volume=161|issue=3–4|pages=147–156|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90151-0|issn=0040-1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore providing a method for the formation of crustal dichotomy, as seen today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Types of crust ==

==== Primordial crust ====
The initial crystallisation of minerals from the [[magma ocean]] formed the primordial crust. 

A potential explanation of this process states the resultant solidification of the mantle edge took place approximately 4.43Ga. This would subsequently produce continents composed of [[komatiite]], an ultramafic rock rich in [[magnesium]] with a high melting point and low [[dynamic viscosity]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nna-Mvondo|first=Delphine|last2=Martinez-Frias|first2=Jesus|date=2007-02-15|title=Review komatiites: from Earth's geological settings to planetary and astrobiological contexts|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|language=en|volume=100|issue=3–4|pages=157–179|doi=10.1007/s11038-007-9135-9|issn=0167-9295|hdl=10261/8082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of research follows up on this, proposing that differences in the densities of newly formed crystals caused separation of crustal rocks; upper crust largely composed of fractionated [[gabbro]]s and lower crust composed of [[anorthosite]]s.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Santosh|first1=M.|last2=Arai|first2=T.|last3=Maruyama|first3=S.|date=2017-03-01|title=Hadean Earth and primordial continents: The cradle of prebiotic life|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116300834|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=309–327|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.07.005|issn=1674-9871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall result of initial crystallisation formed a primordial crust roughly 60&amp;nbsp;km in depth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The lack of certainty regarding the formation of primordial crust is due to there being no remaining present day examples. This is due to Earth's high erosional rates and the [[subduction]] and subsequent destruction of tectonic plates throughout its 4.5 Ga history.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Furthermore, during its existence the primordial crust is thought to have been regularly broken and re-formed by impacts involving other planetesimals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This continued for several hundred million years after [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], which concluded approximately 4.4Ga.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The outcome of this would be the constant alteration in the composition of the primordial crust, increasing the difficulty in determining its nature.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

==== Secondary crust ====
Recycling of existing primordial crust contributes to the production of secondary crust. Partial melting of the existing crust increases the [[mafic]] content of the melt producing basaltic secondary crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L8OM3NDrttsC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=secondary+crust#v=onepage&amp;q=secondary%20crust&amp;f=false|title=Earth as an Evolving Planetary System|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|date=2011-08-25|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123852274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further method of formation due to the decay of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] elements within the Earth releasing heat energy and eventually causing the partial melting of upper mantle, also producing basaltic lavas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RtC-nQEACAAJ|title=The Continental Crust: Its Composition and Evolution|last=Taylor|first=Stuart Ross|date=1985|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most secondary crust on Earth is formed at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid ocean ridges]] forming the oceanic crust.

==== Tertiary crust ====
The present day continental crust is an example of a tertiary crust. Tertiary crust is the most differentiated type of crust and so has a composition vastly different to that of the bulk Earth.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S. R.|last2=McLennan|first2=S. M.|date=1985-01-01|title=The continental crust: Its composition and evolution|language=English|osti=6582885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tertiary crust contains over 20% of the abundance of [[incompatible element]]s, which are elements a size or charge that prevent them from being included in mineral structure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This a result of its generation from the subduction and partial melting of secondary crust where it undergoes further [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallisation]]. Two stages of evolution produce an increased proportion of incompatible elements.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Initiation of plate tectonics ==
[[File:Plumeinducedsubduction.png|thumb|357x357px|A schematic evolutionary diagram showing the impact of a mantle plume on the early lithosphere (dark blue) and surface proto-crust (brown). This initiated subduction and subsequent global plate tectonics within a previously unseparated lithosphere that had no lateral surface movement.Modified from &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-12-01|title=Subduction initiation by thermal–chemical plumes: Numerical studies|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920108001581|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=171|issue=1-4|pages=296–312|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.06.032|issn=0031-9201}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Plume induced subduction ===
The formation and development of [[Mantle plume|plumes]] in the early mantle contributed to triggering the lateral movement of crust across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kröner|first=A.|last2=Layer|first2=P. W.|date=1992-06-05|title=Crust Formation and Plate Motion in the Early Archean|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/256/5062/1405|journal=Science|language=en|volume=256|issue=5062|pages=1405–1411|doi=10.1126/science.256.5062.1405|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17791608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of upwelling mantle plumes on the lithosphere can be seen today through local depressions around [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] such as [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]. The scale of this impact is much less than that exhibited in the Archean eon where mantle temperatures were much greater. Localised areas of hot mantle rose to the surface through a central plume wedge, weakening the damaged and already thin lithosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once the plume head breaks the surface, crust either side of the head is forced downwards through the conservation of mass, initiating subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X14002391|journal=Gondwana Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=38–63|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.07.011|issn=1342-937X|last1=Whattam|first1=Scott A.|last2=Stern|first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical modelling shows only strongly energetic plumes are capable of weakening the lithosphere enough to rupture it, such plumes would have been present in the hot Archean mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerya|first=T. V.|last2=Stern|first2=R. J.|last3=Baes|first3=M.|last4=Sobolev|first4=S. V.|last5=Whattam|first5=S. A.|date=2015-11|title=Plate tectonics on the Earth triggered by plume-induced subduction initiation|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15752#ref8|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=527|issue=7577|pages=221–225|doi=10.1038/nature15752|pmid=26560300|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-tectonic subduction can also be inferred from the internal volcanism on Venus. [[Artemis Corona]] is a large plume formed by the upwelling of mantle derived magma and is on a scale potentially comparable to that in the [[Archean]] mantle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Models using its known characteristics showed that continued magmatism from [[Thermal conduction|conductive]] heat through the plume caused gravitational collapse. The weight of collapse caused the spreading of the surrounding crust outwards and subsequent subduction around the margins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Kranendonk|first=Martin J|date=2010|title=Two types of Archean continental crust: Plume and plate tectonics on early Earth|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/310/10/1187.full.pdf+html|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=310|pages=1187–1209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anhydrous]] nature of the crust on Venus prevents it from sliding past each other, whereas through the study of oxygen isotopes, the presence of water on Earth can be confirmed from 4.3Ga.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-07-15|title=Magmatic δ18O in 4400–3900 Ma detrital zircons: A record of the alteration and recycling of crust in the Early Archean|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05002773|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=235|issue=3–4|pages=663–681|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.04.028|issn=0012-821X|last1=Cavosie|first1=A.J.|last2=Valley|first2=J.W.|last3=Wilde|first3=S.A.|last4=e.i.m.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this model helps provide a mechanism for how plate tectonics could have been triggered on Earth, although it does not demonstrate that subduction was initiated at the earliest confirmed presence of water on Earth. Based on these models, the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is dated at 3.6Ga.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Late Heavy Bombardment ===
Impact cratering also had consequences for both the development of plume-induced subduction and the establishment of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The steepening of geothermal gradients could have directly enhanced convective mantle transport which now beneath an increasingly fractured lithosphere could have created stresses great enough to cause rifting and the separation of crust into plates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Crustal growth rates ==
[[File:Growthcurve.png|thumb|331x331px|Plots showing the rate of continental crustal growth over time as a percentage of the total mass, along with associated thickness of the newly generated crust. The plot of crustal reworking represents the amount of post formational alteration undergone by the crust. The dramatic increase in crustal reworking and reduction in the rate of crustal growth at approximately 3.6Ga represents the onset of subduction and plate tectonics. Modified from &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;]]

=== Lithological dating ===
Crustal growth rates can be used to calculate estimates for the age of the continental crust. This can be done through analysis of [[igneous rock]]s with the same [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition as initial mantle rock. These igneous rocks are dated and assumed to be direct evidence of new continental crust formation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resulting ages of isotopically juvenile igneous rocks give distinct peaks, representing an increased proportion of igneous rock and therefore increased crust growth, at 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Ga. The validity of these results is questioned as the peaks could represent periods of preservation rather than increased continental crust generation. This is reinforced by the fact that such peaks are not observed in recent geologic time where it is given that [[magmatism]] resulting from the plate subduction has strongly contributed to producing new crust.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=C. J.|last2=Kemp|first2=A. I. S.|date=2006-10-19|title=Evolution of the continental crust|journal=Nature|volume=443|issue=7113|pages=811–817|doi=10.1038/nature05191|issn=1476-4687|pmid=17051208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustal growth rates from igneous rocks can be compared to the rates generated from [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic]] isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks. Projections of growth rates using these techniques does not produce staggered peaks, instead smooth shallow curves presenting a more constant rate of crustal growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although representative of large periods of time, limitations are found where samples do not solely represent magmatic production events. Instead samples include the mixing of sediments which produces a mix of original and altered isotope ratios.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zircon dating ===
[[Zircon]] minerals can be both [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] grains from sedimentary rocks and crystals in igneous rocks. Therefore, a combination of zircon forms can provide a more accurate estimate of crustal growth rates. Further to this, zircon minerals can be subject to [[Hafnium|Hf]] and [[Oxygen|O]] isotope ratio analysis.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is important as Hf isotopes indicate whether a rock originates from the mantle or an existing rock. High δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values of zircons represent rock recycled at the Earth's surface and thus potentially producing mixed samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condie|first=K. C.|date=2014-06|title=Growth of continental crust: a balance between preservation and recycling|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/minmag/article/78/3/623/85695/growth-of-continental-crust-a-balance-between|journal=Mineralogical Magazine|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=623–637|doi=10.1180/minmag.2014.078.3.11|issn=0026-461X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this combined analysis is valid zircons showing periods of increased crustal generation at at 1.9 and 3.3Ga, the latter of which representing the time period following the commencement of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Class III designation is reserved for natural monuments that are "protected areas managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features". Or, "areas containing one, or more, specific natural or natural/cultural features which is of outstanding or unique value because of its inherent rarity, representative or aesthetic qualities or cultural significance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/protected_areas/categories/index.html United Nations Environment Programme Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1426">'''Empresa Eléctrica del Ecuador''' (literally ''Electric Company of Ecuador'') or '''Emelec''' was the name of an [[Ecuador]]ian [[Electrical power industry|electric company]] based in the city of [[Guayaquil]].

Until 2004, it was owned by [[Fernando Aspiazu]] who used to be president of [[Banco del Progreso]], Ecuador's second largest bank that was closed in March 1999. In 2004, Emelec had debts of $400 million with the Ecuadorian state and $800 million with state-owned ''Centro Nacional de Control de Energía'' (Cenace). Therefore, in 2004, the government of [[Alfredo Palacio]] confined by decree the administration of Emelec's actives for five years to ''Corporación para la Administración Temporal Eléctrica de Guayaquil'' (CATEG; literally ''Corporation for the Temporal Electric Administration of Guayaquil''), an entity administrated by Venezuelan power company [[Electricidad de Valencia]] (Eleval), whose main duty beside supplying energy is debt collection from EMELEC's private debtors.

A group of employees of EMELEC founded the sports club [[Club Sport Emelec]] in 1929, which nowadays is known for one of Ecuador's top soccer teams.

The '''empty lattice approximation''' is a theoretical [[electronic band structure]] model in which the potential is ''periodic'' and ''weak'' (close to constant). One may also consider an empty{{clarify|is there actually some lattice that is "empty"?|date=November 2014}} irregular lattice, in which the potential is not even periodic.&lt;ref&gt;Physics  Lecture Notes. P.Dirac, Feynman,R.,1968. Internet, Amazon,25.03.2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The empty lattice approximation describes a number of properties of energy dispersion relations of non-interacting [[Free electron model|free electrons]] that move through a [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. The energy of the electrons in the "empty lattice" is the same as the energy of free electrons. The model is useful because it clearly illustrates a number of the sometimes very complex features of energy dispersion relations in solids which are fundamental to all electronic band structures.
__TOC__

==Scattering and periodicity==
[[Image:1D-Empty-Lattice-Approximation.svg|thumb|400px|Free electron bands in a one dimensional lattice]]
The periodic potential of the lattice in this free electron model must be weak because otherwise the electrons wouldn't be free. The strength of the scattering mainly depends on the geometry and topology of the system. Topologically defined parameters, like [[Scattering cross-section|scattering]] [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]], depend on the magnitude of the potential and the size of the [[potential well]]. For 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional spaces potential wells do always scatter waves, no matter how small their potentials are, what their signs are or how limited their sizes are. For a particle in a one-dimensional lattice, like the [[Kronig-Penney model]], it is possible to calculate the band structure analytically by substituting the values for the potential, the lattice spacing and the size of potential well.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;
{{cite book |author=C. Kittel |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |year= 1953–1976 |publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-49024-1 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; For two and three-dimensional problems it is more difficult to calculate a band structure based on a similar model with a few parameters accurately. Nevertheless, the properties of the band structure can easily be approximated in most regions by [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation methods]].

In theory the lattice is infinitely large, so a weak periodic scattering potential will eventually be strong enough to reflect the wave. The scattering process results in the well known [[Bragg's law|Bragg reflections]] of electrons by the periodic potential of the [[crystal structure]]. This is the origin of the periodicity of the dispersion relation and the division of [[Reciprocal lattice|k-space]] in Brillouin zones. The periodic energy dispersion relation is expressed
as:
:&lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k}) = \frac{\hbar^2 (\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{G}_n)^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors to which the bands{{clarify|date=November 2014}} &lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; belong.

The figure on the right shows the dispersion relation for three periods in reciprocal space of a one-dimensional lattice with lattice cells of length ''a''.
{{clear}}

==The energy bands and the density of states==
In a one-dimensional lattice the number of reciprocal lattice vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; that determine the bands in an energy interval is limited to two when the energy rises. In two and three dimensional lattices the number of reciprocal lattice vectors that determine the free electron bands &lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; increases more rapidly when the length of the wave vector increases and the energy rises. This is because the number of reciprocal lattice vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; that lie in an interval &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k} + d\mathbf{k}]&lt;/math&gt; increases. The [[density of states]] in an energy interval &lt;math&gt;[E,E + dE]&lt;/math&gt; depends on the number of states in an interval  &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k} + d\mathbf{k}]&lt;/math&gt; in reciprocal space and the slope of the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space]]
Though the lattice cells are not spherically symmetric, the dispersion relation still has spherical symmetry from the point of view of a fixed central point in a reciprocal lattice cell if the dispersion relation is extended outside the central Brillouin zone. The [[density of states#Parabolic dispersion|density of states]] in a three-dimensional lattice will be the same as in the case of the absence of a lattice. For the three-dimensional case the density of states &lt;math&gt;D_3\left(E\right)&lt;/math&gt; is;

:&lt;math&gt;D_3\left(E\right) = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{E-E_0}{c_k^3}} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In three-dimensional space the Brillouin zone boundaries are planes. The dispersion relations show conics of the free-electron energy dispersion parabolas for all possible reciprocal lattice vectors. This results in a very complicated set intersecting of curves when the dispersion relations are calculated because there is a large number of possible angles between evaluation trajectories, first and higher order Brillouin zone boundaries and dispersion parabola intersection cones.

{{clear}}

==Second, third and higher Brillouin zones==
[[Image:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|300px|right|FCC Brillouin zone]]
"Free electrons" that move through the lattice of a solid with wave vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; far outside the first Brillouin zone are still reflected back into the first Brillouin zone. See the [[#External links|external links]] section for sites with examples and figures.

{{clear}}

==The nearly free electron model==
{{main|Nearly free electron model}}
In most [[Metal|simple metals]], like [[aluminium]], the [[screening effect]] strongly reduces the electric field of the ions in the solid. The electrostatic potential is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;V(r) = \frac{Z e}{r} e^{-q r}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]], ''e'' is the elementary unit charge, ''r'' is the distance to the nucleus of the embedded ion and ''q'' is a screening parameter that determines the range of the potential. The [[Fourier transform]], &lt;math&gt;U_{\mathbf{G}}&lt;/math&gt;, of the lattice potential, &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;, is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;U_{\mathbf{G}} =  \frac{4 \pi Z e}{q^2 + \mathbf{G}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When the values of the off-diagonal elements &lt;math&gt;U_{\mathbf{G}}&lt;/math&gt; between the reciprocal lattice vectors in the Hamiltonian almost go to zero. As a result, the magnitude of the band gap &lt;math&gt;2|U_{\mathbf{G}}|&lt;/math&gt; collapses and the empty lattice approximation is obtained.

==The electron bands of common metal crystals==

Apart from a few exotic exceptions, [[metal]]s crystallize in three kinds of crystal structures: the BCC and FCC [[cubic crystal system|cubic crystal structures]] and the [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] close-packed [[close-packing of spheres#fcc and hcp lattices|HCP]] crystal structure.

[[File:2014-06-12 Tulpenfeld 4, Bonn IMG 5567.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Headquarters in Bonn]]

The '''Federal Network Agency''' ({{lang-de|Bundesnetzagentur}} or {{lang|de|BNetzA}}) is the German regulatory office for electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway markets. It is a federal [[government agency]] of the [[German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] and headquartered in [[Bonn]], Germany.

== Responsibilities ==

=== Telecommunications ===
In telecommunications, the agency  has the authority over the [[Telephone numbers in Germany|German telephone numbering plan]] and other technical number assignments. It also claims to regulate the telecommunication market, including termination fees and open access to subscriber lines and licenses telephone companies. Thus in return for significant license fees, just a few companies are permitted to regulate the nowadays vital area of telecommunication for both private individuals and businesses. But with barriers to entry to this lucrative market created by the high cost of licenses, only a small number of providers can enter. With competition stifled, prices and bandwidths bring huge profits for the service providers, to the disadvantage of users. The result is basic communication breakdown for those who attempt to change to a carrier offering better rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.computerbild.de/dsl-wlan/unendliche-geschichte-dsl-kunden-unzufrieden-service_83242.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this widespread failure to maintain services in terms of speed of registration and also actual communication bandwidth delivered, new laws have been passed which claim to bring clients in Germany into the same league as the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;pm_nummer=0014/13]&lt;/ref&gt; Until January 2013 those paying for and expecting to be able to use telephones and internet were powerless when the services failed to materialise, this new law is expected to give them a voice by allowing compensation claims a legitimate backing by the highest court in Germany. 

In [[radio|radio communications]], the Agency manages the [[radio frequency spectrum]], licenses broadcasting transmitters and detects [[radio interference]]s. Licensing [[radio station|radio]] and [[TV station]]s (that is, content providers), however, is the task of [[States of Germany|State]] authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tasks of the Federal Network Agency|author=Federal Network Agency|url=http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/enid/5333f1762a4a5da9f211546e95dce838,0/The_Agency/Functions_xk.html|accessdate=2010-03-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a root [[certificate authority]] for [[qualified signature]]s according to the German Signature Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite german law|defull=Gesetz über Rahmenbedingungen für elektronische Signaturen |de=Signaturgesetz|deab=SigG|en=Act on a Legal Framework for Electronic Signatures|link=sigg_2001|date=2001-05-16|pages=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postal Services ===
The Agency's responsibility in the post market include the licensing of companies for postal services and the observation of the market. It also regulates the market, assuring non-discrimintory access to some service facilities, such as [[PO box]]es.

=== Electricity and Gas ===
In the electricity and gas market, the Agency is responsible for ensuring non-discriminatory third-party access to networks and regulating the fees.

The Agency is not responsible for licensing energy companies. These tasks remain with authorities determined by [[States of Germany|State]] law.

=== Railway ===
In the area of [[Rail transport in Germany|railway traffic]], the Federal Network Agency is responsible for ensuring non-discriminatory access to railway infrastructure. This includes monitoring and regulating the train schedules, allocation of railway track slots, access to service facilities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/enid/30d3dbe8d4543b1ec45060697b229a78,0/Areas/Railway_Regulation_29e.html{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agency is not responsible for technical supervision and licensing of railway companies. These tasks remain with the [[Federal Railway Office]] ({{lang|de|Eisenbahn-Bundesamt}}, EBA).

== History ==
In the 1990s, the telecommunications and postal services in Germany were [[privatization|privatized]]. In 1994, the [[Deutsche Bundespost]], was privatised and split into [[Deutsche Post]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]], which remained under the supervision of the Federal Office for Post and Telecommunications ({{lang|de|Bundesamt für Post und Telekommunikation}}, BAPT). When the market was finally opened for competitors on 1 January 1998, the '''Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Posts''' ({{lang|de|Regulierungsbehörde für Telekommunikation und Post}}, {{lang|de|RegTP}}) was established, superseding the Federal Office as the supervisor for posts and telecommunications.

When the government decided to improve competition for the energy and railway markets as of 13 July 2005 and 1 January 2006, it found that the Regulatory Authority's expertise in enabling [[open access (infrastructure)|open access]] to telecommunication networks would also be useful in these infrastructure markets. To reflect these new competences, the authority was renamed to '''Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Posts and Railway''' ({{lang|de|Bundesnetzagentur für Elektrizität, Gas, Telekommunikation, Post und Eisenbahnen}}, {{lang|de|BNetzA}}).

==Governance==
===Presidents===
* Klaus-Dieter Scheurle (1998–2000)
* Matthias Kurth (2001–2012)
* [[Jochen Homann]] (2012–present)

===Advisory Council===
The Advisory Council consists of 16 members of the German [[Bundestag]] and 16 representatives of the German [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]; the Bundesrat representatives must be members or political representatives of the government of a federal state. The members and deputy members of the Advisory Council are appointed by the federal government upon the proposal of the German Bundestag and the German Bundesrat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">In [[population biology]] and [[demography]], the '''generation time''' is the average time between two consecutive generations in the lineages of a [[population]]. In human populations, the generation time typically ranges from 22 to 33 years.&lt;ref name="OECD2015" /&gt; [[Historian]]s sometimes use this to date events, by converting generations into years to obtain rough estimates of time.

== Definitions and corresponding formulas ==

The existing definitions of the generation time fall into two categories: those that treat the generation time as a renewal time of the population, and those that focus on the distance between individuals of one generation and the next. Below are the three most commonly used definitions:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;

=== The time it takes for the population to grow by a factor of its net reproductive rate ===

The [[net reproduction rate|net reproductive rate]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of offspring an individual is expected to produce during its lifetime (a net reproductive rate of 1 means that the population is at its demographic equilibrium). This definition envisions the generation time as a renewal time of the population. It justifies the very simple definition used in [[microbiology]] ("the time it takes for the population to double", or [[doubling time]]) since one can consider that during the exponential phase of bacterial growth mortality is very low and as a result a [[bacterium]] is expected to be replaced by two bacteria in the next generation (the mother cell and the daughter cell). If the population dynamic is exponential with a growth rate ''r'' (i.e. ''n''(''t'') ~ α.e&lt;sup&gt;''rt''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n''(''t'') is the size of the population at time ''t''), then this measure of the generation time is 
given by:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\log R_0}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt; is such that ''n''(''t'' + ''T'') = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''(''t''), i.e. e&lt;sup&gt;''rT''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== The average difference in age between parent and offspring ===

This definition is a measure of the distance between generations rather than a renewal time of the population. Since many demographic models are female-based (that is, they only take females into account), this definition is often expressed as a mother-daughter distance (the "average age of mothers at birth of their daughters"). However, it is also possible to define a father-son distance (average age of fathers at the birth of their sons) or not to take sex into account at all in the definition. In age-structured population models, an expression is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \int_0^{\infty} x e^{-rx} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''r'' is the growth rate of the population, ''ℓ''(''x'') is the survivorship function (probability that an individual survives to age ''x'') and ''m''(''x'') the maternity function (or birth function, or age-specific fertility). For [[matrix population models]], there is a general formula:&lt;ref name="BienvenuLegendre2015" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{ \lambda \mathbf{v w}}{\mathbf{v F w}} = \frac{1}{\sum e_{\lambda}(f_{ij})}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''λ'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; is the discrete-time growth rate of the population, '''F''' = (''f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'') is its fertility matrix, '''v''' its reproductive value (row-vector) and '''w''' its stable stage distribution (column-vector); the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle e_{\lambda}(f_{ij}) = \frac{f_{ij}}{\lambda} \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial f_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Elasticity of a function|elasticities]] of ''λ'' to the fertilities.

=== The age at which members of a given cohort are expected to reproduce ===

This definition is very similar to the previous one but the population need not be at its stable age distribution. Moreover, it can be computed for different cohorts and thus provides more information about the generation time in the population. This measure is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} x \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, the numerator is the sum of the ages at which a member of the cohort reproduces, and the denominator is  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the average number of offspring it produces.

''Highgate School Register 1833–1988''. (7th edition) p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a very young child he contracted [[meningitis]], a disease which threatened his life and thereafter created debilitating health problems which left him bed-ridden for  many days at a time, several times a year, until he had an operation at the age of 36 which cured the condition.&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;&lt;ref name=kathimerini&gt;Varvitsiotis, Eleni [http://www.kathimerini.gr/849472/article/proswpa/geyma-me-thn-k/giwrgos-logo8eths-panw-ap-ola-h-ellada-einai-ta-synora-ths-dyshs "George Logothetis: Above all, Greece is the border of the West"] (Greek).

==Career==
Logothetis started working at his father's shipping company, Lomar Shipping, in 1993 at the age of 18.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=84145977&amp;privcapId=84145892 George M.

Logothetis's philosophy from the start was to work hard, and then take three to five months off every five years to reflect about the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/video/2015/04/17/why-this-ceo-takes-5-months-off/ "Why this CEO takes 5 months off"] (video). ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. April 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During these hiatuses, he avoids work emails and phone calls, believing that "ideas need space to be born".&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=kostis&gt;Christodoulou, Kostis.

''News 247''. March 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On his first sabbatical, he traveled around Asia, and on his second, he did some university studies in New York City.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

During his three-month sabbatical in New York, the idea of diversification came to him.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; In 2003 Logothetis, with his brother Constantine, created and founded the [[Libra Group]], based in New York and London, in order to diversify and expand his company.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=wealthiest /&gt;

Between 2004 and 2007, during a boom in the shipping business, the Libra Group sold off most of Lomar's ships.&lt;ref name=returning&gt;Saul, Jonathan. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/greece-libra-investment-idUSL6N0BY6S020130307 "Interview - Conglomerate Libra sees investors returning to Greece"]. ''[[Reuters]]''. March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With the profit from the ship sales, the new company purchased a fleet of airplanes, which were at a cyclical low, and set up an aircraft leasing division, [[Lease Corporation International]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Logothetis repeated this successful "buy-low, sell-high" formula of going counter to prevailing market trends several times in the ensuing decade, building a large diversified multinational conglomerate out of what was once a small shipping company.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;&lt;ref name=returning /&gt;&lt;ref name=wealthiest /&gt;&lt;ref name=kostis /&gt;

"The idea behind Libra was to diversify away from shipping to create a global group, using the top lieutenants we had worked with in the preceding years", Logothetis told ''[[Reuters]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref name=returning /&gt; He told ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' he "took all the great people from our shipping business, and sent them around the world to start companies. We ended up with a ship's captain running a $200 million real estate company and a Russian fruit seller who runs six [[biogas]] plants in Latvia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/companies/2012/10/25/best-advice.fortune/19.html "George Logothetis: The best advice I ever got"]. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. October 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He later reiterated to [[BBC News]] how he expanded and diversified the company: "'We designed a framework of all the places in the world that we wanted to have an office and representation in. Next to each place we put the name of a person that we knew – a family member, a friend or an employee.' These people were sent out to different locations and given the chance to learn new businesses."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

In 2006, the Libra Group started expanding beyond aviation. Its new major ventures included real estate, hotels and hospitality, and renewable energy.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Diane.

Logothetis has been an advocate for and an investor in Greece during the [[Greek financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=dabilis /&gt;  And as a result of the crisis, he has become a sought-after business leader for his opinions on investing in Greece and in Greek assets, products, and industries. In June 2012, following prime minister [[Antonis Samaras]]'s election and instatement, he emphasized that the promise of governmental stability was bringing back  business confidence and individual confidence in Greece, and noted Libra Group's numerous recent and projected Greek investments and businesses.&lt;ref name=returning /&gt;&lt;ref name=dabilis /&gt; In March 2013, he cited Samaras's coalition government's relieving the Greek [[eurozone]] crisis as a reason investors were returning to, and should continue to return to, Greece.&lt;ref name=returning /&gt; In late 2013, he sounded a cautionary note concerning the "buying frenzy" occurring in the slump-ridden shipping sector.&lt;ref name=banks&gt;Saul, Jonathan.

The system was completed on time, on budget, and with no Lost Time Injuries demonstrating GlassPoint and PDO’s shared commitment to [[Occupational safety and health|health, safety, security and the environment]] (HSSE). During the first 12 months of operations, actual performance of the GlassPoint system matched output models within a few percent and steam production continues to exceed contracted performance targets. The system recorded 98.6% uptime and maintained regular operations during severe dust and [[Dust storm|sand storms]]. The automated roof-washing unit proved particularly effective in all weather events, restoring system performance overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction, Operations and Performance of the First Enclosed Trough Solar Steam Generation Pilot for EOR Applications|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/y8rdvhaiklt08yn/SPE%20169745%20Daniel%20Palmer%20OGWA.pdf|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineering|accessdate=27 June 2014|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project served as a performance and operational baseline for larger steam generators in Oman and provided PDO with valuable information for planning potential large-scale projects in the future.

In July 2015, Petroleum Development Oman and GlassPoint Solar announced that they signed an agreement to build a 1 GWth solar field. The total solar field will be 1.8KM and the total project will be 3KM. The project, named [[Miraah]], will be the world's largest solar field measured by peak thermal capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ironic Or Economic?

In August 2017, GlassPoint and its contractors crossed the threshold of 1.5 million man-hours worked without lost time injury (LTI) at Miraah.

In November 2017, GlassPoint and Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) completed construction on the first block of the Miraah solar plant safely on schedule and in line with budget, and successfully delivered steam to the Amal West oilfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171101005644/en/Petroleum-Development-Oman-GlassPoint-Announce-Commencement-Steam|title=Petroleum Development Oman and GlassPoint Announce Commencement of Steam Delivery From Miraah Solar Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2018, the first 100 MWt of Miraah are operating and meeting all performance targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofoman.com/article/140597|title=GlassPoint, PDO launch new tech centre|work=Times of Oman|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belridge Solar ===
In November 2017, [[Aera Energy]] and GlassPoint Solar announced a joint project to create California’s largest solar energy field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mailchi.mp/glasspoint/belridge-solar-announcement|title=Belridge Solar Announcement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at the [[South Belridge Oil Field]], the project, called Belridge Solar, will be the first in the world to incorporate solar steam generation with [[Solar power|solar electricity generation]].

The Belridge Oil Field resides near [[Bakersfield, California]]. Once completed, the facility is projected to produce 12 million barrels of steam annually through a 850MW thermal solar steam generator. It is planned to reduce the natural gas used at the Belridge Oil Field for the production and extraction of heavy oil in its [[Enhanced oil recovery|enhanced oil recovery process]] (EOR).

Additionally, a separate 26.5 MW electricity generating facility using photovoltaic panels is planned to power oilfield operations.
[[File:Belridgesolar render2.jpg|thumb|A rendering of the Belridge facility, which, when done, will be the largest in California.]]
This new facility is predicted to reduce [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] by more than 376,000 metric tons annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/11/29/one-of-the-countrys-biggest-oilfields-turns-to-an-unexpected-power-source-solar/|title=Unexpected Power Source|last=|first=|date=|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will offset more than one-third of all the cars driven in Bakersfield. It is also expected to create hundreds of jobs throughout [[California]].

This project highlights a growing trend of oil and gas companies partnering with the [[Solar power in the United States|solar energy industry]].

=== Occidental Petroleum of Oman ===
In November 2018, GlassPoint and [[Occidental Petroleum]] of Oman signed an agreement to cooperate on a solar thermal project to facilitate oil production on an oilfield in the [[Oman|Sultanate of Oman]].

The agreement outlines plans to generate up to 100,000 barrels of solar steam per day for heavy oil production at Mukhaizna oilfield. The proposed solar thermal plant would exceed two gigawatts and could save more than 800,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year.

Occidental of Oman would purchase the steam under a long-term off-take agreement, providing a cost-effective, zero-emissions alternative to steam generated using natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tradearabia.com/news/OGN_347579.html|title=GlassPoint, Occidental set to develop 2GW Oman solar plant|website=tradearabia.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In-Country Value==
[[File:GlassPoint Trough.jpg|thumb|Glasspoint introduced the concept of an enclosed trough to EOR]]
GlassPoint claims its technology can help oil operators free [[natural gas]] currently burned for oil production. This gas can be redirected to higher value applications, such as desalination, industrial development or export as [[Liquified natural gas|LNG]], thus increasing economic well-being. New supply chains associated with solar industries can generate significant societal value as well.

=== GlassPoint Innovation Spur ===
In January 2018, GlassPoint signed a collaboration agreement with a host of partners to establish its corporate social responsibility initiative, the ‘GlassPoint Innovation Spur’. 

The program is set to contribute and sustainably drive innovation within Oman’s renewable energy and water management sectors. The list of partners includes The Research Council (TRC), Innovation Park Muscat (IPM), Public Authority for SME Development (Riyada) and Sharakah.

An intensive full-cycle incubation program, the GlassPoint Innovation Spur will provide aspiring Omani entrepreneurs with an integrated ecosystem of scientific, technical and business support. The two-year program will equip participants with valuable skills through coaching and mentorship, as they transform their innovations into implementable businesses. Robust screening, selection, and testing criteria is in place to ensure originality and economic feasibility. Selected entrepreneurs will receive practical support to further develop their inventions and establish businesses before being linked to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasspoint.com/glasspoint-innovation-spur-launched-to-drive-renewable-energy-development-in-oman/|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.glasspoint.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SolaRISE Technology Center ===
In September 2018, GlassPoint Solar in partnership with [[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO) announced a new technology center.

The joint initiative is called SolaRISE for Solar Research, Innovation, and Sustainability in Energy. It was formed to develop and test solar technologies in oil fields.

Researchers will focus on cutting costs and automating operations. The center also will pilot and evaluate solar energy uses for other industrial processes in Oman and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasspoint.com/glasspoint-and-petroleum-development-oman-launch-solarise-technology-center/|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.glasspoint.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Eidsvoll]], and took his secondary education at [[Oslo Cathedral School]] in 1943. He then enrolled in the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] in-exile in [[Little Norway|Canada]], serving in [[World War II]]. After the war he returned to Norway, enrolling at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] in 1946. He graduated in 1951, and then worked as a research assistant and fellow until 1954. In 1955 he was hired in [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Norway]], advancing to director of planning, public relations and environment in his later career.

[[File:Howland Forest canopy.JPG|thumb|300px|View of the Howland Forest canopy from one of the site's research towers.]]
The '''Howland Research Forest''' is a {{convert|555|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract of mature [[evergreen forest]] in the [[North Maine Woods]], within [[Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot County]], central [[Maine]].    It is located west of the town of [[Howland, Maine|Howland]]. 

==History==
The tract is part of the 1.1&amp;nbsp;million acres (4,500&amp;nbsp;km²) of Maine forest sold in 2005 by [[International Paper]] (IP) to the [[Seven Islands Land Company]], a private forest investment management holding company. In 2007, the research forest was purchased by [[Northeast Wilderness Trust]] ensuring its wild and natural state into the future.&lt;ref name="HF web"&gt;Howland Forest website: http://www.howlandforest.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Howland Forest is a founding member of the [[AmeriFlux]] and [[FLUXNET]] research networks.&lt;ref name="HF web" /&gt; 

==Ecology==
The Howland Forest study site is located in a boreal transitional forest of the [[New England/Acadian forests]] ecoregion. The forest is dominated by mixed spruce, hemlock, aspen, and birch stands ranging in age from 45 to 130&amp;nbsp;years. The soils are formed on coarse-loamy granitic basal till.&lt;ref&gt;Woods Hole Research Center: http://www.whrc.org/new_england/Howland_Forest/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research forest==
The tract had previously been designated as a research forest under IP's ownership, attracting researchers from the [[US Forest Service]], the [[University of Maine]], [[NASA]], [[NOAA]], and the [[Woods Hole Research Center]]. Areas of study included [[acid rain]], [[nutrient cycling]], [[soil ecology]], and more recently, forest carbon uptake and loss. The forest has one of the longest records of carbon flux measurement in the world, dating to 1996, providing important information about [[carbon sequestration]] in mature forests.

[[File:Edificio del Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad.JPG|thumb|right|ICE Building in Sabana Norte, [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]]]
'''Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad''' ({{lang-en|'''Costa Rican Institute of Electricity'''}}) ('''ICE''') is the [[Costa Rica]]n [[Public company|government-run]] [[electricity]] and [[telecommunication]]s services provider.  Jointly with the Radiographic Costarricense SA (RACSA) and Compañía Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL) form the ICE Group.

ICE was founded on 8 April 1949 by Decree-Law No. 449 after the [[Costa Rican Civil War]] of 1948, in order to solve the problems of power shortages that occurred in Costa Rica in the 1940s.  Since 1963 ICE provides telecommunications services throughout the country.

The attempts to reform ICE throughout a set of laws in the years 1999 and 2000 generated a great [[Mass mobilization|social mobilization]].  The ruling party at that time, the [[Social Christian Unity Party]] and the main opposition [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)|National Liberation Party]] agreed to change the institution.  Meanwhile, the citizen opposition reached 274 protests in 14days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Gangas |first1=P |last2=Retana |first2=J |year=2006 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=30804205 |title=Ciudadanos críticos: Las movilizaciones contra el "Combo ICE" en Costa Rica |language=Spanish |trans-title=Critical Citizens: Demonstrations against "Combo ICE" in Costa Rica |journal=América Latina Hoy |issue=42 |pages=93–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement]], the telecommunication market was opened to private companies.  Since 2011, [[América Móvil]] through [[Claro Americas]] and [[Telefónica]] through [[Movistar]], are competing against ICE in the Costa Rican mobile market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Agüero |first=Mercedes R. |date={{Date|2011-11-06}} |title=Claro rompe monopolio celular al activar sus primeras líneas |language=Spanish |trans-title=Claro breaks mobile telephony monopoly by activating its first line |journal=[[La Nación (San José)|La Nación]] |url=http://www.nacion.com/2011-11-06/ElPais/Claro-rompe-monopolio-celular-al-activar-sus---primeras-lineas.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524195041/http://www.nacion.com/2011-11-06/ElPais/Claro-rompe-monopolio-celular-al-activar-sus---primeras-lineas.aspx |archivedate=May 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Agüero |first=Mercedes R. |date={{Date|2011-11-0}} |title=Movistar no logró abrir todas sus tiendas en primer día de ventas |language=Spanish |trans-title=Movistar failed to open all its stores in its first day of sales |journal=[[La Nación (San José)|La Nación]] |url=http://www.nacion.com/2011-11-09/ElPais/movistar--no-logro-abrir-todas-sus-tiendas-en-primer-dia-de-ventas---.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214113451/http://www.nacion.com/2011-11-09/ElPais/movistar--no-logro-abrir-todas-sus-tiendas-en-primer-dia-de-ventas---.aspx |archivedate=December 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A photon with energy &lt;math&gt;h\nu_1&lt;/math&gt; excites an electron of fundamental level, of energy &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;, up to an excited energy level (e.g. &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;) or on one of the vibrational sub-levels. Vibrational relaxation then takes place between excited levels, which leads to dissipation of part of the energy (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_d&lt;/math&gt;), taking the form of a transition (internal conversion) towards the lowest excited level. Energy is then dissipated by emission of a photon of energy &lt;math&gt;h\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;, which allows the system to go back to its fundamental state.]]
'''Kasha's rule''' is a principle in the [[photochemistry]] of [[Excited state|electronically excited]] molecules. The rule states that photon emission ([[fluorescence]] or [[phosphorescence]]) occurs in appreciable yield only from the lowest excited state of a given [[Multiplicity (chemistry)|multiplicity]]. It is named for American spectroscopist [[Michael Kasha]], who proposed it in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020325103542/http://turmac13.chem.columbia.edu/PDF_db/History/characterization.PDF Characterization of Electronic Transitions in Complex Molecules]. Kasha, M. ''Discussions of the Faraday Society'', 1950, '''9''': p.14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]. [http://goldbook.iupac.org/K03370.html Kasha rule – Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book")]. Compiled by McNaught, A.D. and Wilkinson, A. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and explanation==

The rule is relevant in understanding the [[emission spectrum]] of an excited molecule. Upon absorbing a photon, a molecule in its electronic [[ground state]] (denoted ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, assuming a [[singlet state]]) may – depending on the photon [[wavelength]] – be excited to any of a set of higher electronic states (denoted ''S''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n''&gt;0). However, according to Kasha's rule, [[Luminescence|photon emission]] (termed fluorescence in the case of an ''S'' state) is expected in appreciable yield only from the lowest excited state, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since only one state is expected to yield emission, an equivalent statement of the rule is that the emission wavelength is independent of the excitation wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.grenzwissen.de/postingimage/spiepaper709712.pdf "Unusual autofluorescence characteristic of cultured red-rain cells"]. Louis, J. and Kumar, A.S. Presented in [[SPIE]] Conference 7097, Aug 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule can be explained by the [[Franck–Condon principle|Franck–Condon factor]]s for [[vibronic transition]]s. For a given pair of energy levels that differ in both vibrational and electronic [[quantum number]], the Franck–Condon factor expresses the degree of overlap between their vibrational [[wavefunction]]s. The greater the overlap, the quicker the molecule can undergo transition from the higher to the lower level. Overlap between pairs is greatest when the two vibrational levels are close in energy; this tends to be the case when the ''vibrationless'' levels of the electronic states coupled by the transition (where the vibrational quantum number ''v'' is zero) are close. In most molecules, the vibrationless levels of the excited states all lie close together, so molecules in upper states quickly reach the lowest excited state, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, before they have time to fluoresce. However, the energy gap between ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is greater, so here fluorescence occurs, since it is now kinetically competitive with [[Internal conversion (chemistry)|internal conversion]] (IC).&lt;ref name=klan&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8IstqQf6ZckC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=kasha%27s+rule&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ArmEU3BEC7&amp;sig=RV1DG7mCXuWRSFcXM1Q6YZ8UY3w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sjvkS8zINYmEmgPXj5CCBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=kasha%27s%20rule&amp;f=false ''Photochemistry of Organic Compounds: From Concepts to Practice'']. Klán, P. and Wirz, J. Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. p.40. {{ISBN|1-4051-6173-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suppan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xq-vurqbVt4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22kasha%27s+rule%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tL_TTPa5Lof1sgbMhfjtBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kasha%27s%20rule%22&amp;f=false ''Chemistry and Light'']. Suppan, P. Royal Society of Chemistry, 1994. p.56. {{ISBN|0-85186-814-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions to Kasha's rule arise when there are large energy gaps between excited states. An example is [[azulene]]: the classical explanation is that the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; states lie sufficiently far apart that fluorescence is observed mostly from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=klan /&gt;&lt;ref name=suppan /&gt;  However, recent research has put forward that this may not be the case, and that fluorescence is seen from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because of crossing in the ''N''-dimensional potential surface allowing very fast internal conversion from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Vavilov rule==

A corollary of Kasha's rule is the [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov|Vavilov]] rule, which states that the [[quantum yield]] of luminescence is generally independent of the excitation wavelength.&lt;ref name=klan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]. [http://goldbook.iupac.org/K03371.html Kasha–Vavilov rule – Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book")]. Compiled by McNaught, A.D. and Wilkinson, A. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood as a consequence of the tendency – implied by Kasha's rule – for molecules in upper states to relax to the lowest excited state non-radiatively. Again there are exceptions: for example [[benzene]] vapour.&lt;ref name=klan /&gt;

[[File:Mean piston speed.png|thumb|The comparison of mean piston speed (black line) with real piston speed (color lines). Diagram shows one stroke from BDC to TDC. Revolution = 1.000 min-1, stroke = 88 mm. The connecting rod ratio l/r varies: 3 - red, 4 - green, 5,5 - blue]]
The '''mean piston speed''' is the average [[speed]] of the [[piston]] in a [[reciprocating engine]]. It is a function of [[Stroke (engines)|stroke]] and RPM.  There is a factor of 2 in the equation to account for one stroke to occur in 1/2 of a crank revolution (or alternatively: two strokes per one crank revolution) and a '60' to convert seconds from minutes in the RPM term.

MPS = 2 * Stroke * RPM / 60

For example, a piston in an automobile engine which has a stroke of 90&amp;nbsp;mm will have a mean speed at 3000 rpm of 
2 * (90 / 1000) * 3000 / 60 = 9&amp;nbsp;m/s.

It is a good indicator of the class and performance of an engine relative to its competitors. The 5.2-liter V10 that debuted in the 2017 Audi R8 has the highest mean piston speed for any production car (26.9&amp;nbsp;m/s) thanks to its 92.8 mm stroke and 8700-rpm redline.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/the-fastest-production-audi-ever-the-new-audi-r8-4421/engine-4426&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrected Piston Speed (Frederick Lanchester and Janke and King)
Corrected Piston speed is a method to more accurately represent stress on an engine, and is calculated as mean piston speed divided by the square root of the stroke/bore ratio.

==Classes==
; low speed diesels : ~8.5&amp;nbsp;m/s for marine and electric power generation applications
; medium speed diesels : ~11&amp;nbsp;m/s for trains or trucks
; high speed diesel : ~14&amp;nbsp;m/s for automobile engines
; medium speed petrol : ~16&amp;nbsp;m/s for automobile engines
; high speed petrol : ~20–25&amp;nbsp;m/s for sport automobile engines or motorcycles
; competition : Some extreme examples are [[Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] and [[Formula one]] engines with ~25&amp;nbsp;m/s and [[Top Fuel]] engines ~30&amp;nbsp;m/s

The mean of any function refers to the average value. In the case of mean piston speed, taken in a narrow mathematical sense, it is zero because half of the time the piston is moving up and half of the time the piston is moving down; this is not useful. The way the term is usually used is to describe the distance traveled by the piston per unit of time, taking distance positive in both up and down senses. It is related to the rate that friction work is done on the cylinder walls, and thus the rate that heat is generated there.
This is sort of a non-puzzle. It represents a specification to be designed to rather than as a result of design and the mean piston velocity is a function of the revolutions per minute, that is, the piston at a specific rpm is going to be the same at the peak of the graph as it is at the trough, that is at 286.071 degrees on the crankshaft if the rpm is held consistent. At 0 and 180 degrees, the piston velocity is zero.
Piston velocity is a test of the strength of the piston and connecting rod subassembly. The alloy used to make the piston itself is what determines the maximum velocity that the piston can reach before friction coefficients, heat levels and reciprocating stress overcome the maximum levels that the piston can sustain before it begins to fail structurally. As the alloy tends to be fairly consistent across most manufacturers, the maximum velocity of the piston at a given rpm is determined by the length of the stroke, that is, the radius of the journal of the crankshaft.
The most common engine types in production are built to square, or below square. That is, a square engine has the same diameter of cylinder bore as the total length of the stroke from 0 to 180 degrees, whereas in an undersquare engine, the total length of the stroke is greater than the diameter of the bore. The opposite, oversquare, is mostly used in higher performance engines where the torque curve approaches the peak of the maximum piston velocity. Generally in this type of engine, the volume of the cylinder can be artificially enhanced with turbochargers or superchargers, increasing the amount of fuel/air available for combustion.
An example is found in Formula 1 racing engines, where the cylinder diameter is substantially greater than the length of the stroke, resulting in higher available rpm but necessitating greater requirements of the strengths of connecting rods and pistons and higher temperature tolerances for bearings. The cylinder diameter in these engines are fairly small (under 45&amp;nbsp;mm) and the stroke is less than that, depending on the torque curve and maximum available rpm as designed by the builder. Peak torque is reached at higher rpm and is spread over a wider range of rpm. The specifications of these are known factors and can be designed to.
Torque is a function of the length of the stroke, the shorter the stroke, the less available torque at lower rpm, but the piston velocity can be taken to much greater speeds, meaning higher engine rpm. These types of engines are much more delicate and require a much higher level of precision in the moving parts than square or oversquare engines. Up until the early 1960s, the focus by designers was on torque rather than piston velocity, probably due to material considerations and machining technologies. As materials have improved, engine rpm has increased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22571">The '''methanol economy''' is a suggested future [[economy]] in which [[methanol]] and [[dimethyl ether]] replace [[fossil fuel]]s as a means of energy storage, ground transportation fuel, and [[raw material]] for synthetic hydrocarbons and their products. It offers an alternative to the proposed [[hydrogen economy]] or [[ethanol economy]].

In the 1990s, [[Nobel prize]] winner [[George A. Olah]] advocated a methanol economy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy | author = George A.

K. Surya Prakash]] and Alain Goeppert, published a summary of the state of fossil fuel and alternative energy sources, including their availability and limitations, before suggesting a methanol economy.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy '', [[George A. Olah]], Alain Goeppert, G. K. Surya Prakash, Wiley-VCH, '''2006'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanol can be produced from a wide variety of sources including still-abundant fossil fuels ([[natural gas]], [[coal]], [[oil shale]], [[tar sands]], etc.) as well as agricultural products and municipal waste, [[wood]] and varied [[biomass]]. It can also be made from chemical recycling of [[carbon dioxide]].

==Uses==
[[Image:Fuel cell NASA p48600ac.jpg|thumb|right|Direct-methanol fuel cell]]

===Fuel===
{{main article|Methanol fuel}}
Methanol is a fuel for heat engines and fuel cells. Due to its high [[octane rating]] it can be used directly as a fuel in [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel cars]] (including [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] and [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles) using existing internal combustion engines (ICE). Methanol can also be burned in some other kinds of engine or to provide heat as other liquid fuels are used. [[Fuel cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, can use methanol either directly in [[Direct Methanol Fuel Cell]]s (DMFC) or indirectly (after conversion into [[hydrogen]] by reforming).

=== Feedstock ===
Methanol is already used today on a large scale to produce a variety of chemicals and products. Global methanol demand as a chemical [[feedstock]] reached around 42 million metric tonnes per year as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methanol.org/the-methanol-industry/|title=The Methanol Industry - METHANOL INSTITUTE|author=|date=|website=methanol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process, it can be transformed into gasoline. Using the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process, methanol can also be converted to [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]], the two chemicals produced in largest amounts by the [[petrochemical industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/propylene-production-from-methanol|title=Technology Economics: Propylene from Methanol|first=|last=Intratec Solutions|date=31 May 2012|website=slideshare.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are important building blocks for the production of essential polymers (LDPE, HDPE, PP) and like other chemical intermediates are currently produced mainly from petroleum feedstock. Their production from methanol could therefore reduce our dependency on petroleum. It would also make it possible to continue producing these chemicals when fossil fuels reserves are depleted.

== Production ==
Today most [[methanol]] is produced from [[methane]] through [[syngas]]. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] is currently the world's largest methanol exporter, with exports mainly to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/2014/09/ryder-scott-trinidad-and-tobago-s-gas-reserves-fell-in-2013.html|title=Ryder Scott: Trinidad and Tobago’s gas reserves fell in 2013|author=|date=|website=www.ogj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural gas that serves as feedstock for the production of methanol comes from the same sources as other uses. Unconventional gas resources such as [[coalbed methane]], tight sand gas and eventually the very large [[methane hydrate]] resources present under the continental shelves of the seas and Siberian and Canadian tundra could also be used to provide the necessary gas. 

The conventional route to methanol from [[methane]] passes through syngas generation by [[steam reforming]] combined (or not) with partial oxidation. New and more efficient ways to convert methane into methanol are also being developed. These include:
* Methane oxidation with homogeneous catalysts in [[sulfuric acid]] media
* Methane bromination followed by hydrolysis of the obtained [[bromomethane]]
* Direct oxidation of methane with oxygen
* Microbial or photochemical conversion of methane
* Partial methane oxidation with trapping of the partially oxidized product and subsequent extraction on copper and iron exchanged [[Zeolite]] (e.g. [[Alpha-Oxygen]])

All these synthetic routes emit the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. To mitigate this, methanol can be made through ways minimizing the emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. One solution is to produce it from syngas obtained by biomass gasification. For this purpose any biomass can be used including [[Wood economy|wood]], wood wastes, grass, agricultural crops and their by-products, animal waste, aquatic plants and municipal waste. There is no need to use food crops as in the case of ethanol from corn, sugar cane and wheat.
:Biomass → Syngas (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH
Methanol can be synthesized from carbon and hydrogen from any source, including still available [[fossil fuels]] and [[biomass]].  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industries and eventually even the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contained in the air, can be a source of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kothandaraman|first=Jotheeswari|last2=Goeppert|first2=Alain|last3=Czaun|first3=Miklos|last4=Olah|first4=George A.|last5=Prakash|first5=G.

In the longer range however, considering diminishing fossil fuel resources and the effect of their utilization on [[earth's atmosphere]], even the low concentration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself could be captured and recycled via methanol, thus supplementing nature’s own photosynthetic cycle. Efficient new absorbents to capture atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are being developed, mimicking plants' ability. Chemical recycling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to new fuels and materials could thus become feasible, making them renewable on the human timescale.

Methanol can also be produced from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by [[catalytic hydrogenation]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the hydrogen has been obtained from [[water electrolysis]].  This is the process used by [[Carbon Recycling International]] of [[Iceland]]. Methanol may also be produced through CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[electrochemical reduction]], if electrical power is available. The energy needed for these reactions in order to be carbon neutral would come from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectricity and solar as well as  nuclear power. In effect, all of them allow free energy to be stored in easily transportable methanol, which is made immediately from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, rather than attempting to store energy in free hydrogen.

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

or with  electric energy

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 6 HO&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; 
:6 HO&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;  → 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:Total:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + electric energy → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 3/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The necessary CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be captured from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industrial [[flue gases]] including cement factories. With diminishing fossil fuel resources and therefore CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content in the air could also be used. Considering the low concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in air (0.04%) improved and economically viable technologies to absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will have to be developed. For this reason, extraction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water could be more feasible due to its higher concentrations in dissolved form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/fuel-seawater-whats-catch-180953623/|title=Fuel from Seawater? What's the Catch?|last=Willmott|first=Don|date=|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow the chemical recycling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus mimicking nature’s photosynthesis.

==Advantages==
In the process of [[photosynthesis]], green plants use the energy of sunlight to split water into free oxygen (which is released) and free hydrogen. Rather than attempt to store the hydrogen, plants immediately capture carbon dioxide from the air to allow the hydrogen to reduce it to storable fuels such as hydrocarbons (plant oils and [[terpene]]s) and polyalcohols ([[glycerol]], [[sugar]]s and [[starch]]es). In the methanol economy, any process which similarly produces free hydrogen, proposes to immediately use it "captively" to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol, which, like plant products from photosynthesis, has great advantages in storage and transport over free hydrogen itself.

Methanol is a liquid under normal conditions, allowing it to be stored, transported and dispensed easily, much like [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]]. It can also be readily transformed by dehydration into [[dimethyl ether]], a diesel fuel substitute with a [[cetane number]] of 55.

===Comparison with hydrogen===
Methanol economy advantages compared to a hydrogen economy:
* Efficient energy storage by volume, as compared with [[compressed hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=9991|title=Few transportation fuels surpass the energy densities of gasoline and diesel - Today in Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|author=|date=|website=www.eia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; When hydrogen pressure-confinement vessel is taken into account, an advantage in energy storage by weight can also be realized. The volumetric [[energy density]] of methanol is considerably higher than liquid hydrogen, in part because of the low density of liquid hydrogen of 71&amp;nbsp;grams/litre. Hence there is actually more hydrogen in a litre of methanol (99&amp;nbsp;grams/litre) than in a litre of liquid hydrogen, and methanol needs no cryogenic container maintained at a temperature of -253&amp;nbsp;°C .
* A liquid [[hydrogen infrastructure]] would be prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name=zubrin-117&gt;{{cite book |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |year=2007 |title=Energy Victory |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |pages=117–118 |isbn=978-1-59102-591-7 |author-link=Robert Zubrin |quote=The situation is much worse than this, however, because before the hydrogen can be transported anywhere, it needs to be either compressed or liquefied. To liquefy it, it must be refrigerated down to a temperature of -253°C (20 degrees above absolute zero). At these temperatures, fundamental laws of thermodynamics make refrigerators extremely inefficient. As a result, about 40 percent of the energy in the hydrogen must be spent to liquefy it. This reduces the actual net energy content of our product fuel to 792&amp;nbsp;kcal. In addition, because it is a cryogenic liquid, still more energy could be expected to be lost as the hydrogen boils away as it is warmed by heat leaking in from the outside environment during transport and storage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=romm-94&gt;{{cite book |last=Romm |first=Joseph J. |year=2004 |title=The Hype about Hydrogen |url= |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Island Press |pages=94–95 |isbn=1-55963-703-X |author-link=Joseph J. Romm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=luft-329&gt;{{cite book |last1=Luft |first1=Gal |last2=Korin |first2=Anne |year=2009 |title=Energy Security Challenges for the 21st Century |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=Praeger Security International |page=329 |isbn=978-0-275-99997-1 |author-link2=Anne Korin |quote=The infrastructure dilemma seems insurmountable. Onboard storage of hydrogen in either gaseous or liquid form, makes for incredibly expensive vehicles, and a large-scale shift to hydrogen entails supplementing or supplanting the existing liquid fuel delivery infrastructure. This is a tough proposition, to put it mildly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methanol can use existing gasoline infrastructure with only limited modifications.
* Can be blended with gasoline (for example in [[M85 fuel|M85]], a mixture containing 85% methanol and 15% gasoline).
* User friendly. Hydrogen is volatile, and its confinements uses high pressure or cryogenic systems.
* Less losses : Hydrogen leaks more easily than methanol. Heat will evaporate liquid hydrogen, giving expected losses up to 0.3% per day in storage tanks. (see [http://www.chart-ferox.com/getattachment/37f20eca-f9ee-4eaa-88c7-0f373e93f8ca/VT_FULL_EN.aspx Chart Ferox storage tanks Liquid oxygen]).

===Comparison with ethanol===
* Can be made from any organic material using proven technology going through syngas. There is no need to use food crops and compete with food production. The amount of methanol that can be generated from biomass is much greater than ethanol.
* Can compete with and complement ethanol in a diversified energy marketplace. Methanol obtained from fossil fuels has a lower price than ethanol.
* Can be blended in gasoline like ethanol. In 2007, China blended more than {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}} of methanol into fuel and will introduce methanol fuel standard by mid-2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Methanol's Allure'', Kemsley, J., ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News'', December 3, '''2007''', pages 55-59 [http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/85/8549sci1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[M85 fuel|M85]], a mixture of 85% methanol and 15% gasoline can be used much like [[E85]] sold in some gas stations today.

==Disadvantages==
* High energy costs currently associated with generating and transporting hydrogen offsite.
* Depending on the feedstock the generation in itself may be not clean.
* Presently generated from [[natural gas]] still dependent on fossil fuels (although any combustible hydrocarbon can be used).
* Energy density (by weight or volume) one half of that of gasoline and 24% less than ethanol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2005/JennyHua.shtml|title=Energy Density of Methanol (Wood Alcohol) - The Physics Factbook|first=Glenn|last=Elert|date=|website=hypertextbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Handling
** If no inhibitors are used, methanol is [[corrosive]] to some common metals including [[aluminum]], [[zinc]] and [[manganese]]. Parts of the engine fuel-intake systems are made from aluminum. Similar to ethanol, compatible material for fuel tanks, gasket and engine intake have to be used.
** As with [[Pipeline transport#Ethanol|similarly corrosive and hydrophilic ethanol]], existing [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] designed for petroleum products cannot handle methanol. Thus methanol requires shipment at higher energy cost in trucks and trains, until new pipeline infrastructure can be built, or existing pipelines are retrofitted for methanol transport.
** Methanol, as an alcohol, increases the permeability of some plastics to fuel vapors (e.g. high-density polyethylene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=5882923|title=Gasoline and Methanol Exposures from Automobiles Within Residences and Attached Garages|first1=C. P.|last1=Weisel|first2=N. J.|last2=Lawryk|first3=A. H.|last3=Huber|first4=G. H.|last4=Crescenti|date=1 January 1993|publisher=|via=www.osti.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This property of methanol has the possibility of increasing emissions of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) from fuel, which contributes to increased tropospheric [[ozone]] and possibly human exposure.
* Low volatility in cold weather: pure methanol-fueled engines can be difficult to start, and they run inefficiently until warmed up. This is why a mixture containing 85% methanol and 15% gasoline called M85 is generally used in ICEs. The gasoline allows the engine to start even at lower temperatures.
* With the exception of low level exposure, methanol is toxic.&lt;ref&gt;Methanol is a developmental and neurological toxin, though typical dietary and occupational levels of exposure are not likely to induce significant health effects.  The a National Toxicology Program panel recently concluded that blood concentrations below approx. 10 mg/L there is minimal concern for adverse health effects.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15995730&amp;query_hl=8&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum]  Other literature summaries are also available (see, for instance, Reproductive Toxicology 18 (2004) 303–390).&lt;/ref&gt; Methanol is lethal when ingested in larger amounts (30 to 100 mL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.methanol.org/pdfFrame.cfm?pdf=Methanol_humantox_rev.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707042155/http://www.methanol.org/pdfFrame.cfm?pdf=Methanol_humantox_rev.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-07 |df= }}, ''Methanol in fuel cell vehicles Human toxicity and risk evaluation (Revised)'', Statoil, '''2001'''&lt;/ref&gt; But so are most motor fuels, including gasoline (120 to 300 mL) and diesel fuel. Gasoline also contains small amounts of many compounds known to be carcinogenic (e.g. benzene). Methanol is not a carcinogen, nor does it contain carcinogens. However, methanol may be metabolized in the body to formaldehyde, which is both toxic and carcinogenic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antizol.com/mpoisono.htm,"Methanol poisoning overview",Mechanism of toxicity&lt;/ref&gt;  Methanol occurs naturally in small quantities in the human body and in edible fruits.
* Methanol is a liquid: this creates a greater fire risk compared to hydrogen in open spaces as Methanol leaks do not dissipate. Methanol burns invisibly unlike gasoline. Compared to gasoline, however, methanol is much safer. It is more difficult to ignite and releases less heat when it burns. Methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water, whereas gasoline floats on water and continues to burn. The EPA has estimated that switching fuels from gasoline to methanol would reduce the incidence of fuel related fires by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/08-fire.pdf, ''Methanol Fuels and Fire Safety'', EPA 400-F-92-010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Methanol is water-soluble: accidentally released, it may undergo relatively rapid groundwater transport, causing [[groundwater pollution]], although this risk has not been thoroughly studied. An accidental release of methanol in the environment would, however, cause much less damage than a comparable gasoline or crude [[oil spill]]. Unlike these fuels, methanol is biodegradable and totally soluble in water, and would be rapidly diluted to a concentration low enough for [[microorganism]] to start [[biodegradation]]. This effect is already exploited in water treatment plants, where methanol is already used for [[denitrification]] and as a nutrient for bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.methanol.org/pdf/evaluation.pdf, ''Evaluation of the fate and transport of methanol in the environment'', prepared by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. for the Methanol Institute, '''1999'''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panelling''' (or '''paneling''' in the U.S.) is a [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] wall covering constructed from rigid or semi-rigid components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paneling|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/paneling|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are traditionally interlocking [[wood]], but could be [[plastic]] or other materials.

Panelling was developed in antiquity to make rooms in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] buildings more comfortable.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The panels served to [[Thermal insulation|insulate]] the room from the cold stone.  In more modern [[building]]s, such panelling is often installed for [[Interior decoration|decorative purposes]].  Panelling, such as wainscoting and boiserie in particular, may be extremely ornate and is particularly associated with seventeenth and eighteenth century [[interior design]], [[Victorian architecture]] in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and its international contemporaries.

[[File:RSC Staircase.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Simple moulded panelling on the walls of a staircase.]]

The term '''wainscot''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|w|eɪ|n|s|k|ə|t}} {{respell|WAYN|skət}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|w|eɪ|n|s|k|ɒ|t}} {{respell|WAYN|skot}}) originally applied to high quality [[Wood splitting|riven]] [[oak]] boards. 

Wainscot oak came from large, slow-grown forest trees, and produced boards that were knot-free, low in [[tannin]], light in weight, and easy to work with. It was preferred to home-grown oak, especially in Holland and Great Britain, because it was a far superior product and dimensionally stable.

The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' states that it derives from the medieval German ''wagenschot'' as well as ''wageschot'' or 'wall-board'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/wainscot|title=wainscot|last=|first=|date=9 September 2017|website=Oxford Dictionaries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Johnson's Dictionary]]'' defined it thus: {{quote|text=Wainscot [''wageschot'', Dutch], the inner wooden covering of a wall.&lt;br/&gt; 
To wainscot [''waegenschotten'', Dutch], to line the walls with boards}}

A 'wainscot' was therefore a board of riven (and later [[Quarter sawing|quarter-sawn]]) oak, and wainscoting was the panelling made from it. During the 18th century, oak wainscot was almost entirely superseded for panelling in Europe by softwoods (mainly Scots pine and Norway spruce), but the name stuck:

"The term wainscoting, as applied to the lining of walls, originated in a species of foreign oak of the same name, used for that purpose; and although that has long been superseded by the introduction of fir timber, the term has been continued notwithstanding the change of material".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nicholson, ''An Architectural Dictionary'', 2 Vols., London (1819).&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 18th century, the style of panelling changed from a floor-to-ceiling covering to one in which only the lower part of the wall was covered. Hence wainscot or wainscoting became a panelling style applied to the lower {{convert|90|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of an interior [[wall]], below the [[dado rail]] or chair rail, and above the [[baseboard]] or skirting board.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  It is traditionally constructed from [[tongue-and-groove]] boards, though bead-board or decorative panels, such as a wooden [[door]] might have, are also common.  New manufacturing techniques are capable of milling large panels from one sheet, reducing seams, caulking, and expansion/contraction cracks that have plagued traditional construction.  Wainscoting may also refer to other materials used in a similar fashion.

The original purpose of wainscoting was to cover the lower part of walls, which, in houses constructed with poor or non-existent [[damp-proof course]]s, are often affected by rising dampness.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Its purpose is now decorative.

'''Frame and Panel – Wainscoting'''

A frame and panel can suit a large variety of homes as you have the choice as to what moulding profile is best for the look you are trying to achieve. These mouldings are then constructed into a series of raised square or rectangular sections which sit above the skirting boards and below the chair rail. Some wall panelling extends higher than the chair rail height (typically about mid wall height where you would expect the top of a chair seat height to be) especially in a smaller room where you are trying to achieve a sense of height and space to a smaller room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://intrimmouldings.com.au/blog/how-to-choose-a-look-style-add-wow-with-interior-panelling/|title=How to choose a look &amp; style|last=|first=|date=2017-06-27|work=Intrim Mouldings|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boiserie ==
[[Image:Zunfthaus - Gesellschaftssaal.jpg|thumb|375px|Elaborate boiseries in the guild hall of the ''Zunfthaus zu Kaufleuten'', [[Kramgasse]] 29, [[Bern]]]]
'''Boiserie''' ({{IPA-fr|bwazʁi}}; often used in the plural '''boiseries''') is the French term used to define ornate and intricately carved wood panelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garay|first1=Regina|title=The Beauty of Boiserie|url=http://paintandpattern.com/boiserie/|publisher=paintandpattern.com|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boiseries became popular in the latter part of the 17th century in [[France|French]] [[interior design]], becoming a ''de rigueur '' feature of fashionable French interiors throughout the 18th century. Such panels were most often painted in two shades of a chosen color or in contrasting colors, with gilding reserved for the main reception rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The French Interior in the 18th Century|author=Whitehead, John| publisher=Dutton Studio Books| year=1992|p=95-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palace of Versailles]] contains many fine examples of white painted ''boiseries'' with gilded mouldings installed in the reigns of [[Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Verlet, Pierre (1985). Le château de Versailles. Paris: Librairie Arthème Fayard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels were not confined to just the walls of a room but were used to decorate doors, frames, cupboards, and shelves also. It was standard for mirrors to be installed and framed by the carved ''boiseries'', especially above the mantelpiece of a fireplace. Paintings were also installed within ''boiseries'', above doorways or set into central panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The French Interior in the 18th Century|author=Whitehead, John| publisher=Dutton Studio Books| year=1992|p=95-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Taylor''' (born 24 January 1948) is a UK [[environmentalist]] with a long track record of public activism and scholarship on issues ranging from [[nuclear safety]],&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt; [[ocean pollution]],&lt;ref name=r3 /&gt; [[biodiversity]] strategies,&lt;ref name=r4 /&gt; [[renewable energy]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=r5 /&gt; His recent work on [[global warming]] has been questioned by environmentalists.&lt;ref name=r6 /&gt; His 2009 book ''Chill: a reassessment of global warming theory'' argued that most of the recent documented warming is caused by peaking natural cycles, that there is also a potential for global cooling and that adaptation not mitigation should be a priority. His views received widespread coverage in the media – with front page on the ''[[Daily Express]]'', and articles in the online versions of ''[[Daily Mail|The Mail]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and an [[Al Jazeera]] video.&lt;ref name=r7 /&gt;

==Education==

Born in January 1948, Taylor was educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in Glamorgan, Wales from where he won an Open Scholarship to [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College, Oxford University]]. He graduated with honours in [[Natural Sciences]] from the School of [[Zoology]] in 1970. As a student he led a successful inter-university biological expedition to East Africa;&lt;ref name=r8 /&gt; After six years of what he describes in his autobiography ''Shiva's Rainbow'' as an adventurer and explorer, including a solo vehicle-crossing of the [[Sahara]] and climbing the [[Eiger]], he returned to Oxford to study [[Social Anthropology]] under the linguistic anthropologist [[Edwin Ardener]]. Taylor has been a member of the [[Institute of Biology]] and is a Certified [[Biologist]], a former member of the International Union of Radioecologists, the International Society for Radiation Protection and the [[British Ecological Society]]. He is currently a member of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]].

==Political Ecology Research Group==

Taylor left his academic studies in anthropology order to develop the Political Ecology Research Group (PERG) which he founded in 1976. Eschewing the academic elements of [[political ecology]] and the need for theory in favour of political involvement, the group pioneered scientific and legal support for environmental policy initiatives &lt;ref name=r1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt; and worked closely with [[Greenpeace International]], [[Trade Unions]] and at times government agencies. The group held copyright on all its work and published over 20 research reports between 1978 and 1992. Taylor published an account of the anti-nuclear movement in [[The Ecologist]] - a text used by the [[Open University]] for its Control of Technology Course, an on assessments of nuclear risk in the science journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]].&lt;ref name=r8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=r9 /&gt;

Taylor became a public figure following the 1977 Windscale Inquiry into nuclear fuel reprocessing during which he exposed the risks of nuclear waste storage and mounted a successful campaign against radioactive discharges to the marine environment – his work was widely reported in the national press, [[New Scientist]], [[The Ecologist]] and the [[New Internationalist]].&lt;ref name=r14 /&gt; Between 1980 and 1992 he became an advisor to a wide spectrum of organisations, ranging from government agencies to environmental NGOs, appearing on TV and radio on issues of nuclear risk and pollution. His work uncovered the health impact of the [[Windscale fire|Windscale Fire]] in 1957 - in the PERG report RR-7, and in association with Yorkshire TV, the excess of childhood cancers around [[Sellafield]].&lt;ref name=r14 /&gt;  He served on the government commission into nuclear waste dumping at sea (chaired by Sir Fred Holliday) which recommended the practice be banned. He also sat on a research advisory group on nuclear waste management set up by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Department of Environment]] – resigning when he felt government were not allowing time for detailed comparative assessment of the options.&lt;ref name=r15 /&gt;

The work of PERG played a role in limiting the development of nuclear fuel reprocessing and the 'plutonium economy', particularly in Germany,&lt;ref name=r16 /&gt; cleaning up discharges to the Irish Sea,&lt;ref name=r17 /&gt; altering perceptions of the risks of [[ionizing radiation|ionising radiation]] and the consequences of reactor meltdowns.&lt;ref name=r18 /&gt; The group also produced the first study in renewable energy strategies in a report for the [[European Parliament]] in 1980; the first comparative study of organic and conventional agriculture, and the first UK study of forestry as [[carbon sequestration]].

Taylor involved both of his brothers during the 1980s campaigns, with Ron infiltrating the US Nevada weapons test site and leading the Greenpeace climb of Big Ben &lt;ref name=r19 /&gt; and Robert heading the Greenpeace international strategy on chemical wastes.&lt;ref name=r20 /&gt;

In 1992, PERG evolved into an international network of independent experts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems – Terramarès – to carry out critical science policy analysis.&lt;ref name=r17 /&gt;&lt;ref name=r18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=r21 /&gt; This group worked collectively and individually behind the scenes in several important developments – with Professor Jackson Davis helping to lay the foundation for the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Climate Convention]],&lt;ref name=r22 /&gt; and in Clean Production Strategies and the [[Precautionary Principle]] &lt;ref name=r23 /&gt; with [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] (now Professor of Sustainable Development at the [[University of Surrey]]); and further work on energy strategies with Gordon Thompson who now leads the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts (ref IRSS). Taylor's work on ocean pollution culminated in 1993 with a critique of the UN's ocean protection system in the peer-reviewed journal Bulletin of Marine Pollution.&lt;ref name=r17 /&gt;

==Beyond Conservation==

He then moved from Oxford to North Wales to follow up his long standing interests in wildlife conservation and shamanism. As a member of the [[British Association of Nature Conservationists]] he organised the conference 'Wilderness Britain' in 1995 and organised a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] seminar on wilderness and wildland values at its Centennial Conference. He was a keynote speaker at the BANC/National Trust 1999 'Nature in Transition' conference in July 1999 and co-authored the National Trust's document 'Call for the Wild'. His many articles in BANC's journal ECOS contributed to the new wave of consciousness in conservation known as 'rewilding' &lt;ref name=r24 /&gt; culminating in 2005 with the publication of ''Beyond Conservation'' and the founding of the [http://www.wildland-network.org Wildland Network]. In this work Taylor argues that conservation is too preservation oriented and needs to be more creative and focussed upon wilder and larger scale land management.&lt;ref name=r25 /&gt;  [[Chris Baines|Professor Chris Baines]] one of Britain's leading conservation experts described Taylor's book as important and brilliantly capturing the changing mood of conservation &lt;ref name=r26 /&gt; and Peter Marren gave it a whole page spread in the Independent.&lt;ref name=r27 /&gt; Alan Watson Featherstone, of [[Trees for Life (Scotland)|Trees For Life]] endorsed the cover with 'this book offers a beacon of hope to all those who draw spiritual sustenance from wild Nature' and Professor Bill Adams, at Cambridge University, also endorsing the cover said 'Peter Taylor builds bridges between ecology, countryside policy and spirituality'. In networking ecological practitioners and land managers, Taylor worked to construct a political strategy for [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding conservation]] through regional seminars, national conferences and in 2008, his colleague in the network Steve Carver founded the Wildland Research Institute at [[Leeds University]].&lt;ref name=r28 /&gt;

==Energy and climate change==

In the lead up to his work on climate change, Taylor had been engaged at government level to develop strategies for the integration of renewable energy into countryside policy on community and biodiversity. Between 2000 and 2003, he was appointed to the UK National Advisory Group of the Community Renewables Initiative – a joint Countryside Agency and Department of Trade and Industry task-force on community scale renewable energy. To aid this work he set up the design consultancy Ethos, which combined science expertise from Terramarès with graphic design and the use of computer virtual reality for visualising change and integrating development in the countryside.&lt;ref name=r30 /&gt;

His controversial reassessment of global warming theory in 2009 outlined his concern that the remedies for climate change might prove more damaging to the environment than the ailment itself. Taylor argued that his work with the CRI had given him a deeper insight into the impacts associated with powering a modern economy from renewable sources. Despite an endorsement by the drafting author of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] – Professor Jackson Davis, with whom he worked at the UN and who had played a role in setting up the Framework Climate Convention, the book received little publicity at first – but in the lead up to the [[Copenhagen summit]], his views were widely publicized.&lt;ref name=r7 /&gt; However, Taylor is critical of how the environmental movement and left-liberal press have ignored the book - it was not reviewed in [[The Guardian]], [[The Independent]], [[The Observer]], nor in [[New Scientist]], all of which had previously covered his work. He has become a target of ''ad hominem'' attacks focussed either on whether he is adequately qualified to review climate science or on his embrace of mystical philosophy and shamanism.&lt;ref name=r28 /&gt;
His detractors have focussed upon his statements in ''Shiva's Rainbow'' of how science in public policy is mostly theatre and how he was more of an actor than a scientist. Taylor admits freely that most of his work was as a lawyer - 'the ultimate actor', but argues that his record as a skilled and experienced policy analyst has been glossed over by those who are averse to his message on climate change.&lt;ref name=r6 /&gt;

==Yoga and healing work==

In his autobiography, Taylor gives an account of studying with the yogic master [[Haidakhan Babaji|Babaji]], training with the founder of rebirthing [[Leonard Orr]], and practising as a breathing therapist and teacher of meditation – in which he now has an international reputation,&lt;ref name=r31 /&gt; whilst at the same time being heavily involved in environmental activism. In recent years he has also trained with western [[shamanic]] practitioners and brings this perspective into his ecological conservation work &lt;ref name=r32 /&gt; and is often invited to speak at 'alternative' conventions where he has outlined his understanding of the connections between science and consciousness.&lt;ref name=r33 /&gt; Taylor featured in Karen Sawyer's ''The Dangerous Man'' as someone who challenges the fixed paradigms of science and social control.&lt;ref name=r34 /&gt;

He warns in his recent presentations and in his autobiography, that humanity faces a crisis of consciousness and that much of the enthusiasm and caring for the Earth especially among young people, is being channelled into collusion with undemocratic corporate power structures in the banking world.&lt;ref name=r35 /&gt; In this vein, he argues in ''Chill'' that mitigation of climate change is a delusion and that resources need to be channelled into adaptation and the creation of resilient human communities and a robust biodiversity.

In August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] in California in 2015. Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/08/toyota-to-start-selling-hydrogen-fuel-cell-car-in-2015/1#.UXK8KLWG18E|title=Toyota to start selling hydrogen fuel-cell car in 2015 |author=Alisa Priddle |work=[[USA Today]]|date=2013-03-17|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in September 2012 Toyota announced that is backing away from fully electric vehicles. The company's vice chairman, [[Takeshi Uchiyamada]], said "''The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society’s needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge''." Toyota's emphasis would be re-focused on the hybrid concept, and 21 new hybrid gas-electric models scheduled to be on the market by 2015.&lt;ref name=WP0912&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Automotive/2012/09/24/Toyota-beefs-up-green-vehicles-plans-electric-car-for-this-year-fuel-cell-vehicle-by-2015.html|title=Toyota beefs up green vehicles, plans electric car for this year, fuel cell vehicle by 2015 |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ludwig, Sean|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/09/24/toyota-kills-electric-car-plans/|title=Toyota kills electric car plans, says 'capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society’s needs'|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of [[Toyota]]'s effort to maintain its alternative propulsion lead, it launched for retail customers the [[Toyota Mirai]] [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen]] [[fuel cell vehicle]] in late 2014, and [[Honda]] plans to launch the [[Honda Clarity Fuel Cell|Clarity Fuel Cell]] by late 2016.&lt;ref name=FCEV_BEV/&gt; Toyota is responding to interest in the hydrogen economy in its home market, where, {{as of|2014|12|lc=y}}, there were 100,000 residential [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]s already installed across Japan. The country is aiming for 5.3 million households, or roughly 10%, to have fuel cells by 2030.&lt;ref name=JapanFCEV/&gt; Nevertheless, in June 2015 Toyota announced its plans to continue a strong promotion of [[plug-in hybrid]]s starting with the introduction of the [[Prius Prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/business/view/toyota-gets-bullish-on-plug-in-hybrids-with-new-prius-prime | title=Toyota gets bullish on plug-in hybrids with new Prius Prime | first=Yuri | last=Kageyama | work=[[Japan Today]] | date=2016-06-17 | accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Shoichi Kaneko, assistant chief engineer for the [[Prius Prime]], said in an interview with the website AutoblogGreen that creating the next-generation Prius will be a tremendously difficult challenge due to the physical limitations to improve the Prius' fuel economy. And considering that Toyota "wants to lead the way in reducing (and eventually eliminating) fossil fuels from its vehicles, simply making a better standard hybrid powertrain might not be enough,"  the carmaker is considering making every future Prius a [[plug-in hybrid]] beginning with the fifth-generation models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2016/09/28/toyota-every-future-prius-plug-in-hybrid/ | title=Toyota: Every future Prius might be a plug-in hybrid | first=Sebastian | last=Blanco | work=Autoblog.com | date=2016-09-28 | accessdate=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese government introduced the first electric vehicle incentive program in 1996, and it was integrated in 1998 with the Clean Energy Vehicles Introduction Project, which provided subsidies and tax discounts for the purchase of [[electric vehicle|electric]], [[natural gas vehicle|natural gas]], [[methanol fuel|methanol]] and [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s.

In May 2009 the Japanese Diet passed the "Green Vehicle Purchasing Promotion Measure" that went into effect on June 19, 2009, but retroactive to April 10, 2009.&lt;ref name=JAMAFact/&gt; The program established tax deductions and exemptions for [[Green vehicle|environmentally friendly]] and fuel efficient vehicles, according to a set of stipulated environmental performance criteria, and the requirements are applied equally to both foreign and domestically produced vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4699">A '''Pump As Turbine''' or '''(PAT)''', otherwise known as a ‘'''Pump in Reverse'''’, is an unconventional type of reaction water turbine, which behaves in a similar manner to that of a [[Francis turbine]]. The function of a PAT is comparable to that of any [[turbine]], to convert kinetic and pressure energy of the fluid into mechanical energy of the runner. They are commonly commercialized as composite pump and motor/generator units, coupled by a fixed shaft to an asynchronous [[induction type motor]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agarwal|first1=Tarang|title=Review of pump as turbine (PAT) for micro-hydropower|journal=International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering|date=November 2012|volume=2|issue=11|page=163-169|citeseerx=10.1.1.414.3606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=A.A.|title=Pumps as turbines for low cost micro hydro power|journal=Renewable Energy|date=September 1996|volume=9|issue=1-4|pages=1227–1234|doi=10.1016/0960-1481(96)88498-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other conventional machines which require being manufactured according to the client’s specifications, pumps are a very common piece of equipment widely available in different sizes and functionality anywhere around the globe. When used as a turbine, the rotor moves in the opposite direction, or in reverse, as to when it is operating as a pump. In this manner, it allows the motor may generate electrical power.

== History ==
First mentions of the possibility of using pumps as turbines (PAT) dates back to the early 1930s and are associated to lab experiments performed by Thoma and Kittredge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thoma|first1=D|last2=Kittredge|first2=C|title=Centrifugal pumps operated under abnormal conditions|journal=Power|date=1931|page=881–884}}&lt;/ref&gt; who first identified the potential for a common pump to function quite efficiently as a turbine by reversing the flow.

Subsequently, in the second half of the 20th century, a new impulse for research on this topic came from the pump manufacturing industry. During this time, established collaborations with several research institutes helped develop an in-depth understanding of the phenomena associated with PAT utilization. Efforts were made to develop methods to predict characteristic and efficiency curves. This helped determine the Best Efficiency Point (BEP) of these machines, in turbine mode, and related it to its specifications when used as a pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Punit|title=Optimization of internal hydraulics and of system design for PUMPS AS TURBINES with field implementation and evaluation|journal=Universität Karlsruhe (TH): Diss. Institut für Wasserwirtschaft und Kulturtechnik|date=2005|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.459.9416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Among the existing designs of hydraulic pumps/PATs, "centrifugal" or "radial" units are the most used worldwide in a wide variety of application fields.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grundfos Industry|title=Pump Handbook|date=2004|url=http://noteswww.grundfos.com/web/homeind.nsf/Grafikopslag/handbookPDF/$file/Pump_handbook_industry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from the radial path followed by the fluid in the rotor: from the centre to the periphery when running as a pump and in the opposite direction when flow is reversed.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramos|first1=Helena|title=Guidelines for Design of Small Hydropower Plants|date=2000|url=http://www.civil.ist.utl.pt/~didia/FCT2009/book-SHP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve a higher [[head drop]] across the machine, more [[impeller]]s can be assembled in series to create a multistage unit. Conversely, a double flow radially split pump/PAT design involves a single radial open rotor fed by two symmetric inlets and enable processing a higher flow rate with respect to a standard radial unit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
A second type of pump/PAT design is the axial one, in which the fluid interacts with a propeller following a trajectory parallel to the pump axis. Such units are particularly suitable to processing high flow rates with low head difference. Finally, mixed flow pumps/PATs stand in between the applicability range of radial and axial units and have an impeller shaped in a similar way as a Francis turbine.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
Another special pump/PAT design is that of submersible units, which can possibly be fitted inside a pipe connected to draft tube exploiting small head differences in flowing rivers.

'''Robert Edward Ulanowicz''' is an American [[theoretical ecology|theoretical ecologist]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Poles|Polish]] descent who in his search for a ''unified theory of ecology'' has formulated a paradigm he calls ''Process Ecology''.&lt;ref&gt;"Who's Who in Polish America" 1st Edition 1996-1997, Boleslaw Wierzbianski editor; Bicentennial Publishing Corporation, New York, NY, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He was born September 17, 1943 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland.

He served as Professor of Theoretical Ecology at the [[University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science]]'s [[Chesapeake Biological Laboratory]] in [[Solomons, Maryland]] until his retirement in 2008.  Ulanowicz received both his BS and PhD in [[chemical engineering]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1964 and 1968, respectively.

Ulanowicz currently resides in [[Gainesville, Florida]], where he holds a Courtesy Professorship in the Department of Biology at the [[University of Florida]]. Since relocating to Florida, Ulanowicz has served as a scientific advisor to the [[Howard T. Odum]] Florida Springs Institute, an organization dedicated to the preservation and welfare of Florida's natural [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://floridaspringsinstitute.org/board-of-directors |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402043550/http://floridaspringsinstitute.org/board-of-directors |archive-date=2016-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Ulanowicz uses techniques from [[information theory]] and [[thermodynamics]] to study the organization of flows of energy and nutrients within ecosystems.  Although his ideas have been primarily applied in ecology, many of his concepts are abstract and have been applied to other areas in which [[flow network]]s arise, such as [[psychology]] and [[economics]].

Though Ulanowicz began his career modeling ecological systems using differential equations, he soon reached the limits of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, K.H., T.C. Platt and R.E Ulanowicz, (eds) 1981, ''Mathematical Models in Biological Oceanography'', UNESCO Monographs on Oceanographic Methodology, 7 UNESCO Press, Paris, 157 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that any ecosystem is a [[complex system]], he decided to move away from what he saw as the inappropriate use of the [[reductionism|reductionist]] approach, and instead began to work towards development of theoretical measures of the ecosystem as a whole, such as [[ascendency]]. Gradually, he came to appreciate the ecosystem behavior is not simply a matter of "mechanics with noise," but rather an intricate interplay between opposing tendencies—autocatalytic-like self-organization and entropic decay. This natural conversation could be followed quantitatively using information-theoretic measures applies to networks of trophic processes.

Following [[Gregory Bateson]], Ulanowicz points out how ecology differs significantly from [[physics]] in that constraints that are absent play important roles in ecosystem dynamics. He also argues how the homogeneous laws of physics only constrain the behavior of very heterogeneous ecosystems but are incapable by themselves of determining outcomes. He goes so far as to suggest that an entirely new metaphysics, which he calls ''Process Ecology'', is required to understand complex living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ulanowicz, Robert E. "Process Ecology: Making Room for Creation." ''Sophia'' (2016): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

One pertinent discovery by Ulanowicz was that ecosystems do not progress to maximum efficiency. Ecosystems that channel too much activity along the most efficient pathways do so at the expense of redundant, less-efficient processes that can function to take over vital activities in the event that mainstream processes are distributed. Ecosystems that persist are those that achieve a balance between the mutually exclusive attributes of efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Ulanowicz, R.E. 2009. "The dual nature of ecosystem dynamics ''Ecological Modeling'' 220: 1886-1892.&lt;/ref&gt; This result from nature poses a significant challenge to mainstream economics, wherein market efficiency is held to be the ''sine qua non''.&lt;ref&gt;Goerner, S.J., Lietaer, B., and Ulanowicz, R.E. 2009. "Quantifying economic sustainability: Implications for free-enterprise theory, policy, and practice." ''Ecological Economics'' 69:76-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Ulanowicz has authored or co-authored over two hundred articles in theoretical ecology and related areas of philosophy, especially those dealing with [[autocatalysis]] and [[causality]].  He has authored three books to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/CQ/V04N3/side4/ Profile: A Scientist for All Seasons] Chesapeake Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palms==

While living in Maryland, Ulanowicz took up a hobby of cultivating and casually breeding cold-hardy palm trees; he drew attention for a [[Windmill palm]] on [[Solomons, Maryland|Solomons Island]] that grew taller than the one-story building it was planted outside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.somdnews.com/stories/102506/recfea163931_32093.shtml Erica Mitrano, "Palm gracing Solomons conjures a tropical breeze", ''Southern Maryland Newspapers Online'', Oct. 25, 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326094505/http://ww2.somdnews.com/stories/102506/recfea163931_32093.shtml |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Ulanowicz was named the recipient of the 2007 [[Ilya Prigogine]] Medal for outstanding research in ecological systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2007/eco07/ ECOSUD 2007: Sixth International Conference on Ecosystems and Sustainable Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007164714/http://www.wessex.ac.uk/conferences/2007/eco07/ |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He participated in the [[Stock Exchange of Visions]] project in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockexchangeofvisions.org/speaker.php?id=49 |title=Robert E. Ulanowicz, Ecologist |publisher=Stock Exchange of Visions |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulanowicz was a featured speaker at the 2009 Ill STOQ International Conference entitled "Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories," which discussed the impacts and effects of the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by rankup |url=http://www.evolution-rome2009.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=58&amp;lang=en |title=自分を信じて転職サイトを使おう – 転職サイトを使う前に自分には能力がないなんて思わないで |publisher=Evolution-rome2009.net |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sandpiper pipeline''' is a {{convert|616|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} underground [[oil pipeline]] project in the United States. It would carry light [[crude oil]] from the [[Bakken formation|Bakken]] oil fields in Northwest [[North Dakota]], through [[Minnesota]], to end in [[Superior, Wisconsin]]. [[Enbridge Energy Partners]], and Williston Basin Pipe Line LLC, an indirect subsidiary of [[Marathon Petroleum Corporation]] have been planning the project since 2013. In 2015 Enbridge estimated the pipeline will cost about $2.6 billion.

==History==
The Sanpiper pipeline project was made public by the media in 2013, and informational hearings for landowners took place in three North Dakota towns during March 2014. The [[North Dakota Public Service Commission]] approved the pipeline in June 2014.&lt;ref name=NDPUC&gt;[http://www.psc.nd.gov/database/docket_view_list.php?s_dept=PU&amp;s_year_case=13&amp;s_seq_num=848&amp;s_company_name=Enbridge+Pipelines+%28North+Dakota%29+LLC Case #:  PU-13-848] North Dakota Public Service Commission, retrieved 23 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Public Utilities Commission]] unanimously approved the Sandpiper pipeline, but its decision was overturned in September 2015.&lt;ref name=garvey/&gt;  

In September 2016, [[Enbridge Energy Partners]] announced that due to "extensive and unprecedented [regulatory] delays [which] have plagued the Sandpiper pipeline," they were withdrawing their state application and asking for an end to regulatory proceedings, including work on an environmental-impact statement. An Enbridge spokesperson said that the pipeline may be reconsidered once the oil market rebounds but it was then "outside the company’s current five-year planning horizon".&lt;ref name="Star Tribune"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.startribune.com/enbridge-energy-pulling-plug-on-sandpiper-pipeline/392082361/ | title=Enbridge Energy pulling plug on Sandpiper pipeline | publisher=Star Tribune | date=September 2, 2016 | accessdate=31 October 2016 | author=Hughlett, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
In 2015, Enbridge stated that "The Sandpiper Pipeline serves the oil conducting needs of North Dakota residents, which constitutes a public benefit". Per Enbridge, the Sandpiper pipeline represents a "public use", a "statutorily defined public utility.", and its route was chosen with the "greatest public benefit and the least private injury." and "As long as the public benefit can be demonstrated, it is immaterial that private interests are also served." &lt;ref&gt;John Hageman [http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/3814192-gf-county-landowner-plans-appeal-pipeline-decisionGF County landowner plans to appeal pipeline decision. Grand Fork Herald, 9 August 2015, retrieved 23 December 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Per Enbridge, the pipeline is necessary "to meet demand for Bakken oil".&lt;ref name=kare/&gt;
The corporation projects economic benefits of $69 million in property tax revenue for the 3 states, and 3000 construction jobs for workers in Minnesota and North Dakota.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

==Description==

The pipeline would enter Minnesota just south of [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]], east to [[Clearbrook, Minnesota|Clearbrook]] Enbridge's terminal. and then south toward Park Rapids along an existing crude oil corridor. Afterwards, the pipeline would run in a transmission line corridor to [[Superior, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=kare&gt;Greg Vandegrift [http://www.kare11.com/story/news/2015/02/10/sandpiper-oil-pipeline-minnesota/23173281/ Sandpiper oil pipeline divides Minnesota] Kare11, TEGNA, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The route passes through 28&amp;nbsp;rivers, including the [[Mississippi River]] headwaters, and lakes and wetlands that can’t be reached by nearby roads if a spill should occur.&lt;ref name="Star Tribune"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.startribune.com/enbridge-energy-pulling-plug-on-sandpiper-pipeline/392082361/ | title=Enbridge Energy pulling plug on Sandpiper pipeline | publisher=Star Tribune | date=September 2, 2016 | accessdate=31 October 2016 | author=Hughlett, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Dakota portion===
Informational hearings for landowners took place in three North Dakota towns during March 2014. The [[North Dakota Public Service Commission]] approved the pipeline on 25 June 2014.&lt;ref name=NDPUC/&gt;

Enbridge sued a couple in Grand Forks in 2014, because they refused to give Enbridge an easement and right-of-way. the couple quoted NDPL's abuse of eminent domain, continued reliance on fossil fuels their effect on the environment and possibility for spills as arguments. In August 2015 the couple agreed on an easement, and forfeited compensation, in order to file an appeal to the North Dakota Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;John Hageman [http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/local/3815600-watch-now-jury-trial-avoided-grand-forks-sandpiper-pipeline-case Jury trial avoided in Grand Forks Sandpiper Pipeline case.] Grand Forks Herald 11 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minnesota portion===
In November 2013, Enbridge applied at the [[Minnesota Public Utilities Commission]] (MPUC). The MPUC unanimously approved the project, allowing to do an environmental review later. In September 2015, the {[[Minnesota Court of Appeals]] overruled the PUC decision as a violation of state law.&lt;ref name=garvey/&gt;

In a November 2014 Star Tribune commentary a Polk County commissioner, a Clearwater County commissioner and a Red Lake County commissioner opined, that the Sandpiper pipeline was the "best choice for the state...better than trucks or rail and also offer[ing] economic benefits."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Strandell, Duane Hayes and John Lerohl [http://www.startribune.com/sandpiper-pipeline-is-best-choice-for-state/283548741/ Sandpiper pipeline is best choice for state] Star Tribune, November 23, 2014, retrieved 23 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]], represented by [[Winona LaDuke]] stated that the pipeline would cross a portion of its land, which Enbridge disputes. La Duke has been against the pipeline because it would violate Indian sovereignty and for environmental reasons.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;Justin Glawe [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/02/the-pipeline-fight-pitting-native-americans-against-big-oil.html The Pipeline Fight Pitting Native Americans Against Big Oil] The Daily Beast, 2 February 2015, retrieved 23 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of [[North America's Building Trades Unions]] came out in a December 2015 commentary criticizing the Minnesota Court of Appeals decision, accused the court was "robbing hard-working Minnesotans of jobs" which would provide workers with a path to middle class.&lt;ref name=garvey&gt;Sean McGarvey [http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/columns/3900487-labors-view-sandpiper-pipeline-promises-bright-future Labor's view: Sandpiper pipeline promises a bright future], Duluth News Tribune10 December 2015, retrieved 23 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thai Airways International Flight 601''' was a [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] that crashed into the sea on landing at the former [[Kai Tak Airport]], Hong Kong, in a typhoon on Friday 30 June 1967.

== Accident ==
[[Thai Airways|Thai Airways International]] Flight 601 took off from [[Taipei Songshan Airport]] (TSA/RCSS) on a flight to [[Kai Tak Airport]]. The [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] (Registration: HS-TGI which had its first flight in 1960) had 73 passengers and 7 crew on board and after a 1-hour flight was on an [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] approach to land on runway 31 at [[Hong Kong-Kai Tak International Airport]] (HKG/VHHH). With a typhoon over Hong Kong at the time of the approach, the Captain was busy looking for visual contact with the ground not noticing that the aircraft had descended below the decision height of {{convert|415|ft}}. The aircraft made an abrupt heading change (while already {{convert|80|ft}} below the glide slope), then entered a high rate of descent and crashed into the sea short of runway 31 under-shoot. The accident killed 24 passengers out of 80 passengers and crew on board.

== Probable cause ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The probable cause of the accident was crew error, not noticing that the aircraft had descended below the glide slope. The presence of strong wind shear and downdrafts is also a probable major factor, however at the time of the accident there was no means of measuring these phenomena available at Kai Tak.
* The pilots did not adhere to the Thai Airways procedure for a 'captain monitored' approach in bad visibility.
* The captain did not monitor the approach adequately.
* The abrupt heading change after the aircraft descended below minimum altitude may have exacerbated a high rate of descent.
* Downdrafts and wind shear may have contributed to the height loss which resulted from this mishandling.

The '''tomín''' (plural '''tomines''', abbreviated '''t''') is an antiquated Spanish unit of weight and currency. It was equivalent to one-eighth of a ''[[peso]]'', both in currency and weight, and derived from the Arabic term ''tomn'' ("one eighth").&lt;ref name="Diez2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Diez|title=The Sumario Compendioso of Brother Juan Diez: The Earliest Mathematical Work of the New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMPFWyZXid4C&amp;pg=PA9|date= 2007|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-60206-325-9|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die Kinderspiele - Verschiedene Kreisel.jpg|thumb|Extract from ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

A '''spinning top''' is a [[toy]] designed to [[rotation|spin]] rapidly on the ground, the motion of which causes it to remain precisely balanced on its tip because of its [[Inertia#Rotational inertia|rotational inertia]]. Such toys have existed since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Traditionally tops were constructed of [[wood]], sometimes with an [[iron]] tip, and would be set in motion by aid of a [[twine|string]] or [[rope]] coiled around its axis which, when pulled quickly, caused a rapid unwinding that would set the top in motion. Today they are often built of [[plastic]], and modern materials and manufacturing processes allow tops to be constructed with such precise balance that they can be set in motion by a simple twist of the fingers and twirl of the wrist without need for string or rope.

}}

The motion of a top is produced in the most simple forms by twirling the stem using the fingers. More sophisticated tops are spun by holding the axis firmly while pulling a string or twisting a stick or pushing an [[auger (drill)|auger]]. In the kinds with an auger, an internal weight rotates, producing an overall circular motion. Some tops can be thrown, while firmly grasping a string that had been tightly wound around the stem, and the [[centrifugal force]] generated by the unwinding motion of the string will set them spinning upon touching ground.

The top is one of the oldest recognizable toys found on [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites. Spinning tops originated independently in cultures all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = D. W. Gould | title = The Top | publisher = Clarkson Potter | location = NY |year = 1973 | isbn = 0-517-50416-2}}{{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides toys, tops have also historically been used for [[gambling]] and [[prophecy]]. Some [[role-playing game]]s use tops to augment [[dice]] in generating randomized results; it is in this case referred to as a ''spinner''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} A [[thumbtack]] may also be made to spin on the same principles. Gould mentions [[maple]] [[samara (fruit)|seeds]], [[celt (tool)|celts]] (leading to [[rattleback]]s), the [[bow drill|fire-drill]], the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] [[spindle whorl|whorl]], and the [[potter's wheel]] as possible predecessors to the top, which he assumes was invented or discovered multiple times in multiple places.&lt;ref&gt;Gould (1973), p.20-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of a top is described by equations of [[rigid body dynamics]] (see the section [[rigid body dynamics#Rotation in three dimensions|Rotation in three dimensions]]). Typically the top will at first wobble until the shape of the tip and its interaction with the surface force it upright; contrary to what is sometimes assumed, longstanding scientific studies (and easy experimentations reproducible by anyone) show that less friction increases the time before the upright position is reached (unless the top is so unbalanced that it falls before reaching it).&lt;ref name="Crabtree"&gt;{{cite book | author = H. Crabtree | title = An Elementary Treatment of the Theory of Spinning Tops and Gyroscopic Motion | publisher = Longman, Green and C | location = London |year = 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spinning upright (in the so-called "sleep" position) for an extended period, the [[angular momentum]] will gradually lessen (mainly due to friction), leading to ever increasing [[precession]], finally causing the top to topple in a frequently violent last thrash. In the "sleep" period, and only in it, provided it is ever reached, less friction means longer "sleep" time (whence the common error that less friction implies longer global spinning time)

There have been many developments within the technology of the top. Bearing tops, with a tip made of a small hard ceramic, tungsten carbide or even ruby ball (sometimes wrongly believed to spin with respect to the body of the top), have been one of the biggest changes. In addition, plastic and metal have largely supplanted the use of wood in tops. Fixed tip tops are featured in National Championships in [[Chico, California]] and in the World Championships in [[Orlando, Florida]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The following two well-known characteristics of a top that increase its global spinning time (&lt;ref name="Crabtree"/&gt;) are exploited in various ways in such championships and by the main top makers (obviously, an optimisation of both characteristics has to be somehow restricted by conditions on mass and/or diameter and by practical considerations about the rim not touching the spinning surface too early):

- low center of gravity

- high moment of inertia


A top may also be used to demonstrate visual properties, such as by [[James David Forbes]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in Maxwell's disc (see [[color triangle]]). By rapidly spinning the top, Forbes created the illusion of a single color that was a mixture of the primaries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Natural Philosophy of James Clerk Maxwell|author=Peter Michael Harman|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-00585-X|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qf6jtc4nZisC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=forbes+maxwell+color+top|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227210539/https://books.google.com/books?id=qf6jtc4nZisC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=forbes+maxwell+color+top|archivedate=2017-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] experiments of Professor J. D. Forbes, which I witnessed in 1849… [established] that blue and yellow do not make green, but a pinkish tint, when neither prevails in the combination…[and the] result of mixing yellow and blue was, I believe, not previously known.|James Clerk Maxwell|Experiments on colour, as perceived by the eye, with remarks on colour-blindness (1855), [[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]}}

Maxwell took this a step further by using a circular scale around the rim with which to measure the ratios of the primaries, choosing [[vermilion]] (V), [[emerald (color)|emerald]] (EG), and [[ultramarine]] (U).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell|author=James Clerk Maxwell|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|isbn=0-486-49560-4|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=duyKrTNps_AC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=maxwell+vermilion+emerald+ultramarine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227210539/https://books.google.com/books?id=duyKrTNps_AC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=maxwell+vermilion+emerald+ultramarine|archivedate=2017-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asymmetric tops of virtually any shape can also be created and designed to balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bächer|first1=Moritz|last2=Whiting|first2=Emily|last3=Bickel|first3=Bernd|last4=Sorkine-Hornung|first4=Olga|title=Spin-It: Optimizing Moment of Inertia for Spinnable Objects|journal=ACM Conference on Computer Graphics &amp; Interactive Techniques ([[SIGGRAPH]]) 2014|date=August 10–14, 2014|url=http://www.disneyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/Project_SpinIt_SIGGRAPH14_paper.pdf|accessdate=15 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810090719/http://www.disneyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/Project_SpinIt_SIGGRAPH14_paper.pdf|archivedate=10 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trash Inc: The Secret Life of Garbage''''' is a one-hour television documentary film that aired on [[CNBC]] on September 29, 2010 about [[waste|trash/garbage]], what happens to it when it's "thrown away", and its impact on the world.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-secret-garbage-20100929,0,2134032.story Television review: 'Trash Inc.'], [[Susan Carpenter]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The film is hosted by CNBC ''Squawk Box'' co-anchor [[Carl Quintanilla]] as he reports from various [[landfill]]s (such as the largest in the United States, the Apex Landfill in [[Clark County, Nevada]]), business, and other locations in the United States (New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, South Carolina) and China (mostly [[Beijing]]).

The idea for ''Trash, Inc'' was born of the [[2008 recession]] and the relative stability of publicly traded waste management companies.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

'''Uranium hydride''', also called '''uranium trihydride''' (UH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is an [[inorganic compound]] and a [[transition metal hydride|hydride]] of [[uranium]].

==Properties==
Uranium hydride is a highly toxic, brownish grey to brownish black [[pyrophoric]] powder or brittle solid. Its density at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is 10.95 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, much lower than that of uranium (19.1 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). It has a metallic conductivity, is slightly soluble in [[hydrochloric acid]] and decomposes in [[nitric acid]].

Two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist, both cubic: an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is grown when the formation temperature is above 250&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"/&gt; After growth, both forms are metastable at room temperature and below, but the α form slowly converts to the β form upon heating to 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=mor&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerd Meyer|author2=Lester R. Morss|title=Synthesis of lanthanide and actinide compounds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnS5elHL2w8C&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=11 October 2011|year=1991|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-1018-1|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both α- and β-UH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] at temperatures below ~180 K. Above 180 K, they are paramagnetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. H. J. Buschow|title=Concise encyclopedia of magnetic and superconducting materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9mvytGEBtwC&amp;pg=PA901|accessdate=11 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044586-1|pages=901–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation in uranium metal==

===Hydrogen gas reaction===

Exposition of uranium metal to hydrogen leads to [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. Hydrogen diffuses through metal and forms a network of brittle hydride over the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. Hydrogen can be removed and ductility renewed by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] in [[vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSAkBkAZ-J4C&amp;pg=PA232|title=Plasma and high frequency processes for obtaining and processing materials in the nuclear fuel cycle|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2003|isbn=1-59033-009-9 |page=232|author=I. N. Toumanov|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium metal heated to 250 to 300 [[Celsius|°C]] (482 to 572 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) reacts with [[hydrogen]] to form '''uranium hydride'''. Further heating to about 500&amp;nbsp;°C will reversibly remove the hydrogen. This property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium [[carbide]], [[nitride]], and [[halide]] compounds.&lt;ref name="EncyChem782"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements |chapter=Uranium |year=1968 |authorlink=Glenn T. Seaborg |first=Glenn T. |last=Seaborg |publisher=Reinhold Book Corporation |location=[[Skokie, Illinois]] |page=782|id=LCCCN 68-29938}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reversible reaction proceeds as follows:&lt;ref name=wib&gt;{{cite book|author1=Egon Wiberg|author2=Nils Wiberg|author3=Arnold Frederick Holleman|title=Inorganic chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mtth5g59dEIC&amp;pg=PA239|accessdate=11 October 2011|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9|pages=239–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium hydride is not an [[interstitial compound]], causing the metal to expand upon hydride formation. In its [[crystal structure|lattice]], each uranium atom is surrounded by 6 other uranium [[atom]]s and 12 atoms of [[hydrogen]]; each hydrogen atom occupies a large tetrahedral hole in the lattice.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0ZdEdgLlP0C&amp;pg=PA789|title=Text Book Of Inorganic Chemistry|author=Amit Arora|page=789|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2005 |isbn=81-8356-013-X|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of hydrogen in uranium hydride is approximately the same as in liquid water or in [[liquid hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VW7Nl0L0GeoC&amp;pg=PA393|title=Alternative Energy Systems in Building Design (GreenSource Books)|author=Peter Gevorkian|page=393|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2009|isbn=0-07-162147-4 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-H-U linkage through a hydrogen atom is present in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l3bYxwBWMcC&amp;pg=PA218|title=Environmental Pollution |author=G. Singh|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2007|isbn=81-8356-241-8 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water reaction===

Uranium hydride forms when uranium metal (e.g. in [[Magnox]] fuel with corroded [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]]) becomes exposed to water; the reaction proceeds as follows:
:7 U + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3 UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 UH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The resulting uranium hydride is pyrophoric;  if the metal (e.g. a damaged [[fuel rod]]) is exposed to air afterwards, excessive heat may be generated and the bulk uranium metal itself can ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|page=49|title=Rust never sleeps|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |publisher=Books.google.com |year= 1994|accessdate=2010-02-07|volume=50|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydride-contaminated uranium can be [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by exposition to a gaseous mixture of 98% [[helium]] with 2% [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teton.if.uidaho.edu/emsp/overviewflowviz.html |title=EMSP |publisher=Teton.if.uidaho.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930205434/http://teton.if.uidaho.edu/emsp/overviewflowviz.html |archive-date=2009-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Condensed moisture on uranium metal promotes formation of hydrogen and uranium hydride; a pyrophoric surface may be formed in absence of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcPYAAANpGYC&amp;pg=PT16|title=Advanced nuclear fuel cycles and radioactive waste management|page=176|author=OECD Nuclear Energy Agency|publisher=OECD Publishing|year= 2006|isbn=92-64-02485-9|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poses a problem with underwater storage of [[spent nuclear fuel]] in [[spent fuel pond]]s. Depending on the size and distribution on the hydride particles, self-ignition can occur after an indeterminate length of exposure to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrIz5k3ALv8C&amp;pg=PA197|title=Stabilisation/Solidification Treatment and Remediation: Proceedings of the International Conference on Stabilisation/Solidification Treatment and Remediation, 12–13 April 2005, Cambridge, UK|author1=Abir Al-Tabbaa |author2=J.

Uranium metal exposed to steam produces a mixture of uranium hydride and [[uranium dioxide]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Uranium hydride exposed to water evolves hydrogen. In contact with strong oxidizers this may cause fire and explosions. Contact with [[halocarbon]]s may cause a violent reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/uraniuminsolublecompounds/recognition.html |title=Uranium &amp; Insoluble Compounds |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322215227/http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/uraniuminsolublecompounds/recognition.html |archive-date=2010-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other chemical reactions==

[[Polystyrene]]-impregnated uranium hydride powder is non-pyrophoric and can be pressed, however its hydrogen-carbon ratio is unfavorable. Hydrogenated polystyrene was introduced in 1944 instead.&lt;ref name="critas"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoTve97yYB8C&amp;pg=PA211|title=Critical Assembly: A Technical History of Los Alamos During the Oppenheimer Years, 1943–1945|isbn=0-521-54117-4|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|author=Lillian Hoddeson|page=211 |accessdate=2010-02-07|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium deuteride is said to be usable for design of some types of [[neutron initiator]]s.

Uranium hydride [[Nuclear enrichment|enriched]] to about 5% [[uranium-235]] is proposed as a combined [[nuclear fuel]]/[[neutron moderator]] for the [[Hydrogen Moderated Self-regulating Nuclear Power Module]]. According to the aforementioned patent application, the reactor design in question begins producing power when [[hydrogen]] gas at a sufficient temperature and pressure is admitted to the core (made up of granulated uranium metal) and reacts with the uranium metal to form uranium hydride.&lt;ref name="USPatApp11804450"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=_WGoAAAAEBAJ&amp;zoom=4&amp;pg=PA1|title=Patent Application 11/804450: Self-regulating nuclear power module |last=Peterson|first=Otis G. |date=2008-03-20 |work=United States Patent Application Publication |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office, Federal Government of the United States, Washington, DC, USA |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uranium hydride is both a [[nuclear fuel]] and a [[neutron moderator]]; apparently it, like other neutron moderators, will slow neutrons sufficiently to allow for fission reactions to take place; the uranium-235 atoms within the hydride also serve as the nuclear fuel. Once the nuclear reaction has started, it will continue until it reaches a certain temperature, approximately {{convert|800|°C|-2}}, where, due to the chemical properties of uranium hydride, it chemically decomposes and turns into hydrogen gas and uranium metal. The loss of neutron moderation due to the chemical [[decomposition reaction|decomposition]] of the uranium hydride will consequently slow — and eventually halt — the reaction. When temperature returns to an acceptable level, the hydrogen will again combine with the uranium metal, forming uranium hydride, restoring moderation and the nuclear reaction will start again.&lt;ref name="USPatApp11804450" /&gt;

'''Uranium zirconium hydride''' (UZrH), a combination of uranium hydride and [[zirconium(II) hydride]], is used as a fuel/moderator in the [[TRIGA]]-class reactors.

On heating with [[diborane]], uranium hydride produces [[uranium boride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qi0vujzNSz4C&amp;pg=PA235|title=Advances in inorganic chemistry and radiochemistry|volume=16|author= [[Harry Julius Emeléus]]|page=235|publisher=Academic Press|year=1974|isbn=0-12-023616-8 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[bromine]] at 300&amp;nbsp;°C, [[uranium(IV) bromide]] is produced. With [[chlorine]] at 250&amp;nbsp;°C, [[uranium(IV) chloride]] is produced. [[Hydrogen fluoride]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[uranium(IV) fluoride]]. [[Hydrogen chloride]] at 300&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[uranium(III) chloride]]. [[Hydrogen bromide]] at 300&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[uranium(III) bromide]]. [[Hydrogen iodide]] at 300&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[uranium(III) iodide]]. [[Ammonia]] at 250&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[uranium(III) nitride]]. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] at 400&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[uranium(IV) sulfide]]. [[Oxygen]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[triuranium octoxide]]. Water at 350&amp;nbsp;°C produces [[uranium dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvAbtU6XvzgC&amp;pg=PT12|title=Lanthanide and actinide chemistry|author=Simon Cotton|page=170|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006|isbn=0-470-01006-1 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium hydride ion may interfere with some [[mass spectrometry]] measurements, appearing as a peak at mass 239, creating false increase of signal for plutonium-239.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3FnEOg8tS4C&amp;pg=PA243|title=Nuclear forensic analysis|author1=Kenton James Moody |author2=Ian D.

==History==
Uranium hydride slugs were used in the "[[Demon core|tickling the dragon's tail]]" series of experiments to determine the [[critical mass]] of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/LA/Photo-Pages-2/LAP-217.htm |title=Photo – Tickling the Dragon's Tail |publisher=Mphpa.org |date=2005-08-03 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium hydride and uranium [[deuterium|deuteride]] were suggested as a [[fissile material]] for a [[uranium hydride bomb]]. The tests with uranium hydride and uranium deuteride during [[Operation Upshot–Knothole]] were disappointing, however. During the early phases of the [[Manhattan Project]], in 1943, uranium hydride was investigated as a promising bomb material; however, it was abandoned by the spring of 1944 as it turned out that such a design would be inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|page=2|title=Lying well|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |publisher=Books.google.com |date= July 1994|accessdate=2010-02-07|volume=50|issue=4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Hydrogen, [[deuterium]], and [[tritium]] can be purified by reacting with uranium, then thermally decomposing the resulting hydride/deuteride/tritide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYCBJIKpC2gC&amp;pg=PA104|title=Thermophysical properties of lithium hydride, deuteride, and tritide and of their solutions with lithium|page=104 |publisher=Springer|year=1987|isbn=0-88318-532-6|author=E.

The swelling and pulverization at uranium hydride synthesis can be used for preparation of very fine uranium metal, if the powdered hydride is thermally decomposed.

Uranium hydride can be used for [[isotope separation]] of [[hydrogen]], preparing uranium metal powder, and as a [[reducing agent]].

'''Vacuum swing adsorption''' (VSA) is a non-cryogenic gas separation technology.

Using special solids, or [[adsorption|adsorbent]]s, VSA segregates certain gases from a gaseous mixture under minimal pressure according to the species' molecular characteristics and affinity for the adsorbents. These adsorbents (e.g., [[zeolite]]s) form a [[molecular sieve]] and preferentially adsorb the target gas species at near ambient pressure. The process then swings to a vacuum to regenerate the adsorbent material.

VSA differs from cryogenic distillation techniques of [[gas separation]] as well as [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) techniques because it operates at near-ambient temperatures and pressures. VSA may actually be best described as a subset of the larger category of PSA.  It differs primarily from PSA in that PSA typically vents to atmospheric pressures, and uses a pressurized gas feed into the separation process.  VSA typically draws the gas through the separation process with a vacuum.  For oxygen and nitrogen VSA systems, the vacuum is typically generated by a blower.  Hybrid [[Pressure swing adsorption|VPSA]] systems also exist.  VPSA systems apply pressurized gas to the separation process and also apply a vacuum to the purge gas.  VPSA systems, like one of the portable oxygen concentrators, are among the most efficient systems, measured on customary industry indices, such as recovery (product gas out/product gas in), productivity (product gas out/mass of sieve material).  Generally, higher recovery leads to a smaller compressor, blower, or other compressed gas or vacuum source and lower power consumption.  Higher productivity leads to smaller sieve beds.  The consumer will most likely consider indices which have a more directly measurable difference in the overall system, like the amount of product gas divided by the system weight and size, the system initial and maintenance costs, the system power consumption or other operational costs, and reliability.
