The natural space aims to protect the geological and orographic structure of the open cold river, the only natural step through the [[Andean mountains|Andean]] Cordilleras, linking the high western plains and tectonic [[Táchira depression]].

The area is of a very populated vegetation, whose flora plays a regulating role of the microclimatic conditions in its surroundings. The Cerros de Blanquisal are known for their scenic beauty. Close to its borders, which extend to the banks of the river Uribante, join the rivers Frío and Quinimari.

The natural area also protects the transitability of the road that connects San Cristóbal with the regions of the Uribante.

[[File:Antarktyda i Antarktyka.jpg|thumb|Earth image on September 21, 2005 with the full Antarctic region visible]]

'''Antarctic sea ice''' is the [[sea ice]] of the [[Southern Ocean]]. It extends far north in winter and retreats almost to the coastline each summer. Sea ice is frozen seawater that is usually less than a few meters thick. This is in contrast to [[ice shelf|ice shelves]], which are formed by [[glaciers]], float in the sea, and are up to a kilometer thick. There are two subdivisions of sea ice: [[fast ice]], which is attached to land; and [[Drift ice|ice floes]], which are not.

Sea ice in the Southern Ocean melts from the bottom instead of from the surface like [[Arctic sea ice|Arctic ice]] because it is covered in snow. As a result, [[melt ponds]] are rarely observed. On average, Antarctic sea ice is younger, thinner, warmer, saltier, and more mobile than Arctic sea ice.&lt;ref name="ipcc.ch"&gt;http://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter04_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its inaccessibility, it is not as well-studied as Arctic ice.

== Measurements of sea ice ==
{{main|Measurement of sea ice}}

=== Extent ===
The Antarctic sea ice cover is highly seasonal, with very little ice in the [[austral summer]], expanding to an area roughly equal to that of Antarctica in winter. It peaks (~18 × 10^6&amp;nbsp;km^2) during September, which marks the end of austral winter, and retreats to a minimum (~3 × 10^6&amp;nbsp;km^2) in February.&lt;ref name="ipcc.ch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic Sea Ice|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/sea_ice_south.php|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, most Antarctic sea ice is [[first year ice]], a few meters thick, but the exact thickness is not known. The mass of 18 million km^2 of ice, for each meter of thickness, is 18,000&amp;nbsp;km^3 and roughly 16 gigatonnes (billion metric tons).&lt;ref&gt;One cubic meter of water weighs a metric ton, and there are 18 trillion cubic meters in 18 million square kilometers, one meter thick (18 million x 1 million x 1). The weight of ice is 88% that of water.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ocean off the Antarctic coast is almost always much warmer than the air over it, the extent of the sea ice is largely controlled by the winds and currents that push it northwards. If it is pushed quickly, the ice can travel much further north before it melts. Most ice is formed along the coast, as the northward-moving ice leaves areas of open water (coastal [[latent heat polynya|latent heat]] [[polynyas]]), which rapidly freeze.

[[File:Katabatic-wind hg.png|thumb]]

=== Thickness ===
{{main|Sea ice thickness}}
Because Antarctic ice is mainly first-year ice, which is not as thick as multiyear ice, it is generally less than a few meters thick. Snowfall and flooding of the ice can thicken it substantially, and the layer structure of Antarctic ice is often quite complex.

==Recent trends and climate change==
{{Further|Climate of Antarctica#Climate change in Antarctica}}

Recent changes in [[Antarctic oscillation|wind patterns]], which are connected to regional changes in the number of [[extratropical cyclone]]s and [[anticyclone]]s,&lt;ref name="Schemm_GRL_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL079109|title=Regional Trends in Weather Systems Help Explain Antarctic Sea Ice Trends|authors=Schemm, S.|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|doi=10.1029/2018GL079109|year=2018|volume=45|pages=7165–7175.}}&lt;/ref&gt; around Antarctica have advected the sea ice farther north in some areas and not as far north in others (see images). The net change is a slight increase in the area of sea ice in the Antarctic seas (unlike the Arctic Ocean, which is showing a [[Arctic ice pack#Extent and volume of sea ice and their trends|much stronger decrease]] in the area of sea ice).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/antarctic_melting.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/&lt;/ref&gt; Increased sea ice extent does not indicate that the Southern Ocean is cooling, since the Southern Ocean is warming.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/10/141006094511.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Spseaice extent 2013 chart.jpg|Antarctic sea ice cover grows in autumn and winter, and shrinks again each spring and [[summer]]. In 2013 (black line) and 2012 (red line), the ice reached the highest extents ever recorded, but it was only slightly above the historical average (blue line). Light blue regions show the range of natural variability.

File:Antarctic Grows.jpg|The (then-record) 2012 Antarctic sea ice extent; compare with the yellow outline, which shows the median sea ice extent in September from 1979 to 2000. Sea ice coverage in the Arctic has [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arctic_Sea_Ice_Shrinks.jpg shrunk at a much faster rate] than it has expanded in the Southern Ocean.

File:Spseaice sss 2012170 chart.jpg|Antarctic sea ice cover shrinks to its minimum extent each year in February or March; the ice cover then grows until reaching its maximum extent in September or October. The graph above shows the maximum extent for each September since 1979, in millions of square kilometers. There is variability from year to year, though the overall trend shows growth of about 1.5 percent per decade.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC AR5]] report concluded that "it is ''very likely''" that annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased 1.2 to 1.8% per decade, which is 0.13 to 0.20&amp;nbsp;million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per decade, during the period 1979 to 2012.&lt;ref name="AR5"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Physical Science Basis | year = 2013 | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/docs/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf |page=7| author = IPCC AR5 WG1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308023118/http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/docs/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPCC AR5 also concluded that due to the lack of data it is not possible to determine the trend in total volume or mass of the sea ice. The increase in sea ice area probably has a number of causes.&lt;ref name="NASA_QA"&gt;{{cite web |
title=Q&amp;A with NASA's Joey Comiso: What is Happening with Antarctic Sea Ice? | date=Oct 7, 2014 | url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/qa-what-is-happening-with-antarctic-sea-ice/#.VD69CvldU0O }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are tied to changes in the southern hemispheric [[Westerlies|westerly]] winds, which are a combination of natural variability and forced change from greenhouse gases and the ozone hole. Another possible driver is [[ice-shelf|ice-shelves]] melting, which increases freshwater input to the ocean; this increases the stratification of the ocean surface layer and so reduces the ability of warm subsurface water to reach the surface. A 2015 study found this effect in climate models run to simulate future climate change, resulting in an increase of sea ice in the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/56/69/a69a001.pdf|title=The effect of increased fresh water from Antarctic ice shelves on future trends in Antarctic sea ice|authors=R.

Atmospheric and oceanic drivers likely have contributed to the formation of regionally varying trends in Antarctic sea-ice extent. For example, temperatures in the atmosphere and Southern Ocean have increased during the period 1979–2004. However, sea ice grows faster than it melts, due to a [[Stratification (water)|weakly stratified]] Ocean. Thus, this oceanic mechanism is, among others, contributing to an increase in the net ice production, potentially resulting in more sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Observed autumn and spring trends in the number of [[extratropical cyclone]]s, [[anticyclone]]s and [[Block (meteorology)|blocks]], which have a strong thermodynamic control through [[advection#Meteorology|temperature advection]], and a strong dynamic control through [[Drift ice|ice-drift]], on sea-ice extent during the same and also during following seasons are almost everywhere around Antarctica in agreement with the observed, regionally varying, trends in sea-ice extent.&lt;ref name="Schemm_GRL_2018"/&gt; Consequently, the near-surface winds steered around weather systems are thought to explain large parts of the inhomogeneous Antarctica sea-ice trends.

After gradual increases in sea ice as referenced above, southern hemisphere spring (i.e. September, October and November) 2016 saw a rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice.

===Implications===

Monitoring changes in sea ice is important as this impacts the [[psychrophiles]] that live here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/sea-ice-extremophiles-and-life-on-extraterrestrial-ocean-worlds/C76FF80A75B755492331A3356CD1B824|title=Sea ice, extremophiles and life on extra-terrestrial ocean worlds|authors=Andrew Martin, Andrew McMinn|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|doi=10.1017/S1473550416000483|year=2017|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in Antarctic sea ice are also important because of implications for atmospheric and oceanic circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/environment/global_climate.html |title= Sea Ice and Global Climate |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= NSIDC |access-date=11 Jul 2018 |quote=NSIDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; When sea ice forms, it rejects salt (ocean water is saline but sea ice is largely fresh) so dense salty water is formed which sinks and plays a key role in formation of [[Antarctic Bottom Water]].

In [[ancient Rome]], '''Appias''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|i|ə|s}} was a statue of a nymph near the Appiades Fountain in the [[Forum of Caesar]]. [[Ovid]] wrote that the fountain was in the middle of the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]] and surrounded by statues of nymphs who were called "The Appiades" ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|.|ə|d|iː|z}}; plural form of Appias).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Remedia Amoris]]'', 659; ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', 1. 81., 3. 451&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lanciani, Rodolfo Amedeo.

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Appias''' was a [[naiad]] who lived in the Appian Well outside the temple to [[Venus (goddess)|Venus Genitrix]] in the [[Roman Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DGRBM|title=Appias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his letters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Ad familiares'', 3. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] refers to a statue of Minerva as "Appias". In this case, he derived this surname from the name of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher]], whom he intended to flatter.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Callisto''' or '''Kallisto''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|s|t|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc|Καλλιστώ}} {{IPA-grc|kallisˈtɔː|}}) was a [[nymph]], or the daughter  of King [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]]; the myth varies in such details.  She was one of the followers of [[Artemis]], or Diana for the Romans, who attracted [[Zeus]] (Jupiter).  He transformed himself into the figure of Artemis and seduced her in this disguise.  She became pregnant and when this was eventually discovered, she was expelled from  Artemis's group, after which a furious [[Hera]] (Juno, wife of her seducer) transformed her into a bear.  Later, just as she was about to be killed by her son when he was hunting, she was [[Catasterismi|set among the stars]] as [[Ursa Major]] ("the Great Bear").  She was the bear-mother of the [[Arcadia]]ns, through her son [[Arcas]] by Zeus.

The [[Callisto (moon)|fourth Galilean moon of Jupiter]] is named after Callisto.

==Myth==
As a follower of Artemis, Callisto, who [[Hesiod]] said&lt;ref&gt;In his lost ''Astronomy'', quoted in ''[[Catasterismi]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was the daughter of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]], king of [[Arcadia]],&lt;ref&gt;Other writers gave her a mortal genealogy as the daughter of one or the other of Lycaon's sons: Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; took a vow to remain a virgin, as did all the nymphs of Artemis. But to have sex with her, Zeus disguised himself as Artemis ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]) herself, in order to lure her into his embrace. Callisto was then turned into a [[bear]], as [[Hesiod]] described:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...but afterwards, when she was already with child, was seen bathing and so discovered. Upon this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she became a bear and gave birth to a son called Arcas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Either Artemis "slew Kallisto with a shot of her silver bow,"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Homer#Works ascribed to Homer|Homerica, The Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', 316 ff (trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps urged by the wrath of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] ([[Hera]])&lt;ref&gt;This was the version current in Greece when Pausanias visited in the second century CE ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], VIII.35.8).&lt;/ref&gt; or later [[Arcas]], the eponym of [[Arcadia]], nearly killed his bear-mother, when she had wandered into the [[Temenos|forbidden precinct]] of Zeus. In every case, Zeus placed them both in the sky as the [[constellation]]s [[Ursa Major]], called ''Arktos'' (αρκτος), the "Bear", by Greeks, and [[Ursa Minor]].
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Diana and Callisto - WGA20326.jpg|thumb|[[Diana and Callisto (Rubens)|''Diana and Callisto'']] by [[Rubens]], c. 1635]]

According to [[Ovid]],&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. Book II, Lines 405–531; Ovid narrates the myth also in ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', book II.&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Zeus) who took the form of Diana (Artemis) so that he might evade his wife Juno’s detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was separated from Diana and the other nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;The transformation of Zeus, with its [[lesbian]] overtones, was rendered as comedy in a lost work by the Attic Amphis ([http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Kallisto.html Theoi Project – Kallisto]).&lt;/ref&gt; Callisto's subsequent pregnancy was discovered several months later while she was bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Diana became enraged when she saw that Callisto was pregnant and expelled her from the group.  Callisto later gave birth to [[Arcas]]. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor|Minor]], respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] that the two might never meet her waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] positions in ancient times (see below).

==In art==
[[File:Callisto - Par Gillis CONGNET.jpg|thumb|[[Gillis Coignet]], 1580]]
Callisto's story was sometimes depicted in [[classical art]], where the moment of transformation into a bear was the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;Gods&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Renaissance on a series of major [[history painting]]s as well as many smaller [[cabinet painting]]s and book illustrations, usually called "Diana and Callisto", depicted the traumatic moment of discovery of the pregnancy, as the goddess and her nymphs bathed in a pool, following [[Ovid]]'s account.  The subject's attraction was undoubtedly mainly the opportunity it offered for a group of several females to be shown largely nude.&lt;ref&gt;There is a good but by no means complete, selection at [http://iconographic.warburg.sas.ac.uk/vpc/VPC_search/subcats.php?cat_1=5&amp;cat_2=244&amp;cat_3=2345&amp;cat_4=3995 Warburg Institute Iconographic Database, Myths → Callisto's pregnancy discovered by Diana]; more on Wikimedia Commons&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1556-1559), was the greatest (though not the first) of these, quickly disseminated by a print by [[Cornelius Cort]].&lt;ref&gt;Brigstocke, 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, as in most subsequent depictions, Diana points angrily, as Callisto is held by two nymphs, who may be pulling off what little clothing remains on her.  Other versions include [[Diana and Callisto (Rubens)|one by Rubens]], and ''[[Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto]]'' by [[Rembrandt]], which unusually combines the moment with the arrival of [[Actaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Gods&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic composition is rather unusually consistent.  [[Carlo Ridolfi]] said there was a version by [[Giorgione]], who died in 1510, though his many attributions to Giorgione of paintings that are now lost are treated with suspicion by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Martineau (ed), ''The Genius of Venice, 1500–1600'', 207, 1983, Royal Academy of Arts, London&lt;/ref&gt;  Other, less dramatic, treatments before Titian established his composition are by [[Palma Vecchio]] and [[Dosso Dossi]].

Although Ovid places the discovery in the ninth month of Callisto's pregnancy, in paintings she is generally shown with a rather modest bump for late pregnancy.  With the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'' in religious art, this was the leading recurring subject in history painting that required showing [[pregnancy in art]], which [[Early Modern]] painters still approached with some caution.  In any case, the narrative required that the rest of the group had not previously noticed the pregnancy.

Callisto being seduced by Zeus/Jupiter in disguise was also a popular subject, usually called "Jupiter and Callisto"; it was the clearest common subject with lesbian lovers from classical mythology.  The two lovers are usually shown happily embracing in a bower. The violent rape described by Ovid as following Callisto's realization of what is going on is rarely shown.  In versions before about 1700 Callisto may show some doubt about what is going on, as in the versions by Rubens. It was especially popular in the 18th century, when depictions were increasingly erotic; [[François Boucher]] painted several versions.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Gods&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''Callisto'' is lost.

==Origin of the myth==
[[File:Karel Philips Spierincks - Jupiter and Callisto.jpg|thumb|left|330px|''Jupiter and Callisto'' by [[Karel Philips Spierincks]]. In the background Jupiter's jealous wife Juno is dragging Callisto by the hair.]]
The name ''Kalliste'' (Καλλίστη), "most beautiful", may be recognized as an [[epithet]] of the goddess herself, though none of the inscriptions at Athens that record priests of ''Artemis Kalliste'' (Άρτεμις Καλλίστη), date before the third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Geagan. "The Athenian Constitution After Sulla" (''Hesperia Supplements'' '''12''' 1967:72, 95).&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis Kalliste was worshiped in Athens in a shrine which lay outside the Dipylon gate, by the side of the road to the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Klio: Beiträge Zur Alten Geschichte'' (Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften Zu Berlin Institut für Griechisch-Römische Altertumskunde) 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; W. S. Ferguson suggested&lt;ref&gt;In ''Klio'' '''7''' (1907:213f).&lt;/ref&gt; that Artemis Soteira and Artemis Kalliste were joined in a common cult administered by a single priest. The bearlike character of Artemis herself was a feature of the [[Brauronia]].

The myth in ''[[Catasterismi]]'' may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], namely Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, [[Boötes]], and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. The [[Boötes|constellation Boötes]], was explicitly identified in the Hesiodic ''Astronomia'' (Αστρονομία)&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Astronomia'', fragment 3, preserved as a quote in a commentary on [[Aratus]].&lt;/ref&gt; as Arcas, the "Bear-warden" (''Arktophylax''; Αρκτοφύλαξ):&lt;ref&gt;Thus Hesiod is quoted, though Boötes, Βοώτης, from his very name, is a ''cow'' (βοως) herdsman.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He is Arkas the son of Kallisto and Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lykaion. After Zeus had seduced Kallisto, Lykaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe [Arkas] which he had cut up.&lt;ref&gt;The episode is a doublet of the serving up of [[Pelops]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Sebastiano Ricci - Diana and Callisto - WGA19416.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastiano Ricci]], ''Diana and Callisto'', 1712-16]]
The stars of Ursa Major were all circumpolar in Athens of 400 BCE, and all but the stars in the Great Bear's left foot were circumpolar in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens; however, Ursa Minor (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong.

==Historic human use, conservation, and preservation==
Historically wood from this forest was gathered by repeatedly cutting down the tree stems to near the ground [[coppiced]]), where it resprouted.&lt;ref name=SNH/&gt; The wood was used for charcoal, tanning, and bobbin-making. These practices ended in the mid-1800s. There is currently wildland management for conservation.&lt;ref name=SNH/&gt;
Since the 20th century, conservation effort has resulted in many of the woods being protected and managed to address problems such as invasive [[Rhododendron ponticum|Rhododendron]], excessive grazing from sheep and deer, and non-native plantation trees.&lt;ref&gt;Bain C (2015)The Rainforests of Britain and Ireland - A Traveller's Guide.

'''ClearPath Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization based in [[Charlotte, NC]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] that is focused on "conservative clean energy". According to a press release, the organization was founded to propose and support policies that accelerate [[clean energy]] without expanding the size of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New National Poll Shows Strong Republican Support for Clean Energy Policies|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/clearpath-energy-poll-idUSnPnb7135F+81+PRN20150929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ClearPath was founded by Republican entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Jay Faison]] in 2013 to change the [[conservative]] viewpoint on clean energy. After selling his majority stake in the audio-visual company SnapAV, Faison donated $165 million to start ClearPath, with a mission of "accelerating conservative clean energy solutions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goode|first1=Darren|title=Republican pledges $175 million to push party on climate|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/republican-climate-change-jay-faison-118755.html|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ClearPath Foundation, About Us|url=https://clearpath.org/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

ClearPath advances its mission through "strategic grant-making, advocacy, and digital platforms", and focuses on energy policy, polling, and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://clearpath.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; ClearPath has conducted polling on Americans' attitudes towards clean energy with [[Kristen Soltis Anderson]], finding that "72% of Republicans
support accelerating the development of clean energy".&lt;ref&gt;https://clearpath.org/polling/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

The ClearPath website lists five principles used for analyzing policy. ClearPath believes in "small government, [[free markets]], and American innovation", as well as pollution [[risk management]], [[cost-benefit analysis]] and [[energy security]].&lt;ref&gt;https://clearpath.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy Areas ==
*[[Coal pollution mitigation]] and [[natural gas]] – the ClearPath Foundation argues for expanded use of natural gas and further development of [[carbon capture]], utilization and storage.&lt;ref&gt;https://clearpath.org/policy/clean-coal-and-gas-101/&lt;/ref&gt; They focus heavily on streamlining pipeline permitting and exports, as well as increasing research on carbon capture.&lt;ref&gt;https://clearpath.org/policy/clean-coal-and-gas/#streamline-exports&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] – ClearPath proposes expanded use of nuclear power in the United States, calling it "one of America's greatest success stories".&lt;ref&gt;https://clearpath.org/policy/nuclear-101/&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they support existing nuclear plants, as well as advanced nuclear such as [[small modular reactors]] and [[generation IV reactors]]. In February 2016, ClearPath's CEO Jay Faison proposed developing "super-competitive, next-generation" nuclear reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Code of Openness''' ('''CPO''') is an open initiative of [[ProSTEP iViP|prostep ivip]] under the patronage of the [[BMWi|German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (German acronym: BMWi).&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.prostep.org/2016/04/21/beitrag-2/ BMWi states CPO Patronage], 21 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym CPO originally stands for the abbreviation of Code of [[Product lifecycle|PLM]] Openness.

[[Openness]] is a capability provided by an IT system, and it is characterized by interoperability, portability and extensibility. These capabilities are implemented using IT interfaces, standards and the IT architecture. All these are technical aspects of openness, Openness is also based on non-technical aspects, which are related to the partnership between the involved partners (IT customers, IT vendors and/or IT service providers). The development of the CPO was inspired by the spirit of a "[[code of conduct]]".

Thereby, the CPO goes far beyond the requirement to provide IT standards and related interfaces. It aims seamless connectivity and the easy integration of IT in networked IT-environments and therefore combines technological IT-requirements with those of IT customer and users. CPO a standard catalogue that defines measurable criteria (‘shall’, ‘should’, ‘may’) for the following categories: interoperability, infrastructure, extensibility, interfaces, standards, architecture as well as partnership.

== History ==
From July 2011 to February 2012 representatives of [[BMW]], [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Dassault Systèmes]], [[IBM]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Parametric Technology|PTC]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], [[Siemens PLM Software]], [[T-Systems]] and [[Volkswagen]] specified the first version of the CPO, which was publicly introduced by the CIO of BMW and Continental at a conference within the context of the CeBIT 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plmportal.org/en/news-detail/codex-of-plm-openness-version-1-0-released.html CIO of BMW and Continental introduce the CPO at CeBIT], 08 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013 the CPO was continuously enhanced. Since 2014 the internationalization as well as the industrial roll-out was driven forward actively. Companies like e.g.  [[Airbus]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Fuji Heavy Industries]], [[Hino Motors|Hino]], [[Honda]], [[Isuzu Motors|Isuzu]], [[Mazda]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], [[Nissan]], [[Suzuki]], [[ThyssenKrupp|thyssenkrupp]], [[Toyota]], [[Volvo]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] joined the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prostep.org/en/cpo/initiative/signees/ CPO-Signees], 15 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the following, it became more and more clear that the CPO Criteria do not only serve the original target PLM, but also for assuring openness in IoT scenarios. Consequently, in April 2016 the German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, [[Sigmar Gabriel]], declared the patronage of the [[BMWi]] for the CPO: ''"The German industry relies on the fact, that smart products and services can be offered and applied globally. With regard to this, interoperability is the key. A certification assures trust with regard to the broad application of information and communication technology (ICT), removes technological barriers and boosts the power of the German economy."''

== Certification ==
Together with the BMWi prostep ivip currently specifies the CPO-related certification procedure. Pilot-certifications have been conducted in 2017. Companies like [https://www.conweaver.com/en/products/code-of-plm-openness CONWEAVER], HCL, PROSTEP, PTC and [https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en/about_us/newsroom/press/press_release.cfm?Component=261652&amp;ComponentTemplate=822 Siemens PLM] were the first who received this certificate. In parallel, an accredited certification program is worked out together with the [http://www.dakks.de/en DAkkS]. Additionally, related next steps on EU-level&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/openness-iot-industry-40 Openness in IoT / Industry 4.0], 01 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Japan (together with the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|METI]]) are planned.

== Publications ==
The CPO, Guidelines with hints and interpretation help, templates and the CPO annual report are published via the CPO-site of ProSTEP iViP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/en/cpo.html CPO-Homepage], 22 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The CPO itself and associated certification criteria will be published as DIN SPEC 91372. The first part, DIN SPEC 91372-1:2018-03, is already available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-91372-1/284985634 Technical Rule: DIN SPEC 91372-1:2018-03], 16 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment''' (DICE) is a scientific mission consisting of two [[Miniaturized Satellites]] '''DICE-1''' and '''DICE-2''' flying in formation. The satellites are an unusual 1.5U variant of the [[CubeSat]] design for microsatellites. Both satellites were launched from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in October 2011 atop a [[Delta II]] [[rocket]]. This was a multi-payload mission with four other CubeSats, [[AubieSat-1]], [[M-Cubed]], [[Explorer-1_Prime]] and [[RAX-2]].

The satellites are intended to map changes in the Earth's [[Plasmasphere]] caused by [[Geomagnetic storm]]s.

On board control is provided by a Pumpkin FM430 flight control module containing a [[Texas Instruments]] MPS430 [[microcontroller]]. Communications are provided by a [[half-duplex]] [[UHF]] [[modem]] with a 1.5 Mbit/s downlink (465 MHz) and 19.2 kbit/s uplink (450 MHz). The satellites carry four Electric Field Probe sensors on telescopic booms, two DC [[Langmuir probe]]s for detection of [[ions]] and a three-axis [[magnetometer]] for measuring [[magnetic fields]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18878">'''Earl Lemley Core''' (1902–1984) was a [[botanist]] and botanical educator, researcher and author as well as a local [[West Virginia]] historian. He was founder (1936) of the [[Southern Appalachian Botanical Club]] and editor of its journal, ''[[Castanea (journal)|Castanea]]'', for thirty-five years. He was a teacher and professor at [[West Virginia University]] (WVU) for over forty-four years (1928–72). He served for four years on the [[Morgantown City Council]] and was mayor of [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]] for two years. The [[Earl L. Core Arboretum]] at WVU was named in his honor in 1967.

==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Core was born on January 20, 1902, at [[Core, West Virginia]], the son of Harry Michael and Clara Edna (''[[née]]'' Lemley) Core. He graduated from [[Morgantown High School]], taught in rural schools (1920–23) and then attended WVU, earning [[Bachelor of Arts]]  (1926) and [[Master of Arts]] (1928) degrees. He married Freda Bess Garrison on June 8, 1925. (They eventually parented four children: Ruth, Merle, Harry, and David.) He earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree (1936, [[Columbia University]]) with a dissertation on the [[systematics]] of the [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] genus ''[[Scleria]]''.

===Career===
Core became an instructor at WVU in 1928 and remained on the faculty for over 44 years. He progressed to assistant professor (1934), associate professor (1941), professor (1942), and professor emeritus (1972) and was chairman of the Biology Department from 1948 to 1966. He served as curator of the university [[herbarium]] from 1934 until his retirement in 1972. In addition, he served as a member of the summer faculty at [[Ohio State University]] during 1939-41 and of [[Concord University|Concord College]] in 1961.

Core was named botanist for the [[Colombia Cinchona Mission]], [[Bogota, Colombia]], from 1943 to 1945 during which assignment he explored in the [[Andes Mountains]] in search of wartime sources of [[quinine]] from the ''[[Cinchona]]'' tree.

==Author==
In the course of his career, Core authored numerous technical articles, several books, and hundreds of newspaper articles. Two notable textbooks that became standards were ''General Biology'' by P.D. Strausbaugh, B.R. Weimer, and Earl L. Core and ''A New Manual for the Biology Laboratory'' by Core and Weimer. His botanical texts were ''The Flora of West Virginia'' (a four volume series written with Strausbaugh), ''Flora of the Erie Islands'', ''Spring Wild Flowers'', ''Plant Taxonomy'', ''Vegetation of West Virginia'', and ''The Wondrous Year'', a collection of weekly botanical writings he prepared for the ''[[Charleston Gazette|Charleston (West Virginia) Gazette]]'' newspaper.

In 1937, Core wrote ''The Chronicles of Core'', a history of his home community and in 1960 he published ''Morgantown Disciples'', a history of the First Christian Church of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]]. Late in life he embarked upon an extensive five-volume history of [[Monongalia County, West Virginia]] (1974–84), completing the last volume shortly before his death. (This material had been published over a period of 12 years in a weekly column of the Morgantown ''[[The Dominion Post (Morgantown)|Dominion Post]]'' newspaper.)

Italy is located above a relatively thin crust, with four large areas of underground heat:
* the first is [[Tuscany]], with the [[Larderello]] fields.
* the second is in [[Campania]], the [[Phlegraean Fields]]
* the third, very large and not fully explored, in the south of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armani|first=F.

* the fourth is the [[Strait of Sicily]], around the undersea [[Empedocles (volcano)|Empedocles volcano]] and [[Lampedusa|Lampedusa Island]]

A 2018 report by the Italian Geothermal Union indicated that Italy has additional geothermal energy potential which has yet to be utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.egec.org/geothermal-development-italy/|title=Geothermal development in Italy|last=|first=|date=2018-04-24|work=EGEC - European Geothermal Energy Council|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
Research into the potential for geothermal energy started in 1977, following the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], with work of [[Enel|ENEL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carella|first=R.|date=1985-01-01|title=Geothermal activity in Italy: Present status and future prospects|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375650585900653|journal=Geothermics|language=en|volume=14|issue=2-3|pages=247–254|doi=10.1016/0375-6505(85)90065-3|issn=0375-6505|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eni|ENI]], which started jointly to bore hundreds of wells in Italy, creating a complete map of the underground resource. But in the '90s, the exploratory activity stopped.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Following results a mapping of Italy in four areas:

* very high potential, with water of more than {{convert|150|°C|°F}} temperature at less than 3&amp;nbsp;km depth; area extends from NW-SE of [[Genoa]] to the [[Aeolian Islands]].
* water temperature between {{convert|90|°C|°F}} and {{convert|150|°C|°F}} at less than 3&amp;nbsp;km depth.
* water temperature between {{convert|30|°C|°F}} and {{convert|60|°C|°F}} at less than 3&amp;nbsp;km depth.
* low potential, no commercial utilization at less than 3&amp;nbsp;km depth.

== Thermal applications ==
Italy uses its lower temperature fluids for [[spa]]s, agriculture, industry and [[district heating]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A large portion of house heating is concentrated in the [[Abano Terme|Abano]] spa area, in northeast Italy. As district heating the most important plants are in [[Ferrara]] and [[Vicenza]] in the eastern [[Po Valley]], about 1990. Smaller district heating plants are found in [[Bagno di Romagna]] and [[Acqui Terme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Gypcrete''' or '''gypcrust''' is a hardened layer of [[soil]], consisting of around 95% [[gypsum]] ([[calcium sulfate]]). Gypcrust is an arid zone [[duricrust]].&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=M.J.|title=Hot Deserts: Engineering, Geology and Geomorphology: Engineering Group Working Day Report|url=https://books.google.com/?id=igeqMqSKkeAC&amp;dq=gypcrust+formation|publisher=Geological Society of London|accessdate=7 October 2013|isbn=9781862393424|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also occur in a semiarid climate in a basin with internal drainage, and is initially developed in a playa as an evaporate.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|title=gypcrete|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/250383/gypcrete|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gypcrete is the arid climate's equivalent to [[calcrete]], which is a duricrust that is unable to generate in very arid climates.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Fred G.|title=Geological Hazards: Their Assessment, Avoidance and Mitigation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eE_X-QnIQrYC&amp;dq=formation+of+gypcrust|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002|accessdate=7 October 2013|isbn=9780203014660|date=2002-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Gypcrust horizons can be up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} thick with a 75-97% gypsum (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;∙2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) content. The majority of gypsum-rich layers occur where the average annual rainfall is less than 250&amp;nbsp;mm because gypsum is moderately soluble (c. 2.6&amp;nbsp;g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&amp;nbsp;°C) and is normally leached out under higher rainfall conditions. Gypsum cements are rarely, if ever, as strong as calcretes or silcretes.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

== Formation ==
Gypcrust forms in a manner similar to that of [[Caliche (mineral)|caliche]], which is composed of [[calcium carbonate]]. The development of gypcrust has 3 main stages. The first stage is primary crystallization of the surface brines or groundwater; the second stage is transportation and redeposition by wind or water; and the third stage is post-depositional alteration above or below the [[capillary fringe]]. Most gypcrust is formed either as a result of soil-forming processes or through the precipitation of cementing agents from groundwater.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

== Influence of groundwater on the formation of duricrusts ==
There are two models that are used to illustrate the influence groundwater has on the formations of duricrusts like gypcrust: ''per ascensum'' and ''per descensum''. The ''per ascensum'' model demonstrates a situation where the water table is relatively close to the surface, allowing solutions to be drawn upwards by evaporation and eventually cement near-surface sediments once they become concentrated enough to trigger precipitation. The ''per ascensum'' model is applicable to environments with high rates of surface evaporation like deserts. This type of system only produces thin duricrust layers since the process ultimately seals the surface horizons, which consequently decreases the potential for further evaporation. This model best depicts the formation of gypcrust.
The ''per descensum'' model describes a system different from that of the formation of gypcrust in which precipitation of minerals occurs at a depth from downward-percolating solutions.  This type of system explains the formation of thick duricrust horizons.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

== Conditions for formation ==
Gypcretes form in four distinct conditions: in well drained soils, as buried evaporates, in hydromorphic soils, or by the exposure of subsurface horizons by erosion.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

== Profile ==
Gypcrete can be a loose and powdery deposit or a massive crystalline structure.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The profile of a gypcrust outcrop can have three layers. The bottom layer is the [[sand rose]] horizon at the water table where gypsum develops as [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s of crystals. The middle layer is composed of massive gypcrete cemented sand, which forms above the water table during evaporation from the capillary fringe; newly formed gypcrete will be hard, and will soften with age. The uppermost layer is usually rich in gypsified roots and has a banded or nodular structure.&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt;

== Uses ==
Gypcrete has been used successfully for road construction in the Sahara.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Well-cemented gypcrusts may also provide adequate bearing capacity for structures, however it must be ensured that the underlying uncemented material is not overloaded to avoid collapse.&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt;

[[Image:Vegetarian diet.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Food for Life distributes food on an international basis produced solely from [[vegan]] and [[lacto-vegetarian]] ingredients.]]
'''Hare Krishna Food for Life''' is the world's largest [[vegetarian]] [[non-profit]] food relief organization. Its efforts span the globe, with projects occupying over 60 countries.&lt;ref name="About Food for Life Global"&gt;[http://www.ffl.org/about/ About Food for Life Global]&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers provide up to 2,000,000 free meals daily.&lt;ref name="About Food for Life Global"/&gt; Food For Life does not only tackle only one form of hunger but reaches out to all in need, including; the homeless, disadvantaged children throughout [[India]]; and victims of natural disasters around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evana.org/index.php?id=7759 European Vegetarian and Animal News Agency article: Interview with Paul Turner]&lt;/ref&gt;

With roots in [[India]], the Food for Life project is a modern-day revival of the ancient [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] culture of hospitality with its belief in the equality of all beings. It was conceived of and began by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] in 1974 and is thus commonly known as ''ISKCON Food For Life'' or ''[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] Food For Life''. It has been lauded by ''The New York Times'' [[Vegetarian Times]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Nelson Mandela]] amongst others, for its relief efforts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ffl.org/emergency-relief/new-york-times/|title=New York Times - Food for Life Global - Uniting the World Through Pure Food|website=www.ffl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120070845/http://www.ffl.org/emergency-relief/new-york-times/|archivedate=2010-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laud"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070418182647/http://partners.guidestar.org/controller/searchResults.gs?action_gsReport=1&amp;partner=networkforgood&amp;ein=52-1952901 Network for Good]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Swami Prabhupada.jpg|thumb|right|x216px|[[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami]], who inspired Food for Life]]
Food for Life as a project was initially inspired by an elderly Indian [[Swami]], known as [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder Acharya of ISKCON]].  In 1974 when watching a group of village children fighting with dogs over scraps of food, the Swami became upset and told his students, "No one within ten miles of a temple should go hungry... I want you to immediately begin serving food."&lt;ref name="ffl"&gt;[http://www.ffl.org/about/history/ History of Food for Life]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his plea, members of [[ISKCON]] and volunteers around the world were inspired to expand that original effort into a global network of kitchens, cafes, vans, and mobile services, all providing free food, and establishing daily delivery routes in many large cities around the world. Since that day, Food for Life has grown into the world’s largest vegan/vegetarian food relief program. The distribution of sanctified plant-based meals has been and will continue to be an essential part of India’s Vedic culture of hospitality from which Food for Life was born.

With volunteers serving up to 2,000,000 free plant-based meals daily to schools, as well as from mobile vans and to disaster areas. FOOD FOR LIFE is now the largest food relief in the world, eclipsing even the United Nations [[World Food Programme.]]

Food For Life volunteers have provided food for the poor and homeless during several recent disasters.

*2015 – Food for Life Nepal provided over 100,000 vegan meals to survivors of the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].
*2013 – Food for Life provided vegan food relief to survivors of [[Cyclone Phailin]] in India and [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in the Philippines.
*2008 – Food For Life served freshly cooked vegan meals to survivors of [[Hurricane Gustav]] and [[Hurricane Ike]] in the southern United States.
*2007 – Food For Life volunteers were on the ground to feed many of the hundreds of thousands of survivors who were left homeless after the deadliest cyclone to hit [[Bangladesh]] in a decade.
*2005 – Following the earthquake in [[Pakistan]], Food For Life volunteers worked side-by-side with local military and police personnel, distributing drinking water, food, tents and blankets.
*2005 – When [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the Gulf Coast with deadly force, Food For Life volunteers were among the first responders, distributing up to 800 freshly cooked meals daily to needy families in [[Mississippi]] and [[Texas]].
*2004 – 2005 A killer [[Tsunami]] wreaked caused massive damage to areas in [[South Asia]], resulting in the deaths of nearly 200,000 people. Food For Life volunteers joined the relief effort on the very day of the disaster, providing thousands of meals daily, along with medical care, clothing, and shelter in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]].
*1990s – Food For Life volunteers risked their lives in the war-torn countries of [[Chechnya]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Abkhazia]], distributing food to needy and frightened civilians.

In total, Food for Life has distributed more than 2 billion meals since its inception.

Food for Life has expanded its reach to include, eco projects such as [[Working Villages International]]; as well as orphanages such as Gokulam – Bhaktivedanta Children’s Home Gokulam in Sri Lanka, a refuge where needy children receive food, shelter, medical care, education and loving care.

===Siege of Sarajevo===
In the [[Siege of Sarajevo|war zone]] of [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], volunteers visited orphanages, homes for the elderly, hospitals, institutes for handicapped children, and basement shelters on a daily basis throughout the three-year conflict; an estimated 20 tons of food have been distributed since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffl.org/emergency-relief/sarajevo-1994/ "Sarajevo 1994"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chechnyan Wars===
In a [[New York Times]] article dated (December 12, 1995) volunteers in [[Chechnya]] were described as having "a reputation like the one Mother Teresa has in Calcutta: it's not hard finding people to swear they are saints."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[http://www.ffl.org/ffl_newyorktimes.php ''New York Times'', December 12, 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616104254/http://ffl.org/ffl_newyorktimes.php |date=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Tsunami===
Food for Life was the first food relief agency to respond to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami disaster of December 2004]]. On the same afternoon the great tsunami hit, Vaisnava monks at ISKCON's temple in Chennai, India were preparing their weekly Sunday vegetarian feast, when they heard of the disaster. They immediately raced to the most affected areas on the southeast coastline of India and began serving thousands of people with their preprepared vegetable curry. Over the following 6 months, Food for Life Volunteers in [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]], Europe, USA and Australia provided more than 350,000 freshly cooked meals, along with medical care, water, clothing, and shelter for children at ISKCON's orphanage in Colombo, the [http://www.gokulam.org Bhaktivedanta Children's Home].

===Hurricane Katrina===
Food for Life Global Volunteers responded to the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster in late August 2005 by providing vegan meals to families relocated to [[Mississippi]] and [[Texas]].  Up to 800 meals were served daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffl.org/emergency-relief/katrina-and-rita-2005/|accessdate=July 6, 2011|title=Summary of Katrina/Rita Relief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Some Food for Life programs have suffered severe criticism from ISKCON leaders and devotees who believe them to be a major deviation from Srila Prabhupada's original preaching mission by their promotion of so-called "mundane welfare activities". According to these opponents, Srila Prabhupada was strongly opposed to food distribution done without chanting of the names of Krsna and without preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DAS|first1=Murari|title=Mundane Welfare Work in ISKCON.|url=http://lastingimpression.info/pdf/mundane_welfare_work_in_iskcon-ver.2-19.01.2015.pdf|access-date=2017-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306040716/http://lastingimpression.info/pdf/mundane_welfare_work_in_iskcon-ver.2-19.01.2015.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SWAMI|first1=Jayadvaita|title=Food for Death Seminar.|url=http://iskconsalem.com/food-death/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SWAMI|first1=Bhakti Vikasa|title=Some Concerns About ISKCON lecture series.|url=http://bvks.com/search/?q=some+concerns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inductor''', also called a '''coil''', '''choke''', or '''reactor''', is a [[incremental passivity|passive]] [[terminal (electronics)|two-terminal]] [[electronic component|electrical component]] that stores energy in a [[magnetic field]] when [[electric current]] flows through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Charles|last2=Sadiku|first2=Matthew|title=Fundamentals of Electric Circuits|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=211|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] around a core. 

When the current flowing through an inductor changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces an [[electromotive force]] (''e.m.f.'') ([[voltage]]) in the conductor, described by [[Faraday's law of induction]]. According to [[Lenz's law]], the induced voltage has a polarity (direction) which opposes the change in current that created it. As a result, inductors oppose any changes in current through them.

An inductor is characterized by its [[inductance]], which is the ratio of the voltage to the rate of change of current. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of inductance is the [[Henry (unit)|henry]] (H) named for 19th century American scientist [[Joseph Henry]]. In the measurement of magnetic circuits, it is equivalent to [[Weber (unit)|weber]]/[[ampere]]. Inductors have values that typically range from 1{{nbsp}}µH (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;{{nbsp}}H) to 20{{nbsp}}H.  Many inductors have a [[magnetic core]] made of iron or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] inside the coil, which serves to increase the magnetic field and thus the inductance. Along with [[capacitor]]s and [[resistor]]s, inductors are one of the three passive [[linear circuit|linear]] [[circuit element]]s that make up electronic circuits.  Inductors are widely used in [[alternating current]] (AC) electronic equipment, particularly in [[radio]] equipment.  They are used to block AC while allowing DC to pass; inductors designed for this purpose are called [[choke (electronics)|choke]]s.  They are also used in [[electronic filter]]s to separate signals of different [[frequency|frequencies]], and in combination with capacitors to make [[tuned circuit]]s, used to tune radio and TV receivers.

==Description==
An electric current flowing through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] generates a magnetic field surrounding it. The [[magnetic flux| magnetic flux linkage]] &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; generated by a given current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; depends on the geometric shape of the circuit. Their ratio defines the inductance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus
:&lt;math&gt;L := \frac{\Phi_\mathbf{B}}{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

The inductance of a circuit depends on the geometry of the current path as well as the [[magnetic permeability]] of nearby materials. An inductor is a [[electronic component|component]] consisting of a wire or other conductor shaped to increase the magnetic flux through the circuit, usually in the shape of a coil or [[helix]]. Winding the wire into a [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] increases the number of times the [[magnetic flux]] [[Field Lines|lines]] link the circuit, increasing the field and thus the inductance.  The more turns, the higher the inductance.  The inductance also depends on the shape of the coil, separation of the turns, and many other factors.  By adding a "magnetic core" made of a [[ferromagnetic]] material like iron inside the coil, the magnetizing field from the coil will induce [[magnetization]] in the material, increasing the magnetic flux.  The high [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] of a ferromagnetic core can increase the inductance of a coil by a factor of several thousand over what it would be without it.

===Constitutive equation===
Any change in the current through an inductor creates a changing flux, inducing a voltage across the inductor.  By [[Faraday's law of induction]], the voltage induced by any change in magnetic flux through the circuit is given by&lt;ref name="Purcell" /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_\mathbf{B}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

Reformulating the definition of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; above, we obtain&lt;ref name="Purcell" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_\mathbf{B} = LI&lt;/math&gt;.
It follows, that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_\mathbf{B}}{dt} = -\frac{d}{dt}(LI) = -L\frac{dI}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; independent of time. 

So inductance is also a measure of the amount of [[electromotive force]] (voltage) generated for a given rate of change of current. For example, an inductor with an inductance of 1 henry produces an EMF of 1 volt when the current through the inductor changes at the rate of 1 ampere per second. This is usually taken to be the [[constitutive relation]] (defining equation) of the inductor.

The [[duality (electrical circuits)|dual]] of the inductor is the capacitor, which [[Capacitor#Energy of electric field|stores energy in an electric field]] rather than a magnetic field. Its current–voltage relation is obtained by exchanging current and voltage in the inductor equations and replacing ''L'' with the capacitance ''C''.

===Lenz's law===
{{Main|Lenz's Law}}
The polarity (direction) of the induced voltage is given by [[Lenz's law]], which states that the induced voltage will be such as to oppose the change in current.&lt;ref name="Shamos"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0fCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT238&amp;lpg=PT238&amp;dq=1834+Lenz%E2%80%99s+Law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OydZ5Gh36h&amp;sig=eMuxVY230eH6k_Kj4fZBWdA-jY8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigncny6dbVAhVi_4MKHVSUCzUQ6AEIZDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=1834%20Lenz%E2%80%99s%20Law&amp;f=false|title=Great Experiments in Physics: Firsthand Accounts from Galileo to Einstein|last=Shamos|first=Morris H.|date=2012-10-16|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486139623|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the current through an inductor is increasing, the induced voltage will be positive at the terminal through which the current enters and negative at the terminal through which it leaves, tending to oppose the additional current.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The energy from the external circuit necessary to overcome this potential "hill" is being stored in the magnetic field of the inductor. If the current is decreasing, the induced voltage will be negative at the terminal through which the current enters and positive at the terminal through which it leaves, tending to maintain the current.  In this case energy from the magnetic field is being returned to the circuit.

===Energy stored in an inductor===
One intuitive explanation as to why a potential difference is induced on a change of current in an inductor goes as follows:

:When there is a change in current, there is a change in the strength of the induced magnetic field. Without loss of generality, let us assume we have increased the current over our inductor, and now our induced magnetic field is stronger. This, however, does not come without a price. [[Magnetic_energy|Magnetic fields store energy]], and the stronger they are the more energy they store. To make up for an ''increase in magnetic potential energy'' in the induced magnetic field, we must ''take some energy'' from the inductor ''in the form of electrical energy''. Here we experience a drop in ''electric'' potential over the inductor i.e a negative voltage. Once we stop increasing the current, and keep it constant, no additional energy must be supplied to the magnetic field and the electrical potential returns to its original value, thus we see no voltage drop over the inductor.

:Likewise, when the current decreases, the induced magnetic field strength decreases, and that superfluous energy must be returned. Hence, we experience an increase in ''electrical'' potential over the inductor.

====Derivation====
We know that the [[Work_(physics)|work done]] per unit charge on a charged particle when passing the inductor is &lt;math&gt;-\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;. The negative sign indicates that the work is done ''against'' the emf, and is not done ''by'' the emf.

By knowing that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the charge per unit time, it follows that the rate of energy &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; done against the emf is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dW}{dt} = -\mathcal{E}I = L\frac{dI}{dt} \cdot I = LI \cdot \frac{dI}{dt}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We may proceed to state that
:&lt;math&gt;
dW = L I\cdot dI
&lt;/math&gt;.

If the magnetic field in the inductor approaches the level at which the core saturates, the inductance will begin to change with current and thus we will henceforth denote the inductance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;L_I&lt;/math&gt; to accommodate for this dependency. Neglecting losses, the [[energy]] &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; stored by an inductor with a current &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; passing through it, is equal to the amount of work required to establish the current through the inductor. This is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{0}^{I_0} L_I I dI&lt;/math&gt;.

If the inductance is constant over the current range &lt;math&gt;L := L_I&lt;/math&gt; , the stored energy is 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  W &amp;= L\int_0^{I_0} IdI \\
  W &amp;= \frac{1}{2}L I_0^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For inductors with magnetic cores, the above equation is only valid for [[linear circuit|linear]] regions of the magnetic flux, at currents below the [[magnetic saturation|saturation]] level of the inductor, where the inductance is approximately constant. Where this is not the case, the integral form must be used with &lt;math&gt;L_I&lt;/math&gt; variable.

===Ideal and real inductors===
&lt;!-- NB. Section header used in redirects to this page --&gt;
{{cleanup|section|reason=wordy; rambling|date=November 2017}}
In [[circuit theory]], inductors are idealized as obeying the mathematical relation (2) above precisely. An "ideal inductor" has inductance, but no [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[capacitance]], and does not dissipate energy. However real inductors have nonideal properties which cause their behavior to depart from this simple model.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have resistance (due to the resistance of the wire and energy losses in the core), and parasitic capacitance due to electric potential between the turns of wire. This [[capacitive reactance]] rises with frequency; at some frequency, the inductor will behave as a [[resonant circuit]], becoming [[self-resonant frequency|self-resonant]]. Above the self-resonant frequency the capacitive reactance is the dominant part of the impedance. At higher frequencies, resistive losses in the windings increase due to [[skin effect]] and [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]].

Inductors with ferromagnetic cores have additional energy losses due to [[hysteresis]] and [[eddy current]]s in the core, which increase with frequency. At high currents, magnetic core inductors also show sudden departure from ideal behavior due to nonlinearity caused by [[magnetic saturation]] of the core. An inductor radiates electromagnetic energy into surrounding space and circuits, and may absorb electromagnetic emissions from other circuits, causing [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI). For real-world inductor applications, these [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic]] parameters may be as important as the inductance.

An early solid-state electrical switching and amplifying device called a [[saturable reactor]] exploits saturation of the core as a means of stopping the inductive transfer of current via the core.

====''Q'' factor====
The winding resistance appears as a resistance in series with the inductor; it is referred to as DCR (DC resistance).  This resistance dissipates some of the reactive energy. The [[Q factor|quality factor]] (or ''Q'') of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and is a measure of its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal inductor.  High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and receivers.  The higher the Q is, the narrower the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the resonant circuit.

The Q factor of an inductor is defined as, where ''L'' is the inductance, ''R'' is the DCR, ''ω'' is the radian operating frequency, and the product ''ωL'' is the inductive reactance:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{\omega L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

''Q'' increases linearly with frequency if ''L'' and ''R'' are constant. Although they are constant at low frequencies, the parameters vary with frequency. For example, skin effect, [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]], and core losses increase ''R'' with frequency; winding capacitance and variations in [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] with frequency affect ''L''.

At low frequencies and within limits, increasing the number of turns ''N'' improves ''Q'' because ''L'' varies as ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; while ''R'' varies linearly with ''N''.  Similarly, increasing the radius ''r'' of an inductor improves ''Q'' because ''L'' varies as ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; while ''R'' varies linearly with ''r''.  So high ''Q'' air core inductors often have large diameters and many turns.  Both of those examples assume the diameter of the wire stays the same, so both examples use proportionally more wire. If the total mass of wire is held constant, then there would be no advantage to increasing the number of turns or the radius of the turns because the wire would have to be proportionally thinner.

Using a high permeability [[ferromagnetic]] core can greatly increase the inductance for the same amount of copper, so the core can also increase the Q. Cores however also introduce losses that increase with frequency. The core material is chosen for best results for the frequency band.  High Q inductors must avoid saturation; one way is by using a (physically larger) air core inductor. At [[VHF]] or higher frequencies an air core is likely to be used. A well designed air core inductor may have a Q of several hundred.

==Applications==
[[File:InductorSignalFilter1.png|150px|thumb|Example of signal filtering. In this configuration, the inductor blocks AC current, while allowing DC current to pass.]]
[[File:InductorSignalFilter2.png|150px|thumb|Example of signal filtering. In this configuration, the inductor [[Decoupling (electronics)|decouples]] DC current, while allowing AC current to pass.]]
Inductors are used extensively in [[analog circuit]]s and signal processing.  Applications range from the use of large inductors in power supplies, which in conjunction with filter [[capacitor]]s remove [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] which is a multiple of the mains frequency (or the switching frequency for switched-mode power supplies) from the direct current output, to the small inductance of the [[ferrite bead]] or [[torus]] installed around a cable to prevent [[radio frequency interference]] from being transmitted down the wire.  Inductors are used as the energy storage device in many [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] to produce DC current.  The inductor supplies energy to the circuit to keep current flowing during the "off" switching periods and enables topographies where the output voltage is higher than the input voltage.

A [[tuned circuit]], consisting of an inductor connected to a [[capacitor]], acts as a [[Electrical resonance|resonator]] for oscillating current.  Tuned circuits are widely used in [[radio frequency]] equipment such as radio transmitters and receivers, as narrow [[bandpass filter]]s to select a single frequency from a composite signal, and in [[electronic oscillator]]s to generate sinusoidal signals.

Two (or more) inductors in proximity that have coupled magnetic flux ([[mutual inductance]]) form a [[transformer]], which is a fundamental component of every electric [[Public utility|utility]] power grid. The efficiency of a transformer may decrease as the frequency increases due to eddy currents in the core material and skin effect on the windings. The size of the core can be decreased at higher frequencies. For this reason, aircraft use 400 hertz alternating current rather than the usual 50 or 60 hertz, allowing a great saving in weight from the use of smaller transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderquest.com/expounding-aircraft-electrical-systems.htm |title=Aircraft electrical systems |publisher=Wonderquest.com |accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformers enable switched-mode power supplies that isolate the output from the input.

Inductors are also employed in electrical transmission systems, where they are used to limit switching currents and [[fault current]]s. In this field, they are more commonly referred to as reactors.

Inductors have parasitic effects which cause them to depart from ideal behavior. They create and suffer from [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI). Their physical size prevents them from being integrated on semiconductor chips. So the use of inductors is declining in modern electronic devices, particularly compact portable devices.  Real inductors are increasingly being replaced by active circuits such as the [[gyrator]] which can synthesize inductance using capacitors.

An inductor usually consists of a coil of conducting material, typically insulated [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]], wrapped around a [[magnetic core|core]] either of plastic (to create an air-core inductor) or of a [[ferromagnetic]] (or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]]) material; the latter is called an "iron core" inductor. Since power inductors require high induction levels, high permeability and low saturation points in the core materials are not ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://info.triadmagnetics.com/blog/what-to-consider-when-constructing-power-inductors|title=What to Consider When Constructing Power Inductors|last=Dull|first=Bill|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the ferromagnetic core increases the magnetic field and confines it closely to the inductor, thereby increasing the inductance. Low frequency inductors are constructed like transformers, with cores of [[electrical steel]] [[laminate]]d to prevent [[eddy current]]s. 'Soft' [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are widely used for cores above [[audio frequency|audio frequencies]], since they do not cause the large energy losses at high frequencies that ordinary iron alloys do. Inductors come in many shapes.  Some inductors have an adjustable core, which enables changing of the inductance. Inductors used to block very high frequencies are sometimes made by stringing a ferrite bead on a wire.

Small inductors can be etched directly onto a [[printed circuit board]] by laying out the trace in a [[spiral]] pattern. Some such planar inductors use a [[magnetic core#Planar core|planar core]].  Small value inductors can also be built on [[integrated circuit]]s using the same processes that are used to make [[transistor]]s. Aluminium interconnect is typically used, laid out in a spiral coil pattern. However, the small dimensions limit the inductance, and it is far more common to use a circuit called a ''[[gyrator]]'' that uses a [[capacitor]] and active components to behave similarly to an inductor. Regardless of the design, because of the low inductances and low power dissipation on-die inductors allow, they're currently only commercially used for high frequency RF circuits.

The term ''air core coil'' describes an inductor that does not use a [[magnetic core]] made of a ferromagnetic material. The term refers to coils wound on plastic, ceramic, or other nonmagnetic forms, as well as those that have only air inside the windings. Air core coils have lower inductance than ferromagnetic core coils, but are often used at high frequencies because they are free from energy losses called [[core loss]]es that occur in ferromagnetic cores, which increase with frequency. A side effect that can occur in air core coils in which the winding is not rigidly supported on a form is 'microphony': mechanical vibration of the windings can cause variations in the inductance.

At [[high frequency|high frequencies]], particularly [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]] (RF), inductors have higher resistance and other losses. In addition to causing power loss, in [[resonant circuit]]s this can reduce the [[Q factor]] of the circuit, broadening the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. In RF inductors, which are mostly air core types, specialized construction techniques are used to minimize these losses. The losses are due to these effects:
; Skin effect: The resistance of a wire to [[high frequency]] current is higher than its resistance to [[direct current]] because of [[skin effect]]. Radio frequency alternating current does not penetrate far into the body of a conductor but travels along its surface.  For example, at 6&amp;nbsp;MHz the skin depth of copper wire is about 0.001 inches (25&amp;nbsp;µm); most of the current is within this depth of the surface.  Therefore, in a solid wire, the interior portion of the wire may carry little current, effectively increasing its resistance.
; Proximity effect: Another similar effect that also increases the resistance of the wire at high frequencies is proximity effect, which occurs in parallel wires that lie close to each other. The individual magnetic field of adjacent turns induces [[eddy current]]s in the wire of the coil, which causes the current in the conductor to be concentrated in a thin strip on the side near the adjacent wire. Like skin effect, this reduces the effective cross-sectional area of the wire conducting current, increasing its resistance.
; Dielectric losses: The high frequency electric field near the conductors in a [[LC circuit|tank]] coil can cause the motion of polar molecules in nearby insulating materials, dissipating energy as heat.  So coils used for tuned circuits are often not wound on coil forms but are suspended in air, supported by narrow plastic or ceramic strips.
; Parasitic capacitance: The capacitance between individual wire turns of the coil, called [[parasitic capacitance]], does not cause energy losses but can change the behavior of the coil. Each turn of the coil is at a slightly different potential, so the [[electric field]] between neighboring turns stores charge on the wire, so the coil acts as if it has a capacitor in parallel with it. At a high enough frequency this capacitance can resonate with the inductance of the coil forming a [[tuned circuit]], causing the coil to become [[self-resonant frequency|self-resonant]].

}}
To reduce parasitic capacitance and proximity effect, [[Q factor|high Q]] RF coils are constructed to avoid having many turns lying close together, parallel to one another. The windings of RF coils are often limited to a single layer, and the turns are spaced apart. To reduce resistance due to skin effect, in high-power inductors such as those used in transmitters the windings are sometimes made of a metal strip or tubing which has a larger surface area, and the surface is silver-plated.
; Basket-weave coils: To reduce proximity effect and parasitic capacitance, multilayer RF coils are wound in patterns in which successive turns are not parallel but criss-crossed at an angle; these are often called ''honeycomb'' or ''[[Basket winding|basket-weave]]'' coils.  These are occasionally wound on a vertical insulating supports with dowels or slots, with the wire weaving in and out through the slots.
; Spiderweb coils: Another construction technique with similar advantages is flat spiral coils.These are often wound on a flat insulating support with radial spokes or slots, with the wire weaving in and out through the slots; these are called ''spiderweb'' coils. The form has an odd number of slots, so successive turns of the spiral lie on opposite sides of the form, increasing separation. 
; Litz wire: To reduce skin effect losses, some coils are wound with a special type of radio frequency wire called [[litz wire]]. Instead of a single solid conductor, litz wire consists of a number of smaller wire strands that carry the current. Unlike ordinary [[stranded wire]], the strands are insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist pattern ensures that each wire strand spends the same amount of its length on the outside of the wire bundle, so skin effect distributes the current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.

; Axial Inductor
Small inductors for low current and low power are made in molded cases resembling resistors.  These may be either plain (phenolic) core or ferrite core.  An ohmmeter readily distinguishes them from similar-sized resistors by showing the low resistance of the inductor.

===Ferromagnetic-core inductor===
{{See also|Magnetic core}}
[[Image:Aplikimi i feriteve.png|thumb|A variety of types of ferrite core inductors and transformers]]

Ferromagnetic-core or iron-core inductors use a magnetic core made of a [[ferromagnetic]] or [[ferrimagnetic]] material such as iron or [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] to increase the inductance. A magnetic core can increase the inductance of a coil by a factor of several thousand, by increasing the magnetic field due to its higher [[magnetic permeability]]. However the magnetic properties of the core material cause several side effects which alter the behavior of the inductor and require special construction:
  {{glossary}}
  {{term|[[Core loss]]es}}{{defn|A time-varying current in a ferromagnetic inductor, which causes a time-varying magnetic field in its core, causes energy losses in the core material that are dissipated as heat, due to two processes:{{glossary}}
  {{term|[[Eddy current]]s}}{{defn|From [[Faraday's law of induction]], the changing magnetic field can induce circulating loops of electric current in the conductive metal core. The energy in these currents is dissipated as heat in the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the core material. The amount of energy lost increases with the area inside the loop of current.}}
{{term|[[Hysteresis loop|Hysteresis]]}}{{defn|Changing or reversing the magnetic field in the core also causes losses due to the motion of the tiny [[magnetic domain]]s it is composed of. The energy loss is proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop in the BH graph of the core material. Materials with low [[coercivity]] have narrow hysteresis loops and so low hysteresis losses.}}
  {{glossary end}}
Core loss is non-linear with respect to both frequency of magnetic fluctuation and magnetic flux density. Frequency of magnetic fluctuation is the frequency of AC current in the electric circuit; magnetic flux density corresponds to current in the electric circuit. Magnetic fluctuation gives rise to hysteresis, and magnetic flux density causes eddy currents in the core. These nonlinearities are distinguished from the threshold nonlinearity of saturation. Core loss can be approximately modeled with [[Steinmetz's equation]]. At low frequencies and over limited frequency spans (maybe a factor of 10), core loss may be treated as a linear function of frequency with minimal error. However, even in the audio range, nonlinear effects of magnetic core inductors are noticeable and of concern. }}
{{term|Saturation}}{{defn|If the current through a magnetic core coil is high enough that the core [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturates]], the inductance will fall and current will rise dramatically. This is a nonlinear threshold phenomenon and results in distortion of the signal. For example, [[audio signal]]s can suffer [[intermodulation distortion]] in saturated inductors. To prevent this, in [[linear circuit]]s the current through iron core inductors must be limited below the saturation level. Some laminated cores have a narrow air gap in them for this purpose, and powdered iron cores have a distributed air gap. This allows higher levels of magnetic flux and thus higher currents through the inductor before it saturates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/vishay/Inductors101.pdf |title=Inductors 101 |publisher=vishay |access-date=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{term|Curie point demagnetization}}{{defn|If the temperature of a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic core rises to a specified level, the magnetic domains dissociate, and the material becomes paramagnetic, no longer able to support magnetic flux.  The inductance falls and current rises dramatically, similarly to what happens during saturation.  The effect is reversible: When the temperature falls below the Curie point, magnetic flux resulting from current in the electric circuit will realign the magnetic domains of the core and its magnetic flux will be restored.  The Curie point of ferromagnetic materials (iron alloys) is quite high; iron is highest at 770{{nbsp}}°C. However, for some ferrimagnetic materials (ceramic iron compounds – [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]]s) the Curie point can be close to ambient temperatures (below 100{{nbsp}}°C).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} }}
{{glossary end}}

====Laminated-core inductor====
[[Image:Vorschaltdrossel Kvg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Laminated iron core [[ballast (electrical)|ballast]] inductor for a [[metal halide lamp]] ]]
Low-frequency inductors are often made with [[laminated core]]s to prevent eddy currents, using construction similar to [[transformer]]s. The core is made of stacks of thin steel sheets or [[lamination]]s oriented parallel to the field, with an insulating coating on the surface. The insulation prevents eddy currents between the sheets, so any remaining currents must be within the cross sectional area of the individual laminations, reducing the area of the loop and thus reducing the energy losses greatly. The laminations are made of low-conductivity [[silicon steel]] to further reduce eddy current losses.

====Ferrite-core inductor====
{{main|Ferrite core}}
For higher frequencies, inductors are made with cores of ferrite. Ferrite is a ceramic ferrimagnetic material that is nonconductive, so eddy currents cannot flow within it. The formulation of ferrite is xxFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; where xx represents various metals. For inductor cores [[soft ferrite]]s are used, which have low coercivity and thus low hysteresis losses.

====Powdered-iron-core inductor====
{{see also|Carbonyl iron}}
Another material is powdered iron cemented with a binder.

====Toroidal-core inductor====
{{main|Toroidal inductors and transformers}}
[[File:3Com OfficeConnect ADSL Wireless 11g Firewall Router 2012-10-28-0869.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Toroidal inductor in the power supply of a wireless router]]

In an inductor wound on a straight rod-shaped core, the [[magnetic field lines]] emerging from one end of the core must pass through the air to re-enter the core at the other end. This reduces the field, because much of the magnetic field path is in air rather than the higher permeability core material and is a source of [[electromagnetic interference]]. A higher magnetic field and inductance can be achieved by forming the core in a closed [[magnetic circuit]]. The magnetic field lines form closed loops within the core without leaving the core material. The shape often used is a [[toroid]]al or doughnut-shaped ferrite core. Because of their symmetry, toroidal cores allow a minimum of the magnetic flux to escape outside the core (called ''[[leakage flux]]''), so they radiate less electromagnetic interference than other shapes. Toroidal core coils are manufactured of various materials, primarily ferrite, powdered iron and laminated cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/34053/definit.pdf |title=Inductor and Magnetic Product Terminology |publisher=Vishay Dale |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rollspule.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A "roller coil", an adjustable air-core RF inductor used in the [[tuned circuit]]s of radio transmitters.  One of the contacts to the coil is made by the small grooved wheel, which rides on the wire.  Turning the shaft rotates the coil, moving the contact wheel up or down the coil, allowing more or fewer turns of the coil into the circuit, to change the inductance.]]

Probably the most common type of variable inductor today is one with a moveable ferrite magnetic core, which can be slid or screwed in or out of the coil. Moving the core farther into the coil increases the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]],  increasing the magnetic field and the inductance. Many inductors used in radio applications (usually less than 100&amp;nbsp;MHz) use adjustable cores in order to tune such inductors to their desired value, since manufacturing processes have certain tolerances (inaccuracy). Sometimes such cores for frequencies above 100&amp;nbsp;MHz are made from highly conductive non-magnetic material such as aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coilcraft.com/pdfs/uni5.pdf Coilcraft catalog page with aluminum cores. Accessed 10 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  They decrease the inductance because the magnetic field must bypass them.

Air core inductors can use sliding contacts or multiple taps to increase or decrease the number of turns included in the circuit, to change the inductance. A type much used in the past but mostly obsolete today has a spring contact that can slide along the bare surface of the windings.  The disadvantage of this type is that the contact usually [[short circuit|short-circuits]] one or more turns.  These turns act like a single-turn short-circuited transformer [[secondary winding]]; the large currents induced in them cause power losses.

A type of continuously variable air core inductor is the ''variometer''.  This consists of two coils with the same number of turns connected in series, one inside the other.  The inner coil is mounted on a shaft so its axis can be turned with respect to the outer coil.  When the two coils' axes are collinear, with the magnetic fields pointing in the same direction, the fields add and the inductance is maximum.  When the inner coil is turned so its axis is at an angle with the outer, the mutual inductance between them is smaller so the total inductance is less.  When the inner coil is turned 180° so the coils are collinear with their magnetic fields opposing, the two fields cancel each other and the inductance is very small.  This type has the advantage that it is continuously variable over a wide range.  It is used in [[antenna tuner]]s and matching circuits to match low frequency transmitters to their antennas.

Another method to control the inductance without any moving parts requires an additional DC current bias winding which controls the permeability of an easily saturable core material.  See [[Magnetic amplifier]].

===Choke===
[[File:Two ferrite beads.jpg|thumbnail|An MF or HF radio choke for tenths of an ampere, and a ferrite bead VHF choke for several amperes.]]
A [[choke (electronics)|choke]] is an inductor designed specifically for blocking high-frequency alternating current (AC) in an electrical circuit, while allowing DC or low-frequency signals to pass. It usually consists of a coil of insulated wire wound on a magnetic core, although some consist of a donut-shaped "bead" of ferrite material strung on a wire. Like other inductors, chokes resist changes in current passing through them increasingly with frequency. The difference between chokes and other inductors is that chokes do not require the high [[Q factor]] construction techniques that are used to reduce the resistance in inductors used in tuned circuits.

==Circuit analysis==
The effect of an inductor in a circuit is to oppose changes in current through it by developing a voltage across it proportional to the rate of change of the current. An ideal inductor would offer no resistance to a constant [[direct current]]; however, only [[superconductor|superconducting]] inductors have truly zero [[electrical resistance]].

The relationship between the time-varying voltage ''v''(''t'') across an inductor with inductance ''L'' and the time-varying current ''i''(''t'') passing through it is described by the [[differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = L \frac{di(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
 
When there is a [[sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] (AC) through an inductor, a sinusoidal voltage is induced. The amplitude of the voltage is proportional to the product of the amplitude (''I''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) of the current and the frequency (''f'') of the current.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              i(t) &amp;= I_\mathrm P \sin(\omega t) \\
  \frac{di(t)}{dt} &amp;= I_\mathrm P \omega \cos(\omega t) \\
              v(t) &amp;= L I_\mathrm P \omega \cos(\omega t)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In this situation, the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the current lags that of the voltage by π/2 (90°). For sinusoids, as the voltage across the inductor goes to its maximum value, the current goes to zero, and as the voltage across the inductor goes to zero, the current through it goes to its maximum value.

If an inductor is connected to a direct current source with value ''I'' via a resistance ''R'' (at least the DCR of the inductor), and then the current source is short-circuited, the differential relationship above shows that the current through the inductor will discharge with an [[exponential decay]]:

:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}&lt;/math&gt;

===Reactance===
The ratio of the peak voltage to the peak current in an inductor energised from an AC source is called the [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and is denoted ''X''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm L = \frac {V_\mathrm P}{I_\mathrm P} = \frac {\omega L I_\mathrm P}{I_\mathrm P} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm L = \omega L &lt;/math&gt;

Reactance is measured in ohms but referred to as ''impedance'' rather than resistance; energy is stored in the magnetic field as current rises and discharged as current falls.  Inductive reactance is proportional to frequency.  At low frequency the reactance falls; at DC, the inductor behaves as a short-circuit.  As frequency increases the reactance increases and at a sufficiently high frequency the reactance approaches that of an open circuit.

===Corner frequency===
In filtering applications,with respect to a particular load impedance, an inductor has a [[corner frequency]] defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{3\,dB} = \frac{R}{2\pi L}&lt;/math&gt;

===Laplace circuit analysis (s-domain)===
When using the [[Laplace transform]] in circuit analysis, the impedance of an ideal inductor with no initial current is represented in the ''s'' domain by:
:&lt;math&gt;Z(s) = Ls\, &lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;'' is the inductance, and
: ''&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;'' is the complex frequency.

If the inductor does have initial current, it can be represented by: {{bulleted list
| adding a voltage source in series with the inductor, having the value:
:&lt;math&gt; L I_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;'' is the inductance, and
: ''&lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the initial current in the inductor.

(''Note that the source should have a polarity that is aligned with the initial current'')

| or by adding a current source in parallel with the inductor, having the value:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{I_0}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''&lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the initial current in the inductor.
: ''&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;'' is the complex frequency.
}}

===Inductor networks===
{{main|Series and parallel circuits}}
Inductors in a parallel configuration each have the same potential difference (voltage). To find their total equivalent inductance (''L''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;):

: [[Image:inductors in parallel.svg|A diagram of several inductors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{L_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{L_n}&lt;/math&gt;

The current through inductors in series stays the same, but the voltage across each inductor can be different. The sum of the potential differences (voltage) is equal to the total voltage. To find their total inductance:

: [[Image:inductors in series.svg|A diagram of several inductors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current going through each]]

:&lt;math&gt; L_\mathrm{eq} = L_1 + L_2 + \cdots + L_n \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

These simple relationships hold true only when there is no mutual coupling of magnetic fields between individual inductors.

====Mutual inductance====
Mutual inductance occurs when the magnetic field of an inductor induces a magnetic field in an adjacent inductor.  Mutual induction is the basis of transformer construction.

The '''Jerusalem District Electricity Company''' (JDECO) is an electricity company established in its current form in 1956 that has the exclusive rights to supply electricity to consumers in the districts of [[East Jerusalem]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Ramallah]] and [[Jericho]]. The company does not have its own power stations, but buys over 95% of its electricity from [[Israel Electric Corporation]] (IEC) and the remainder from [[Jordanian National Electric Power Company]]. Jordanian electricity is only used in the Jericho district.&lt;ref name=monitor&gt;[https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/03/palestine-jerusalem-electricity-company-pressure-israel-pa.html Jerusalem electricity company crippled by Israel, Palestinian Authority]&lt;/ref&gt;

JDECO supplies electricity to 30% of households in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. JDECO supplies electricity in its license area, while IEC sells electricity directly to the PA to distribute in areas not covered by JDECO.&lt;ref name=haaretz_power_license/&gt; JDECO recorded a net loss of about NIS 2.6 million in 2011.&lt;ref name=pua_description/&gt; In 2012, JDECO owed NIS 458 million to IEC.&lt;ref name=haaretz_power_license/&gt;

== History ==
The Jerusalem District Electricity Company was founded in 1914 by Ottoman authority, before the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].&lt;ref name=haaretz_power_license&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/israel-renews-palestinian-power-supplier-s-license-despite-debt.premium-1.492469 ''Israel Renews Palestinian Power Supplier's License, Despite Debt'']. Itai Trilnick, Haaretz, 7 January 2013 (premium)&lt;/ref&gt; The Company was established in its current form in 1956 under Jordan authority.&lt;ref name=pua_description&gt;[http://pua.gov.il/English/Documents/Appendix%20B%20-Jerusalem%20District%20Electricity.pdf ''Appendix B, Jerusalem District Electricity Co. Ltd ("JDECO") - Description of Corporate Business'']. State of Israel, Public Utilities Authority Electricity. Accessed March 2016. [http://pua.gov.il/English/Pages/default.aspx Here available]&lt;/ref&gt;

JDECO has had a monopoly over supplying electricity in the larger Jerusalem area for nearly 100 years. Its first concession was signed during the British Mandate and has been extended under Jordanian rule. In 1988, Jordan extended the concession for another 60 years, but Israel has only agreed to an extension until 2030.&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt; The [[Electricity Authority (Israel)|Israel Electricity Authority]] has granted JDECO a 20-year license for electricity distribution in East Jerusalem, which currently runs to 2030, and an annually renewable license for the supply of electricity to consumers. JDECO’s activities in East Jerusalem are regulated by the Israel Electricity Authority, and in the [[West Bank]] they are regulated by the [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) or, in some cases, by the [[Israeli Civil Administration]].&lt;ref name=pua_description/&gt;

== Organization ==
JDECO is a [[joint-stock company]]. As at 2016, 25% of its shares were owned by the municipalities of Jerusalem, Ramallah, Al-Bireh, Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, Beit Jala and Jericho, while the remaining 75% were owned by over 3,000 private shareholders. The board of directors consists of 18 members: 9 representatives of the municipalities and 9 representatives of the private shareholders.

The company has four area branches, Jerusalem, Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jericho. In 2011, JDECO employed about 450 workers.

== Activities ==
JDECO is responsible for connecting new consumers to the grid, as well as metering and billing. It has exclusive rights within its license areas. 

JDECO does not have its own power stations, but purchases over 95% of its electricity from [[Israel Electric Corporation]] (IEC) and the remainder from Jordanian National Electric Power Company. Jordanian electricity is permitted to be used only in the Jericho district.&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt; 

In 2011, all of the electricity distributed by the company in East Jerusalem was purchased from IEC. JDECO‘s activities in the Jerusalem area constitute about 1/3 of the company’s total economic activity.

== Debt to IEC ==
Most of the electricity sold by JDECO is supplied by IEC. However, by 2012, JDECO’s debt to IEC was NIS 458 million,&lt;ref name=haaretz_power_license/&gt; and growing. By February 2015, IEC was owed NIS 1.9 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-cuts-power-to-west-bank-cities-for-second-time/|title=Israel cuts power to West Bank cities for second time|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which was owed by the Palestinian Authority and JDECO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Israel-Electric-Corporation-cuts-off-power-in-Palestinian-cities-for-second-time-392163|title=Power cut again in Palestinian cities despite 'collective punishment' accusations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 February 2015, IEC intentionally cut off electricity to the West Bank for about 45 minutes due to unpaid debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.643910|title=Israeli government says not behind electric corp. decision to cut West Bank power – Diplomacy and Defense|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later it again cut off electricity, stating it was a warning to the Palestinian Authority to begin paying down the debt. IEC stated that it is losing NIS 85 million per month on power supplied to [[Nablus]] and [[Jenin]] that is not being paid for, causing the majority of IEC’s quarterly loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-Israel-Electric-to-resume-West-Bank-power-disruptions-1001013466|title=Israel Electric to resume West Bank power disruptions – Globes English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinians accused IEC of collective punishment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Feb-23/288447-israeli-electric-company-begins-west-bank-power-cuts-over-debt.ashx|title=Israeli electric company begins West Bank power cuts over debt|date=23 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while IEC stated that it must operate independently and is treating this as it would any customer who does not pay its debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.644099|title=Cutting Palestinians' electricity: It isn't just business, it's personal – Opinion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the debts were NIS 1.7 billion; and on 31 March, IEC again cut power, this time to the [[Jericho]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-iec-reduces-electricity-supply-to-jericho-1001114010|title=IEC reduces Jericho electricity supply – Globes English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 April, IEC cut power in the [[Bethlehem]] area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-electric-corporation-to-cut-power-to-bethlehem/|title=Israel Electric Corporation to reduce power to Bethlehem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following day it cut power in the [[Hebron]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Hebron-becomes-latest-city-to-experience-electricity-cut-450353|title=Hebron becomes latest city to experience electricity cut|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April, IEC restored full power to the West Bank after it received a payment of NIS 20 million, and an agreement to receive a full debt repayment schedule within seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Full-power-restored-to-West-Bank-after-PA-takes-step-to-pay-down-NIS-174b-debt-450419|title=Full power restored to West Bank after PA takes step to pay down NIS 1.74b. debt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Hypolimnion]]'' &lt;br&gt; The scales are used to associate each section of the stratification to their corresponding depths and temperatures. The arrow is used to show the movement of wind over the surface of the water which initiates the turnover in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion.]]
{{lake stratification topics}}
'''Lake stratification''' is the separation of [[lake]]s into three layers:

# [[Epilimnion]]: the top of the lake. 
# [[Metalimnion]] (or [[thermocline]]): the middle layer, which may change depth throughout the day. 
# [[Hypolimnion]]: the bottom layer.

The thermal stratification of lakes refers to a change in the temperature at different depths in the lake, and is due to the change in water's density with temperature.&lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Cold water is denser than warm water and the epilimnion generally consists of water that is not as dense as the water in the hypolimnion.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Wildlife (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater is 4&amp;nbsp;°C.  In [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions where lake water warms up and cools through the seasons, a cyclical pattern of overturn occurs that is repeated from year to year as the cold dense water at the top of the lake sinks.  For example, in [[dimictic lake]]s the lake water turns over during the spring and the fall.  This process occurs more slowly in deeper water and as a result, a [[thermal bar]] may form.&lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  If the stratification of water lasts for extended periods, the lake is [[meromictic]].  Conversely, for most of the time, the relatively shallower [[Mere (lake)|meres]] are unstratified; that is, the mere is considered all epilimnion.

The accumulation of dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] in three meromictic lakes in [[Africa]] ([[Lake Nyos]] and [[Lake Monoun]] in [[Cameroon]] and [[Lake Kivu]] in [[Rwanda]]) is potentially dangerous because if one of these lakes is triggered into [[limnic eruption]], a very large quantity of carbon dioxide can quickly leave the lake and displace the [[oxygen]] needed for life by people and animals in the surrounding area.

Natural resource and environmental managers are often challenged by problems caused by lake and pond thermal stratification.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Wildlife (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (1972a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (1972b)&lt;/ref&gt;   Fish die-offs have been directly associated with thermal gradients, stagnation, and ice cover.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey and Holmes (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;  Excessive growth of [[plankton]] may limit the recreational use of lakes and the commercial use of lake water.  With severe thermal stratification in a lake, the quality of drinking water also can be adversely affected.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Wildlife (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[fisheries]] managers, the spatial distribution of fish within a lake is often adversely affected by thermal stratification and in some cases may indirectly cause large die-offs of recreationally important fish.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey and Holmes (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; One commonly used tool to reduce the severity of these lake management problems is to eliminate or lessen thermal stratification through [[aeration]].&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (1972a)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many types of aeration equipment have been used to thermally destratify lakes.  Aeration has met with some success, although it has rarely proved to be a panacea.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (1972b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of the various particles listed are also given, as well as the laws that the particles follow. For individual lists of the different particles, see the list below.

==Elementary particles==
{{Main article|Elementary particle}}
Elementary particles are particles with no measurable internal structure; that is, it is unknown whether they are composed of other particles.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the fundamental objects of [[quantum field theory]]. Many families and sub-families of elementary particles exist. Elementary particles are classified according to their [[spin (physics)|spin]]. [[Fermion]]s have half-integer spin while [[boson]]s have integer spin. All the particles of the [[Standard Model]] have been experimentally observed, recently including the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Khachatryan |first1=V. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=CMS Collaboration |year=2012 |title=Observation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=716 |issue=2012 |pages=30 |arxiv=1207.7235 |bibcode= 2012PhLB..716...30C|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Abajyan |first1=T. |collaboration=ATLAS Collaboration |display-authors=etal |title=Observation of a new particle in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=716 |issue=2012 |pages=1–29 |year=2012 |arxiv=1207.7214  |bibcode= 2012PhLB..716....1A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other hypothetical elementary particles, such as the [[graviton]], have been proposed, but not observed experimentally.

===Fermions===
{{Main article|Fermion}}

Fermions are one of the two fundamental classes of particles, the other being [[boson]]s. Fermion particles are described by [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and have [[quantum numbers]] described by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. They include the quarks and leptons, as well as any composite particles consisting of an odd number of these, such as all [[baryons]] and many atoms and nuclei.

Fermions have half-integer spin; for all known elementary fermions this is {{frac|1|2}}. All known fermions, except neutrinos, are also [[Dirac fermion]]s; that is, each known fermion has its own distinct [[antiparticle]]. It is not known whether the [[neutrino]] is a Dirac fermion or a [[Majorana fermion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1012.4469|last1=Kayser|first1=Boris|title=Two Questions About Neutrinos|class=hep-ph|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermions are the basic building blocks of all [[matter]]. They are classified according to whether they interact via the [[strong interaction]] or not. In the Standard Model, there are 12 types of elementary fermions: six [[quark]]s and six [[lepton]]s.

====Quarks====
{{Main article|Quark}}

Quarks are the fundamental constituents of [[hadron]]s and interact via the [[strong interaction]]. Quarks are the only known carriers of fractional charge, but because they combine in groups of three (baryons) or in pairs of one quark and one [[antiquark]] (mesons), only integer charge is observed in nature. Their respective [[antiparticle]]s are the [[antiquark]]s, which are identical except that they carry the opposite electric charge (for example the up quark carries charge +{{frac|2|3}}, while the up antiquark carries charge −{{frac|2|3}}), color charge, and baryon number. There are six [[flavor (particle physics)|flavors]] of quarks; the three positively charged quarks are called "up-type quarks" while the three negatively charged quarks are called "down-type quarks".

&lt;/center&gt;

====Leptons====
{{Main article|Leptons}}

Leptons do not interact via the [[strong interaction]]. Their respective [[antiparticle]]s are the [[antilepton]]s, which are identical, except that they carry the opposite electric charge and lepton number. The antiparticle of an [[electron]] is an antielectron, which is nearly always called a "[[positron]]" for historical reasons. There are six leptons in total; the three charged leptons are called "electron-like leptons", while the neutral leptons are called "[[neutrino]]s". Neutrinos are known to [[neutrino oscillation|oscillate]], so that neutrinos of definite [[flavour (particle physics)|flavor]] do not have definite mass, rather they exist in a superposition of mass [[eigenstate]]s. The hypothetical heavy right-handed neutrino, called a "[[sterile neutrino]]", has been left off the list.

===Bosons===
{{main article|Boson}}

Bosons are one of the two fundamental classes of particles, the other being [[fermion]]s. Bosons are characterized by [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and all have integer spins. Bosons may be either elementary, like [[photons]] and [[gluons]], or composite, like [[mesons]].

According to the [[Standard Model]] the elementary bosons are:

&lt;center&gt;

|-
|[[Higgs boson]] || {{Subatomic particle|Higgs boson}} || Self || 0 || 0 ||125.09{{+-|0.24}} || [[Mass]] ||Yes
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[Higgs boson]] is postulated by the [[electroweak theory]] primarily to explain the origin of [[Mass|particle masses]]. In a process known as the "[[Higgs mechanism]]", the Higgs boson and the other gauge bosons in the Standard Model acquire mass via [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of the SU(2) gauge symmetry. The [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM) predicts several Higgs bosons. A new particle expected to be the Higgs boson was observed at the [[Large Hadron Collider|CERN/LHC]] on 14&amp;nbsp;March 2013, around the energy of 126.5&amp;nbsp;GeV with an accuracy of close to five sigma (99.9999%, which is accepted as definitive). The Higgs mechanism giving mass to other particles has not been observed.

Elementary bosons responsible for the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature are called [[Force carrier|force particles]] ([[gauge boson]]s). [[Strong interaction]] is mediated by the [[gluon]], [[weak interaction]] is mediated by the W and Z bosons.

&lt;center&gt;

|-
! Name !! Symbol !! Antiparticle !! Charge ([[elementary charge|e]]) !! Spin !! Mass (GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;ref name="PDG2016"/&gt; !! Interaction mediated !!Observed
|-
|[[Graviton]] || G || Self || 0 || 2 || 0 ||[[Gravitation]]  ||No
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
The [[graviton]], listed separately above, is a hypothetical particle that has been included in some extensions to the standard model to mediate the [[gravitation]]al force. It is in a peculiar category between known and hypothetical particles: As an unobserved particle that is not predicted by, nor required for the [[Standard Model]], it belongs in the table of hypothetical particles, below. But gravitational force itself is a certainty, and expressing that known force in the framework of a [[quantum field theory]] requires a boson to mediate it.

===Hypothetical particles===
[[Supersymmetry|Supersymmetric]] theories predict the existence of more particles, none of which have been confirmed experimentally {{as of|2018|lc=y}}:

[[Mirror matter|Mirror particles]] are predicted by theories that restore [[Parity (physics)|parity symmetry]].

"[[Magnetic monopole]]" is a generic name for particles with non-zero magnetic charge.  They are predicted by some GUTs.

"[[Tachyon]]" is a generic name for hypothetical particles that travel faster than the speed of light (and so paradoxically experience time in reverse due to inversal of [[Theory of relativity]]) and have an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] rest mass.

[[Preon]]s were suggested as subparticles of quarks and leptons, but modern [[collider]] experiments have all but ruled out their existence.

[[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza–Klein towers]] of particles are predicted by some models of extra dimensions. The extra-dimensional momentum is manifested as extra mass in four-dimensional spacetime.

==Composite particles&lt;!--'Composite particle' and 'Composite particles' redirect here--&gt;==

===Hadrons===
{{Main article|Hadron}}
Hadrons are defined as [[strong interaction|strongly interacting]] '''composite particles'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. Hadrons are either:
* Composite fermions (especially 3 quarks), in which case they are called [[baryon]]s.
* Composite bosons (especially 2 quarks), in which case they are called [[meson]]s.

[[Quark model]]s, first proposed in 1964 independently by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] (who called quarks "aces"), describe the known hadrons as composed of valence [[quark]]s and/or antiquarks, tightly bound by the [[quantum chromodynamics|color force]], which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. A "sea" of virtual quark-antiquark pairs is also present in each hadron.

====Baryons====
[[Image:Baryon decuplet.svg|thumb|A combination of three u, d or s-quarks with a total spin of {{frac|3|2}} form the so-called "baryon decuplet".]]
[[Image:Proton quark structure.svg|thumb|200px|Proton quark structure: 2 up quarks and 1 down quark. The gluon tubes or flux tubes are now known to be Y shaped.]]
{{See also|List of baryons}}

Ordinary [[baryon]]s (composite [[fermion]]s) contain three valence quarks or three valence antiquarks each.
* [[Nucleon]]s are the fermionic constituents of normal atomic nuclei:
**[[Proton]]s, composed of two up and one down quark (uud)
**[[Neutron]]s, composed of two down and one up quark (ddu)
* [[Hyperon]]s, such as the Λ, Σ, Ξ, and Ω particles, which contain one or more [[strange quark]]s, are short-lived and heavier than nucleons. Although not normally present in atomic nuclei, they can appear in short-lived [[hypernucleus|hypernuclei]].
* A number of [[charm quark|charmed]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] baryons have also been observed.
* [[Pentaquark]]s consist of four valence quarks and one valence antiquark.
* Other [[exotic baryon]]s may also exist.

====Mesons====
[[Image:Noneto mesônico de spin 0.png|thumb|Mesons of spin 0 form a nonet]]
{{See also|List of mesons}}

Ordinary [[meson]]s are made up of a [[valence quark]] and a valence [[antiquark]]. Because mesons have [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 0 or 1 and are not themselves elementary particles, they are "composite" [[boson]]s. Examples of mesons include the [[pion]], [[kaon]], and the [[J/ψ]]. In quantum hydrodynamic models, mesons mediate the [[residual strong force]] between nucleons.

At one time or another, positive [[signature]]s have been reported for all of the following [[exotic meson]]s  but their existences have yet to be confirmed.
* A [[tetraquark]] consists of two valence quarks and two valence antiquarks;
* A [[glueball]] is a bound state of gluons with no valence quarks;
* [[Hybrid (particle physics)|Hybrid]] mesons consist of one or more valence quark-antiquark pairs and one or more real gluons.

===Atomic nuclei===
[[Image:Helium atom QM.svg|right|300px|thumbnail|A [[Uncertainty principle|semi-accurate]] depiction of the [[helium]] atom.  In the nucleus, the protons are in red and neutrons are in purple. In reality, the nucleus is also spherically symmetrical.]]
[[Atomic nucleus|Atomic nuclei]] consist of protons and neutrons. Each type of nucleus contains a specific number of protons and a specific number of neutrons, and is called a "[[nuclide]]" or "[[isotope]]". [[Nuclear reaction]]s can change one nuclide into another. See [[table of nuclides]] for a complete list of isotopes.

===Atoms===
[[Atom]]s are the smallest neutral particles into which matter can be divided by [[chemical reaction]]s. An atom consists of a small, heavy nucleus surrounded by a relatively large, light cloud of electrons. Each type of atom corresponds to a specific [[chemical element]]. To date, 118 elements have been discovered or created.

The atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are, in turn, made of quarks.

===Molecules===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Molecule]] --&gt;
[[Molecule]]s are the smallest particles into which a non-elemental substance can be divided while maintaining the physical properties of the substance. Each type of molecule corresponds to a specific [[chemical compound]]. Molecules are a composite of two or more atoms. See [[list of compounds]] for a list of molecules. A molecule is generally combined in a fixed proportion. It is the most basic unit of matter and is homogenous.

==Quasiparticles==

[[Quasiparticles]] are effective particles that exist in many particle systems. The field equations of [[condensed matter physics]] are remarkably similar to those of high energy particle physics.  As a result, much of the theory of particle physics applies to condensed matter physics as well; in particular, there  are a selection of field excitations, called [[quasi-particle]]s, that can be created and explored. These include:

* [[Phonon]]s are vibrational modes in a [[crystal lattice]].
* [[Exciton]]s are bound states of an [[electron]] and a [[electron hole|hole]].
* [[Plasmon]]s are coherent excitations of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].
* [[Polariton]]s are mixtures of [[photon]]s with other quasi-particles.
* [[Polaron]]s are moving, charged (quasi-) particles that are surrounded by ions in a material.
* [[Magnon]]s are coherent excitations of electron spins in a material.

==Other==
* [[Acceleron]]s are hypothetical particles postulated to relate neutrino mass to dark energy, and are named for the role they play in the [[accelerating expansion of the universe]]
* An [[anyon]] is a generalization of fermion and boson in two-dimensional systems like sheets of [[graphene]] that obeys [[braid statistics]].
* A [[plekton]] is a theoretical kind of particle discussed as a generalization of the braid statistics of the anyon to dimension &gt; 2.
* A [[Weakly Interacting Massive Particle|WIMP]] (weakly interacting massive particle) is any one of a number of particles that might explain dark matter (such as the neutralino or the axion).
* A [[Gravitationally-interacting massive particles|GIMP]] (gravitationally interacting massive particle) is a particle which provides an alternative explanation of dark matter, instead of the aforementioned WIMP.
* The [[pomeron]], used to explain the [[elastic scattering]] of hadrons and the location of [[Regge pole]]s in [[Regge theory]].
* The [[skyrmion]], a topological solution of the [[pion]] field, used to model the low-energy properties of the [[nucleon]], such as the axial vector current coupling and the mass.
* A genon is a particle existing in a closed [[timelike]] [[world line]] where [[spacetime]] is curled as in a [[Frank Tipler]] or [[Ronald Mallett]] [[Time travel|time machine]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* A [[goldstone boson]] is a massless excitation of a field that has been [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]]. The [[pion]]s are quasi-goldstone bosons (quasi- because they are not exactly massless) of the broken [[Chirality (physics)|chiral]] [[isospin]] symmetry of [[quantum chromodynamics]].
* A [[goldstino]] is a goldstone [[fermion]] produced by the spontaneous breaking of [[supersymmetry]].
* An [[instanton]] is a field configuration which is a local minimum of the Euclidean action. Instantons are used in nonperturbative calculations of tunneling rates.
* A [[dyon]] is a hypothetical particle with both electric and magnetic charges.
* A [[Geon (physics)|geon]] is an electromagnetic or gravitational wave which is held together in a confined region by the gravitational attraction of its own field of energy.
* An [[inflaton]] is the generic name for an unidentified scalar particle responsible for the [[cosmic inflation]].
* A [[spurion]] is the name given to a "particle" inserted mathematically into an isospin-violating decay in order to analyze it as though it conserved isospin.
* What is called [[Muonium|"true muonium"]], a [[bound state]] of a [[muon]] and an antimuon, is a theoretical exotic atom which has never been observed.
* An [[ion]] (a charged atom or molecule) is either an anion or a cation.
* A [[Dislon|dislon]] is a localized collective excitation of a crystal dislocation around the static displacement.

==Classification by speed==
* A [[bradyon|tardyon or bradyon]] travels slower than light and has a non-zero rest mass.
* A [[Massless particle|luxon]] travels at the speed of light and has no rest mass.
* A [[tachyon]] (mentioned above) is a hypothetical particle that travels faster than the speed of light and has an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] rest mass.

'''Lovelock's theorem''' of [[general relativity]] says that from a local gravitational action which contains only second derivatives of the four-dimensional [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|spacetime metric]], then the only possible equations of motion are the [[Einstein field equations]].&lt;ref name=modgrav&gt;{{cite journal |first=Timothy |last=Clifton |first2=Pedro G. |last2=Ferreira |first3=Antonio |last3=Padilla |first4=Constantinos |last4=Skordis |displayauthors=1 |title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology |date=March 2012 |arxiv=1106.2476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Lovelock |title=The Einstein Tensor and Its Generalizations |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=498–501 |year=1971 |doi=10.1063/1.1665613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock(1972)"/&gt;  The theorem was described by British physicist [[David Lovelock]] in 1971.

==Statement==
In four dimensional space, any tensor &lt;math&gt;A^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; whose components  are function of metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and its first and second derivatives (but linear in the second derivatives of &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;), and also symmetric and divergenceless,  then field equation in vacuum &lt;math&gt;A^{\mu\nu}=0&lt;/math&gt;, then only possible form of &lt;math&gt;A^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;A^{\mu\nu}=a G^{\mu\nu}+b g^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are just simple constant numbers and &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Einstein tensor]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock(1972)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lovelock  |first=David |date= 10 January 1972 |title=The Four-Dimensionality of Space and the Einstein Tensor |url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1666069  |journal= Journal of Mathematical Physics |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=874–876 |doi=10.1063/1.1666069|access-date=27 December 2017|bibcode=1972JMP....13..874L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only possible second-order Euler–Lagrange expression obtainable in a four-dimensional space from a scalar density of the form &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}(g_{\mu\nu})&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name=modgrav/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E^{\mu\nu} = \alpha \sqrt{-g} \left[R^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} R \right] + \lambda \sqrt{-g} g^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

==Consequences==
Lovelock's theorem means that if we want to modify the Einstein field equations, then we have five options.&lt;ref name=modgrav/&gt;

* Add other fields rather than the metric tensor
* Use more or less than four spacetime dimensions
* Add more than second order derivatives of the metric
* Non-locality, e.g. for example the inverse d'Alembertian
* Emergence – the idea that the field equations don't come from the action.

A '''motiongram''' is a spatiotemporal display of motion, created from a video recording. Motiongrams are created using a [[video processing]] technique, in which a [[motion image]] is collapsed into a series of 1 pixel wide stripes and plotted next to one another.

== Challenge ==

The traditional way of representing (human) motion visually, is either by displaying individual frames from a video file as a [[keyframe]] display or by doing one or more forms of feature extraction and subsequent plotting of the resultant data. Neither of these are ideal to give a good impression of the actual motion happening in the sequence. Keyframe displays only show postures and not motion, while feature graphs often rely on multiple analysis steps. Motiongrams are useful as an intermediary step to show spatiotemporal   information of a movement sequence, but with no need for doing a full analysis of the data.

== History ==

The term motiongram was first proposed by Alexander Refsum Jensenius in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title       = Using motiongrams in the study of musical gestures
| url         = http://www.duo.uio.no/sok/work.html?WORKID=90455
| publisher   = International Computer Music Association
| accessdate  = 1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the technique has later been refined by him and others. The technique was inspired by the pioneering work of [[Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey|Marey]] from the 19th century, as well as the [[Slit-scan photography|slit-scan]] community in the 20th century. Motiongrams resemble slit-scan photographs, but are different in that they are created from frame-differenced motion-images. The result is that only motion is shown in the final display.

== Implementation ==

An overview of creating a motiongram is shown in Figure 1. The process starts by reading a video stream, and doing simple image adjustments, e.g., changing the brightness and contrast. The next step involves producing the [[motion image]] by calculating the absolute frame difference between successive video frames, followed by applying some noise removal algorithms. The motiongram is created by calculating the normalized mean value for each row or column in the motion image. This means that for each image matrix of size MxN, a Mx1 or 1xN matrix is calculated. Drawing these 1 pixel wide “stripes” next to each other over time results in the final motiongram.

The motiongram technique has been implemented as modules in the open framework [[Jamoma]] for [[Max (software)|Max]], as well as for the [[EyesWeb]] platform and in [[Matlab]]. There are also two standalone applications for OSX and Windows: VideoAnalysis (non-realtime) and AudioVideoAnalysis (realtime).

== Examples ==

Motiongrams allow for quick navigation in video material and for comparative analysis of motion qualities. Although quite rough, it is easy to see differences in the quantity of motion and similarities in upward/downward patterns between motion sequences.

== Limitations ==

Since motiongrams are made by averaging over either the rows or columns of a video file, only one dimension will be shown in the final motiongram. Thus a horizontal motiongram will mainly represent vertical motion, while a vertical motiongram will mainly represent horizontal motion.

'''Mount Tarawera''' is the [[volcano]] responsible for one of New Zealand's largest historic eruptions. Located 24&amp;nbsp;kilometres southeast of [[Rotorua]] in the [[North Island]], it consists of a series of [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] [[lava dome]]s that were fissured down the middle by an explosive [[basalt]]ic [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera|eruption in 1886]], which killed an estimated 120 people. These fissures run for about 17&amp;nbsp;kilometres northeast-southwest.

The volcano's component domes include Ruawahia Dome (the highest at 1,111&amp;nbsp;metres), Tarawera Dome and Wahanga Dome. It is surrounded by [[lakes of Rotorua|several lakes]], most of which were created or drastically altered by the 1886 eruption. These lakes include Lakes [[Lake Tarawera|Tarawera]], [[Lake Rotomahana|Rotomahana]], [[Lake Rerewhakaaitu|Rerewhakaaitu]], [[Lake Okataina|Okataina]], [[Lake Okareka|Okareka]], [[Lake Tikitapu|Tikitapu (Blue Lake)]] and [[Lake Rotokakahi|Rotokakahi (Green Lake)]]. The [[Tarawera River]] runs northeastwards across the northern flank of the mountain from Lake Tarawera.

==Circa 1315 eruption==
Mount Tarawera erupted around 1315. The ash thrown from this event may have affected temperatures around the globe and precipitated the [[Great Famine of 1315–17]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cantor, Norman L. |title=In the wake of the plague: the Black Death and the world it made |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |year=2001 |page=74 |isbn=0-684-85735-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Nairn I.A. |author2=Shane P.R. |author3=Cole J.W. |author4=Leonard G.J. |author5=Self S. |author6=Pearson N. |title=Rhyolite magma processes of the ~AD 1315 Kaharoa eruption episode, Tarawera volcano, New Zealand |journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research |volume=131 |pages=265–94 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1016/S0377-0273(03)00381-0|issue= 3–4 |bibcode = 2004JVGR..131..265N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00288306.2005.9515128|author1=Hodgson K.A. |author2=Nairn I.A. |title=The c.

==1886 eruption== 
[[Image:MountTarawera2.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Volcanic crater]]
{{main article|1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera}}
Shortly after midnight on the morning of 10 June 1886, a series of more than 30 increasingly strong earthquakes were felt in the Rotorua area and an unusual sheet lightning display was observed from the direction of Tarawera. At around 2:00 am&lt;ref name="Keam"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tarawera|author=[[R. F. Keam]]|isbn=0-473-00444-5|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larger earthquake was felt and followed by the sound of an explosion. By 2:30 am Mount Tarawera's three peaks had erupted, blasting three distinct columns of smoke and ash thousands of metres into the sky. At around 3.30 am, the largest phase of the eruption commenced; vents at Rotomahana produced a [[pyroclastic surge]] that destroyed several villages within a 6&amp;nbsp;kilometre radius, and the [[Pink and White Terraces]] appeared to be obliterated.

The eruption was heard clearly as far away as [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and the effects of the ash in the air were observed as far south as Christchurch, over 800&amp;nbsp;km away. In [[Auckland]] the sound of the eruption and the flashing sky was thought by some to be [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The "Russian-scare" forts of 1885|an attack by Russian warships]].

[[File:Inside the Tarawera rift.jpg|thumb|Crumbling [[scoria]] cliffs surround the summit rift]]

Although the official contemporary death toll was 153, exhaustive research by physicist Ron Keam only identified 108 people killed by the eruption. Much of the discrepancy was due to misspelled names and other duplications. Allowing for some unnamed and unknown victims, he estimated that the true death toll was 120 at most.&lt;ref name="Keam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anheizen deaths"&gt;[http://www.anheizen.com/aftermath/index.php?content=deathlist.php Aftermath – Death list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604113757/http://www.anheizen.com/aftermath/index.php?content=deathlist.php |date=2008-06-04 }}, Anheizen.com. Accessed 20 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people claim that many more people died.&lt;ref&gt;In 2007, the General Manager of the Earthquake Commission said that "... Ngati Hinemihi oral accounts put the death toll in the thousands." David Middleton (2007). [http://www.eqc.govt.nz/downloads/pdfs/habitability-conf-presentation.pdf A Roof Over Their Heads?

Accessed 2008-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eruption also buried many [[Māori people|Māori]] villages, including Te Wairoa, which has now become a tourist attraction (the buried village of [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]]), and the world-famous [[Pink and White Terraces]] were thought lost. A small portion of the Pink Terraces was reportedly rediscovered under Lake Rotomahana 125 years later.&lt;ref name="NBR_84968"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/scientists-find-pink-terraces-new-zealands-lost-eight-wonder-world-nn-84968 |title=Scientists find Pink Terraces – NZ's lost 'eighth wonder of the world' |author=NZPA and NBR staff |date=2 February 2011 |work=[[National Business Review]] |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, using a lost 1859 survey of the old lake and terraces, researchers finally  georeferenced the old Lake Rotomahana and the original Pink and White Terrace locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bunn |first=Rex|last2=Nolden|first2=Sascha|date=2017-06-07|title=Forensic cartography with Hochstetter’s 1859 Pink and White Terraces survey: Te Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand |volume=0|issue=0 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|issn=0303-6758}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunn and Nolden|first=Rex and Sascha|date=December 2016|title=Te Tarata and Te Otukapuarangi: Reverse engineering Hochstetter’s Lake Rotomahana Survey to map the Pink and White Terrace locations|url=https://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/3988/3555|journal=Journal of New Zealand Studies|volume=NS23|pages=37–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 2 cubic kilometres of [[tephra]] was erupted,&lt;ref name=gvp&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0401-05=&amp;volpage=erupt|title=Okataina: Eruptive History}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|Mount St. Helens ejected in 1980]]. Many of the lakes surrounding the mountain had their shapes and areas dramatically altered, especially the eventual enlargement of [[Lake Rotomahana]], the largest crater involved in the eruption, as it re-filled with water. The rift created during the eruption extends 17&amp;nbsp;km across the mountain, Lake Rotomahana and through the [[Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley]]. Some of the local survivors at Te Wairoa took shelter in a [[Māori culture|Maori]] meeting house, a [[wharenui]], named Hinemihi, which was later taken to England and erected in the grounds of [[Clandon Park]], the seat of the 4th Earl Onslow, who had been governor-general of New Zealand at the time.

==The phantom canoe==
[[File:Kennett Watkins - The Phantom Canoe- A Legend of Lake Tarawera - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''The Phantom Canoe: A Legend of Lake Tarawera'', by Kennett Watkins]]

One legend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotoruanz.com/rotorua/history/maori_legends.php#phantom|title=Rotorua NZ – Explore Rotorua – Natural and cultural attracitions|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907174539/http://www.rotoruanz.com//rotorua/history/maori_legends.php#phantom|archivedate=2008-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding the 1886 eruption is that of the phantom canoe. Eleven days before the eruption, a boat full of tourists returning from the Terraces saw what appeared to be a war canoe approach their boat, only to disappear in the mist half a mile from them. One of the witnesses was a clergyman, a local Maori man from the Te Arawa iwi. Nobody around the lake owned such a war canoe, and nothing like it had been seen on the lake for many years.
It is possible that the rise and fall of the lake level caused by pre-eruption fissures had freed a burial [[Waka (canoe)|''waka'']] (canoe) from its resting place. Traditionally dead [[Rangatira|chiefs]] were tied in an upright position. A number of letters have been published from the tourists who experienced the event.

Though skeptics maintained that it was a freak reflection seen on the mist, tribal elders at [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]] claimed that it was a ''[[Waka (canoe)|waka]] wairua'' (spirit canoe) and was a portent of doom.  It has been suggested that the waka was actually a [[freak wave]] on the water, caused by seismic activity below the lake, but locals believe that a future eruption will be signaled by the reappearance of the canoe. {{Citation needed|reason=Unreferenced claim|date=May 2014}}{{clear}}

Google Books.  Collected 20 Jul 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Silk noil is also called "raw silk", although that is a [[misnomer]]. As noil is a relatively short fiber, [[textiles|fabric]] made from noil is weaker and considered less valuable.

== Silk ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2018}}

Silk noil may also be made from the short fibres, directly sourced from the silkworm cocoons. Rather than the continuous length of silk, shorter fibers, which are generally not used to create high quality silk are used for silk noil, which has a slightly rough texture. It is relatively weaker and has low resilience. It tends to have very low lustre, which makes it appear more like cotton than silk.

Noil silk has the advantage of being made from protein. Thus, it has a better texture and depth that cotton – and gives a nice fall and drape.

Silk noil is also blended or appended with heavier fabrics like velvets and satins to create varied textures. Made out of the strongest natural fibres (with a protein base) around, the Noil Sarees are not slippery like synthetic fibres and absorb moisture well. Noils are easily dyed, and can also be made waterproof, by using a polyurethane coating. This also increases their usage in furnishings industry. 

Silk noil hails from China, from where it was exported to Europe in the middle ages, especially to Italy. It was used to create silk blends, through the first half of the 14th century. However, over the time the use decreased.

With an increase in demand and variety of alternatives and low-cost substitutes, Noil has re-surfaced – experiencing a sort of revival. In India, noil is used to make sarees, materials and furnishings.

The '''Serpukhovian''' is in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] [[geologic timescale]] the uppermost [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] or youngest [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], the lower [[system (stratigraphy)|subsystem]] of the [[Carboniferous]]. The Serpukhovian age lasted from {{Period start|Serpukhovian}} Ma to {{Period start|Bashkirian}} [[Megaannum|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Gradstein, F.M.; Ogg, J.G. &amp; Smith, A.G.}}; '''2004''': ''A Geologic Time Scale 2004'', [[Cambridge University]] Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is preceded by the [[Visean]] and is followed by the [[Bashkirian]].

The Serpukhovian correlates with the lower part of the [[Namurian]] stage of European stratigraphy and the middle and upper parts of the [[Chesterian]] stage of North American stratigraphy.

==Name and definition==
The Serpukhovian stage was proposed in 1890 by Russian stratigrapher [[Sergei Nikitin (geologist)|Sergei Nikitin]] and was introduced in the official stratigraphy of European Russia in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Fedorowsky, J.}}; '''2009''': ''Early Bashkirian Rugosa (Anthozoa) from the Donets Basin, Ukraine. Part 1. Introductory considerations and the genus Rotiphyllum Hudson, 1942'', Acta Geologica Polonica '''59'''(1), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after the city of [[Serpukhov]], near [[Moscow]]. The ICS later used the upper Russian subdivisions of the Carboniferous in its international geologic time scale.

The base of the Serpukhovian is at the first appearance of the [[conodont]] ''Lochriea crusiformis''. In 2007, no [[GSSP]] had been assigned to the Serpukhovian stage yet. The top of the stage (the base of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subsystem and Bashkirian stage) is at the first appearance of the conodont ''Declinognathodus nodiliferus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Lane, H.R.; Brenckle, P.L.; Baesemann, J.F. &amp; Richards, B.}}; '''1999''': ''The IUGS boundary in the middle of the Carboniferous: Arrow Canyon, Nevada, USA'', Episodes '''22'''(4), pp 272–283.
&lt;/ref&gt; It is also slightly above the first appearance of the [[foraminifera|foram]] ''Globivalvulina bulloides'', genozone of the [[ammonoid]] [[genus]] ''Homoceras'' and the ammonoid [[biozone]] of ''Isohomoceras subglobosum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Menning, M.; Alekseev, A.S.; Chuvashov, B.I.; Davydov, V.I.; Devuyst, F.-X.; Forke, H.C.; Grunt, T.A.; Hance, L.; Heckel, P.H.; Izokh, N.G.; Jin, Y.-G.; Jones, P.J.; Kotlyar, G.V.; Kozur, H.W.; Nemyrovska, T.I.; Schneider, J.W.;  Wang, X.-D.; Weddige, K.; Weyer, D. &amp; Work, D.M.}}; '''2006''': ''Global time scale and regional stratigraphic reference scales of Central and West Europe, East Europe, Tethys, South China, and North America as used in the Devonian–Carboniferous–Permian Correlation Chart 2003 (DCP 2003)'', Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology '''240'''(1-2): pp 318–372.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivision==&lt;!--This is a redirect destination for [[Arnsbergian]] and [[Pendleian]]--&gt;
The Serpukhovian stage includes four conodont biozones:
*''[[Gnathodus]] postbilineatus'' Zone
*''Gnathodus bollandensis'' Zone

In Russian stratigraphy, the Serpukhovian is subdivided into three substages, from bottom to top: Tarusian, Steshevian, and Protvian, named after places near Serpukhov ([[Tarusa]] and Protva). In British stratigraphy, the Serpukhovian (lower Namurian) contains three substages. These are from bottom to top: [[Pendleian]], [[Arnsbergian]] and Chokierian (only the lower Chokierian falls in the Serpukhovian, the top falls in the Bashkirian).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Heckel, P.H. &amp; Clayton, G.}}; '''2006''': ''The Carboniferous system, use of the new official names for the subsystems, series and stages'', Geologica Acta '''4'''(3), pp 403–407.

'''Shell shock''' is a term coined in [[World War I]] to describe the type of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] many soldiers were afflicted with during the war (before PTSD itself was a term).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/what-doesnt-kill-us/201111/is-shell-shock-the-same-ptsd|title=Is Shell Shock the Same as PTSD?|author=|date=|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
It is a reaction to the intensity of the bombardment and fighting that produced a helplessness appearing variously as panic and being scared, flight, or an inability to reason, sleep, walk or talk.&lt;ref name=Hochschild&gt;{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|title=To End All Wars - a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914-1918|year=2012|publisher=Mariner Books, Houghton, Mifflin Harcourt|location=Boston, New York|ISBN=978-0-547-75031-6|pages=xv, 242, 348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the War, the concept of shell shock was ill-defined. Cases of "shell shock" could be interpreted as either a physical or psychological injury, or simply as a lack of moral fibre. The term ''shell shock'' is still used by the [[Veterans Administration]] to describe certain parts of PTSD, but mostly it has entered into popular imagination and memory, and it is often identified as the signature injury of the War.

In World War II and thereafter, diagnosis of "shell shock" was replaced by that of [[combat stress reaction]], a similar but not identical response to the trauma of warfare and bombardment.

==Origin==
During the early stages of World War I in 1914, soldiers from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] began to report medical symptoms after combat, including [[tinnitus]], [[amnesia]], [[headaches]], dizziness, [[tremor]]s, and hypersensitivity to noise. While these symptoms resembled those that would be expected after a physical wound to the brain, many of those reporting sick showed no signs of head wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Fear and Wessely 2007, p.1641&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1914 as many as 10% of British officers and 4% of enlisted men were suffering from "nervous and mental shock".&lt;ref name="McLeod, 2004"&gt;McLeod, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "shell shock" came into use to reflect an assumed link between the symptoms and the effects of explosions from artillery shells. The term was first published in 1915 in an article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' by [[Charles Samuel Myers|Charles Myers]]. Some 60–80% of shell shock cases displayed acute [[neurasthenia]], while 10% displayed what would now be termed symptoms of [[conversion disorder]], including [[mutism]] and [[Fugue state|fugue]].&lt;ref name="McLeod, 2004"/&gt;

The number of shell shock cases grew during 1915 and 1916 but it remained poorly understood medically and psychologically. Some doctors held the view that it was a result of hidden physical damage to the brain, with the shock waves from bursting shells creating a cerebral [[lesion]] that caused the symptoms and could potentially prove fatal. Another explanation was that shell shock resulted from poisoning by the [[carbon monoxide]] formed by explosions.&lt;ref name="Jones 2007"&gt;Jones, Fear and Wessely 2007, p.1642&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time an alternative view developed describing shell shock as an emotional, rather than a physical, injury. Evidence for this point of view was provided by the fact that an increasing proportion of men suffering shell shock symptoms had not been exposed to artillery fire. Since the symptoms appeared in men who had no proximity to an exploding shell, the physical explanation was clearly unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="Jones 2007"/&gt;

In spite of this evidence, the British Army continued to try to differentiate those whose symptoms followed explosive exposure from others. In 1915 the [[British Army]] in [[France]] was instructed that:

{{quote|Shell-shock and shell concussion cases should have the letter 'W' prefixed to the report of the casualty, if it was due to the enemy; in that case the patient would be entitled to rank as 'wounded' and to wear on his arm a '[[wound stripe]]'.  If, however, the man’s breakdown did not follow a shell explosion, it was not thought to be 'due to the enemy', and he was to [be] labelled 'Shell-shock' or 'S' (for sickness) and was not entitled to a wound stripe or a pension.&lt;ref name="shephard"&gt;[[Ben Shephard (English historian)|Shephard, Ben]]. ''A War of Nerves: Soldiers and Psychiatrists, 1914-1994''. London, Jonathan Cape, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, it often proved difficult to identify which cases were which, as the information on whether a casualty had been close to a shell explosion or not was rarely provided.&lt;ref name="Jones 2007"/&gt;

==Management==

===Acute===
At first, shell-shock casualties were rapidly evacuated from the front line – in part because of fear of their unpredictable behaviour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mcleod, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As the size of the British Expeditionary Force increased, and manpower became in shorter supply, the number of shell shock cases became a growing problem for the military authorities. At the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, as many as 40% of casualties were shell-shocked, resulting in concern about an epidemic of psychiatric casualties, which could not be afforded in either military or financial terms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among the consequences of this were an increasing official preference for the psychological interpretation of shell shock, and a deliberate attempt to avoid the [[medicalisation]] of shell shock. If men were 'uninjured' it was easier to return them to the front to continue fighting.&lt;ref name="Jones 2007"/&gt; Another consequence was an increasing amount of time and effort devoted to understanding and treating shell shock symptoms.

By the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917, the British Army had developed methods to reduce shell shock. A man who began to show shell-shock symptoms was best given a few days' rest by his local medical officer.&lt;ref name="McLeod, 2004"/&gt; Col. Rogers, [[Regimental Medical Officer]],  4th Battalion [[Black Watch]] wrote:

{{quote|You must send your commotional cases down the line.  But when you get these emotional cases, unless they are very bad, if you have a hold of the men and they know you and you know them (and there is a good deal more in the man knowing you than in you knowing the man) … you are able to explain to him that there is really nothing wrong with him, give him a rest at the aid post if necessary and a day or two’s sleep, go up with him to the front line, and, when there, see him often, sit down beside him and talk to him about the war and look through his periscope and let the man see you are taking an interest in him.&lt;ref name="shephard"/&gt;}}

If symptoms persisted after a few weeks at a local Casualty Clearing Station, which would normally be close enough to the front line to hear artillery fire, a casualty might be evacuated to one of four dedicated psychiatric centres which had been set up further behind the lines, and were labelled as "NYDN – Not Yet Diagnosed Nervous" pending further investigation by medical specialists.

Even though the Battle of Passchendaele generally became a byword for horror, the number of cases of shell shock were relatively few. 5,346 shell shock cases reached the Casualty Clearing Station, or roughly 1% of the British forces engaged. 3,963 (or just under 75%) of these men returned to active service without being referred to a hospital for specialist treatment. The number of shell shock cases reduced throughout the battle, and the epidemic of illness was ended.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1917, "shell shock" was entirely banned as a diagnosis in the British Army,&lt;ref&gt;Wessely 2006, p443&lt;/ref&gt; and mentions of it were [[Censorship|censored]], even in medical journals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jones, Fear and Wessely 2007, p.1643&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic===
The treatment of chronic shell shock varied widely according to the details of the symptoms, the views of the doctors involved, and other factors including the rank and class of the patient.

There were so many officers and men suffering from shell shock that 19 British military hospitals were wholly devoted to the treatment of cases. Ten years after the war, 65,000 veterans of the war were still receiving treatment for it in Britain. In France it was possible to visit aged shell shock victims in hospital in 1960.&lt;ref name="Hochschild" /&gt;

==Physical causes==
Recent research by Johns Hopkins University has found that the brain tissue of combat veterans who have been exposed to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) exhibit a pattern of injury in the areas responsible for decision making, memory and reasoning.  This evidence has led the researchers to conclude that shell shock may not only be a psychological disorder, since the symptoms exhibited by sufferers from the First World War are very similar to these injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/combat_veterans_brains_reveal_hidden_damage_from_ied_blasts|title=Combat Veterans’ Brains Reveal Hidden Damage from IED Blasts - 01/14/2015|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cowardice==

{{See also|British Army during World War I}}

Some men suffering from shell shock were put on trial, and even executed, for military crimes including desertion and cowardice. While it was recognised that the stresses of war could cause men to break down, a lasting episode was likely to be seen as symptomatic of an underlying lack of character.&lt;ref name="Wessely 2006, p442"&gt;Wessely 2006, p442&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in his testimony to the post-war Royal Commission examining shell shock, [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]] said that shell shock was a weakness and was not found in "good" units.&lt;ref name="Wessely 2006, p442"/&gt; The continued pressure to avoid [[Medicalization|medical recognition]] of shell shock meant that it was not, in itself, considered an admissible defence.

Executions of soldiers in the British Army were not commonplace. While there were 240,000 Courts Martial and 3080 death sentences handed down, in only 346 cases was the sentence carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Wessely 2006, p440&lt;/ref&gt; 266 British soldiers were executed for "Desertion", 18 for "Cowardice", 7 for "Quitting a post without authority", 5 for "Disobedience to a lawful command" and 2 for "Casting away arms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwone/shot_at_dawn_01.shtml |title=Shot at Dawn: Cowards, Traitors or Victims? |first=Peter |last=Taylor-Whiffen |date=2002-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 7 November 2006 the government of the United Kingdom gave them all a posthumous conditional pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=War Pardons receives Royal Assent |publisher=ShotAtDawn.org.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206005826/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/|archivedate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission of enquiry ==
The British government produced a ''Report of the War Office Committee of Enquiry into "Shell-Shock"'' which was published in 1922. Recommendations from this included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
;In forward areas
:No soldier should be allowed to think that loss of nervous or mental control provides an honourable avenue of escape from the battlefield, and every endeavour should be made to prevent slight cases leaving the battalion or divisional area, where treatment should be confined to provision of rest and comfort for those who need it and to heartening them for return to the front line.
;In neurological centres
:When cases are sufficiently severe to necessitate more scientific and elaborate treatment they should be sent to special Neurological Centres as near the front as possible, to be under the care of an expert in nervous disorders.  No such case should, however, be so labelled on evacuation as to fix the idea of nervous breakdown in the patient’s mind.
;In base hospitals
:When evacuation to the base hospital is necessary, cases should be treated in a separate hospital or separate sections of a hospital, and not with the ordinary sick and wounded patients.  Only in exceptional circumstances should cases be sent to the United Kingdom, as, for instance, men likely to be unfit for further service of any kind with the forces in the field.  This policy should be widely known throughout the Force.
;Forms of treatment
:The establishment of an atmosphere of cure is the basis of all successful treatment, the personality of the physician is, therefore, of the greatest importance.  While recognising that each individual case of war neurosis must be treated on its merits, the Committee are of opinion that good results will be obtained in the majority by the simplest forms of psycho-therapy, i.e., explanation, persuasion and suggestion, aided by such physical methods as baths, electricity and massage.  Rest of mind and body is essential in all cases.

:The committee are of opinion that the production of hypnoidal state and deep hypnotic sleep, while beneficial as a means of conveying suggestions or eliciting forgotten experiences are useful in selected cases, but in the majority they are unnecessary and may even aggravate the symptoms for a time.
:They do not recommend psycho-analysis in the Freudian sense.

:In the state of convalescence, re-education and suitable occupation of an interesting nature are of great importance.  If the patient is unfit for further military service, it is considered that every endeavour should be made to obtain for him suitable employment on his return to active life.
;Return to the fighting line
:Soldiers should not be returned to the fighting line under the following conditions:-
:(1) If the symptoms of neurosis are of such a character that the soldier cannot be treated overseas with a view to subsequent useful employment.
:(2) If the breakdown is of such severity as to necessitate a long period of rest and treatment in the United Kingdom.
:(3) If the disability is anxiety neurosis of a severe type.
:(4) If the disability is a mental breakdown or psychosis requiring treatment in a mental hospital.
:It is, however, considered that many of such cases could, after recovery, be usefully employed in some form of auxiliary military duty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Part of the concern was that many British veterans were receiving [[pension]]s and had long-term disabilities.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By 1939, some 120,000 British ex-servicemen had received final awards for primary psychiatric disability or were still drawing pensions – about 15% of all pensioned disabilities – and another 44,000 or so … were getting pensions for ‘soldier’s heart’ or [[Effort Syndrome]].  There is, though, much that statistics do not show, because in terms of psychiatric effects, pensioners were just the tip of a huge iceberg.&lt;ref name="shephard"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

War correspondent Philip Gibbs wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Something was wrong.  They put on civilian clothes again and looked to their mothers and wives very much like the young men who had gone to business in the peaceful days before August 1914.  But they had not come back the same men.  Something had altered in them.  They were subject to sudden moods, and queer tempers, fits of profound [[clinical depression|depression]] alternating with a restless desire for pleasure.  Many were easily moved to passion where they lost control of themselves, many were bitter in their speech, violent in opinion, frightening.&lt;ref name="shephard"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One British writer between the wars wrote:
   
&lt;blockquote&gt;There should be no excuse given for the establishment of a belief that a functional nervous disability constitutes a right to compensation.  This is hard saying.  It may seem cruel that those whose sufferings are real, whose illness has been brought on by enemy action and very likely in the course of patriotic service, should be treated with such apparent callousness.  But there can be no doubt that in an overwhelming proportion of cases, these patients succumb to ‘shock’ because they get something out of it.  To give them this reward is not ultimately a benefit to them because it encourages the weaker tendencies in their character.  The nation cannot call on its citizens for courage and sacrifice and, at the same time, state by implication that an unconscious cowardice or an unconscious dishonesty will be rewarded.&lt;ref name="shephard"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of psychiatry==
At the beginning of [[World War II]], the term "shell shock" was banned by the British Army, though the phrase "[[postconcussional syndrome]]" was used to describe similar traumatic responses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
Shell shock has had a profound impact in British culture and the popular memory of World War I. At the time, war writers like the poets [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[Wilfred Owen]] dealt with shell shock in their work. Sassoon and Owen spent time at [[Craiglockhart War Hospital]], which treated shell shock casualties.&lt;ref&gt;While Sassoon did not in fact suffer from shell shock, he was declared insane at the instigation of his friend [[Robert Graves]] in order to avoid prosecution for his anti-war publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Pat Barker]] explored the causes and effects of shell shock in her [[Regeneration Trilogy]], basing many of her characters on real historical figures and drawing on the writings of the first world war poets and the army doctor [[W. H. R. Rivers]].

The '''shortgrass prairie''' is an [[ecosystem]] located in the [[Great Plains]] of North America. The [[prairie]] includes lands to the west as far as the eastern foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and extends east as far as [[Nebraska]] and north into [[Saskatchewan]]. The prairie stretches through parts of  [[Alberta]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Kansas]], and passes south through the [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]] of [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, R.T. 1901. Geography and Geology of the Black and Grand Prairies, Texas. In: Walcott, C.D. (ed), Twenty-First Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey to the Secretary of the Interior (1899-1900), Part VII - Texas, 666 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prairie was formerly maintained by [[grazing pressure]] of [[American bison]], which is the [[keystone species]]. The two most dominant [[grasses]] in the shortgrass prairie are [[blue grama]] (''Bouteloua gracilis'') and buffalograss (''[[Bouteloua dactyloides]]''), the two less dominant grasses in the prairie are [[greasegrass]] (''Tridens flavus'') and [[sideoats grama]] (''Bouteloua curtipendula''). Due to its [[semiarid climate]], the shortgrass prairie receives on average less [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] than that of the tall and mixed grass prairies to the east.{{fact|date=February 2017}}

== History ==
The shortgrass prairie has a long human history. The [[Kiowa]], [[Comanche]], and [[Arapaho]]e peoples occupied the land, hunting [[bison]] and [[pronghorn]]. Seasonally, these tribes would stage hunts in the adjacent mountains such as the [[Rocky Mountains]]. To manage the prairie these tribes and their predecessors likely used fire. They would create fuel breaks, a gap in vegetation or other combustible material that acts as a barrier to slow or stop the progress of a brushfire or [[wildfire]]. A firebreak may occur naturally in areas without vegetation or other fuel, such as a [[river]], [[lake]] or [[canyon]] around their settlements. These fuel breaks would also entice large herbivores to patches of fresh new growth.

European explorers, trappers, and fur traders began to settle the shortgrass prairie. They developed an extractive economy that led to the later growth and industrialization of the prairie. In the mid- and late 19th century the [[Rail transport|railroads]] expanded transportation channels, helping to increase settlement, predominantly in rural and small towns. While more people began to settle in the prairie, large-scale [[cattle]] and [[sheep]] ranching increased as well. This later led to the development of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]] mining communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dust Bowl ===
In the 1920s, [[El Niño]] played a big role in the success of crop growing in the short grass plains. El Niño caused more precipitation throughout the prairie, promoting plant growth. The success encouraged farmers to buy more efficient farming equipment. With the new equipment, farmers turned up the native land, exposing the soil. By the time the 1930s came around, it was too late to protect the soil with grass. The unprotected soil contributed to the [[Dust Bowl]] by being blown around and creating dust storms.

The Food Security Act of 1985 allowed for lower commodity prices and income supports. This Act also laid the foundation for the dairy herd buyout program. The Act made changes to several other USDA programs.

==== Conservation Reserve Program ====
Farmers enrolled in the program agree to abolish environmentally destroyed land from agricultural production and cattle grazing to improve and regrow healthy grass and habitats in exchange for a yearly rental payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y8344e/y8344e0d.htm|title=Grassland of the world|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today ===
Today much of the shortgrass prairie is grazed by domestic livestock, with a human population that still is dependent upon [[agriculture]]. However, energy and mining exploration have increased. Over time, there has been a precipitous decline of many species, but inhabitants of the region today are demonstrating that sound land management practices can help sustain the native species, natural communities, and ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Climate ==
The shortgrass prairie is a long thin stretch of territory that starts at the top of the country and makes its way to the bottom. Due to this, the climate varies from North to South, but is essentially the same from East to West. The temperature in the North is significantly colder on average then the temperature in the South. Also, there is more [[precipitation]] to the south, and more precipitation to the East. An interesting distinction about the shortgrass prairie compared to the [[Tallgrass prairie|tall]] and [[Mixed grass prairie|mixed]] grass prairies is that it has a one to two month summer [[drought]], where the other two do not. This means that it also the driest prairie of the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZlHRjU2EDLQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Prairie+ecology-the+shortgrass+prairie.&amp;ots=7TF82xWyEP&amp;sig=hFZ-PcprH3vIGisaPAtXK4zVw1M#v=onepage&amp;q=Prairie%20ecology-the%20shortgrass%20prairie.&amp;f=false|title=Prairie Conservation: Preserving North America's Most Endangered Ecosystem|last=Samson|first=Fred B.|last2=Knopf|first2=Fritz L.|date=1996-08-01|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781610913942|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;(cite ecology book) In addition, this region has various amounts of [[hail]]storms, [[blizzard]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[dust storm]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landscope.org/explore/natural_geographies/ecoregions/central_shortgrass_prairie_ecoregion/|title=Central Shortgrass Prairie // LandScope America|website=www.landscope.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
There are two significant population trends currently impacting the shortgrass prairie region. Firstly, the population in the region is decreasing, with many of those people moving westward. Additionally, more people are moving to [[metropolitan area]]s, and about three quarters of the population in this region live in those metropolitan areas. The human population today is still mainly dependent on [[agriculture]], but fields such as energy exploration and [[mining]] have become more popular in the area. Due to the increase in people this has affected the [[ecosystem]] of the region and there has been a decrease of amount of species and diversity of those species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Economy ==

=== Crop Production ===
Large portions of central grasslands of the United States are used for intensive agriculture. The shortgrass prairie has copious amounts for economic potential as it is estimated that only about 50 percent of the shortgrass prairie is still uncultivated. The shortgrass prairie yields for a lot of crop production, and in this specific prairie [[wheat]] is the major crop grown. Other major crops grown are [[maize]], [[soybean]]s, and [[cotton]].

=== Livestock Production ===
The dry grasslands of the shortgrass prairie yield for extensive grazing operations. Typically cow-calf operations with the young animal sold for finishing in feedlots. Stocking rates and the economy in this region highly depend on the amount of precipitation, range conditions, and other environmental factors.

=== Art ===
Parts of the shortgrass prairie are untouched and pastoral. Many artists and photographers travel to this prairie for inspiration and economic opportunities. Paintings and photographs are often sold at high prices for their aesthetic beauty. The Dust Bowl brought a lot of artistic and photographers to this area in seek of fame and economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kansaspress.ku.edu/subjects/art-architecture-and-photography/978-0-7006-1622-0.html|title=The Nature of Kansas Lands - Art, Architecture, and Photography - Subjects|website=kansaspress.ku.edu|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boundaries ==
The shortgrass prairie is located on the western side of the [[Great Plains]] with the [[Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]] to its west and the mixed grass prairie to its east. However, it is pretty much impossible to define exact boundaries of the prairie. This is due to the shifting of plant communities over time and space because of the dynamics of grassland vegetation. So, the prairie extends to the eastern part of the Rocky Mountains to the west, up to [[Canada]] to the North, as far as [[Nebraska]] to the East, and as far as parts of [[Texas]] to the South. Those are just the general boundaries of the shortgrass prairie which is everything inside those said boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tarleton.edu/departments/range/Grasslands/Shortgrass%20Prairie/shortgrassprairie.html|title=Grassland Slides|website=www.tarleton.edu|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
In [[Colorado]], which contains a substantial portion of the shortgrass prairie biome, no legal ecosystem protection exists. More than 85% of prairie is privately owned and used for agriculture, particularly for dry land [[wheat]], [[Maize|irrigated corn]], [[soybean]]s and [[alfalfa]].  Roughly half of the original prairie extent is still present, however conservation in the long run is uncertain. Urban expansion is likely to continue having an impact. [[Climate change]] has less of an effect here than in other areas of Colorado due to the lower elevation, but can still be expected to affect the biome.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landscope.org/colorado/ecosystems/featured_ecosystems/iconic_ecosystems/Shortgrass%20Prairie/|title=Shortgrass Prairie|website=LandScope America|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prairie Dog Coalition ===
The Prairie Dog Coalition is a non- profit group of scientists, organizations and citizens who are fighting for the protection of [[prairie dog]]s and their environments. The alliance educates people on the declining populations of prairie dogs and engages with projects likely to destroy prairie dog habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/about/departments/prairie_dog_coalition/about-the-prairie-dog-coalition.html?credit=web_id271877979|title=About the Prairie Dog Coalition: The Humane Society of the United States|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecosystem ==
The shortgrass prairie was once filled with huge herds of free-ranging [[bison]] and [[pronghorn]]. The prairie also teemed with large prairie dog colonies, [[deer]] and [[elk]], and predators such as [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] and [[grizzly bear]]s. The prairie is home to healthy populations of plains [[Bouteloua gracilis|blue grama]], a vast array of [[songbird]]s and raptors, carpets of buffalo grass and a broad diversity and abundance of [[wildflower]]s and [[Butterfly|butterflies]]. It was a landscape so teeming with life it has been compared to the South American [[Pampas]]. Today the most popular animal on the prairie is domestic cattle. The short grass prairie is used to having animals graze the land, so the pressure of grazing animals does not harm it. Pronghorn and prairie dogs still inhibit the prairie however, in fewer numbers. Top predators have been replaced by [[Coyote|coyotes.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildearthguardians.org/support_docs/factsheet_ecosystem_short-grass-prairie.pdf|title=Shortgrass Prairie Ecosystem Protection|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological processes on a large-scale level such as climate, fire and grazing have strong influences in this system. Today, the shortgrass prairie has suffered the greatest biological destruction of any major [[biome]] in North America. The three central processes historically shaping the shortgrass prairie are herbivory, drought, and fire. Through habitat destruction, extermination of native herbivores and predators, proliferation of noxious weeds, and altered fire regimes have negatively been impacted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Fauna ==
The short grass prairie consists of many kinds of birds, reptiles and mammals. Most of these animals have adapted to living in such an open area, many having adapted to living under ground or traveling long distances to find shelter. 
===Birds===
Grassland birds are part of the fastest decreasing groups of animals in North America. Grassland birds that reside in the short grass prairie add to this decrease by being Colorado’s largest category of declining animals. Some of birds that still inhabit the short grass prairie are the [[Cassin's sparrow]], [[loggerhead shrike]], [[sandhill crane]], [[scaled quail]], [[Swainson's hawk]], [[burrowing owl]], [[mountain plover]] and [[McCown's longspur]]. Although the loggerhead shrike and scaled quail birds are among the more common birds to see in the short grass prairie, they are also some of the few who are on the fastest decline.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildlifedepartment.com/cwcs/ApprovedOKCWCSShortgrassPrairie.pdf|title=Shortgrass Prairie Region|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Reptiles===
Round-tailed horned lizard, [[Texas garter snake]], [[Texas horned lizard]], [[Rhinocheilus lecontei tessellatus|Texas long-nosed snake]] and [[Sistrurus catenatus tergeminus|Western Massasauga]] are among the most dominant reptiles in the short grass prairie. Most of these animals are cold blooded, so in the winter months they live under ground until spring comes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
===Mammals===
[[File:Mom and Calf (4819440992).jpg|thumb|Mother and calf grazing on the prairie.]]
Cattle, [[pronghorn]] and [[white-tailed deer]] are the most abundant mammals on the short grass prairie today. Domestic cattle were placed in the prairie and have essentially replaced the native species that used to live in the short grass prairie such as bison and elk. In addition, the top predators used to be [[Gray wolf]] and [[Grizzly bear]], but today, [[coyote]]s have replaced those animals. 
====Prairie dogs====
Prairie dogs were once the most abundant animals in the short grass prairie, living in colonies across a range that historically spanned 11 states.  Presently, prairie dogs are found in 1 percent of their former range. The decrease has been driven by poisoning campaigns, habitat disruption, and hunting. The decline in prairie dogs has significantly impacted many of the other animals that reside in the short grass prairie, including the [[black-footed ferret]], whose diet relies on prairie dogs. Other animals negatively affected by the decline of prairie dogs are the [[mountain plover]], [[swift fox]], [[ferruginous hawk]] and the burrowing owl.

==Flora==
[[File:Shortgrass pano Petrified Forest NP.jpg|thumb|Shortgrass Prairie]]
The short grass prairie consists of different varieties of vegetation.  Notably abundant grasses are [[Bouteloua gracilis|blue grama]], sod- forming grass, and [[buffalo grass]]. Less prevalent is [[Hilaria (plant)|galleta]] grass. These grasses are native to the short grass prairie and therefor are drought and grazing resistant. Not many plant varieties appear in short grass prairies owing to its extreme changes in annual precipitation and temperature from one year to the next. Two of the main plants that are able to thrive are [[Yucca glauca|soap weed yucca]] and plains [[prickly pear cactus]]. In the years of greater precipitation, otherwise dormant wildflowers bloom in the spring, quickly diminishing in the hotter and drier summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/randal/pr%20ecol%20pdf%20outlines/Short-grass%20prairie.pdf|title=The Short-Grass Prairie|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South Pacific garbage patch''' is an area of elevated levels of [[marine debris]] and plastic particle pollution, most of which is concentrated within the ocean's [[pelagic zone]]. It is located within the [[South Pacific Gyre]], which itself spans from waters east of [[Australia]] to the [[South America]]n continent, as far north as the [[Equator]], and south until reaching the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Pacific Gyre - Correntes Oceânicas|publisher=Google Sites|url=https://sites.google.com/site/correntesoceanica/ocean-currents/ocean-gyres/south-pacific-gyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of plastics in the ocean also leads to a rise in the level of toxins in the area.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Carolyn|title=Plastic Breaks Down in Ocean, After All -- And Fast|publisher=National Geographic, National Geographic Society|date=20 August 2009|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090820-plastic-decomposes-oceans-seas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This garbage patch is the most recently discovered having only been confirmed in mid-2017. The South Pacific garbage patch has been compared in nature to the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]'s state in 2007, making the former ten years younger. The garbage patch is impossible to detect using satellites, or other visual means as most particles are smaller than a grain of rice.

==Discovery==
Evidence pointing to the existence of a garbage patch in the South Pacific gyre was discovered in early 2011 and its existence was confirmed in mid-2017. The discovery was made after a research voyage made by the [[5 Gyres]] Institute, led by Executive Director Dr. Marcus Erikson. This voyage marked the first time the South Pacific gyre had been sampled for plastic pollution. From March to April 2011, following a route based on a model of ocean currents developed by Nikolia Maximenko of the [[University of Hawaii]], which predicts floating debris accumulation zones. The expedition started taking samples off the coast of [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], [[Chile]], and began working its way west, collecting a new sample each 50 nautical miles, reaching the waters off [[Easter Island]], and eventually [[Pitcairn Island]].&lt;ref name="Spear"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spear|first=Stefanie|title=New Garbage Patch Discovered in the South Pacific Gyre|publisher=EcoWatch|date=9 August 2016|url=http://www.ecowatch.com/new-garbage-patch-discovered-in-the-south-pacific-gyre-1881688250.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second water sampling voyage departing from [[Long Beach, California]], launching November 2, 2016, and lasting approximately six months, was led by Oceanographer and Captain [[Charles J. Moore]], and a team of volunteer researchers from Algalita Marine Research and Education, an organization which he founded.&lt;ref name="twn"&gt;{{cite web|work=Inc., Pelmorex Weather Networks|title=South Pacific Ocean Gyre Holds Massive Garbage Patch|publisher=The Weather Network|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/ocean-pacific-gyre-pollution-garbage-patch/84565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon departure the vessel began its journey south along the [[Baja California peninsula]] and on to the [[Galapagos Islands]], continuing southwest on to Easter Island. After departing Easter Island the crew then headed eastward to the [[Juan Fernandez Islands]], after which it continued north following the coast of Chile, with stopping points at [[Antofagasta, Chile]], and [[Arica, Chile]], before heading further out to sea for its return journey to Long Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016-2017 South Pacific Expedition|publisher=Google Maps, Google|url=https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1NOK30jHLS82B8cWic_k-OQxR7sQ&amp;ll=33.76328127037614%2C-121.17901643603517&amp;z=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition, concentration and size==
During the 5 Gyres expedition, 48 samples were taken from a 2,424 nautical sweep. The researchers found an increase in plastic pollution density, averaging 26,898 particles per square kilometer, but spiking at up to 396,342 particles per square kilometer, peaking near the center of the predicted accumulation zone,&lt;ref name="Spear" /&gt; with some estimates as high as one million particles per square kilometer.&lt;ref name="ResearchGate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists Confirm the Existence of Another Ocean Garbage Patch|publisher=ResearchGate|date=19 July 2017|url=https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/scientists-confirm-the-existence-of-another-ocean-garbage-patch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the garbage patch consists mainly of [[microbead]]s, tiny abrasives less than 5 micrometers in size usually found in certain personal hygiene products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Ada|title=Newly Discovered Garbage Patch in the South Pacific Is 1.5 Times the Size of Texas, Study Says|publisher=The Weather Channel|website=Weather.com|date=27 July 2017|url=http://weather.com/science/environment/news/garbage-patch-south-pacific-ocean-discovery-plastic-microplastic-pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt; microscopic fibers from washing clothes,&lt;ref name="Pierre-Louis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierre-Louis|first=Kendra|title=Guess How Many Giant Patches of Garbage There Are in the Ocean Now?|publisher=Popular Science|date=21 July 2017|url=http://www.popsci.com/south-pacific-garbage-patch#page-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; fishing debris from southern hemisphere fishermen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massive South Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch 'A Dead Place'|publisher=Pacific Islands Report|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=14 August 2017|url=http://www.pireport.org/articles/2017/07/24/massive-south-pacific-ocean-garbage-patch-%E2%80%98-dead-place%E2%80%99}}&lt;/ref&gt; and microscopic fragments of larger pieces which have been broken down in the ocean.&lt;ref name="Pierre-Louis" /&gt;

The elevated levels of pollutants can be detected over a vast area estimated to be 2.6 million square kilometers (one million square miles), or about 1.5 times the size of [[Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nield|first=David|title=There's Another Huge Plastic Garbage Patch in The Pacific Ocean|publisher=ScienceAlert|website=Sciencealert.com|date=25 July 2017|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-found-another-huge-plastic-garbage-patch-in-the-pacific-ocean}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the debris found along a nearly 2,500 nautical mile straight line route.&lt;ref name="ResearchGate" /&gt;

==Effects on marine life and the ocean==
As the plastic particles are primarily found in the pelagic layer of the ocean they experience high levels of [[Photodegradation]], which causes the plastics to break down into ever smaller pieces. These pieces eventually become so small that even [[microorganism]]s can ingest and metabolize them converting these plastics into [[carbon dioxide]]. In some instances these [[microplastics]] absorb directly into a microorganisms' biomolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Plastic Photodegradation?|publisher=Pollution Solutions Online|date=19 August 2015|url=http://www.pollutionsolutions-online.com/news/waste-management/21/breaking-news/what-is-plastic-photodegradation/35801}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before reaching this state any number of organisms could potentially interact with these plastics. During their expedition in 2016-17, Charles Moore and Algalita found that more than 35% of south Pacific [[Lanternfish]] had consumed plastic particles. When ingested by the fish the chemical compounds found in these plastics cannot be digested. This can effect Humans as the Lanternfish is a food source for both [[salmon]] and [[tuna]].&lt;ref name="twn" /&gt; In their PNAS journal, Dr Van Sebille and his colleagues report data showing that in 1960 less than 5% of seabirds were found to have consumed waste material, while as of August 2015 that figure climbed to about 90%. It is predicted that by 2050, 99%of seabirds will have consumed such materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Seabirds 'Blighted by Plastic Waste'|publisher=BBC News|date=31 August 2015|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34108017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists studying the stomach contents of [[Laysan Albatross]] chicks report a 40% mortality rate before fledgling. When the stomach contents were analyzed following necropsies, they were found to contain plastic waste. Not only do plastic pellets used in manufacturing worldwide absorb toxic chemicals such as [[DDT]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] from the  water, but can even leach chemicals such as [[biphenyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Plastics Affect Birds|publisher=International Bird Rescue|url=http://www.bird-rescue.org/our-work/research-and-education/how-plastics-affect-birds.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that up to 267 marine species are affected by plastic pollution.&lt;ref name="natgeo" /&gt;

Researchers led by chemist Katsuhiko Saido, a graduate from [[Nihon University]]'s College of Pharmacy in Japan have collected seawater samples worldwide, including from waters of the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[India]], and [[Europe]]. All samples collected were found to contain [[polystyrene]] derivatives. Polystyrene is a plastic found in [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]] and many household and consumer goods. The scientists then simulated the decomposition of polystyrene in the open ocean. The results of this simulation showed that polystyrene, which begins breaking down at temperatures of 86° and higher. As it does so it breaks down into harmful chemicals, such as [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA), which can cause reproductive harm in animals, [[styrene monomer]], a suspected [[carcinogen]], and styrene trimer, a by-product of polystyrene.&lt;ref name="natgeo" /&gt;

One study shows estimates of 5.25 trillion individual pieces of microplastcs, weighing nearly 267,000 tons are currently floating in our oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eriksen|first=Marcus, et al|title=Plastic Pollution in the World's Oceans: More than 5 Trillion Plastic Pieces Weighing over 250,000 Tons Afloat at Sea|publisher=PLOS ONE, Public Library of Science|date=10 December 2014|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0111913#s1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that since being invented, 8.3 billion tons of plastics has been produced, with 80% (6.64 billion tons) being dumped in landfills, on land, and in the oceans. Plastic particles don't biodegrade or break down and instead just fragment into smaller pieces.&lt;ref name="Pierre-Louis" /&gt; If current trends in the amount of plastics flowing into our oceans continues, combined with [[overfishing]], will result in plastics outweighing fish in the oceans by 2050.&lt;ref name="Ronson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ronson|first=Jacqueline|title=The South Pacific Garbage Patch Has Emerged|publisher=Inverse Science|date=21 July 2017|url=http://www.inverse.com/article/34518-south-pacific-garbage-patch-plastic-microplastic-fish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3177">The term '''State of the Environment''' normally relates to an analysis of trends in the [[Natural environment|environment]] of a particular place. This analysis can encompass aspects such as [[water quality]], [[air quality]], [[land use]], [[ecosystem]] health and function, along with social and cultural matters.

== Pressure-State-Response Framework ==

Human activity places pressure on many aspects of the environment. For instance, deforestation results in the invasion of weed species, [[habitat destruction|habitat displacement]], and, when undertaken on a large scale, adversely affects air quality and [[CO2 sequestration|carbon dioxide sequestration]].

Examples of pressures under the Pressure-State-Response ("PSR") framework include: pollutants discharged from factories, or draining into a river from the land; it could be the removal of forest from the land or [[over-harvesting]] by fishermen or hunters.&lt;ref name="mfe.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/ser/ser1997/html/chapter1.3.html Box 1.2: The Pressure-State-Response framework], Chapter One: Introduction, The State of New Zealand’s Environment 1997, Report Ref. ME612, Ministry for the Environment, Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this framework, only pressures introduced by human interaction with the environment are considered.  Natural pressures such as extreme weather are only considered in the context of human-induced [[climate change]] (i.e. [[global warming]]).

A "state" is the condition of the environment at a particular time. This is assessed by measuring various aspects of the atmosphere, air, water, land and organisms.&lt;ref name="mfe.govt.nz"/&gt;

'''Summer'''  is the [[hottest]] of the four [[temperate]] [[season]]s, falling after [[spring (season)|spring]] and before [[autumn]]. At the summer [[solstice]], the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to [[climate]], tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[winter]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa.

==Summer timing==
From an astronomical view, the [[equinox]]es and solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Sir Robert S|title=Elements of Astronomy|year=1900|publisher=The MacMillan Company|location=London|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNSHRDu98k0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=astronomy+%2Bmidwinter#v=snippet&amp;q=midwinter&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-4400-5323-8|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101175419/https://books.google.com/books?id=sNSHRDu98k0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=astronomy+%2Bmidwinter#v=snippet&amp;q=midwinter&amp;f=false|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heck|first=Andre|title=Organizations and strategies in Astronomy|volume=7|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-5300-2|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSsaxkeixH0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=astronomy+%2Bmidwinter#v=onepage&amp;q=astronomy%20%2Bmidwinter&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501221927/https://books.google.com/books?id=YSsaxkeixH0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=astronomy+%2Bmidwinter#v=onepage&amp;q=astronomy%20%2Bmidwinter&amp;f=false|archivedate=1 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice, the time of maximal [[insolation]], often identified with the 21st day of June or December. A variable [[seasonal lag]] means that the [[meteorology|meteorological]] center of the season, which is based on average temperature patterns, occurs several weeks after the time of maximal insolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cecil Adams |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/161/is-it-true-summer-in-ireland-starts-may-1 |title=Is it true summer in Ireland starts May 1? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=1983-03-11 |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830161742/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/161/is-it-true-summer-in-ireland-starts-may-1 |archivedate=30 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere and the months of December, January, and February in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Meteorological Glossary"&gt;{{cite book |publisher= HMSO|location= London |isbn= 0-11-400363-7|page= 260|title=Meteorological Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgs.org/OurWork/Schools/School+Members+Area/Ask+the+experts/Meteorological+forecasting.htm "Professor Paul Hardaker answers questions on meteorological forecasting"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202023116/http://www.rgs.org/OurWork/Schools/School+Members+Area/Ask+the+experts/Meteorological+forecasting.htm |date=2 February 2017 }}. [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; Under meteorological definitions, all seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning of a calendar month and end at the end of a month.&lt;ref name="Meteorological Glossary"/&gt; This meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of summer as the season with the longest (and warmest) days of the year, in which daylight predominates. The meteorological reckoning of seasons is used in [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Russia]] and [[Japan]]. It is also used by many in the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the summer months according to the national meteorological service, [[Met Éireann]], are June, July and August. However, according to the [[Irish Calendar]], summer begins on 1 May and ends on 1 August. School textbooks in Ireland follow the cultural norm of summer commencing on 1 May rather than the meteorological definition of 1 June.

Days continue to lengthen from equinox to solstice and summer days progressively shorten after the solstice, so meteorological summer encompasses the build-up to the longest day and a diminishing thereafter, with summer having many more hours of daylight than spring. Reckoning by hours of daylight alone, summer [[solstice]] marks the midpoint, not the beginning, of the seasons. [[Midsummer]] takes place over the shortest night of the year, which is the summer solstice, or on a nearby date that varies with tradition.

Where a [[seasonal lag]] of half a season or more is common, reckoning based on astronomical markers is shifted half a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Driscol|first1=D. M.|last2=Rice|first2=P.

Reckoning by cultural festivals, the summer season in the [[United States]] is traditionally regarded as beginning on [[Memorial Day weekend]] (the last Weekend in May) and ending on [[Labor Day]] (the first Monday in September) 1981, more closely in line with the meteorological definition for the parts of the country that have four-season weather. The similar [[Canada|Canadian]] tradition starts summer on [[Victoria Day]] one week prior (although summer conditions vary widely across Canada's expansive territory) and ends, as in the United States, on [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]].

In [[Chinese astronomy]], summer starts on or around 5 May, with the ''[[Jieqi|jiéqì]]'' ([[solar term]]) known as [[lixia|lìxià]] (立夏), i.e. "establishment of summer", and it ends on or around 6 August.

In southern and southeast Asia, where the [[monsoon]] occurs, summer is more generally defined as lasting from March, April, May and June, the warmest time of the year, ending with the onset of the monsoon [[rain]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In the Mediterranean regions, it is also associated with dry weather, while in other places (particularly in [[Eastern Asia]] because of the Monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the [[savanna climate]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin University]] (2009).

[[Thunderstorm]] season in the United States and Canada runs in the [[Spring (season)|spring]] through summer. These storms can produce [[hail]], strong winds and [[tornadoes]], usually during the afternoon and evening.

==Holidays==

===School breaks===
Schools and universities typically have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days. In almost all countries, children are out of school during this time of year for [[Summer vacation|summer break]], although dates vary. In the United States, public schools usually end in late May in [[Memorial Day]] weekend, while colleges finish in early May, although some schools get out on the last or second last Thursday in May. In [[England]] and [[Wales]], school ends in mid-July and resumes again in early September; in [[Scotland]], the summer holiday begins in late June and ends in mid- to late-August. Similarly, in [[Canada]] the summer holiday starts on the last or second-last Friday in June and ends in late August or on the first Monday of September, with the exception of when that date falls before [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]], in which case, ends on the second Monday of the month. In [[Russia]] the summer holiday begins at the end of May and ends on August 31. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], school summer holiday dates include the major holidays of [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day]]. School summer holidays in Australia, New Zealand and [[South Africa]] begin in early December and end in early February, with dates varying between states. In South Africa, the new school-year usually starts during the 2nd week of January, thus aligning the [[academic year]] with the [[Calendar year]]. In [[India]], school ends in late April and resumes in early or mid June. In [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]], schools usually finish for summer vacation in mid-July, and resume in the later weeks of September or the first week of October.

===Public holidays===
A wide range of public holidays fall during summer, including:
* [[Memorial Day]] (United States) or [[Victoria Day]] (Canada) through [[Labor Day]]
* [[Independence Day (Jordan)]] (25 May)
* [[Bank holiday]]s in the United Kingdom and Ireland
* [[Festa della Repubblica]], Italian [[national day]] and [[republic day]] (2 June)
* [[National Day of Sweden]] (6 June) and [[Midsummer]], sometimes referred to as the "alternative National Day"
* [[Canada Day]] (1 July)
* [[Independence Day (United States)]] (4 July)
* [[Bastille Day]], National Day of France (14 July)
* [[Belgian National Day]] (21 July)
* [[Ólavsøka]], [[Faroe Islands]] (29 July)
* [[Swiss National Day]] (1 August)
* [[Independence Day (Pakistan)]] (14 August)
* [[Independence Day (India)]] (15 August)
* [[Australia Day]] (26 January)

==Activities==
[[File:Atlantic Ocean shoreline in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.jpg|thumb|right|Hotels and tourists along the [[Atlantic Ocean]] shoreline in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] in summer]]
People generally take advantage of the high temperatures by spending more time outdoors during summer. Activities such as travelling to the [[beach]] and [[picnic]]s occur during the summer months. Sports such as [[association football]], [[basketball]], [[American football]], [[volleyball]], [[skateboarding]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]] and [[golf]] are played. [[Water sports]] also occur. These include [[water skiing]], [[wakeboarding]], [[human swimming|swimming]], [[surfing]], [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]] and [[water polo]]. The modern [[Olympics]] have been held during the summer months every four years since 1896. The [[2000 Summer Olympics]], in [[Sydney]], however, were held during the [[Australia]]n [[Spring (season)|Spring]].

Summer is normally a low point in [[television]] viewing, and television [[schedule]]s generally reflect this by not scheduling new episodes of their most popular shows between the end of May [[sweeps]] and the beginning of the television season in September, instead scheduling low-cost [[reality television]] shows and [[burning off]] commitments to already-cancelled series. There is an exception to this with children's television. Many television shows made for children and are popular with children are released during the summer months, especially on children's cable channels such as the [[Disney Channel]] in the [[United States]], as children are off school. Disney Channel, for example, ends its preschool programming earlier in the day for older school age children in the summer months while it reverts to the original scheduling as the new school year begins. Conversely, the music and film industries generally experience higher returns during the summer than other times of the year and market their summer hits accordingly. Summer is most popular for [[animated movies]] to be released theatrically in [[movie theaters]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

With most school-age children and college students (except those attending [[summer school]]) on summer vacation during the summer months, especially in the United States, travel and vacationing traditionally peaks during the summer, with the volume of travel in a typical summer weekend rivaled only by [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. Teenagers and college students often take [[seasonal industry|summer jobs]] in industries that cater to recreation. Business activity for the recreation, tourism, restaurant, and retail industries peak during the summer months as well as the holiday season.

:''"A single hair can determine a person's location during the past weeks or even years"'' – Thure E. Cerling{{Attribution needed|date=February 2011}}

Cerling's research interests are primarily focused on Earth surface [[geochemistry]] processes and on the geological record of ecological change.&lt;ref name=NAS /&gt; Particularly, working on [[conservation biology]], Cerling has analyzed the modern animal diet and physiology by using [[stable isotope]]s as natural [[Isotopic labeling|tracers]] as well as studying dietary changes of different mammalian lineages extending over millions of years.

Emphasizing continental ecologies of lakes and modern soils and ecosystems, Cerling has written extensievely about the evolution of ecosystems, the inception and strengthening of [[monsoon]]s, and the atmosphere over geological time scales through evidence gathered about the fractionation of stable istopes in these systems.

Current research work includes a focus on the development of landforms in semi-arid regions, the geology of Old World paleo-anthropologic sites and on contaminant migration in surface and ground waters, including the use of tritium and helium as hydrological tracers.

== Early life ==

Thure E. Cerling received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in geology and chemistry from [[Iowa State University]], in [[Ames, Iowa]], in 1972, and, in 1973, his [[Master of Science]] in geology from Iowa State. In 1977 he was awarded a Ph.D. in geology from the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. From 1977 to 1979 he worked as a research scientist at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] and, from 1979 he has been a member of the [[University of Utah]]'s faculty.

== Global ecological changes ==

With the publication of "Expansion of C4 ecosystems as an indicator of global ecological change in the late Miocene" in 1993, Cerling, helped by [[Yang Wang (scientist)|Yang Wang]] and [[Jay Quade]], made relevant studies relatively to carbon isotopes. Thanks to a deep analysis of palaeovegetation from palaeosols and palaeodiet measured in fossil tooth enamel, was demonstrated a global increase in the biomass of plants using C4 photosynthesis between 7 and 5 million years ago. The decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the history below a threshold that favored the C3-photosynthesizing plants was considered as a valid reason for the global expansion of C4 biomass.
The publication "Global vegetation change through the Miocene/Pliocene boundary" in 1997 confirmed these results, demonstrating even how at lower latitudes the change appeared to occur earlier because of the threshold for C3 photosynthesis is higher at warmer temperatures.

== Give me a hair and I'll tell you where you have been. ==

Thure Cerling and [[James Ehleringer]], a biology professor at the University of Utah, founded Isoforensics in 2003, a company with the aim of interpreting the stable isotope composition of various biological and synthetic materials. This was the first step for the discovery they made which was first published on February 25, 2008, by the "[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]" with the title "Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in human hair are related to geography".
To know where people have been and where they lived for a while are information that became available by analyzing the stable isotope composition of their scalp hair. Cerling discovered that a strand of hair could provide valuable clues about a person's travels by studying the variation of hydrogen-2 (δ2H) and oxygen-18 (δ18O) isotopes and comparing them to the ones in the drinking water. The extent of the information that can be deduced depends on the length of the hair: the longer is the hair, the greater is the extraction of information. The variation with geography of isotope concentrations is linked with precipitations, cloud temperatures and with the amount of water that evaporates from soil and plants. When clouds move off the ocean towards inland the ratios of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 and hydrogen-2 to hydrogen-1 tend to decrease because of the rain water with oxygen-18 and hydrogen-2, being heavier, tends to fall first.
Samples of tap water were collected from more than 600 cities across the United States as well as hair samples from the barbershops in 65 cities in 20 states. The comparison showed that both hair and drinking water samples had the same isotopic variations. In order to display these information, the scientists produced color-coded maps based on the correlation of the isotopes in hair to those in drinking water. This maps show how ratios of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in scalp hair vary in different areas of the United States. It was so proved that the water drank by a human being leaves in the hair an evidence which contain oxygen and hydrogen isotopes equal to the ones in the tap water.
This technique would have been a new tool for policemen, anthropologists, archaeologists and doctors.

== The elephant tail hair: how many things they can say! ==

Professor Cerling, helped by James Ehleringer and [[Christopher Remien]] (two University of Utah colleagues), [[George Wittemyer]] of Colorado State University and member of "Save the Elephants" in Nairobi, and [[Iain Douglas-Hamilton]], who founded the association "Save the Elephants", conducted a research around the [[Samburu National Reserve|Samburu]] and [[Buffalo Springs National Reserve|Buffalo Springs]] national reserves in northern Kenya analyzing carbon and other stable isotopes in elephant tail hair to discover where and what Victoria, Anastasia and Cleopatra, three daughters of a mother elephant named Queen Elizabeth, usually eat over a six-years period (2000–2006). In order to monitor their life, the elephants were equipped with a Global Positioning System that recorded their positions every hour for the whole research period. For getting the sample of tail hair, elephants were immobilized with drug-filled dart guns when necessary. Considering that the hair grows about an inch per month, a single hair contained isotopic information to diet during an 18-month period.

=== Wet and dry seasons: different responses ===

The analysis of ratios of carbon-13 to carbon-12 along the length of a single elephant hair led Cerling and his crew to understand the elephants' diet. During the wet season, after the grass had grown long enough for elephants to grab with their trunks, their tail hair showed the presence of different form of carbon, indicating a high amount of high-protein grass. On the other hand, during the dry season, the results obtained by the analysis of the hair pointed out how elephants had switched over to shrubs and trees.

=== Birth and Cattle ===

For what concern the Samburu-Buffalo Springs, five weeks after the rainy season had started, the grass became rich in nutrients and the females were most likely to conceive, giving birth 22 months later, just in time for another rainy season to provide nutrients to the grass they would have eaten: the cycle could restart.
The research also pointed out how developed is the competition between elephants and cattle: during the typical wet season diet of elephants, the overgrazing by cattle caused the grass to be very short, resulting in a limited access to it for elephants, out-competing them. This situation could have influenced the elephants' ability to bulk up for pregnancy.

=== Behavior ===

All these analyses pointed out even that there are some elephant families friendlier than others and showed how there are dominant families that settle down in the best places, where there is plenty of food and water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24442">In theory, [[solar energy]] has been used by humans as early as 7th century B.C. when our ancestors discovered how to light fires using glass as a magnifier.

Another early use for solar energy is in 1776, when [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|Horace de Saussure]], a swiss physicist, invented the first [[Solar cooker|solar oven]]. The solar oven used sunlight to heat meals and no electricity was required.

Later on, in the 19th century, it is observed that the sunlight striking certain materials generates detectable electric current. This discovery has laid the foundation of [[solar cell]]s. Solar cells have gone on to be used in many applications. They have historically been used in situations where electrical power from the grid was unavailable.

* In [[geochemistry]], a trace element is one whose concentration is less than 1000&amp;nbsp;ppm or 0.1[[%]] of a [[rock (geology)|rock]]'s composition. The term is used mainly in [[igneous petrology]]. Trace elements will be compatible with either a liquid or solid phase. If compatible with a [[mineral]], it will be incorporated into a solid phase (e.g., [[nickel]]'s compatibility with [[olivine]]). If it is incompatible with any existing mineral phase it will remain in the liquid [[magma]] phase. The measurement of this ratio is known as the partition coefficient. Trace elements can be substituted for network-forming ions in mineral structures. Trace elements that are not essential to a mineral's defined composition will not appear in the chemical formula of that mineral.

A.|title=Global Tectonics|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|pages=84–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these faults are hidden in the deep ocean, where they offset [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]] in short [[zigzag]]s resulting from [[seafloor spreading]], the best-known (and most destructive) being those on land at the margins of continental [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. A transform fault is the only type of [[Strike slip faults|strike-slip]] fault that is classified as a plate boundary.

==Nomenclature==

These faults are also known as  '''[[Conservation of mass|conservative]] plate boundaries,''' since they neither create nor destroy [[lithosphere]].

== Background ==

Geophysicist and geologist [[John Tuzo Wilson]] recognized that the offsets of [[oceanic ridges]] by faults do not follow the classical pattern of an offset fence or geological marker in [[Harry Fielding Reid|Reid's]] [[Elastic-rebound theory|rebound theory of faulting]],&lt;ref&gt;Reid, H.F., (1910). The Mechanics of the Earthquake. in The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906, Report of the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; from which the sense of slip is derived.  The new class of faults,&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.T. |last=Wilson |date=24 July 1965 |title=A new class of faults and their bearing on continental drift|journal=Nature |volume=207 |issue=4995 |pages=343–347 |doi=10.1038/207343a0 |bibcode = 1965Natur.207..343W }}&lt;/ref&gt; called transform faults, produce slip in the opposite direction from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature.  Slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates; the distance remains constant in [[earthquakes]] because the ridges are spreading centers.  This [[hypothesis]] was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on transform faults points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, L.R. (1967). Mechanism of earthquakes and nature of faulting on the mid-oceanic ridges, Journal of Geophysical Research, 72, 5–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transform faults are closely related to transcurrent faults and are commonly confused. Both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement; nevertheless, transform faults end at the junction of another plate boundary or fault type, while transcurrent faults die out without a junction.  In addition, transform faults have equal deformation across the entire fault line, while transcurrent faults have greater displacement in the middle of the fault zone and less on the margins.  Finally, transform faults can form a tectonic plate boundary, while transcurrent faults cannot.

==Mechanics==

The effect of a fault is to relieve [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], which can be caused by [[Compression (physics)|compression]], extension, or [[Lateral strain|lateral stress]] in the rock layers at the surface or deep in the Earth's subsurface.  Transform faults specifically relieve strain by transporting the strain between ridges or subduction zones. They also act as the plane of weakness, which may result in splitting in [[rift zone]]s.

==Examples==

Transform faults are commonly found linking segments of [[mid-oceanic ridge]]s or spreading centres.   These mid-oceanic ridges are where new seafloor is constantly created through the [[upwelling]] of new [[basaltic]] [[magma]].  With new seafloor being pushed and pulled out, the older seafloor slowly slides away from the mid-oceanic ridges toward the continents.  Although separated only by tens of kilometers, this separation between segments of the ridges causes portions of the seafloor to push past each other in opposing directions.   This lateral movement of seafloors past each other is where transform faults are currently active.  
[[File:Spreading center and strips.png|thumb|300px|Spreading center and strips]]

Transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge.   Instead of the ridges moving away from each other, as they do in other strike-slip faults, transform-fault ridges remain in the same, fixed locations, and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge. Evidence of this motion can be found in paleomagnetic striping on the seafloor.

A paper written by Gerya{{who|date=November 2017}} theorizes that the creation of the transform faults between the ridges of the mid-oceanic ridge is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the mid-oceanic ridge.&lt;ref name=Gerya&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerya|first=T.|title=Dynamical Instability Produces Transform Faults at Mid-Ocean Ridges|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=329|issue=5995|pages=1047–1050| doi = 10.1126/science.1191349 |bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1047G|pmid=20798313}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs over a long period of time with the spreading center or ridge slowly deforming from a straight line to a curved line. Finally, fracturing along these planes forms transform faults. As this takes place, the fault changes from a normal fault with extensional stress to a strike slip fault with lateral stress.&lt;ref name=Bonatti&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bonatti, Enrico|author2=Crane, Kathleen|title=Oceanic Fracture Zones|journal=Scientific American|year=1984|volume=5|issue=5|pages=40–52|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0584-40|bibcode=1984SciAm.250e..40B}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study done by Bonatti and Crane,{{who|date=November 2017}} [[peridotite]] and [[gabbro]] rocks were discovered in the edges of the transform ridges.  These rocks are created deep inside the Earth's mantle and then rapidly exhumed to the surface.&lt;ref name=Bonatti/&gt;  This evidence helps to prove that new seafloor is being created at the mid-oceanic ridges and further supports the theory of plate tectonics.

Active transform faults are between two tectonic structures or faults.  [[Fracture zone]]s represent the previously active transform-fault lines, which have since passed the active transform zone and are being pushed toward the continents.  These elevated ridges on the ocean floor can be traced for hundreds of miles and in some cases even from one continent across an ocean to the other continent.

The most prominent examples of the mid-oceanic ridge transform zones are in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[South America]] and [[Africa]].  Known as the St. Paul, [[Romanche Trench|Romanche]], Chain, and Ascension fracture zones, these areas have deep, easily identifiable transform faults and ridges.  Other locations include: the East Pacific Ridge located in the South Eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], which meets up with [[San Andreas Fault]] to the North.

Transform faults are not limited to oceanic crust and spreading centers; many of them are on [[continental margin]]s.  The best example is the [[San Andreas Fault]] on the Pacific coast of the United States.  The San Andreas Fault links the  [[East Pacific Rise]] off the West coast of Mexico (Gulf of California) to the [[Mendocino Triple Junction]] (Part of the [[Juan de Fuca plate]]) off the coast of the [[Northwestern United States]], making it a ridge-to-transform-style fault.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;  The formation of the San Andreas Fault system occurred fairly recently during the [[Oligocene]] Period between 34 million and 24 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Atwater&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atwater|first=Tanya|authorlink=Tanya Atwater|title= Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America |journal=Bulletin of the Geological Society of America|year=1970|volume=81|issue=12|pages=3513–3536|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1970)81[3513:ioptft]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the [[Farallon plate]], followed by the Pacific plate, collided into the [[North American plate]].&lt;ref name=Atwater/&gt;  The collision led to the subduction of the Farallon plate underneath the North American plate.  Once the spreading center separating the Pacific and the Farallon plates was subducted beneath the North American plate, the San Andreas Continental Transform-Fault system was created.&lt;ref name=Atwater/&gt;

==Types==

In his work on transform-fault systems, geologist Tuzo Wilson  said that transform faults must be connected to other faults or tectonic-plate boundaries on both ends; because of that requirement, transform faults can grow in length, keep a constant length, or decrease in length.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;  These length changes are dependent on which type of fault or tectonic structure connect with the transform fault. Wilson described six types of transform faults:

''Growing length:''  In situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked, the transform fault itself will grow in length.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

[[File:Spreading to upper NEW.svg|Spreading to upper NEW]]  [[File:Upper to upper.svg|Upper to upper]]

''Constant length:'' In other cases, transform faults will remain at a constant length.  This steadiness can be attributed to many different causes.  In the case of ridge-to-ridge transforms, the constancy is caused by the continuous growth by both ridges outward, canceling any change in length.  The opposite occurs when a ridge linked to a subducting plate, where all the lithosphere (new sea floor) being created by the ridge is subducted, or swallowed up, by the subduction zone.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;  Finally, when two upper subduction plates are linked there is no change in length. This is due to the plates moving parallel with each other and no new lithosphere is being created to change that length.

Decreasing length faults: In rare cases, transform faults can shrink in length.  These occur when two descending subduction plates are linked by a transform fault.  In time as the plates are subducted, the transform fault will decrease in length until the transform fault disappears completely, leaving only two subduction zones facing in opposite directions.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">'''Vladimir Petrovich Alganov''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Петрович Алганов}}; born 22 October 1952 in [[Leningrad]]) is a Russian spy. He was Soviet [[KGB]] officer in Warsaw, Poland in the 1980s and Russian [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] officer in the same city in the 1990s.

In 1996, Poland's Prime Minister [[Józef Oleksy]] resigned because of his links to Alganov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Polish PM forced to resign over links with KGB man | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/polish-pm-forced-to-resign-over-links-with-kgb-man-1325658.html | date=25 January 1996 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alganov was deported from Poland in 1997.&lt;ref name="stealthroute"/&gt;

In 2005 Lithuanian authorities said that Alganov had been issued a long-term Lithuanian visa in 2002 and Alganov had met managers of the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chronicle of Russian Espionage in the Baltic Countries | publisher = Axis Globe | url = http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=49 | date = 2005-04-20 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070914005458/http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=49 | archive-date = 2007-09-14 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Baltic News (2005/01) | publisher = Baltics Worldwide | url = http://www.balticsworldwide.com/baltic-news-200501/ | date=January 2005 | accessdate = 2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Alganov secretly met [[Jan Kulczyk]] in a restaurant in Vienna, Austria. The conversation was recorded by Polish intelligence officers. According to [[Antoni Macierewicz]], a member of the investigative board:
* Alganov offered Kulczyk $5 million to influence Poland's then-President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]].&lt;ref name="stealthroute"/&gt;
* Alganov said that six months earlier, Russians had paid $1m to the Minister of Finance [[Wiesław Kaczmarek]] for the Russian company [[Lukoil]] to win the privatization tender for a refinery in Gdansk.&lt;ref name="stealthroute"&gt;{{cite news | title = From Poland to Hungary, Gazprom takes stealth route to domination | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/from-poland-to-hungary-gazprom-takes-stealth-route-to-domination-522003.html | date=8 January 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | location=London | first=Neil | last=Barnett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Oil scandal rocks Polish leadership - Some fear Moscow gaining influence | publisher = The Boston Globe | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/12/05/oil_scandal_rocks_polish_leadership/ | date=2004-12-05 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Fleishman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/moynihan/programs/ces/pcconfpdfs/Kennedy.pdf The cultural politics of military alliances and energy security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317092815/http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/moynihan/programs/ces/pcconfpdfs/Kennedy.pdf |date=2007-03-17 }}.

The '''Yozgat Pine Grove National Park''' ({{lang-tr|Yozgat Çamlığı Millî Parkı}}),  is a [[national park]] consisting of [[pine]] trees in [[Yozgat]], [[Central Anatolia Region]] of [[Turkey]]. It was established on February 5, 1958 as the country's first national park.&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://webarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/2004/09/23/526395.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Asırlık ağaçlara koruma |date=2004-09-23 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park, a forest island on hills within wide [[steppe]]s in the region, covers an area of {{convert|264|ha|sqmi|abbr=on}} and its average elevation is {{convert|1360|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Yozgat Pine Grove National Park is administered by the Directorate-General of Forestry, a governmental agency of the [[Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs (Turkey)|Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs]]. The [[species]] of pine trees within the national park are found only in the higher elevations of [[Caucasus Mountains]]. According to Ali Şimşek, the director of the park, the trees, between 350 and 500 years old, are under protection. Some of the trees are tagged with their age on them.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ktb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/belge/1-20891/eski2yeni.html |publisher=Kültür ve Turizm Bakanlığı |title=Yozgat - Yozgat Çamlığı Milli Parkı  |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national park is located {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the city Yozgat. It is a popular recreational area for the residents of the city. The park has various facilities for visitors like a three-star hotel, [[campsite]], restaurant, cafeteria and [[playground]].&lt;ref name="ktb"/&gt;

'''Zenith Star''' was a [[Directed-energy weapon]] that started development as part of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1987/11/15/and-then-there-was-zenith-star/cf875056-1a8c-4a9f-b58d-22fd685da502/ AND THEN THERE WAS ZENITH STAR. 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

It included the [[Alpha laser]], a high energy [[Hydrogen fluoride laser|hydrogen fluoride chemical laser]], and the [[Large Advanced Mirror Program|LAMP mirror]] which was a 7 segment [[adaptive optics]] mirror.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1987/eirv14n50-19871218/eirv14n50-19871218_024-zenith_star_an_sdi_demonstration.pdf ''Zenith Star: An SDI demonstration'' 1987] 2 pages, with 3 photos&lt;/ref&gt;

Zenith Star was never put in orbit, but the [[Alpha LAMP Integration]] (ALI) project carried out some ground-based tests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xYo_QIzD_kMC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22Alpha+LAMP+integration%22+ALI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtj6nesL7aAhVjIsAKHSE7BQ4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alpha%20LAMP%20integration%22%20ALI&amp;f=false ''Adaptive Optics Engineering Handbook'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}}
