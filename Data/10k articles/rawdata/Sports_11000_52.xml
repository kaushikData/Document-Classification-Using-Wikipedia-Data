==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1756 — Bill "The Nailer " Stevens defeated a number of unnamed opponents until 1759.&lt;ref name=BS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/stevens-williams.htm |title=Bill Stevens |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1757 — George Taylor defeated [[Tom Faulkner]] twice.&lt;ref name=GT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/taylor-george.htm |title=George Taylor |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6 August 1758 — Faulkner defeated Taylor in the 26th round after 1 hour 15 minutes of a fight at [[St. Alban's]]. Faulkner claimed the title after the bout.&lt;ref name=GT/&gt;
* 20 October 1759 — Jack Slack v Jack Moreton at [[Acton, London|Acton Wells]]. Slack won after 35 minutes.&lt;ref name=JS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/slack-jack.htm |title=Jack Slack |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 19 February 1760 — Bill " The Nailer " Stevens defeated Jacob Taplin in 13 round fight lasting 30 minutes at Marylebone Basin.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt; 
* 17 June 1760 — Jack Slack was defeated by Bill "The Nailer" Stevens in the fourth round of a fight lasting 27 minutes; Slack retired from the ring soon afterwards to open a shop on Chandos Street, London. He lived there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=JS/&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* 1756 — Hambledon, almost certainly a local parish organisation at this time, played three matches against the prominent [[Dartford Cricket Club]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* 1757–1760 — Perhaps for the first time, cricket felt the full impact of a major war as it suffered a drain in manpower and investment during the [[Seven Years' War]] (to 1763); few first-class matches were recorded with none at all in 1760.{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* September 1759 — Three [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] v [[Non-international England cricket teams|Rest of England]] matches were played, a number of well-known names being involved; Dartford won the "series" 2–1.{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* c.1760 — It is about this time that [[pitched delivery bowling]] began; in turn, it necessitated the creation and deployment of the modern straight [[cricket bat|bat]], replacing the old "hockey stick" type which could not cope with a ball that bounced.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==[[Golf]]==
'''Events'''
* 1758 — First codified ''Rules of Golf'' published by the St Andrews Golfers, later the [[Royal and Ancient Golf Club]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1758 — The Society of Sportsmen of the [[Curragh]], a precursor of the [[Irish Turf Club]] was formed.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

The '''ARGH Power Ratings''' are a [[sports rating system]] created by Stewart Huckaby in 1990 and designed to identify the best team from within a closed system. They are most closely identified with [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college football|football]]. The system is designed to be both [[prediction|predictive]] and [[retrodiction|retrodictive]] in nature, although in practice it has proven to be more strongly predictive than retrodictive.

The ARGH Power Ratings evaluate teams taking into account a team's wins and losses, its points scored both for and against, its schedule, and the location of the team's games. It is unusual in that for the purposes of providing meaningful ratings throughout the season it seeds teams based on several stated criteria, including records from the previous two seasons, the previous year's strength of schedule, the number of returning starters, whether the head coach is returning, whether the starting [[quarterback]] is returning, and published recruiting rankings from several preseason publications. Preseason seedings disappear over the course of the season, and are completely absent from consideration by the time the season ends.

This system is also sometimes used for NCAA [[College Basketball|basketball]], but due to the relative lack of available preseason information, ARGH basketball power ratings are strictly retrodictive in nature.

}}
'''Castling''' is a move in the game of [[chess]] involving a player's [[king (chess)|king]] and either of the player's original [[rook (chess)|rooks]]. It is the only move in chess in which a player moves two pieces in the same move, and it is the only move aside from the [[knight (chess)|knight]]'s move where a piece can be said to "jump over" another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pandolfini |first=Bruce |year=1992 |title=Pandolfini's Chess Complete: The Most Comprehensive Guide to the Game, from History to Strategy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDup8NHQ8AC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=castling+jump+over&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NFrUUrP8PIex2wX_kIFw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=castling%20jump%20over&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn= 9780671701864 |accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first {{chessgloss|rank}}, then moving the rook to the square over which the king crossed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=124&amp;view=article |title=Laws of Chess |publisher=[[FIDE]]}} (Castling is in rule 3.8)&lt;/ref&gt; Castling may only be done if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in [[check (chess)|check]], and the king does not cross over or end on a square in which it would be in check. Castling is one of the [[rules of chess]] and is technically a king move {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=71}}.

The [[chess notation|notation]] for castling, in both the [[Descriptive chess notation|descriptive]] and the [[Algebraic chess notation|algebraic]] systems, is 0-0 with the {{chessgloss|kingside}} rook and 0-0-0 with the {{chessgloss|queenside}} rook; in [[Portable Game Notation|PGN]], O-O and O-O-O are used instead. Castling on the kingside is sometimes called ''castling short'' and castling on the queenside is called ''castling long''&amp;nbsp;– the difference based on whether the rook moves a short distance (two squares) or a long distance (three squares) {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.

Castling was added to European chess in the 14th or 15th century and did not develop into its present form until the 17th century. The Asian versions of chess do not have such a move.

Castling is permissible provided all of the following conditions hold {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=19}}:
# The king and the chosen rook are on the player's first {{chessgloss|rank}}.&lt;ref&gt;Without this additional restriction, which was added to the FIDE rules in 1972, it would be possible to promote a pawn on the ''e'' {{chessgloss|file}} to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was "discovered" by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabbé]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the rules were amended to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabbé, see also [[:de:Pam-Krabbé-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Neither the king nor the chosen rook has previously moved.
# There are no pieces between the king and the chosen rook.
# The king is not currently in [[check (chess)|check]].
# The king does not pass through a square that is attacked by an enemy piece.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=124&amp;view=article Laws of Chess: For competitions starting before 1 July 2014]". ''World Chess Federation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The king does not end up in check. (True of any legal move.)

Conditions 4 through 6 can be summarized with the more [[mnemonic device|memorable]] phrase: ''One may not castle out of, through, or into check.''

It is a common misperception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=article |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFlLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=castling+rules+confusion&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22considerable+confusion%22 |magazine=[[Chess Review]] |date=1961 |volume=29 |page=298 |access-date=2018-10-30 |quote=on castling, considerable confusion often reigns among beginners }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the requirements for castling are even more stringent than the above. To clarify:

* The chosen rook may be under attack.
* The rook may move through an attacked square, provided the king does not.  The only such square is the one adjacent to the rook, when castling queenside.
* The king may have been in check earlier in the game (provided the king did not move when resolving the check).

In [[chess handicap|handicap]] games where odds of a rook are given, the player giving odds may still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.&lt;ref name="Abrahams"&gt;

==Strategy==
{{See also|Chess opening|}}

Castling is an important goal in the [[Chess opening|opening]], because it serves two valuable purposes: it moves the king into a safer position away from the center of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board (it is even possible to [[checkmate]] with castling).

The choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook.  Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a-{{chessgloss|file}} is undefended;  the king is thus often moved to the b-file to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling.  On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently&amp;nbsp;– on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] may be required to move the rook to a more efficient square.

It is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside.  If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called ''opposite'' (or ''opposite-side'') ''castling''. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight as both players' pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. An example is the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack, 9.Bc4|Yugoslav Attack]], in the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]].

If the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center.  When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called ''[[artificial castling]]'', or ''castling by hand''.

==Tournament rules==
{{See also|Rules of chess|Touch-move rule}}

Under the strict [[touch-move rule]]s enforced in most [[chess tournament|tournaments]], castling is considered a king move.  However, under current [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to perform castling, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to first move the king. As usual, the player's mind may change between all legal destination squares for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player has formally chosen to castle (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly.  A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side.  If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does ''not'' apply to the rook {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13–14,17–18,23}}.

It is also required by the official rules that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13–14,17–18,23}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hartston]] notes in ''Teach Yourself Chess'' that "most chess players refrain from demonstrations of ambidexterity."&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to castle must be the same in all three positions for a valid [[draw (chess)|draw]] claim under the [[threefold repetition]] rule.

==Chess variants and problems==
Some [[chess variant]]s, for example [[Chess960]], have modified castling rules to handle modified starting positions. Castling can also be adapted to large chess variants, like [[Capablanca Chess]], which is played on a 10×8 board. In [[shogi]], the term ''[[Castle (shogi)|castle]]'' refers to a different concept of building a multi-piece defensive structure that defends the king.

In [[chess problem]]s, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by [[retrograde analysis]] that either the king or chosen rook has previously moved.

==Notable examples==
* [[Viktor Korchnoi]], in his [[World_Chess_Championship_1975#1974_Candidates_tournament|1974 Candidates final]] match with [[Anatoly Karpov]], famously asked the [[International Arbiter|arbiter]] if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1067831 |title=Korchnoi vs. Karpov, Moscow 1974 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castling Confuses Even Grandmasters|date=16 July 1995|author=Larry Evans|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-16/entertainment/9507110283_1_rook-anatoly-karpov-castle|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This incident is said to be referenced in Korchnoi's ''Chess is My Life'' --&gt;
* Three castlings occurred in the game [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]]–[[Nick Kerins]], Dublin 1973.  Of course, the third one (the second one by White) was illegal. The game is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Tim Krabbé]] composed a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|joke chess problem]] containing vertical castling (king on e1, [[underpromotion|underpromoted]] rook on e8). The loophole in the definition of castling upon which this problem was based was removed by the new requirement that the castling rook must occupy the same rank as the king.

==History==
Castling has its roots in the "king's leap".  There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king would move once like a knight, and (2) the king would move two squares on his first move.  The knight-move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat.  This second form was [[Chess in Europe|played in Europe]] as early as the 13th century.  In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second {{chessgloss|rank}} and (2) the rook moved to the king's original square and the king moved to the rook's original square {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=48}}.

Before the [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and [[queen (chess)|queen]] acquired their current moves in the 16th century they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board.  When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square, since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=16}}.

The rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1,&lt;ref&gt;c1, c2, c3, d3, e3, f3, ga, g2, or g3, according to [[H. J. R. Murray]]&lt;/ref&gt; if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king might move similarly.)  In Lombardy, the white king might jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move.

In Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called "free castling".

In the [[Göttingen manuscript]] (c. 1500) and a game published by [[Luis Ramírez de Lucena]] in 1498, castling consisted of two moves: first the rook and then the king.

The current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and England in 1640 {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=66}}.

In the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, [[Johann Baptist Allgaier|Johann Allgaier]] introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between "0-0r" (r=right) and "0-0l" (l=left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was added in 1837 by [[Aaron Alexandre]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Bücker: "Was bedeutet 0-0?" (What does 0-0 mean?), in: ''[[Kaissiber]]'', No. 18, 2002, pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was then accepted in the first edition (1843) of the ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]''.

==Nomenclature==
In most European languages, castling is known by a derivative from the same root as the English word "rook" (e.g. ''rochieren, rochada, enroque''), while the local adjectives meaning "long" and "short" (or "big" and "small")  are used in those countries to refer to queenside and kingside castling, respectively.

'''Grahame Park''', previously named '''Bluetongue Stadium''' due to [[Naming rights|sponsorship]] by [[Bluetongue Brewery]], is a sports venue in [[Gosford]], on the [[Central Coast, New South Wales|Central Coast]] of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The stadium is home to the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] [[association football]] club which compete in the [[A-League]]. The stadium also hosts [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] fixtures on an ad hoc basis as well as other major social events.

The stadium was originally designed to be the home stadium for the [[North Sydney Bears]] [[rugby league football]] club.

The stadium is rectangular and is unusual in that seating is located on only three sides of the ground. The southern end is open giving filtered views of [[Brisbane Water]] through a row of palm trees. With an all seater capacity of 20,059 it was {{As of|2012|lc=on}} the second smallest stadium in the [[A-League]]. It is within walking distance of the Gosford CBD and [[Gosford railway station, New South Wales|Gosford railway station]]. The Central Coast Leagues Club and League Club Field are adjacent to the stadium, across Dane Drive.

==History==
In 1911, Erina Shire Council proposed to create a park on the shore of Brisbane Water. The park required much land to be reclaimed from marshland. It also required privately owned land to be purchased by council and a section of road to be demolished. ''Waterside Park'' was opened in 1915 and a cricket pitch was added during that year. Further reclamation of the foreshore extended the park during the Depression that gave work to the unemployed. By 1939 surplus railway land had been added and a Bowling Club and green as well as tennis courts had been constructed. In 1939 the Park was renamed '''Grahame Park''', after the then mayor of [[Gosford]], [[William Calman Grahame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full stadium was then touted and later built in the late 1990s, planned to be ready in 1999 for NRL club the [[North Sydney Bears]], before construction problems including large spells of inclement weather delayed completion. The stadium finally opened in early 2000 as '''NorthPower Stadium at Grahame Park''', the [[Northern Eagles]] [[National Rugby League]] team (a merging of the aforementioned Bears and the [[Manly Sea Eagles]]) taking residence there until their dissolving at the conclusion of the 2002 season.

In 2003, with no major sporting team in residence, the stadium played host to three group matches in the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. The [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team]] played one match at the stadium on their 2004 tour.

The stadium gained its second full-time tenant in 2005 with the formation of the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]], a team in the newly formed national [[A-League]] football competition. It became the first full-time national sporting competition to have a team play at the stadium. Further use of the stadium in 2006 follows from it being the home ground to the [[Central Coast Waves]] [[rugby union]] team, which joined the [[Shute Shield]] in 2006.

The stadium continues to host NRL competition matches from time to time, as well as a number of pre-season trials. The [[Central Coast Rays]], the Central Coasts' [[Australian Rugby Championship]] team, played out of the stadium during the only season of the competition in 2007. The stadium continued as a home to the Mariners A-League side {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, and hosted NRL matches throughout the 2008 Centenary Year. In 2014, the [[NSW Country Eagles]] hosted a [[National Rugby Championship]] match at Central Coast.

In recent years the [[Sydney Roosters]] have hosted one NRL game per season at Central Coast Stadium; other clubs such as the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], [[Wests Tigers]], [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] have also taken games to the Central Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/3808270/stadium-plan-could-see-dragons-lose-more-home-games/?cs=298|title=St George Illawarra Dragons could lose more home games in NSW Government stadium plan|publisher=Illawarra Mercury|first=Michael|last=Chammas|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Central Coast Stadium played host to two [[North Queensland Cowboys]] matches, the first of which resulted in a historic 20-20 draw with wooden spooners South Sydney, the first such result since [[golden point]] was introduced in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-05-15/souths-cowboys-share-the-points/1977120|title=Souths, Cowboys share the points|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=16 May 2004|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a signatory to the [[World Anti-Doping Code]], the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) prohibits the '''use of banned [[performance-enhancing substance]]s''' by competitors at the '''[[World Championships in Athletics]]'''. A [[List of drugs banned by WADA|list of WADA-banned substances]] is regularly published to the public and amended as scientific knowledge expands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/the-prohibited-list The Prohibited List]. WADA. Retrieved 2018-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The IAAF and anti-doping bodies undertake in-competition sampling of athletes [[blood test|blood]] and [[urine test|urine]] in order to detect where athletes have taken banned substances. This is also complemented by out-of-competition tests during the tournament and in the preceding period.&lt;ref name=ID&gt;[https://www.iaaf.org/download/download?filename=0971af8e-36ca-45e0-b7d4-3069baf5c467.pdf&amp;urlslug=IAAF%20Anti-Doping%20Rules IAAF ANTI-DOPING RULES]. IAAF. Retrieved 2018-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a [[Doping in sport|banned substance]] is detected in-competition the athlete's performance will be annulled and—depending on the severity of the infraction—the athlete may be banned from the sport for a set period. Where an out-of-competition sample tests positive for a banned substance, any performances by the athlete after that date may also be annulled. Athletes may also be banned via doping regulations if the athlete fails to submit to testing, tampers or interferes with the undertaking of anti-doping procedures, or is found in possession of banned substances.&lt;ref name=ID/&gt; Where a performance is annulled, any medals won by the athlete will be stripped from the athlete and the IAAF may decided to reallocate the medal(s) to the next best performers. This includes disqualification of whole national [[relay race|relay teams]] should one member break anti-doping rules. Samples are stored for future retesting, as improved methods over time may lead to previously unidentified cases of doping. The IAAF began a long-term storage approach from the [[2007 World Championships in Athletics|2007 World Championships]] onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/iaaf-response-mclaren-report-part-2 IAAF statement in response to second McLaren report]. IAAF (2016-12-09). Retrieved 2018-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 162 athletes (69 men and 93 women) have had their results annulled at the World Championships, and 40 of these have been stripped of medals as a result. A total of 53 medals have been stripped as a result of doping infractions. The first doping failure pre-dates the main championships and comes from Spanish hurdler [[Rosa Colorado]] at the [[1980 World Championships in Athletics]] – an event which only featured two women's events not on the Olympic programme. World champions to be banned include North American sprinters [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], [[Marion Jones]], [[Tim Montgomery]] and [[Kelli White]]. Other prominent champions to have been banned include Russian middle-distance runner [[Mariya Savinova]], steeplechaser [[Yuliya Zaripova]] and racewalker [[Olga Kaniskina]]. The majority of stripped medallists have come from the [[United States]] and the [[post-Soviet states]], though athletes from many other nations of the world have failed doping tests at the competition.&lt;ref name=Stats2017&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/ebooks/2017/WCH/index.html 2017 World Championships in Athletics Statistics Book] (pp. 82–87). IAAF (2017). Retrieved 2018-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an upward trend in the number of doping violations at the championships, with a peak of 50 athletes having had their performances annulled at the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics|2011 event]], though it is assumed that this reflects improved detection rather than increased overall doping – an anonymous survey at that championships revealed over 30% of athletes had used banned substances during their career.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/41084175 Doping: More than 30% of athletes at 2011 Worlds admit to doping]. BBC Sport (2017-08-29). Retrieved 2018-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the susceptibility of the [[sport of athletics]] to doping issues, the IAAF has been central in the development of anti-doping standards and anti-doping measures have been were present at World Championships since the first edition in [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|1983]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iaaf.org/about-iaaf/medical-anti-doping IAAF commitment to healthy and drug-free athletics]. IAAF. Retrieved 2018-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-doping approach had a new development at the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics]], where all Russian athletes were banned due to [[doping in Russia|state-sponsored doping]] and had to request dispensation to compete at [[Authorised Neutral Athletes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/20/iaaf-clears-eight-russian-athletes-world-championships IAAF clears eight Russian athletes to compete as neutrals but rejects 53 more].

==Disqualifications by nation==
[[File:Osaka07 D7A Olga Kaniskina Medal-2.jpg|thumb|Three-time racewalk world champion [[Olga Kaniskina]] of Russia has been stripped of two of those titles for doping.]]
[[File:Mariya Savinova - Womens 800m - 2012 Olympics.jpg|thumb|[[Mariya Savinova]] is one of many Russian athletes to be stripped for World Championships medals.]]
[[File:Zhanna Tarnopolskaya-Pintusevich.jpg|thumb|[[Zhanna Pintusevich-Block]] is one of two Ukrainians to be stripped of medals for doping at the event.]]
This table collates the total number of athletes who have been disqualified for doping at the championships by nation. Athletes with multiple disqualifications are counted as one. Where a relay team is disqualified, this is counted as one disqualification, though multiple team members may have been sanctioned.

In [[college football]], the '''Flea Kicker''' was a notable play executed by the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] against the [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri Tigers]] on November 8, 1997 that sent the game into overtime and resulted in a win for the Cornhuskers who went on to share the [[NCAA Division I-A]] National Championship with the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]]. The final minutes of the game were seen by many people on [[College Football on ABC|ABC]], after other regional games ended.

==Background==
The Cornhuskers, who had won national championships for the 1994 and 1995 seasons, went into the game with an 8–0 record and a No. 1 ranking in the [[AP Poll]].&lt;ref name="soonerstats"&gt;

==The Play==
In the fourth quarter, Tigers [[quarterback]] Corby Jones completed a pass to Eddie Brooks to give Missouri a 38–31 lead, giving Missouri fans hope that they would beat Nebraska for the first time since 1978 and moving coach [[Larry Smith (football coach)|Larry Smith]] to tears.{{cn|date=October 2016}} The Huskers took possession from a punt after Missouri failed to convert a first down on their own 33-yard line with 1:02 left. In less than a minute, the Huskers moved the ball 55 yards. The Huskers were on the Missouri 12-yard line with only seven seconds left when Nebraska quarterback [[Scott Frost]] threw a pass intended for wingback Shevin Wiggins. The ball hit Wiggins directly in the chest near the goal line. The ball immediately shot down and hit a Missouri safety in the foot and popped back in the air. Then Missouri safety Julian Jones tackled Wiggins as time expired. As Wiggins was pulled to the ground, his leg popped up, kicking the ball into the air for a second time. Cornhuskers receiver Matt Davison leaped for the ball, his hands scraping the turf as he managed to make the catch in the endzone for a [[touchdown]]. Missouri fans stormed the field in celebration, thinking they had won.

The play could have resulted in a 15-yard penalty (illegal kick) if officials had considered the kick intentional. Instead, they ruled the catch a touchdown. Once fans were cleared from the field, [[Kris Brown]] kicked the [[extra point]] for Nebraska to send the game into overtime. In OT, Frost ran for a touchdown, and Jones was sacked on 4th and seven by [[Grant Wistrom]] to give Nebraska a 45–38 win.&lt;ref name="Freak play"&gt;

==Aftermath==
Missouri finished the season 7–5 with a loss to [[Colorado State]] in the [[Holiday Bowl]]. The Tigers did not defeat the Cornhuskers until 2003, ending a 24-game losing streak in the series.

After the game, Wiggins claimed to have kicked the ball intentionally to keep the play alive, and some of his statements indicate that he did so to keep the ball away from Missouri defenders. He also at various times and in later interviews claimed to have been trying to kick the ball back to himself for a catch. Regardless, the outcome of the game could not be changed after the fact, despite the kick leading to Nebraska's win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19971113&amp;id=fFkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jm8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6708,5454076|title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of the play remains in dispute among college football fans and experts, as NCAA rules at the time generally made it illegal for an intentional kick (by players other than kickers and punters) but also allowed players to use any part of their bodies - including feet - to help themselves catch a forward pass. Furthermore, the rules only allowed officials to establish intent to kick only as they could determine clearly on the field of play.

Although Nebraska dropped to No. 3 in the AP Poll the following week, they were still undefeated, and national title hopes were still alive. The Cornhuskers defeated [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]] and [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] in the last two games of the regular season and beat [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]] 54–15 in the [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]]. Nebraska went on to defeat [[Peyton Manning]] and No. 3 [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] 42–17 in the [[1998 Orange Bowl]] to finish the season 13–0. The Cornhuskers had a No. 1 ranking in the [[Coaches Poll]], giving them a third national championship in four seasons.&lt;ref name="huskers"&gt;

==Significance==
The Flea Kicker was ranked No. 11 on ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'''s list of Top 50 Amazing Catches.

The Flea Kicker was also being recreated for the [[Fox Sports Net]] program ''Sport Science'' in an episode called "Bet You Can't Do It Again".

The '''flip jump''' (usually just '''flip''') is a [[figure skating jump]] which takes off from a backward inside edge with a toe pick assist, and lands on the backward outside edge of the opposite foot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[John Misha Petkevich]], ''Figure Skating: Championship Techniques'', {{ISBN|0-452-26209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the jump was known as a Mapes. In international competition, women have landed flips with three rotations since 1981, and men have landed flips with four rotations since 2016.

== Description ==
A flip is a [[figure skating jump]] which takes off from a backward inside edge with a toe pick assist, and lands on the backward outside edge of the opposite foot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The name is generally modified by number of rotations performed while the skater is airborne (e.g., a triple flip for three rotations).

== History ==
The origins of the flip jump are obscure. Starting in 1913, the jump was known for many years as a Mapes (now applied to the [[toe loop]] in the jargon of [[artistic roller skating]]), but it is not known for certain if [[Bruce Mapes]] was the inventor. It was certainly being commonly performed by the 1930s.

It is also not definitely established who performed the first triple flip; [[David Jenkins (figure skater)|David Jenkins]] may have landed the jump in the 1950s, but perhaps only in practice.  [[Donald Jackson]] is said to have performed one at the 1961 [[North American Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;"North Americans", ''Skating'' magazine, April 1961&lt;/ref&gt;  Another source claims that no skater had yet landed one in competition as late as 1968, when [[John Misha Petkevich]] was performing them in practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Vr0SAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zfcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5961,831956&amp;dq=triple-flip+skating&amp;hl=en "Difficult Choice Faced by Skater"], Spokane Daily Chronicle, Feb 5 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katarina Witt]] was one of two female skaters to land a triple flip for the first time at the 1981 European Championships.

[[Daisuke Takahashi]] made an attempt at a quad flip at the 2010 World Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/figureskating/news/story?id=5027586|title=Daisuke Takahashi is first Japanese man to win gold at world figure skating championships|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoma Uno]] became the first skater to ever land a [[quad (figure skating)|quadruple]] flip at the [[2016 Team Challenge Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/leaderboard/results/2016/23073/SEGM017.html|title=2016 Team Challenge Cup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
The most common entry into a flip, for a counterclockwise jump, is a long forward straight-line glide on the left foot down the center of the rink with the (right) free foot held forward. The skater uses the toe of the right foot to push into a left forward outside [[3 turn]], reaching back to pick with the right foot to vault into the jump from the left back inside edge immediately after the turn. The skater performs one or more rotations in the air before landing on a right back outside edge.

The flip can also be entered from a [[mohawk turn]], and lends itself well to being performed out of a more complicated footwork approach.

In [[British English]], the flip is sometimes called a ''toe salchow'', but in fact it is a mistake to think of the jump as a toe pick-assisted [[Salchow jump|salchow]] because the technique and mechanics of the two jumps are very different.  The flip is actually quite similar in mechanics to the [[loop jump]]; in both jumps, the rotation comes from the right side of the body (for counterclockwise rotation), and the left leg is already crossed in front of the right in what is called a ''back spin position'' when the skater springs into the air.

===Common technique flaws===
The flip is also similar to the [[Lutz jump]], a toe-assisted jump which takes off a back outside rather than back inside edge. In the same way that some skaters ''flutz'', or turn an intended Lutz jump into a flip by mistakenly changing to the wrong edge on the takeoff, some skaters have a tendency to ''lip'' their flips by mistakenly changing to an outside edge so that it is actually a Lutz jump. Some skaters never manage to get on a strong edge for either the flip or Lutz, a habit that is probably reinforced by the trend to enter both of these jumps from a straight line rather than on a curve. Skating experts tend to be critical of wrong-edge takeoffs, although judges have dealt inconsistently with edge errors over the years. During the 2007 Grand Prix series, however, the technical judges began penalizing wrong-edge takeoffs on all skaters.  Since then, penalties have become more severe; beginning in 2015, the ISU implemented a 30% reduction in base value for flip and Lutz jumps with incorrect take-off edges. Today, the detection and penalization of wrong-edge takeoffs on flip and Lutz jumps remains a controversial topic, due mostly to the unclear range of acceptable edge degrees for respective jumps, as well as the seemingly selective use of the penalty on the part of the judges.

Another notable technique flaw that appears in many skaters' flips (and Lutz jumps) is "mule kick" or "toe hammering," which occurs when the free leg rises unusually high, typically near (in some cases above) hip height, before descending to strike the ice.  This can make the jump easier to rotate but sacrifices height and some control.

===Variants===
A half-rotation jump with a flip entrance, typically landed on the left toe pick and right forward inside edge for a counterclockwise jump, is called a ''half flip''.  The half flip, in turn, forms the basis for the common [[split jump]], in which the skater achieves either a front-to-back or sideways (Russian or straddle) split position at the apex of the jump.  A full-rotation flip jump with a split position is sometimes seen as well; this is called a ''split flip''.
In the past, it was also quite common for skaters to perform a ''one-and-a-half flip'' jump as an element in jump sequences or as a highlight in step sequences.

In general, the [[International Skating Union]]'s new "code of points" judging system now discourages skaters from putting variety jumps such as the split flip or one-and-a-half flip into their competitive programs because they count towards the number of permitted jumps but carry a very low point value.

'''Kanchanaburi Stadium or Kleeb Bua Stadium''' ({{lang-th|สนามกีฬาจังหวัดกาญจนบุรี หรือ สนามกลีบบัว}}), is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Kanchanaburi Province]], [[Thailand]]. It was redeveloped for the 2009 [[Thailand National Youth Games]] and is also the former home stadium of the [[Thai Premier League]]'s [[TOT FC]].

Prior to redevelopment the [[stadium]] was a typical Thai municipal stadium: a pitch surrounded by running track with two small stands on each side. The old stands have been retained as part of the redevelopment and four new stands have been constructed. At each end of the ground there are two new stands, each curved as they follow the line of the running track. To the right of the main stand the two new stands nearly meet in the middle but there is a small gap between them. To the left of the main stand are similar curved stands but there is a larger gap in the middle. All four new stands have [[cantilever]] roofs.

The '''Kelowna Memorial Arena''' is an [[ice hockey]] [[arena]] located in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]]. It was built in 1945 and has a capacity of 2,600. It is notable for its small ice surface of 180' X 80'. It once hosted the [[Western Hockey League]]'s [[Kelowna Wings]] and the [[Kelowna Rockets]] before they moved into the new [[Prospera Place]]. The arena also hosted the Kelowna Spartans of the BCJHL, who won the Centennial Cup in 1993. The old arena still stands and is used for Kelowna Minor Hockey, and the Okanagan College Hockey League.

Built with the memorial fund given to the city due to [[World War II]], there is a war museum connected to the arena.
The "Memorial Arena" is the centre of Downtown Kelowna, right beside [[Okanagan Lake]].

'''Khalifa International Stadium''' ({{Lang-ar|ملعب خليفة الدولي|links=no}}), also known as '''National Stadium''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Doha, Qatar]] as part of the [[Aspire Zone|Doha Sports City]] complex, which also includes [[Aspire Academy]], [[Hamad Aquatic Centre]], and the [[Aspire Tower]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=392062 |title=Alternative Name |publisher=Emporis }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani]], Qatar's former Emir. The final of [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] was held at this stadium. The stadium is also the first completed venue that will host a part of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saraiva |first1=Alexia |title=Get To Know The 8 2022 Qatar World Cup Stadiums |url=https://www.archdaily.com/899352/get-to-know-the-8-2022-qatar-world-cup-stadiums |website=ArchDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it received a four star rating from the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS), the first in the world to be awarded this rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2017/m=11/news=khalifa-international-stadium-receives-major-sustainability-award-2921733.html|title=Khalifa International Stadium receives major sustainability award|last=FIFA.com|date=2017-11-28|work=FIFA.com|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium was originally opened in 1976, but was fully renovated and expanded in 2005 prior to the [[2006 Asian Games]] in order to increase its capacity from 20,000 to 40,000. A roof has also been built on the western side of the stadium, along with a large arch on the eastern side, which was used as a platform for the launch of fireworks during the [[2006 Asian Games opening ceremony]].

Before its renovation it was used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches, but it includes facilities for many other sports. Since 1997, it hosts the annual [[track and field]] event [[Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix]], now as part of the [[IAAF Diamond League]]. It is currently the stadium of [[Qatar national football team]]. It will host the 17th [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]] in autumn 2019.

The venue hosted two international friendly football matches between Brazil and England on 14 November 2009 and Brazil and Argentina on 17 November 2010 and the athletics of the 2009 ISF World School Games, held between 8–12 December 2009.

The stadium also hosted the inaugural function of the [[2011 Pan Arab Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=474966&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211102340/http://gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=474966&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |archivedate=11 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knights Stadium''' was the home of the [[International League]]'s [[Charlotte Knights]] from 1990 to 2013. It sat 10,002 fans. The park was actually across the state line from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]]. The stadium closed at the end of the 2013 season and the Knights moved to [[BB&amp;T Ballpark (Charlotte)|BB&amp;T Ballpark]] in downtown Charlotte for the 2014 season.

Knights Stadium was easily accessible from [[Interstate 77]].  Exit 88 (Gold Hill Road) connects the expressway with the stadium.  Near the stadium is a [[water tower]] painted to resemble a baseball on a tee, which can be seen from Interstate 77.

==History==
The stadium was built to [[Major League Baseball]] specifications to be used should Charlotte land a major league team, and was designed to expand to 40,000 seats.

During construction, the Knights, then a member of the Class AA Southern League, played in an 8,000-seat temporary stadium known as '''Knights Castle'''.  The present stadium was originally known as Knights Castle, but was renamed to Knights Stadium in the late 1990s.  The stadium was still known among Charlotteans as '''The Castle'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The venue hosted the 1997 and 1998 [[Big South Conference Baseball Tournament]]s, won by [[UNC Greensboro Spartans baseball|UNC Greensboro]] and [[Liberty Flames baseball|Liberty]], respectively.&lt;ref name=rb&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Big South Baseball Record Book |url=http://www.bigsouthsports.com/pdf8/731221.pdf |publisher=[[Big South Conference]] |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65XN38Wdc?url=http://www.bigsouthsports.com/pdf8/731221.pdf |archivedate=February 18, 2012 |pages=20–22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also hosted the [[2000 Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament|2000]] and [[2001 Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament|2001]] [[Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament]]s, won by [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets baseball|Georgia Tech]] and [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons baseball|Wake Forest]], respectively.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 ACC Baseball Guide |url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-basebl/2012-acc-baseball-guide.html |publisher=[[Atlantic Coast Conference]] |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/682OROOXc?url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-basebl/2012-acc-baseball-guide.html |archivedate=May 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 2007, a franchise record 15,427 fans attended the game between the Knights and the [[Durham Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IL News and Notes|url=http://www.milb.com/gen/articles/printer_friendly/leagues/l117/press/y2007/m07/d05/c270512.jsp|publisher=International League|date=July 5, 2007|accessdate=July 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted its last Knights game on September 2, 2013, a 4-0 Knights victory over the [[Gwinnett Braves]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/09/02/4283167/charlotte-knights-close-out-era.html#.UiaId2TwJZ8&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, several longtime employees dug up home plate and each of the bases and presented them to team mascot Homer the Dragon. Homer then saluted Knights Stadium one last time, and boarded a helicopter bound for Uptown Charlotte and [[BB&amp;T Ballpark (Charlotte)|BB&amp;T Ballpark]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldonline.com/2013/09/03/5169344/fans-turn-out-for-last-game-before.html&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, York County sold the land to [[Cato Corporation]], a Charlotte-based retailer of women's fashions and accessories. The contract Cato signed permits them to use the land for any industrial, commercial or residential purpose. The stadium was demolished in early 2015.

'''''Le Véloce-sport''''' was a leading [[France|French]] cycling periodical that was founded in [[Bordeaux]] in 1885.{{Citation needed|reason=Nov 2009|date=November 2009}} It was the organiser and publicist of the first running of the [[Bordeaux–Paris]] cycle race in 1891.{{r|RanOnt}}

== Bicycle touring ==
The ''Véloce-sport'' quickly published various guides for [[bicycle touring]]. One can read for example in 1889 a guide for a tour between [[Aude]] and [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] in southern France, from [[Quillan]] to [[Caudiès-de-Fenouillèdes]]. Even though the landscape is said to be quite picturesque, it is also very often specified that the bad state of the roads makes it compulsory, at the time, to frequently go by feet rather than on the bike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vieuxpapierspo.blogspot.fr/2014/07/de-quillan-caudies-de-fenouilledes-velo.html |title=De Quillan à Caudiès-de-Fenouillèdes à vélo en 1889 |author=Fabricio Cardenas |date=19 July 2014 |website=Vieux papiers des Pyrénées-Orientales |language=fr |access-date=9 February 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bordeaux-Paris==
In 1890 ''Le Véloce-sport'' and the Velo Club Bordelais announced that a cycle race from would start in Bordeaux on May 23, 1891, and finish in [[Paris]] after covering 572 kilometres. It was to be the first inter-city race to feature the [[safety bicycle]]. A crowd of 7,000 Parisians gathered at the finish at Port Maillot, near the [[Vélodrome Buffalo]].{{r|RanOnt}} 

The organisers envisaged riders might take several days and laid on meals and beds for riders along the way, but [[George Pilkington Mills]] rode through the night and finished first in finished in 26 hours on a diet that included a lot of strawberries. British riders took the first four places.

[[Image:VCM-2004-start.jpg|thumb|right|Start of the Vienna City Marathon 2004]]

'''Mass start''' is a format of starting in some [[racing sports]] such as [[long-distance running]] in [[athletics (track and field)]], [[speed skating]], long-distance [[Cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] and [[biathlon]].

There are usually a large number of competitors in such an event, and in order for all the competitors to have the same environmental conditions, which, among other things,  include [[temperature]], [[wind speed]], [[rain]] or shine, etc., they need to start at the same time and same place and proceed along the same [[Course (navigation)|course]]. But the large number of competitors makes it impossible to fit all of them at the same starting line. So the [[sportsperson|athlete]]s stand in a pack before they begin: some are behind others, sometimes by dozens of meters or more, depending on the number of competitors.

The [[tradition]] is that all the athletes start at the same time, the gun time, and use the same starting line and same finishing line as those in the front of the pack. This means that those in the back of the pack have to run an extra distance. One's position in the pack at starting is determined either based on their previous records, or chosen by the participant based on their own expectation and [[etiquette]]. Usually, the best athletes take the front positions.

Modern [[electronic technology]] has made it possible to get the time lapsed for each individual athlete from their crossing the starting line to their crossing the finishing line, the chip time. This is also called [[transponder timing]]. However, this has the disadvantage that the race finish is not simultaneous, so the race results do not match the finish line order. Other ways to avoid disadvantage towards those in the back of the pack are individual starts (where athletes start one at a time) and interval starts (where athletes are released in small batches). Chip time is normally not used to determine top positions. The first to reach the finish shall be the winner.

In cross country skiing, on elite level, the tradition is individual start. Each athlete starts at their own predetermined time. Mass starts are used more often after 1990, partly because of TV influence. It creates better summaries for TV stations that do not want to show the entire race, and for viewers who do not want to see all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17704">[[File:Fred Merkle 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Fred Merkle, 1908]]
'''Merkle's Boner''' refers to the notorious [[baserunning|base-running]] mistake committed by rookie [[Fred Merkle]] of the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] in a game against the [[Chicago Cubs]] on September 23, 1908. Merkle's failure to advance to second base on what should have been a game-winning hit led instead to a forceout at second and a tied game. The Cubs later won the makeup game, which proved decisive as they beat the Giants by one game to win the [[National League]] (NL) [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] for [[1908 Major League Baseball season|1908]]. It has been described as "the most controversial game in baseball history".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;
== Background ==
The NL pennant race of 1908 was a three-team fight among the teams that dominated the league in the first decade of the modern era: the Pittsburgh (then often spelled Pittsburg) [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] (pennant winners in 1901, 1902, and 1903), the Giants (winners in 1904 and 1905), and the Cubs (winners in 1906 and 1907).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/|title=National League Team Win Totals – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams were clustered  in the standings all year, with Pittsburgh never more than 2.5 games up or 5 back,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PIT/1908-schedule-scores.shtml|title=1908 Pittsburgh Pirates Schedule and Results – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Giants never more than 4.5 up or 6.5 back,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYG/1908-schedule-scores.shtml|title=1908 New York Giants Schedule and Results – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cubs never more than 4 games up or 6 games back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1908-schedule-scores.shtml|title=1908 Chicago Cubs Schedule and Results – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When play began at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City on September 23, 1908, the Cubs and Giants were tied for first place (although the Giants had six more games to play, with an 87–50 record as opposed to the Cubs' 90–53), and the Pirates were 1.5 games back with an 88–54 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=1908-09-22|title=Standings on Tuesday, September 22, 1908 – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkle was 19 years old in 1908, the youngest player in the National League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaccaro|first=Mike|title=The First Fall Classic|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|edition=[[E-book]]|ISBN=978-0-385-53218-1|page=232|authorlink=Mike Vaccaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in only 38 games all year,&lt;ref name=giantsstats&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYG/1908.shtml|title=1908 New York Giants Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 of which were at first base as the backup for regular Giants first baseman [[Fred Tenney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYG/1908-fielding.shtml|title=1908 New York Giants Fielding Statistics – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkle was recovering from two foot surgeries in July following a blood infection that nearly caused his foot to be amputated and was unable to play for most of July and August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Notes|work=Lowell Sun|issue=p. 22|date=July 16, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fred Merkle Badly Hurt|work=Newark Advocate|issue=p. 3|date=July 10, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of September 23, Tenney woke up with a case of [[lumbago]], and Giants manager [[John McGraw]] penciled Merkle in at first base. It was the first big-league game Merkle had ever started.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth, Cubs shortstop [[Joe Tinker]] hit the ball into the outfield, and when right fielder [[Mike Donlin]] could not stop it from going past him deep into the cavernous outfield of the Polo Grounds, Tinker circled the bases for an inside-the-park home run that gave Chicago a 1–0 lead. It was the first homer hit off Mathewson since a homer by Tinker on July 17.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants tied the score in the fifth when [[Buck Herzog]] singled, advanced to second on an [[error (baseball)|error]], advanced to third on a [[Sacrifice bunt|sacrifice]] by [[Roger Bresnahan]], and scored on a single by Donlin. The game was still tied 1–1 when the Giants came to bat in the bottom of the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

== The incident ==
Pfiester remained on the mound for Chicago. [[Cy Seymour]] led off with a groundout to second. [[Art Devlin (baseball)|Art Devlin]] singled, putting the winning run on first base with one out. [[Moose McCormick]] grounded sharply to second, but Devlin's aggressive slide prevented a [[double play]] and allowed McCormick to reach first base safely on a [[fielder's choice]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; With two outs and McCormick on first, Fred Merkle came up to bat. Merkle, who only had 47 plate appearances in the entire 1908 season,&lt;ref name=giantsstats /&gt; singled down the right-field line. McCormick, the potential winning run, advanced to third base.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Merkles Boner game Polo Grounds Sept23 1908.jpg|thumb|left|An estimated 40,000 fans watched the game.]]
Shortstop [[Al Bridwell]] came up to bat next with two outs and runners at the corners. Bridwell swung at the first pitch from Pfiester, a fastball, and drilled an apparent single into center field. McCormick ran home from third, and the game appeared to be over, a 2–1 Giants victory. Giants fans poured out of the stands and mobbed the field; fans sitting behind home plate customarily crossed the field to exit the ballpark via the outfield in this [[dead ball era|era]]. Merkle, advancing from first base, saw the fans swarming onto the playing field. He turned back to the dugout without ever touching second.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; Official rule 4.09 states that "A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the third out is made ... by any runner being forced out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf MLB Official Rules, Section 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/sep/22/sports/chi-080922-chicago-cubs-merkles-boner|title=100-year Anniversary of 'Merkle's Boner'|date=September 23, 2008|first=Ed|last=Sherman|work=Chicago Tribune|page=5|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

Cubs second baseman [[Johnny Evers]] saw an opportunity to have the rule enforced. He shouted to center fielder [[Solly Hofman]], who, though the field was filled with fans, retrieved the ball and threw it to Evers. According to one account, [[Joe McGinnity]], a Giants pitcher who was coaching first base that day, intercepted the ball and threw it away into the crowd of fans. Evers apparently retrieved the ball and touched second base, although some reports stated that he substituted a different ball. Umpires Emslie and O'Day hurriedly consulted and O'Day, who saw the play from home plate, ruled that Merkle had not touched second base, and on that basis Emslie ruled him out on a force, and O'Day ruled that the run did not score.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, pp. 439–441&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers told different stories of who had gotten the ball to Evers and how. Christy Mathewson, however, who was coaching first base for the Giants, acknowledged in an affidavit that Merkle never made it to second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Player-Mathewson-Baseball-American/dp/1568582684#reader_1568582684|title=The Player: Christy Mathewson|first=Philip|last=Seib|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; One newspaper claimed that Cub players physically restrained Merkle from advancing to second. Retelling the story in 1944, Evers insisted that after McGinnity (who was not playing in the game) had thrown the ball away, Cubs pitcher [[Rube Kroh]] (who also was not in the game) retrieved it from a fan and threw it to shortstop Tinker, who threw it to Evers. (By rule, after a fan or a player who was not in the game touched the ball, it should have been ruled dead.) A contemporary account from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' supports this version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/theinsidegame-volume8no4.pdf|title=Scoring the Merkle Play|first=Norman|last=Macht|journal=The Inside Game|volume=8|number=4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, eight years prior to that, Evers claimed to have gotten the ball directly from Hofman. Five years after the play, Merkle admitted that he had left the field without touching second, but only after umpire Emslie assured them that they had won the game. In 1914, O'Day said that Evers' tag was irrelevant: he had called the third out after McGinnity interfered with the throw from center field.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, pp. 442–444&lt;/ref&gt; Future Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] said Merkle's boner was "the rottenest decision in the history of baseball"; Klem believed that the force rule was meant to apply to infield hits, not balls hit to the outfield.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replayed game ==
Unable to quickly clear the field of fans, O'Day ruled the game over on account of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; The game ended a 1–1 tie. National League president [[Harry Pulliam]] upheld the ruling. On October 2, Pulliam rejected the Giants' appeal of O'Day's ruling and the Cubs' call for a forfeit victory and again upheld the umpires, declaring the force play on Merkle valid and the game a tie.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs-Giants-Pirates pennant race continued to the final days. The Giants were forced to end the season by playing 10 games in a week due to rainouts.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; After Merkle's boner, the Giants won 10 of their last 15 games to finish 98–55. The Cubs won eight of their last 10 after the Merkle game to also finish 98–55. The Pirates, who beat the Dodgers 2–1 on September 23 to gain a half game on their rivals, won nine of their last 10 to force a makeup game with the Cubs on October 4. The Cubs beat the Pirates 5–2, leaving themselves tied with the Giants, and with the Pirates a half-game back of both teams at 98–56, they were thus eliminated.

On October 6, the National League board of directors agreed with its umpires and with Hank Pulliam, making a final ruling that Merkle had failed to touch second base and that the force rule was correctly applied.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; This left the Cubs and Giants tied at 98–55 and required a makeup game to decide the NL pennant. To decide the pennant (and a spot in the [[World Series]]), the teams had to replay the tie game on October 8. Mathewson, scheduled to start the game, said, "I'm not fit to pitch today. I'm dog tired."&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd was estimated at 40,000, the biggest in baseball history at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 601&lt;/ref&gt; Pfiester pitched for the Cubs again in the rematch,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 608&lt;/ref&gt; but was removed from the game in the first inning after hitting Tenney, walking Herzog (who was promptly picked off), giving up an RBI double to Donlin, and walking Seymour. Future Hall of Famer [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown]] entered the game in relief and got out of the jam without allowing another run crossing the plate.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, pp. 609–610&lt;/ref&gt; In the Cubs' half of the third inning, Tinker led off with a triple and scored on a single by [[Johnny Kling]]. Evers walked, [[Frank Schulte]] followed with an RBI double to give the Cubs the lead, and Frank Chance followed with a two-run double.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 612–614&lt;/ref&gt; From there, Chicago cruised to a 4–2 victory, becoming champions of the NL for the third straight year.

== Aftermath ==
The Cubs went on to win the [[1908 World Series]], beating the [[Detroit Tigers]] four games to one.  This was the Cubs' last world championship for more than a century: the next came in the [[2016 World Series]]. The Pirates won the [[1909 World Series]], also against the Tigers. The Giants then returned to the World Series for three straight years, 1911–1913, only to lose each year—to the first of [[Connie Mack]]'s two [[Philadelphia Athletics]] dynasties in {{wsy|1911}} and {{wsy|1913}}, and to the [[Boston Red Sox]] in {{wsy|1912}}. John McGraw's club did not win another championship until {{wsy|1921}}, when they defeated the emerging [[New York Yankees]], featuring [[Babe Ruth]], two consecutive years in the Yankees' first World Series appearances.

''[[The New York Times]]'' game story for September 23, 1908, blamed the loss on "censurable stupidity on the part of player Merkle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/09.23.html|title=A Boner Buries The Giants|work=New York Times|date=September 23, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his life, he lived with the nickname of "Bonehead".&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3604289&amp;type=story|title=Sadly, one play defined Merkle's career|first=Ed|last=Sherman|work=ESPN.com|date=Sep 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkle replaced Tenney as the full-time Giants first baseman in 1910 and was a regular for the Giants, Dodgers, and Cubs for another 10 years. He played in five World Series, all for the losing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/merklfr01.shtml|title=Fred Merkle Statistics and History – Baseball-Reference.com|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitter over the events of the Merkle's boner game, Merkle avoided baseball after his playing career finally ended in 1926. When he finally appeared at a Giants old-timers' game in 1950, he got a loud ovation from the fans.&lt;ref name=ESPN /&gt;

Merkle's Bar and Grill, a popular [[Wrigleyville]] bar just one block south of [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago, is named after Fred Merkle, and features his image prominently in the bar's logo and interior. The bar's website recounts the story of Merkle's infamous baserunning gaffe, and its e-mail list is titled "The Bonehead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merkleschicago.com/|title=Merkles Bar and Grill – The Pink Flamingo !|work=merkleschicago.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2013, a [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] game between the [[Lansing Lugnuts]] and [[Great Lakes Loons]] featured a very similar play, in which an apparent game-winning single for the Lugnuts was nullified when the runner at first joined the celebration instead of advancing to second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fr8mjRo544&amp;t=1m0s |title=Lansing Lugnuts Great Lakes Loons 7/1/13 Grabbing Defeat Out of the Hands of Victory |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lugnuts lost in extra innings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadspin.com/minor-leaguer-hits-walk-off-single-his-team-loses-game-656822487 Minor Leaguer Hits Walk-Off Single, His Team Loses Game], Tom Ley, Deadspin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130702&amp;content_id=52434360&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_milb&amp;tcid=tw_share Loons Win in Merkle-esque Fashion], Jake Seiner, MiLB.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Korte Stadium''', also known as "The Ralph", is a 4,000 seat [[stadium]] located on the campus of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] in [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]], [[Illinois]]. It is home to the SIUE [[SIU Edwardsville Cougars|Cougars]] men's and women's [[soccer]]  and outdoor [[track &amp; field]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.enjoyillinois.com/en-us/thingstodo/details/30871 |title=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Ralph Korte Stadium &amp; Sports Complex |work=Travel Illinois |publisher=ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY |accessdate=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the stands on the west side of the field, a berm was put in on the east side in 2011 to provide lawn seating for the [[Tailgate party|tailgating fans]] known as "The East Siders."

The stadium was constructed on university property surrounding the existing "Bob Guelker Field" in 1993–94 by the City of Edwardsville as a site to host the 1994 [[U.S. Olympic Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/lovejoylibrary/archives/timeline.shtml |title=SIUE 50th Anniversary Historical Timeline |publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |accessdate=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/korte.shtml |title=Maps &amp; Directions - Ralph Korte Stadium|publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |accessdate=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the university trustees named the stadium to honor Ralph Korte, the founder of [[The Korte Company]] of [[Highland, Illinois|Highland]], an SIUE alumnus and strong advocate of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/alumni/profiles/profile-korte.shtml |title=Alumni Profiles- Ralph Korte |website=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |accessdate=1 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The soccer playing surface was named, on November 1, 1986, in honor of [[Bob Guelker]], the coach who inaugurated SIUE's men's soccer program and led it to the [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championship|Division II]] championship in 1972 and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|Division I]] crown in 1979.

The Korte Stadium and its earlier incarnation, Cougar Field, has hosted the [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship]] in 1970 and 1975, the 1972 [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] [[NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championship|Men's Soccer Championship]], and the Division II [[NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship]] in 1997, 1998, 2001, and 2003. It was also the home stadium for the [[Saint Louis Athletica]] of [[Women's Professional Soccer]] for part of their 2009 season, during which the capacity was expanded to 5,000 seats; the team later started playing at [[World Wide Technology Soccer Park|Anheuser-Busch Soccer Park]].

The track features eight 48-inch lanes, with European-style broad turns (118 meters) and short straightaways (82 meters). The field event facilities include high jump aprons; pole vault runways; long jump/triple jump pits; shot put, discus, and hammer throw rings; and javelin throw runways on the west side, just outside the stadium grandstand.

The [[Gateway Arch]] on the [[St. Louis]] riverfront, 25 miles to the southwest, can be seen from the top of the stands at The Ralph.

The record single-day attendance for a track &amp; field competition is 11,072 on July 10, 1994 at the U.S. Olympic Festival.

Although an estimated crowd of over 8,000 was present for the 1971 Bronze Boot game versus [[Saint Louis Billikens men's soccer|St. Louis]] at Cougar Field, the largest soccer crowd in the stadium's current configuration was 4,665 for the Homecoming game against [[Bradley Braves men's soccer|Bradley]] on October 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siuecougars.com/sports/m-soccer/2014-15/boxscores/20141004_xj9b.xml |title=Bradley vs. SIUE at Edwardsville, Ill., 10/4/2014 at 7 p.m. |publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |date=4 October 2014 |accessdate=5 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russell Brands, LLC''', headquartered in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], is an American manufacturer of [[sports equipment]], which markets its products under many brands and subsidiaries, including [[Russell Athletic (brand)|Russell Athletic]] (its flagship brand) and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]]. Formerly a [[publicly traded]] company, Russell Brands has been a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Berkshire Hathaway]] since 2006.

==History==

=== The beginning: Russell Manufacturing Co. ===
{{Main article|Russell Athletic (brand)}}

=== Russell Corp. established ===
The original "Russell Manufacturing Company", founded by Benjamin Russell in [[Alexander City, Alabama]], in 1902,&lt;ref name=refbusiness&gt;[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/48/Russell-Corporation.html Russell Corporation history in "Reference for Business" website]&lt;/ref&gt; became "Russell Corporation" in 1973, under the presidency of Eugene C. Gwaltney, Jr., who had taken over in 1968.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;&lt;ref name=refbusiness/&gt;

By 1990, the company owned and operated 13 sewing plants outside Alexander City and employed 15,000 workers. Since 1976, sales revenues had increased by 13 percent annually. With the acquisition of two subsidiaries, Quality Mills in North Carolina and Cloathbond Ltd. in Scotland, in 1988 and 1989 respectively, the company had become a global contender in the sportswear industry.

Under president and [[CEO]] John C. Adams, Russell Corporation had become the top manufacturer of athletic uniforms in the US. In 1992, the company was awarded a five-year contract to be the exclusive producer and marketer of athletic uniforms for most [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] teams. The contract also stipulated that the company held the exclusive right to manufacture and market replicas of major league uniforms, T-shirts and shorts. This put the company in an advantageous position in relation to its main rival, [[Champion (sportswear)|Champion, Inc.]], the supplier of uniforms to the [[NBA]] teams. In 1992 alone, Russell's international sales increased by 40 percent over 1991.&lt;ref name=refbusiness/&gt;

=== Major restructuring ===
Although sales and net income reached record levels in 1996, in part because of the impact of the [[Summer Olympics]] which were held in [[Atlanta]] that year, Russell's fortunes turned down in 1997 when both sales and net income fell. The decline was caused by intensifying competition as industry-wide over-capacity and price-cutting by rivals forced Russell to lower its own prices, all of which hurt the company's results. Particularly troubled was the Licensed Products Division, which Russell dissolved in 1997, dividing its operations among the other divisions. In 1997, Russell also ended its licensing deals with the professional football, basketball and hockey leagues.

In early 1998, as the company's troubles continued, Adams retired. John "Jack" Ward stepped in as chairman, president and CEO. Within months of his arrival, Russell announced a major restructuring. Over a three-year period, the company planned to eliminate about 4,000 jobs, or 23 percent of its workforce; close about 25 of its 90 plants, distribution centers and other facilities; and move most of the final assembly of garments abroad, to [[Mexico]], [[Honduras]] and elsewhere in the Caribbean basin. The company expected to take charges of $100 to $125 million during the restructuring period. Russell hoped these efforts would result in annual savings of $50–$70 million. Part of these funds would then be used to bolster the marketing and advertising of Russell's brands, including tripling the advertising budget to $25 million per year. Russell also established a second headquarters in Atlanta in February 1999.

Restructuring charges led Russell to post a net loss for fiscal year 1998 of $10.4 million on revenues of $1.18 billion. Results for the first half of 1999 also showed a net loss of $12.9 million but the restructuring had resulted in a decrease in selling, general and administration costs of 13 percent. Russell had also increased its offshore apparel assembly to 55 percent of total capacity, a substantial increase from the 17 percent level before the restructuring was launched. Russell had far to go before it could be considered fully turned around, but it appeared that the company was well on its way.&lt;ref name=refbusiness/&gt;

The company completed its restructuring process in 2001. Nearly all of its retail outlets had been closed, over 6,000 jobs had been cut, and most of its manufacturing operations had moved abroad. In 2000, Russell Corp. acquired the apparel operations for Haas Outdoors, Inc.. This later became the [[Mossy Oak]] Apparel Company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/48/Russell-Corporation.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the company added the [[Bike Athletic Company]] and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] to its holding. Russell continued its acquisition spree in 2004 by purchasing American Athletic Inc. (AAI), [[Huffy|Huffy Corp.]]'s sports division and [[Brooks Sports]]. It also secured an extended contract to provide Spalding and Huffy branded products to the National Basketball Association.

The company faced challenges in 2005 due to rising costs and falling sales. During Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, over 40 containers of Russell products were lost or destroyed and nearly 70 percent of the ports it used for shipping were closed. Amid intense competition and faltering profits, the company launched a restructuring plan much like the effort of the late 1990s. Russell continued shifting its manufacturing base overseas and cut a total of 2,300 jobs.

Conglomerate [[Berkshire Hathaway|Berkshire Hathaway Inc]]. acquired Russell Corporation for $600 million in early 2006. Berkshire, led by the billionaire [[Warren Buffett]], believed Russell would be a good fit with its [[Fruit of the Loom|Fruit of the Loom Inc]]. subsidiary.&lt;ref name=refbusiness/&gt;

==Honduran labor controversy and boycott==
[[File:StudentsMarchOnRussellHQ.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Members of United Students Against Sweatshops march outside of Russell Corporation's offices in Atlanta, GA.]]
Since January 2009, Russell faced the largest collegiate [[boycott]] of an apparel company in history over labor violations in its Honduran factories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/business/24sweat.html?_r=2&amp;ref=business "Michigan Is the Latest University to End a Licensing Deal With an Apparel Maker"], New York Times, February 23, 2009 (retrieved July 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonior, David (February 13, 2009).

United Students Against Sweatshops.  Retrieved July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Worker Rights Consortium]] has documented violations of the rights of workers by Russell in its factory Jerzees de Honduras. The report found that Russell illegally fired nearly 2,000 in two of its factories, in retaliation for employees protesting against working conditions and forming a union. The report also stated that death threats were allegedly made against some members of the union, though not by senior management.&lt;ref name="WRC"&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; In response, over eighty universities have canceled their contracts with Russell, including [[Duke University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Columbia University]], [[University of Michigan]], [[University of Miami]], [[University of Maryland]], [[University of Washington]], [[University of Houston]], [[Penn State University]], [[Rutgers University]], [[University of Minnesota-Twin Cities]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Purdue University]], [[Cornell University]], [[University of Florida]], and the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Bonior"&gt;{{citation

On May 13, 2009, sixty-five [[United States House of Representatives|members of Congress]] wrote to Russell CEO John Holland to express their concern over the labor violations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hare.house.gov/uploads/Russell%20Letter.pdf "Letter from Congressmembers to Russell"]. Retrieved July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 25, 2009, Russell became the first collegiate licensee to be placed on [[probation]] by the [[Fair Labor Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairlabor.org/images/NewsandPublications/NewsReleasesandStatements2009/board_resolution_russell_jun.25.09.pdf "FLA Board Resolution"], Fair Labor Association, June 25, 2009 (retrieved July 31, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Russell said it was being unfairly targeted by the garment workers' union and student activists, and that the plant closure was due to the general downturn in the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailycardinal.com/article/22040&lt;/ref&gt; Five schools announced they planned to continue doing business with Russell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/02/28/techrussell0228.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/40305312.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, at least one of those, the [[University of Florida]], has since terminated its licensing deal with Russell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/college/article1007472.ece "University of Florida cuts sportswear ties with Russell Athletic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608052000/http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/college/article1007472.ece |date=2009-06-08 }}, ''St. Petersburg Times'', June 5, 2009 (retrieved July 31, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090530/ARTICLES/905301014/1105/NEWS?Title=UF-terminates-licensing-agreement-with-Russell-Athletic "UF terminates licensing agreement with Russell Athletic Officials with UF and Russell would not make additional comments."], ''Gainesville Sun'', May 29, 2009 (retrieved July 31, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The company had issued a statement noting that it had recognized the unionization of the Jerzees de Honduras plant on October 3, 2007. In later statements, the company admitted wrongdoing, although the violations are yet to be resolved.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russellsocialresponsibility.com "Russell Athletic open letter"], July 15, 2009 (retrieved July 31, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorships==
Throughout its history, Russell Corporation has been involved in the manufacturing and selling of equipment for many professional, collegiate and high school sports teams. Most notable of these are its stint of manufacturing uniforms for [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] (through its flagship brand, [[Russell Athletic (brand)|Russell Athletic]]), the production of official basketballs for the [[NBA]] (through its subsidiary [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]]), and the production of official footballs for the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] (under the [[Sherrin]] Brand).

Shooting is easily the most common way for [[Scoring in association football|goals to be scored]]. It is done using the feet; using the head, i.e. heading the ball, is the second most common way in which goals are scored.&lt;ref name="The Soccer Shooting Guide"/&gt;

== Types of shots ==

* [[Instep]] drive: This shot is done with the laces of a boot and is widely used. The ball is struck through with the laces or the top part of the foot. The shot is powerful but less accurate.&lt;ref name="The Soccer Shooting Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-training-guide.com/soccer-shooting.html |title=The Soccer Shooting Guide |publisher=Soccer-training-guide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Curl (football)|Swerve shot]]: This shot is made using the side of the foot (or the outside of the foot on occasion) and is usually but not exclusively used in [[Direct free kick|free kick]]s. The ball bends or swerves in such a way that it beats the keeper, the only drawback is that it lacks great power.&lt;ref name="The Soccer Shooting Guide"/&gt;
* [[Chip (association football)|Chip]]: Also known as the lob, this shot focuses on getting the ball to a certain amount of vertical height, where the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] can't reach it and then have it come back down again into goal, it takes a certain amount of technique and precision to do and players such as [[Raúl González]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Romário]], [[Francesco Totti]], [[Alessandro Del Piero]] and [[Lionel Messi]] have made it trademark moves.&lt;ref name="The Soccer Shooting Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/02/22/58adac0ae5fdea9b038b45d2.html|title=The art of the chip: Falcao matches Totti, Messi and Raul|publisher=Marca|author1=Joel del Río|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/48791/baggio%E2%80%99s-month-may|title=Baggio’s month of May|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Dave Taylor|date=5 May 2014|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/150issue/delpieroicon.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104150909/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/150issue/delpieroicon.html|archivedate=4 January 2009|title=Calcio Italia 150 issue, Calcio Icons, Del Piero|publisher=Channel4.com|last=Gilbert|first=Dan|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development of sports ==
Historically many sports have developed their sporting equipment over time. For instance, the use of a football dates back to ancient China, between 225 BC and 220 AD.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm|title=History|website=www.soccerballworld.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As football remains the most popular sport in the [[21st century]], the material of the ball has completely changed over the centuries; from being made out of animal skin, to being lined with multiple layers of polyester or cotton.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the sporting equipment industry improves, so does the athletes performance. This is due to the fact that the equipment is more efficient, lighter and stronger it forming a bio-mechanical system, interacting with the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12283-015-0183-5 | volume=18| issue=4|journal=Sports Engineering|pages=191–202| title=Biomechanics research and sport equipment development| year=2015| last1=Stefanyshyn| first1=Darren J.| last2=Wannop| first2=John W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the massive adoption of wearable, new sport equipment tend to be electronics and connected to deliver data performances.

The '''Taça de Cabo Verde''' (Portuguese for the '''Cape Verdean Cup''', also as the '''Capeverdean Cup''') is the main knock-out football tournament of the [[Cape Verde]] islands.

==History==
The first edition took place in 1982 and was only broadcast on radio, television broadcasts did not began until 1997, its first telecast of the cup competition began in 2007.  Most of the matches, all of the semis and finals were broadcast on TCV and RCV.  Some of the matches were broadcast on regional television and radio including [[Rádio Barlavento]] and [[Rádio Praia]] (or AM Praia).

From the 2013 edition, the winner competes in the [[Cape Verdean Cup]], the only time done was [[CD Onze Unidos|Onze Unidos]], the 2012 cup winner.

There had been no cup competitions since 2013 and is uncertain about the cancellation of recent tournaments. With the National Championships held in 2017 which originally to finish in July and extended into late-August, the 2017 national cup competition was again not held.  It is one of the countries in Africa which a football cup competition was held for just five seasons.
