[[File:The world in 500 CE.PNG|thumb|300px|The world at the beginning of the 6th century AD.]]

The '''6th century''' is the period from [[501]] to [[600]] in accordance with the [[Julian calendar]] in the [[Common Era]]. In the West, this century marks the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]]. Following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] late in the previous century, Europe fractured into many small Germanic Kingdoms, which competed fiercely for land and wealth. From this upheaval the [[Franks]] rose to prominence, and carved out a sizeable domain encompassing much of modern France and Germany. Meanwhile, the surviving [[Eastern Roman Empire]] began to expand under the emperor [[Justinian]], who eventually recaptured North Africa from the [[Vandals]], and attempted to fully recover [[Italy]] as well in the hope of re-establishing Roman control over the lands once ruled by the [[Western Roman Empire]].

During its second Golden Age, the [[Sassanid Empire]] reached the peak of its power under [[Khosrau I]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Roberts, J 1994"&gt;Roberts, J: "History of the World.". Penguin, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The classical [[Gupta Empire]] of [[Northern India]], largely overrun by the [[Huna (people)|Huna]], ended in the mid-6th century. In [[Japan]], the [[Kofun period]] gave way to the [[Asuka period]]. After being divided for more than 150 years into the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], [[History of China|China]] was reunited under the [[Sui Dynasty]] toward the end of the 6th century. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] persisted throughout the 6th century. The [[Göktürks]] became a major power in [[Central Asia]] after defeating the [[Rouran]].

In the [[Americas]], [[Teotihuacan]] began to decline in the 6th century after having reached its zenith between AD 150 and 450. Classic Period of the [[Maya civilization]] in [[Central America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1941">'''Albert of Castile''' (c. 1460–1522) was a [[Roman Catholic]] historian. He entered the [[Order of St. Dominic]] at an early age in the Convent of SSts. John and Paul at [[Venice]] and became skilled in nearly every department of contemporary learning.

History, however, was his chief study. He is the author of several noteworthy works, among which may be mentioned; "Catalogus Illustrium Ordinis Virorum" (Venice, 1501); "Catalogus Sanctorum a [[Petrus de Natalibus|Petro de Natalibus]] Veneto eregione Costellana episcopo Equilino concinnatus" (Venice, 1501); "Chronica brevis ab initio ordinis usque ad praesens tempus" (Venice, 1504); an account of the Popes, the Dominican Generals, and the illustrious men of the Order, beginning with its foundation, drawn up chiefly from the work of the Dominican [[Giacomo de Luzato]].

He is also the editor of the following works: "Biblia Latina cum pleno apparatu tersissime et nitidissime impressa" (Venice, 1506); this he re-edited fifteen years later with a concordance of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s; "Pontificale secundum ritum Romanae Ecclesiae emendatum primum a Jacobo de Lutiis episcopo Cafacensi et Joanne Buckardo" (Venice, 1520); "Constitutiones ord. Praed., una cum adjectis ad singulos textus opportune declarationibus" (Venice, 1507); "Liber de instructione officialium venerabilis Humberti magistri ordinis V" (Venice, 1507); "Regula et privilegia Fratrum et Sororum de poenitentia impugnantes Fratres Praedicatores, quod non vivant secundum vitam apostolicam, a [[Jacob de Voragine|Jacobo de Voragine]], O.P. archiepiscopo Januensi" (Venice, 1504)

'''Alberto G. Valveavellano''' ([[Guatemala City]], 5 August 1861 - Guatemala City, 16 July 1928) was the first landscape and sports photographer of [[Guatemala]].

== Biography ==
Little is known about Valdeavellano family and personal life; his parents got married on 25 October 1851 and had seven children.  Valdeavellano was the fourth of the couple's children. He grew up and got educated during the Liberal Reform in the 1870s and 1880s, he became an anticlerical agnostic, something not uncommon for the educated youth of those decades in Guatemala.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|n.d.|p=}}

He graduated high school at the then prestigious Instituto Nacional for boys, where he was classmate with [[Rafael Spinola|Rafael Spínola]] - who would later become editor in chief of ''[[La Ilustración Guatemalteca]]'' and ''La Idea Liberal'' and eventually secretary of Infrastructure of president [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]]-; Spínola described him in 1896 as a consumed artist that used to draw his classmates and teacher while in class.{{sfn|Spínola|1896|p=174}}

Given his talent as cartoonist and painter, he used it to work on photographic techniques, something that he has in common with most of photography pioneers in Guatemala, especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Valdeavellano learnt his profession from Emilio Herbruger ca. 1880, who owner "Fotografía Imperial" and where he worked together with Juan J. de Jesús Yas and Luis de la Riva Ruiz. After a while, he moved on to work with Eduardo J. Kildare in "Palacio de Artes", when the American photographer left Herbruger's shop.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|n.d.|p=}}

Towards the end of the 1890s, he worked with an associate in "Fernández and Valdeavellano" under the name of "El Siglo XX" ("The 20th century").  By then he lived in an Arabic style residence in [[Guatemala City]] and had a constant stream of socialites that wanted a portrait; some of his best work was published on biweekly basis in the ''[[La Ilustración Guatemalteca]]''.{{sfn|Spínola|1896|p=174-175}}

After a trip to Europe, his studio became "El Arte Nuevo" in the 1900s and towards the end of his live, we formed the "Valdeavellano y Bolaños" company, and worked there until his death in 1928.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|s.f.|p=}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Valdeavellano was a versatile professional photographer which made him the one of choice among the elite and middle classes in Guatemala to make their portraits; he became quite famous and also was the first sports photographers in the country as his cycling pictures show.  Several of those sports pictures were published in ''[[La Ilustración Guatemalteca]]'' between 1896 and 1897. For the first issue of that cultural magazine he took the first ever instant photograph made in Guatemala on 28 June 1896, a picture of president general [[José María Reina Barrios]], on his horse observing some military drills.{{sfn|Valdeavellano|1896|p=15}}

He travelled non-stop all across Guatemala capturing the rural landscape, the roads and the railways;  he would picture colonial monuments or Maya temples in [[Quiriguá]]. He was able to get many images of Guatemala with his lens and made an extraordinary effort of getting them to the public, but in Guatemala and overseas.  He printed postcards and posters of the main cities in Guatemala, such as [[Guatemala City]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Antigua Guatemala]] and [[Amatitlán]].{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|s.f.|p=}}

== Death ==

Died in Guatemala City on 16 July 1928, as a result of a liver problem, in his own home, located on East fourth street #26, across the streef from the Santa Teresa Catholic Church.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|s.f.|p=}} Valdeavellano never married and did not have any children, but led a plentiful family life with his siblings, nieces and nephews.

The '''American Society for Legal History''' is a learned society dedicated to promoting scholarship and teaching in the field of [[legal history]]. It was founded in 1956 and has an international scope, despite being based in [[the United States]]. It sponsors the [[peer-review]]ed journal ''[[Law and History Review]]'' and the book series ''Studies in Legal History'', both of which are published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/aslh |title=American Society for Legal History |website=Cambridge Core |language=en |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the Society established the ''[[American Journal of Legal History]]'', which the Society originally published as its official journal. The journal was later acquired by the [[Temple University Beasley School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pv7sAgAAQBAJ |title=Journals of the Century |last=Cole |first=Jim |last2=Stankus |first2=Tony |date=2014-02-25 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317720140|page=236 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.acls.org/ |title=American Society for Legal History |website=American Council of Learned Societies |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9768">'''Andrés de San Martín''' (b. [[Seville]] - d. [[Cebu]], 1521) was the chief pilot-cosmographer of the ''Armada del Maluco'', the fleet commanded by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1519.

His nationality has been variously identified as Portuguese or French but archival records published in 1997 show San Martín was born in Seville.&lt;ref name="Mena"/&gt; [[Antonio Pigafetta]] wrote he was from Seville, and there's every reason to believe the Vicentine diarist who knew the astrologer although they were not in the same ''nao''; Pigafetta was in the flagship ''Trinidad'', while San Martín was assigned at first in ''San Antonio'' but later transferred to ''Victoria''.

== Family ==
Andrés de San Martín was born in Seville, the son of Juan de Logroño and Juana Hernández. He had at least one brother, Cristóbal de San Martín, who was his heir. Andrés de San Martín had two daughters, Juana and María, with his partner Ana Martín, whom he never married.&lt;ref name="Mena"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Escuela de Estudios Hispano-Americanos| pages = 41–60| editors = Mª Justina Sarabia Viejo, Javier Ortiz de la Tabla Ducasse, Pablo E.

== Exceptional pilot of the Renaissance ==
Little is known of San Martín's life before 1512, when King Ferdinand commissioned him royal pilot.

His knowledge of cosmography (astrology) was singular. He knew more than others during the Age of Discovery how astronomical science could be applied to navigation. Confident of his unique skills he applied for the post of pilot major of Spain upon the death in 1512 of its holder, Amerigo Vespucci. He was unfortunately turned down by the King who appointed instead Juan Díaz de Solís. He again applied for the post in 1518 when Solís died. Again he was turned down in favor of another foreigner, Sebastian Cabot. Nevertheless, the King consoled San Martín by raising his pay to 10,000 maravedis.

He reported for duty upon order of the King sometime in July 1519. He received advances on July 31, 1519 of 30,000 maravedis and 7,500 maravedis for cost-of-living allowance.

At Rio de Janeiro, San Martín left ''San Antonio'' and transferred to ''Victoria'' where he remained until his presumed death at Cebu on May 1, 1521. There is no certainty he was one of those killed there. There were reliable reports later that some eight survived the massacre.

== Measurement of longitude ==
Andrés de San Martín, according to Tim Joyner, was the most eminent cosmographer in the fleet, unequaled by no one in the fleet, not even by the greatest mariner of all time, Ferdinand Magellan. Twice, he was able to calculate accurately, using astronomical measurement, the longitudes of two places, Port San Julian at Patagonia and Homonhon Island in the Philippines. At San Julian, he brought out his instruments, to quote Tim Joyner, "to test Faleiro's [Rodrigo (Ruy) Failero] system for using conjunctions of the moon with the planets to determine longitude. His measurements resulted in the astonishingly accurate estimate of 61° west of Seville. Less than one degree in error, this was an accomplishment far beyond the capabilities of the other pilots."

Again, at Homonhon Island, in central Philippines, he was able to measure its longitude, according to [[Rolando Laguarda Trías]]. Laguarda asserts that the reading of 189° longitude "from the meridian" which meant the line of demarcation at 47° ''west'' of Greenwich. In today's system of reckoning Homonhon Is. is at 125° 42.8' ''east'' longitude. This reading is only two degrees in error, Laguarda asserts. No other had shown such mathematical skill. Indeed, for two hundred years his calculations were not matched by anyone.

== San Martín's papers ==
San Martín entrusted his priceless navigational notes and other papers to [[Ginés de Mafra]] sometime before May 1, 1521. These were confiscated when de Mafra together with co-prisoners [[Gómez de Espinosa]] and [[Hans Bergen]] reached Lisbon in July 1526. This lengthy possession by de Mafra of San Martín's papers has led to the belief voiced by geographer [[Donald D. Brand]] and embraced by Magellan historiographer [[Martin Torodash]], who is cited by Philippine religious historian John Schummacher, S.J., for Brand's dictum, that the eyewitness account of [[Ginés de Mafra]] is nothing more than his recall of what he read from San Martín's papers. This has led to historians overall disregarding the testimony of de Mafra which has overarching importance in Age of Discovery geography of the Philippine region.

In fact, because de Mafra's observations may reflect as well the genius of San Martín, his testimony becomes doubly important.
De Mafra's account, more precisely, is critical and indispensable in solving the Mazaua landfall issue which is also known in the Philippines as the '[[First mass in the Philippines]]'  controversy.

San Martín's papers were kept at a Lisbon archive where these were consulted by Portuguese historians like [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]], [[Gaspar Corrêa]], [[Damião de Góis]], [[João de Barros]], and others.

San Martín's papers were later transferred to Madrid during the union of the Iberian kingdoms, 1580-1640. [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]], as asserted by [[J. Denucé]], extensively used San Martín's insights. One of the key observations of the astrologer pertaining the March–April 1521 incident at the island-port of [[Mazaua]] remained the sole faithful published account throughout the 16th century until the 19th century with the exact name of the island. Other accounts had either "Messana" or "Massana" as the island's name. These two names were first used by [[Maximilianus Transylvanus]] in his report of the circumnavigation contained in a letter to Cardinal Matthäus Lang, the archbishop of Salzburg. Transylvanus' report was published and became an overnight sensation in Europe. San Martín's papers unfortunately got lost and are nowhere to be found. They exist in the various quotes by contemporary Portuguese historians and later Spanish historians like Herrera.

{{Bridgewater Canal map}}
The '''Bridgewater Canal''' connects [[Runcorn]], [[Manchester]] and [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], in [[North West England]]. It was commissioned by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], to transport coal from his mines in [[Worsley]] to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester, and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh.

The [[canal]] is connected to the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] via a lock at Cornbrook; to the [[Rochdale Canal]] in Manchester; to the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at [[Preston Brook]], southeast of Runcorn; and to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] at Leigh. It once connected with the [[River Mersey]] at Runcorn but has since been cut off by a slip road to the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]].

Often, although mistakenly, considered to be the first true canal in England, it required the construction of an [[navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]] to cross the [[River Irwell]], one of the first of its kind. Its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in Britain, known as [[Canal Mania]]. It later faced intense competition from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the [[Macclesfield Canal]]. Navigable throughout its history, it is one of the few canals in Britain not to have been nationalised, and remains privately owned. Pleasure craft now use the canal which forms part of the [[Cheshire Ring]] network of canals.

== Design and construction ==
[[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], owned some of the coal mines dug to supply [[North West England]] with fuel for the [[steam engine]]s instrumental in powering England's [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=pb15&gt;{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chal34&gt;{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1963|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The duke transported his coal along the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] and also by [[packhorse]], but each method was inefficient and expensive; river transport was subject to the vagaries of river navigation,&lt;ref&gt;Vessels were affected by tide levels, and the shared use of water by industry&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount of coal packhorses could carry was limited by its relative weight.{{sfn|Kindleberger|1993|p=192|ps=}}  The duke's underground mines also suffered from persistent flooding, caused by the [[geology]] of the Middle [[Coal Measures]], where the [[Worsley Four Foot mine|coal seam]] lies beneath a layer of permeable [[sandstone]].

Having visited the [[Canal du Midi]] in France and watched the construction of the [[Sankey Canal]] in England,&lt;ref name=Penninewaterways&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Bridgewater Canal |url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/bridgewater/bri2.htm |publisher=Pennine Waterways |accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the duke's solution to these problems was to build an underground canal at Worsley, connected to a surface canal between [[Worsley]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].&lt;ref name="Priestleyp89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Priestley|1831|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to easing overland transport difficulties and providing drainage for his mines, an underground canal would provide a reliable source of water for the surface canal, and also eliminate the need to lift the coal to the surface (an expensive and difficult proposition). The canal boats would carry {{convert|30|LT}} at a time, pulled by only one horse&amp;nbsp;– more than ten times the amount of cargo per horse that was possible with a cart.{{sfn|N/A|1978|p=990|ps=}}  The duke and his estate manager [[John Gilbert (agent)|John Gilbert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coal and Water&amp;nbsp;— The Bridgewater Canal, John Gilbert |url=http://www.peak41.co.uk/coalandwater/johngilbert.html |publisher=Mike Higginbottom |accessdate=14 August 2008|format= – &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3ACoal+and+Water%26nbsp%3B%E2%80%94+The+Bridgewater+Canal%2C+John+Gilbert&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718221904/http://www.peak41.co.uk/coalandwater/johngilbert.html |archivedate=18 July 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a plan of the canal, and in 1759 obtained an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]], enabling its construction.&lt;ref name="Priestleyp89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=129-bw |title=Bridgewater Estates Collection |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|An Act to enable the most noble Francis Duke of Bridgewater, to make a navigable cut or canal from a certain place in the township of Salford, to or near Worsley Mill, and Middlewood, in the manor of Worsley, and to or near a place called Hollin Ferry, in the county palatine of Lancaster. 32nd George II.}}

[[James Brindley]] was brought in for his technical expertise (having previously installed a pumping system at the nearby [[Wet Earth Colliery]]), and after a six-day visit suggested varying the route of the proposed canal away from Salford, instead taking it across the [[River Irwell]] to [[Stretford]] and thereon into Manchester.&lt;ref name="Skemptonp76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Skempton|2002|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This route would make connecting to any future canals much easier, and would also increase competition with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation company.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Boughey, Joseph. (1998) Hadfield's British Canals, Sutton Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7509-1840-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mather|1970|p=xvi|ps=}}  Brindley moved into [[Worsley Old Hall]] and spent 46&amp;nbsp;days surveying the proposed route, which to cross the Irwell would require the construction of an aqueduct at [[Barton-upon-Irwell]].&lt;ref name=chal34/&gt;  At the duke's behest, in January 1760 Brindley also travelled to London to give evidence before a [[parliamentary committee]].  The duke therefore gained a second Act of Parliament, which superseded the original.&lt;ref name="Priestleyp89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skemptonp76"/&gt;{{efn|An Act to enable the most noble Francis Duke of Bridgewater, to make a navigable cut or canal from a certain place in the township of Salford, over the Irwell, to the town of Manchester, in the county palatine of Lancaster, and to or near Longford Bridge, in the township of Stretford, in the said county.}}

Brindley's planned route began at Worsley and passed southeast through [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]], before turning south to cross the River Irwell on the [[Barton Aqueduct]]. From there it continued southeast along the edge of [[Trafford Park]], and then east into Manchester. Although a connection with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation was included in the new Act, at Hulme Locks in [[Castlefield]] (on land previously occupied by [[Hulme Hall, Hulme|Hulme Hall]]), this was not completed until 1838. The terminus would be at Castlefield Basin, where the nearby [[River Medlock]] was to help supply the canal with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Salford Hundred, Ancestry, Annals and History |url=http://www.mancuniensis.info/WorsleyFPX.htm |publisher=Elaine and Roger Hart, Bolton, Greater Manchester |accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boats would unload their cargoes inside the duke's purpose-built warehouse.  There were no locks in Brindley's design, demonstrating{{clarify|whose opinion?|date=January 2011}} his ability as a competent engineer.&lt;ref name="Skemptonp76"/&gt;  The Barton Aqueduct was built relatively quickly for the time; work commenced in September 1760 and the first boat crossed on 17&amp;nbsp;July 1761.{{sfn|Collins|1812|p=213|ps=}}

The duke invested a large sum of money in the scheme. From Worsley to Manchester its construction cost £168,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|168000|1761|r=-1}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}{{sfn|Timbs|1860|p=363|ps=}} but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.&lt;ref name=Bridgewatercollieries&gt;{{citation |title=The Times newspaper: Bridgewater Collieries |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=1 December 1913 |accessdate=19 July 2008 |location=London |first1=Rachel |last1=Sylvester |first2=Sam |last2=Coates}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as [[Canal Mania]].{{sfn|Kindleberger|1993|pp=192–193|ps=}} Along with its stone aqueduct at Barton-upon-Irwell, the Bridgewater Canal was considered a major engineering achievement. One commentator wrote that when finished, "[the canal] will be the most extraordinary thing in the Kingdom, if not in Europe. The boats in some places are to go underground, and in other places over a navigable river, without communicating with its waters".&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;

In addition to the duke's warehouse at Manchester, more buildings were built by Brindley and extended to Alport Street (now called [[Deansgate]]).&lt;ref name=pb15/&gt;  The warehouses were of timber-frame design, with load-bearing hand-made brick walls, supported on cast iron posts. The duke's warehouse was badly damaged by fire in 1789 but was rebuilt.&lt;ref name=pb15/&gt;&lt;ref name=pb17&gt;{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manchester to Runcorn extension ===
In September 1761, with his assistant Hugh Oldham,{{sfn|Skempton|2002|p=79|ps=}} Brindley surveyed an extension from Longford Bridge to Hempstones, near [[Halton, Cheshire]].&lt;ref name="Skemptonp76"/&gt;  He assisted in obtaining Parliamentary approval for the Bridgewater Canal Extension Act of 1762&lt;ref&gt;An Act to enable the most noble Francis Duke of Bridgewater, to make a navigable cut or canal from Longford Bridge, in the township of Stretford, in the county palatine of Lancaster, to the River Mersey, at a place called the Hempstones, in the township of Halton, in the county of Chester.&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the construction of an extension to the canal, from Manchester, to the River Mersey at [[Runcorn]].&lt;ref name=chal35&gt;{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1963|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite objections from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company,&lt;ref name="Skemptonp76"/&gt; [[Royal assent]] was given on 24&amp;nbsp;March 1762.&lt;ref name=anon29&gt;{{Harvnb|Anon|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A junction, Waters Meeting, was created in [[Trafford Park]], at which the new extension branched south through [[Stretford]], [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], [[Altrincham]], [[Lymm]] and finally to [[Runcorn]].

In December 1761 Brindley undertook a survey of the route at Runcorn. His initial plan was to make the terminus at Hempstones, east of Runcorn Gap,&lt;!-- where the Mersey narrows between the town of Runcorn and a promontory which was to later form part of the town of [[Widnes]] - not certain this is relevant so will leave hidden for now--&gt; but following a study of the tides and depth of water there, he decided instead to build the terminus west of Runcorn Gap.{{sfn|Starkey|1990|p=125|ps=}}  This change was designed to accommodate [[Mersey Flat|Mersey flats]], although the low fixed bridges required that traffic on the canal be able to lower or unship their masts.&lt;ref name=st13&gt;{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Runcorn basin was almost {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} above the Mersey,{{sfn|Nickson|1887|p=159|ps=}} so a flight of ten locks, described as "the wonder of their time",{{sfn|Starkey|1990|p=127|ps=}} was built to connect the two.  Nine locks had a fall of {{convert|2|m|ft|0}}, with a fall at the river lock of more than {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} at low water. It allowed vessels to enter and leave the canal on any [[tide]]. The connection to the Mersey was made on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1773.&lt;ref name=st126/&gt;  The river's tidal action tended to deposit [[silt]] around the lower entrance to the locks, so to counteract this a channel, equipped with gates at each end and known as the Duke's Gut, was cut through the marshes upriver from the locks.  At high tide the gates were closed, and with the ebb of the tide were opened to release water, which scoured the silt from the entrance to the locks.  The cut created an island, known as Runcorn Island, crossed by Castle Bridge.{{sfn|1970|p=20}}{{sfn|Starkey|1990|pp=128–129|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;It was known as Castle Bridge because it made a connection with a rocky promontory which had once been the site of a castle built by [[Ethelfleda]] to defend her kingdom of [[Mercia]] from [[Viking]] invasion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection to Manchester was delayed by [[Brooke baronets|Sir Richard Brooke]] of [[Norton Priory]]. Concerned that boatmen might poach his game and wildfowl, Brooke did not want the canal to pass through his land. The Act included several stipulations: the canal should not come within {{convert|325|m|ft|0}} of his house; the towpath should be on the south side of the canal, furthest away from Brooke's house; there should be no quays, buildings, hedges or fences to obstruct the view; no vessels were to be moored within {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} of the house, other than during construction.  Eventually, though, a compromise was reached.  This included the construction of a link to the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at [[Preston Brook]] (permitted by the Trent and Mersey Canal Act of 1766),{{sfn|Priestley|1831|p=90|ps=}} and the building of the canal's terminus to the west of Runcorn Gap.&lt;ref name=st126/&gt;  The Trent and Mersey link gave the Duke access to the Midlands, and forestalled the Weaver Trustees from making their own junction with the canal.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=xvi–xvii|ps=}} The new extension also met with opposition from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, until the duke purchased a controlling interest in the company.&lt;ref name=chal35/&gt;  The first part of the new extension was opened in 1767,&lt;ref name="Chalonerp36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1963|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and completed in full by March 1776,&lt;ref name=st126&gt;{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Brindley did not live to see its completion; it was continued by his brother-in-law, [[Hugh Henshall]].&lt;ref name=anon29/&gt;

The total cost of the canal, from Worsley to Manchester and from Longford Bridge to the Mersey at Runcorn, was £220,000.{{sfn|Nickson|1887|p=161|ps=}}  Alongside the Mersey, the duke built [[Port of Runcorn|Runcorn Dock]], several warehouses, and [[Bridgewater House, Runcorn|Bridgewater House]], a temporary home from which he could supervise operations at the Runcorn end.  Two locks up from the tideway was a small [[dry dock]].&lt;ref name=st13/&gt;

=== Sale to Stockport branch ===
In 1766 the Duke gained a fourth act of parliament for a branch canal between [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale Moor]] and [[Stockport]] which was to follow the valley of the Mersey.  The Act was applied for to counter a proposed canal that would give the towns of [[Stockport]] and [[Macclesfield]] access to the Mersey, via the [[River Weaver]].&lt;ref name="Chalonerp36"/&gt;  The work was not done, the Act lapsed and this section of canal was never built.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=1765 - From Sale to Stockport|url=http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/timeline5.html|publisher=The Manchester Ship Canal Company|accessdate=14 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121224755/http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/timeline5.html|archivedate=21 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over two decades later, the nearby [[Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal]] had sought a connection to other waterways, and it appears that the Duke had planned to limit the activities of the new company.  On 15 December 1792 the Duke purchased a portion of the [[Ringspiggot]] estate in Salford which blocked the MB&amp;BC's plans to build a riverside basin and wharfs there.&lt;ref name="Tomlinsonp33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|1991|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worsley to Leigh extension ===
In 1795 the duke secured a fifth Act which enabled him to extend the canal a further {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from Worsley via [[Boothstown]], [[Astley, Greater Manchester|Astley Green]] and [[Bedford, Greater Manchester|Bedford]] to Leigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1795 – From Worsley to Leigh |url=http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/timeline6.html |publisher=The Manchester Ship Canal Company |accessdate=14 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121225106/http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/timeline6.html |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chal37&gt;{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1963|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new extension enabled the supply to Manchester of coal from Leigh and the surrounding districts.{{sfn|Smiles|2006|p=272|ps=}}  On 21 June 1819 an Act of Parliament was enacted to create a link between this extension and the [[Wigan]] branch of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]].{{sfn|Tomlinson|1991|p=44|ps=}}

Access to the canal brought about a rapid development in coal mining on the [[Manchester Coalfield]] west of Worsley. Chaddock pits in the east of Tyldesley were connected to an underground level from Worsley. In 1820, to ease congestion at the Delph in Worsley, Chaddock Pit was connected to the canal at Boothstown basin by an underground canal, the Chaddock Level which ran in a north west direction from the canal at Boothstown to the pit.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=31–32|ps=}} Sometime after 1840 Samuel Jackson built a narrow gauge tramroad worked by horses from his [[Astley and Tyldesley Collieries|Gin Pit Colliery]] to Marsland Green where he installed cranes and tipplers to load barges at a wharf. The tramroad was later worked by locomotives.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=148|ps=}} In 1867 the [[Fletcher, Burrows and Company|Fletchers]] built a private railway line and the Bedford Basin with facilities for loading coal from [[Howe Bridge]] onto barges. [[Astley Green Colliery]] began winding coal on the north bank of the canal in 1912. In the 1940s and '50s coal was sent to [[Barton Power Station]] and Runcorn Gas Works.{{sfn|Sweeney|1997|p=332|ps=}}

Upon completion of the [[Rochdale Canal]] in 1804, the two canals were joined at Castlefield.&lt;ref name=pb17/&gt;{{sfn|Pickering|1807|p=663|ps=}}  This connection may have been a factor in the failure of the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal Company's rival scheme to build a canal between [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] and Sladen.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1991|pp=34–35|ps=}}  The River Medlock, a major source of water for the canal and which was almost as badly polluted as the nearby Irwell, was diverted through a tunnel under the canal at Castlefield by [[Charles Edward Cawley]], a civil engineer for the [[County Borough of Salford|Salford Corporation]] and later [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for Salford.  The canal was from that point supplied by the much purer water of the Rochdale Canal.{{sfn|Corbett|1974|p=41|ps=}}

=== Mines ===
{{Main|Worsley Navigable Levels}}
Worsley Delph, in Worsley, originally a centuries-old [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] near Worsley Brook, was the entrance to the Navigable Levels. It is now a [[Scheduled Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite PastScape |num=44278 |desc=Worsley Delph |access-date=30 December 2007 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two entrances, built years apart, allow access to the specially built M-boats (also known as [[Starvationers]]), the largest of which could carry {{convert|12|LT}} of coal. Inside the mines {{convert|46|mi|km|0}} of underground canal on four levels, linked by inclined planes, were constructed. The mines ceased production in 1887.&lt;ref name=BLW11&gt;Ware (1989), p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the canal passes through Worsley, [[iron oxide]] from the mines has, for many years, stained the water bright orange. The removal of this colouration is currently the subject of a £2.5&amp;nbsp;million remedial scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transformation of Worsley's Orange Canal |url=http://www.coal.gov.uk/media//94807/Page%208%20and%209%20Enviro%20Issue%2013.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=15 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327152417/http://www.coal.gov.uk/media//94807/Page%208%20and%209%20Enviro%20Issue%2013.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traffic ===
In 1791 the mines at Worsley produced {{convert|100282|LT}} of coal, {{convert|60461|LT}} of which were "sold down the navigation";&lt;ref name=chal37/&gt; {{convert|12000|LT}} of [[Halite|rocksalt]] was also transported from [[Cheshire]].  Sales of coal were £19,455, and nearly £30,000 was earned from other cargoes.  Passenger traffic in 1791 brought in receipts of £3,781.&lt;ref name=chal37/&gt;

The canal also carried passengers and was in keen competition with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company (M&amp;IN).  The journey down river by the latter route took eight hours (nine hours in the up direction) while the journey on the Bridgewater canal took nine hours each way.  Fares were similar but the Bridgewater route was said to be "more picturesque".{{sfn|Starkey|1990|p=130|ps=}} [[Boating]] men also used the canal.  They lifted their small lightweight boats out of the M&amp;IN at Runcorn, and carried them a short distance up the steep streets onto the Bridgewater Canal.{{sfn|Corbett|1974|p=40|ps=}}

Barges on the canal continued to be towed by horses until the middle of the 19th century, when they were replaced by steam-powered boats after a fatal epidemic spread through the horse population. The "dense smoke" produced by the steam barges and their "harsh unnecessary whistling" proved unpopular with some local residents, who also began to suffer from a condition known as canal throat, "no doubt caused by the foul emanations given off by its [the Bridgewater Canal's] horribly filthy water".&lt;ref name=AspinP48&gt;{{Harvnb|Aspin|1995|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canal carried commercial freight traffic until 1975; the last regular cargo was grain from Liverpool to Manchester for BOCM. It is now used mainly by pleasure craft and hosts two [[sport rowing|rowing]] clubs&amp;nbsp;– Trafford Rowing Club and Manchester University Boat Club.

== Bridgewater Trustees ==
The Duke of Bridgewater died on 8 March 1803.  By his will the income from the canal was to be paid to his nephew [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|George Leveson-Gower]], the Marquess of Stafford (later the 1st Duke of Sutherland).  On his death it was to go to Stafford's second son [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Francis]], provided he changed his name to Egerton; and then to his heirs and successors. The management of the company was placed in the hands of three trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=xviii–xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were [[Archibald Macdonald|Sir Archibald Macdonald]], who was [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], [[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt]], at the time the [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and later the [[Archbishop of York]], and, as Superintendent, [[Robert Haldane Bradshaw]], the Duke's agent. Bradshaw managed the estate, for which he received a salary of £2,000 a year and the use of the duke's mansions at Worsley and Runcorn. The other two trustees had each married nieces of the duke and were "dummy trustees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BridgewaterCanalTradeFigures.png|left|thumb|400px|Value of trade carried on the Bridgewater Canal 1806–71&lt;ref name=mather358&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=358–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the time the canal was administered by the Bridgewater Trustees, it made a profit every year.&lt;ref name=mather358/&gt;  Until his retirement in 1834, the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw. It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was of the order of 13 per cent, and in 1824, the best year, it was 23 per cent.{{sfn|Mather|1970|p=7|ps=}}  Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate, and complained of being over-worked, but he was also regarded as being a "formidable bargainer".{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=10–11|ps=}} In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby [[Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal]] to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner, but his response was delayed.&lt;ref name="Tomlinsonp33"/&gt; In 1810 there was a general agreement with the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] Company (M&amp;IN) to simultaneously raise freight charges. However any cooperation between the two companies was short-lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges. Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal; in 1824 the traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time. However, in time more profit came from "tonnage traffic" (that carried by private companies) than from the Bridgewater's own carriage of freight.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=12–15|ps=}} Bradshaw's administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal, the locks, docks and warehouses. The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke's will.{{sfnp|Mather|1970|pp=21–23|ps=}} There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself.{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=17, 20|ps=}}

During the 1820s there was increased dissatisfaction with the canals. They did not cope well with increasing volumes of cargo, and they were perceived as monopolistic, and the preserve of the landed gentry class.  There was increased interest in the possibility of railway construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possible construction of a railway between Liverpool and Manchester was vigorously opposed by Bradshaw, who refused railway surveyors access to land owned by the Trustees.  When the first [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was presented to parliament in 1825, the Trustees opposed and it was overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later in the year Lord Stafford, possibly persuaded to do so by [[William Huskisson]], invested £100,000 (one-fifth of the required capital), in the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].  Following this the Trustees withdrew their opposition to the construction of the railway; they did not petition against the second bill, which was passed in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as he made his investment in the railway, Lord Stafford advanced £40,000 for improvements to the canal. This was spent mainly on a second line of locks at Runcorn, which were completed in 1828, plus new warehouses at Manchester and Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The additional line of locks cost £35,000&lt;ref name="Starkeyp179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used for traffic heading to Manchester, while the old line was used for traffic passing down to the Mersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Starkey|1983|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830 the new railway opened and by the end of the year was carrying freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the [[Macclesfield Canal]] in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=57–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a [[stroke]], as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=80–82, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters came to a head in 1833, the year in which the canal made its lowest profit since the death of the Duke.&lt;ref name=mather358/&gt; On 19&amp;nbsp;July the Marquess of Stafford (now the 1st Duke of Sutherland) died and the profits from the canal passed to Francis Egerton. On 25&amp;nbsp;September Bradshaw's son, Captain James Bradshaw, who had been acting as a deputy superintendent to the Trustees, and who had been expected to succeed his father as Superintendent, committed suicide. The agent for both Francis Egerton and his older brother, who was now the [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland|2nd Duke of Sutherland]], was [[James Loch]].&lt;ref name=mather84&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The events that followed were "stage-managed by Loch".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported to Francis Egerton that Bradshaw was no longer fit to be Superintendent, and then persuaded Bradshaw to retire on his full salary. It had been expected that he would appoint his other son, William Rigby Bradshaw, as his successor, but Loch persuaded him to appoint James Sothern in the position; Sothern had been the principal agent of the Trust since December 1832. He took over the position of Superintendent on 3&amp;nbsp;February 1834.&lt;ref name=mather84/&gt;  The appointment of Sothern was not a success. Charges were made against him of dishonesty and of nepotism. He entered into disputes and disagreements with Loch, with Francis Egerton, and with the other two trustees. (Sir Archibald Macdonald had died in 1826; by this time his place had been taken by the [[William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon|10th Earl of Devon]]). To avoid a costly lawsuit, at the end of 1836 Sothern agreed to retire on various conditions which included receipt of £45,000. On 1&amp;nbsp;March 1837, he was succeeded as Superintendent by James Loch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loch was extremely busy and did not have time to deal with the detailed administration of the Trust. He therefore looked for a deputy to take on these duties. His first choice was Richard Smith who was the mine agent to the Trustees of the [[John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|1st Earl of Dudley]]. However this was perceived as poaching and it led to such controversy that Smith declined the offer and recommended his son, [[George Samuel Fereday Smith]] for the post. Fereday Smith was appointed as Deputy Superintendent in March 1837 on a salary of £600 a year, half of the salary which had been offered to his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loch immediately undertook a reorganisation of the administration and efficiency of the business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; restored the agreement with the Old Quay Company to raise freight charges, and improved the facilities for passengers, including the introduction of "swift boats".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=105–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1837, the Trustees employed around 3,000&amp;nbsp;people (including those working in the colliery and in Worsley Yard), making it one of the largest employers in the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the death of the Duke the amount of freight carried by the canal had almost trebled; in 1803 it carried {{convert|334495|LT}} of goods and in 1836 {{convert|968795|LT}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 a new dock, the Francis Dock, was opened at Runcorn.&lt;ref name="Starkeyp179"/&gt; The late 1830s and early 1840s had seen increased competition between the Bridgewater Canal on the one hand, and other canal companies and the railways on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=121–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dangerous of the rivals was the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company who started to reduce their rates again in 1840. This led to a price war between the two canal companies and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, who had previously cooperated on rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=152–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, in desperation, the Bridgewater Trustees bought the Mersey and Irwell and took over its ownership on 1 January 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year competition with other canals was further reduced by agreements made with the [[Ellesmere Canal|Ellesmere and Chester Canal]] Company and with the Anderton Carrying Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1844 the canal made a profit of £76,410, the second highest during the time it was administered by the Trustees.&lt;ref name=mather358/&gt;

Having seen off competition from other canal companies, the next major threat was to come from the railways.  This was the period in the mid-1840s known as the [[Railway Mania]].  The railways competed with the canals in three ways; by building, or threatening to build, new lines which would be in direct competition with the canals; by amalgamation into giant companies (such as the [[Midland Railway|Midland]] and the [[London and North Western Railway|London and North Western]] companies), which gave them more political power; and by taking over ownership of canal companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=176–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13&amp;nbsp;April 1844 ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper reported that the canal was to be emptied of water, and converted into a railway,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: The Bridgewater Canal | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1844-04-13-08&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1844-04-13-08-015&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=13 April 1844|accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London |first1=Rachel |last1=Sylvester |first2=Sam |last2=Coates}}&lt;/ref&gt; although nothing came of this scheme. In 1845, in return for concessions, the Trustees supported the [[Grand Junction Railway]] in its campaign to build a more direct line to Liverpool, which crossed the Mersey over a bridge at Runcorn Gap.  However the bill was overthrown in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Competition from the railways and other canals led to a decline in the trading and the profits between 1845 and 1848, but there was no "disastrous collapse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time the Trustees and their representatives were engaged in vigorous campaigns in Parliament to protect their interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=185–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1844 a bonding warehouse had been built in Manchester and the first cargo to arrive was announced in a letter to the ''[[Manchester Guardian]],'' later printed in ''[[The Times]]:''
{{quote|&lt;center&gt;FIRST ARRIVAL IN THE PORT OF MANCHESTER OF A CARGO OF GOODS FOR BOND&lt;/center&gt;
We have great pleasure in recording the first arrival in the Port of Manchester of a vessel, with an entire cargo of wines and spirits removed in bond, and for bonding in Manchester. The vessel, a flat named the Express, was wholly laden with a valuable cargo of wines and spirits, in all about 40 tons weight, belonging to Mr. William Gibb, spirit merchant, of this town, whose active and long-continued exertions in the struggle to obtain the privilege of bonding for this great and important borough are about to be acknowledged in the form of a substantial mark of respect and gratitude by his fellow-townsmen. The Express arrived from Liverpool on Saturday evening; but it was yesterday morning before she began to unload. She is lying in the Bridgewater Canal, Knott Mill where the Duke's trustees have constructed a large bonding vault, which Mr. Gibb has taken and had licensed for the purpose, and we believe he is now removing his stock of wine and spirits from other ports to Manchester, for the greater convenience of sampling and sale. The lockers, gaugers, and other officers of Customs were in attendance, superintending the unloading of the vessel and thus have commenced the operations of the Manchester Custom-house. It is a gratifying circumstance that a gentleman who took so prominent a part in the struggle to obtain the boon of bonding for Manchester should be the first to enjoy the fruits of its success. We hope ere long to record the general operation of the system; though it will require a little time, perhaps, as it must have a beginning. -&amp;nbsp;''Manchester Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=author unknown |title=First arrival in the Port of Manchester of a cargo of goods for bond |newspaper=The Times |page=6 |date=10 October 1844}}
&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

However, this venture was less successful than expected, as is evidenced by a letter to ''[[The Observer]]'' later that year, also printed in ''The Times'':

{{quote|&lt;center&gt;MANCHESTER A BONDING PORT&lt;/center&gt; After the pressing demands which have been made by some of our principal manufacturing towns for the privileges of inland bonded warehouses for goods subject to Customs duties, it would naturally be supposed that the formation of a Custom-house establishment at Manchester would have occasioned a vast quantity of business in that extensive seat of British manufacturers; but we are informed that the result is very different from what had been expected. Although the system has been introduced into Manchester only as an experiment and a large establishment has been formed entirely of old and experienced officers; under the impression that the extent of business there would require the constant services of well tried men, we believe that, up to the present period, little trade has passed through the Manchester Custom-house and the officers' duties are nearly approaching to a sinecure. The total annual expense of this establishment, exclusive of that for the Custom-house and warehouse is £2,620. The town council of the borough of Manchester, however, are made liable, under the act of the 7th and 8th of Victoria cap 81, to the charges of maintaining this establishment, and the public are thereby exonerated from the expense. &lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;''Observer''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=author unknown |title=Manchester a bonding port |newspaper=The Times |page=2 |date= 3 December 1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Between 1849 and 1851 the competition between the Trustees and the railway companies intensified.  Agreements and alliances were made and broken.  Their major opponents were the London and North Western Railway and the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] who reduced tariffs and took business away from the canals.  For the first time the railways carried more trade between Liverpool and the towns of central Lancashire than the canals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=195–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The value of the traffic carried by the Bridgewater Canal in 1851 was the lowest in the time it was administered by the Trustees.&lt;ref name=mather358/&gt;  In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere hosted [[Royal visits to Manchester and Salford during the reign of Queen Victoria|a visit to Manchester]] by [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].  They stayed at Worsley Hall, with a view of the canal, and were given a trip between [[Patricroft railway station]] and Worsley Hall, on state barges.  Large crowds had gathered to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge so much that they fell into the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbett|1974|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trustees spent much time between 1851 and 1855 in negotiations to ease the competition, especially that from the London and North Western Railway.  The most likely allies seemed to be other railway companies, including the [[Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway|Shrewsbury and Birmingham]] and the [[Shrewsbury to Chester Line|Shrewsbury and Chester]] railway companies, and the Great Western Railway.  Of these, the most likely seemed to be the Great Western Railway who, in their concern to expand northwards were willing to help the Trustees with the carriage of their traffic to the south.  However years of negotiations came to no agreement and, in the end, the Trustees' railway deal was done with the London and North Western Railway, who agreed to cooperate with the onward passage of the Trustees' traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=226–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28&amp;nbsp;June 1855 James Loch, the Superintendent, died and was succeeded by [[Algernon Egerton|Hon. Algernon Fulke Egerton]], Lord Ellesmere's third son.  He was then aged 29, and had been educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]; he had been destined for a political life and had no experience of managing coal mines or canals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since James Loch had been appointed, he had been mainly in control of the management of the Trustees, assisted by his son [[George Loch]].  During this time the role of Fereday Smith had been diminished; initially appointed as Deputy Superintendent, his position was reduced to that of Principal Agent in 1845.  With the arrival of the inexperienced Algernon Egerton, Fereday Smith had a much greater say in the management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the previous four years the Lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to the canal or Runcorn Dock, despite the increasing demand for the passage of goods through the dock, and the profits made during these years became stagnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=259–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fereday Smith had been keen on expansion&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now his opportunity came.  He first reduced the top-heavy administration of the Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then took on the planning of the expansion of the business.  The [[Steamboat|steamers]] owned by the Trustees had been neglected and were in a poor state; these were repaired or sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Loch, who had been opposed to using the Trustees' investments for improvements to the canals or docks, died in 1857. Between 1857 and 1872 the Trustees provided more capital for improvements from their own resources than at any previous time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Runcorn and Weston Canal]] was built in 1858–59, providing a connection between Runcorn Docks and the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation]].  A new [[half tide dock]], the [[Port of Runcorn#Runcorn Docks|Alfred Dock]] was opened at Runcorn in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Electric telegraph]] was installed in 1861–62.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 the 2nd&amp;nbsp;Earl of Ellesmere died and his son and heir, the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere|3rd&amp;nbsp;Earl]] was a [[Minor (law)|minor]], aged 15.  This gave Algernon Egerton even more power to invest the profits of the company in developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Negotiations were made to increase sea-borne trade, both British and foreign, through the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=283–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building started on a new dock at Runcorn in 1867. Work was carried out in the Mersey estuary around the docks to improve access for vessels.  Some of this was carried out in conjunction with the London and North Western Railway who were building a [[Runcorn Railway Bridge|bridge]] across Runcorn Gap to take their line from Weaver Junction to Liverpool; the railway paid half the cost of the improvements, amounting to about £20,000 (£{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|20000|1867|r=-4}}|0}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=285–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Improvements were made to the Trustees' facilities at Liverpool, to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and to the Bridgewater Canal itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=287–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agreements were made with the railway companies to cooperate on the transit of goods and the rates of carriage&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|pp=292–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the Trustees' fortunes entered a calmer phase".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mather|1970|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 the Bridgewater Navigation Company Ltd was formed, and on Monday 9 September the canal was purchased in the names of [[Edward Watkin|Sir Edward William Watkin]] and William Philip Price, respectively chairmen of the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] and the [[Midland Railway]] for £1,120,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Times newspaper: The Bridgewater Canal | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1872-09-09-10&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1872-09-09-10-003&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=9 September 1872|accessdate=19 July 2008 |location=London |first1=Rachel |last1=Sylvester |first2=Sam |last2=Coates}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mather|1970|pp=334–335|ps=}}  The canal was sold again in 1885, when the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] Company paid the Bridgewater Navigation Company £1,710,000 for all their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Bridgewater Canal History, 1872 - Change and Consolidation |url=http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/timeline9.html |publisher=The Manchester Ship Canal Company |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121225344/http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/timeline9.html |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the ship canal forced the removal of Barton Aqueduct and the construction of [[Barton Swing Aqueduct]], as the former was too low for the vessels which would use the new canal.  In 1907 The Manchester Ship Canal (Bridgewater Canal) Act 1907 was passed, permitting coal mining near the canal between Monton Bridge and Leigh, in exchange for which the mine owners were obliged to pay the associated costs of keeping the canal open and navigable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Manchester Ship Canal (Bridgewater Canal) Act 1907 (Amendment) Order 1996 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1484/note/made |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Bridgewater Estates Ltd was formed to acquire the [[Earl of Ellesmere|Ellesmere family]] estate in Worsley. In 1984 Bridgewater Estates Ltd was purchased by a subsidiary of [[Peel Group|Peel Holdings]]. In 1987 Highams acquired a majority shareholding of the Manchester Ship Canal Company (subsequently the shares held by Highams were transferred to Peel Holdings).

'''Civil registration''' is the system by which a [[government]] records the [[vital event]]s (births, marriages, and deaths) of its [[citizen]]s and [[Residency (domicile)|resident]]s. The resulting repository or [[database]] has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a '''civil registry''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/topics/civil_registry.asp|title=OAS - Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|first=|last=OAS|date=1 August 2009|website=Oas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''civil register''' (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a vital event),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=341|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms - Civil register Definition|first=OECD Statistics|last=Directorate|website=stats.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''vital records''', and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a '''bureau of vital statistics''', '''registry of vital records and statistics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm|title=Where to Write for Vital Records - Homepage|date=30 June 2018|website=Cdc.gov|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''registrar''', '''registry''', '''register''', '''registry office''' (officially '''register office'''), or '''population registry'''. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal [[document]] that can be used to establish and protect the [[civil rights|rights]] of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]]. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was [[France]] in 1539, using the registers of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Sweden]] followed in 1631, on the basis of a register drawn up by the [[Church of Sweden]] on behalf of the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish king]].

The [[United Nations]] defines civil registration as "the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population as provided through [[decree]] or [[regulation]] in accordance with the legal requirements of a country. Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents required by law. These records are also a main source of vital statistics. Complete coverage, accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential to ensure the quality of vital statistics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/UNSD/demographic/sources/civilreg/default.htm|title=United Nations Statistics Division: Civil registration systems|website=Unstats.un.org|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vital events that are typically recorded on the register include live [[birth]], [[death]], [[stillbirth|foetal death]], [[name]], [[change of name]], [[marriage]], [[divorce]], [[annulment of marriage]], [[legal separation|judicial separation of marriage]], [[adoption]], [[legitimation|legitimization]] and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_84E.pdf|format=PDF|title=United Nations Handbook on Training in Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems |website=Unstats.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the legal documents that are derived from civil registration are [[birth certificate]]s, [[death certificate]]s, and [[marriage certificate]]s. A [[family register]] is a type of civil register which is more concerned with events within the [[family]] unit and is common in Continental European and Asian countries, such as Germany (''{{lang|de|[[Familienbuch]]}}''), France, Spain, Russia (''[[Resident registration in Russia|Propiska]]''), China (''[[Hukou system|Hukou]]''), Japan (''[[Koseki]]''), and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] (''[[Hoju]]'').

Additionally, in some countries, [[immigration]], [[emigration]], and any change of [[residency (domicile)|residence]] may require notification. A [[resident registration|register of residents]] is a type of civil register primarily concerned with the current residence.

== Challenges ==
Civil registration is faced with many challenges, both on the demand side and supply side, especially in the low income countries. The demand-side challenges include a lack of awareness of the need and importance of registration of vital events, and the situation is not helped by the many existing barriers to registration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|last2=Organization|first2=World Health|date=2014-05-28|title=Global Civil Registration and Vital Statistics : A Scaling Up Investment Plan 2015-2024|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10986/18962|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2009, the World Health Statistics of WHO estimated that only about 1% of the estimated deaths within low income groups are reported and just about 9% in lower-middle income groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The registration systems in many cases are very difficult, causing potential barriers to accessing the registration. Furthermore, in certain societies, due to stigmatisation based on cultural and religious settings, single mothers may fear questions of paternity during notification through chief or community agents.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P|first=Kathuri, Bernard|date=2016|title=Birth Notification Service For Civil Registration In Kenya – SOA Model|url=http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/100245|website=Erepository.uonbi.ac.ke|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the supply side, challenges often involve different, and often conflicting, legal frameworks various stakeholders (health institution, civil registry, statistics agency), and as a result, many countries with "burdensome procedures and non-standardized systems across a country, leading to confusion regarding what individuals need to do or present."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other challenges include  accessibility of remote areas and also irregular migration caused by civil conflicts and porous borders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Innovations ==
There has been new developments in civil registration across the globe over the years. With the advent of enhanced and information and communication technology, civil registration has been moving from a paper-intensive, manual-based civil registration to more automated and digitalised systems. Some of the innovations implemented in civil registration include the use of e-birth notification systems, whereby the health officials are able to notify the national population registration system with new births.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/namibia/media_20171.html|title=UNICEF Namibia - Media centre - Innovative e-Birth Notification System Launched in Namibia|website=Unicef.org|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system improve registration process, by timely feeding the system with information as soon as a birth occurs. Another innovation, such as that implemented by [[Icivil|iCivil Africa]] in [[Burkina Faso]], is the use of a mobile application to register newborns .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biometricupdate.com/201608/icivil-promises-much-needed-birth-registration-in-africa|title=iCivil promises much needed birth registration in Africa|date=2016-08-09|work=BiometricUpdate|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
=== Namibia ===
In [[Namibia]], Civil registration mandate lies with the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration, which has offices in all fourteen region of the country. Although some vital events (e.g., marriages) are recorded by various agencies (e.g., church and courts), vital records are contained in the National Population Register, which is maintained by the department of Civil Registration within the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mha.gov.na/web/mhai/civil-registration-services|title=Department of Civil Registration - GRN Portal|website=Mha.gov.na|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Namibia, civil registration and identity management systems are integrated and managed by one department. Over the years, Namibia has transformed its civil registration processes, moving away from the manual system to electronic system. In 2017, Namibia, which has at least 22 birth and registration offices based within the maternity wards of hospitals across the country, launched its e-birth notification system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This improvement is expected to "improve the quality of vital statistics produced in the country.  The system is also a welcome departure from the present mechanism of relying on surveys for estimations of birth registration rates and projections of the numbers of births each year."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, vital records are contained in the National Population Register, which is maintained by the national [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]]. Any Home Affairs office can record a vital event or issue a certified copy of a vital record.

=== Burkina Faso ===
In Burkina Faso, since 2015, a centralized [[CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistic)|CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics)]] is being implemented by the non governmental organization iCivil Africa. This "new tech start up has set themselves a massive task: to register all newborn babies digitally".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/01/africa/birth-registration-system-burkina-faso/index.html|title=New technology could help 230 million 'ghost' children|last=Morlin-Yron|first=Sophie|date=|website=cnn.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==
=== France ===
France was the first country to create a national Registration. In 1539, King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] ordered in the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]], as part of a wider legislation regarding the policing of [[Benefice|church benefice]]s, to keep vital records registers in the various church local institutions (mainly [[parish]]es). The ordinance orderer the creation of at least a register of [[baptism]]s, as a proof of one's date of birth, and a register of [[burial]]s of churchmen, as a proof of one's date of death. Though both registers were kept by religious authorities, they were authenticated by a public notary, always a layman, and were kept in the local royal administration's archives. In fact, as the church kept [[parish register]]s since the Middle Ages (the oldest one in France is [[Giry]]'s, of 1303), these registers were used to meet the ordinance's dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;Delsalle, Paul (2009). Histoires de familles: les registres paroissiaux et d'état civil, du Moyen Âge à nos jours : démographie et généalogie. Besançon: Presses universitaires de Franche-Comté. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The national registration was fully laicized in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]] by order of the French Republic. These records have been continued through the present and are kept at the departmental archives. The Civil Registration includes birth, marriage, divorce, and death records.

=== Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]], maintaining the civil registry ("basisregistratie personen") is the duty of the municipalities.

Before the [[History of the Netherlands#Revolution.2C Republic and French rule|French Rule]], the Netherlands did not have a central registration of its population, which was introduced in some parts of the country in 1796 by the French. In 1811, this registration was introduced throughout the country. The Dutch differentiate between the ''basisregistratie personen'', an ongoing database of citizens' information, and the ''burgerlijke stand'', which is a collection (at the municipal level) of documents evidencing certain events taking place in a given municipality, such as birth, marriage, [[civil union]], and death.&lt;ref name=seegers/&gt;

Beginning on 1 January 1850, municipalities were obliged to keep citizen's records in book form (Dutch: bevolkingsregister). Early in the twentieth century this system was replaced by a card system that registered families. The move toward individual registration took place in 1939 with the introduction of the ''persoonskaart'', a single card registering a single individual, kept in the municipality. Information gathered on this card included family name, first names, gender, position within the family, date and place of birth, marital status, address, and church affiliation, besides information on when a person entered and left a municipality.&lt;ref name=seegers/&gt;

In 1940, the Dutch government did not want to mandate citizen's identification, but during [[World War II]] the German occupying government mandated it so they could assess who was to be sent to Germany as forced labor and to select Jewish citizens from the general population. When the war was over, mandatory identification was done away with.&lt;ref name=seegers&gt;{{cite book|last=Seegers|first=G.H.J.|title=Persoonlijk gegeven - Grepen uit de geschiedenis van bevolkingsregistratie in Nederland|year=1993|publisher=Bekking|location=Amersfoort|author2=M.C.C. Wens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s all local registries were automated, and starting on 1 October 1994 the individual registration card was replaced with a digital list containing a person's information as collected by the ''gemeentelijke basisadministratie van persoonsgegevens'' (in 2015 replaced with the 'basisregistratie personen'), kept and maintained at the municipal level. Municipalities exchange information through a closed network at the end of each day to a nationwide database, which can be consulted by officials online. Though it was generally considered "un-Dutch," on 1 January 2005 mandatory identification (when asked by a mandated person) was reintroduced for everyone over 14; official identification is to be presented for all important transactions between citizens and government.

=== Romania ===
Civil registries were introduced in 1806-1812 during the Russian occupation, and they followed the Tsarist model of keeping them with church records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/registrele-parohiale-stare-civila-introduse-principatul-moldovei-tara-r|title=Registrele parohiale de stare civilă, introduse în Principatul Moldovei şi Ţara Românească în timpul războiului ruso-turc (1806-1812)|website=Historia.ro|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the "Communal Law" (''Legea comunală'') of 31 March 1864 subsequent record keeping became the responsibility of the mayor in each dwelling, who was allowed to delegate it to one of his helpers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdQwAQAAIAAJ|title=Din istoria statisticii româneşti: culegere de articole|first=Romania Direcția Centrală de|last=Statistică|date=12 July 1969|publisher=Direcţia Centrală de Statistică|accessdate=12 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; An effort by the state to gather the ancient historical records happened around 1926-1932 but in some cases as late as 1948-1952; a good number of these early records were lost in this process, sometimes literally by the truckload.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arhivelenationale.ro/images/custom/image/serban/RA%201%202008/05_bodale,_arcadie.pdf Colecţia de stare civilă – între realizări şi deziderate] by [[Romanian National Archives]] (pp. 55-56)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
{{main|Population registration in Sweden}}

In Sweden, the civil registry is maintained by the [[Swedish Tax Agency]] (''Skatteverket''); up into the 1990s the [[Church of Sweden]] was responsible. Recording of births and deaths was stipulated in the early 17th century, formal national [[census]]es have been made since the mid-18th century, and Sweden has one of the longest and most comprehensive suites of civil records of any country.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], civil registration was first introduced with the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836]] which affected England and Wales. The [[General Register Office for England and Wales]] was set up and the civil registration of [[birth]]s, [[marriage]]s, and [[death]]s in [[England and Wales]] was became mandatory on 1 July 1837.&lt;ref name="Herber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herber|first=Mark D. |title=Ancestral trails: the complete guide to British genealogy and family history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFhmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=March 1998|publisher=Genealogical Pub. Co., Inc|isbn=978-0-8063-1541-6|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the onus lay on registrars to discover and record events, so parents only had to supply information if and when asked.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt; In 1875, the Births &amp; Deaths Act 1874 came into force, whereby those present at a birth or death were required to report the event.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt; Subsequent legislation introduced similar systems in [[Ireland]] (all of which was then part of the United Kingdom) on 1 April 1845 for Protestant marriages and on 1 January 1864 for all birth, marriage and death events.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt; Civil registration was introduced in [[Scotland]] on 1 January 1855.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt;

The administration of individual [[registration district]]s is the responsibility of ''registrars'' in the relevant [[local authority]].  There is also a national body for each [[jurisdiction]].  The local offices are generally responsible both for maintaining the original registers and for providing copies to the national body for central retention.  A ''superintendent registrar'' facilitates the legal preliminaries to marriage, conducts civil marriage ceremonies and retains in his/her custody all completed birth, death and marriage registers for the district. The office of the [[superintendent registrar]] is the district [[register office]], often referred to (informally) in the media as the "registry office".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/registry-office registry office] Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. Accessed August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, both officers may also conduct statutory civil partnership preliminaries and ceremonies, citizenship ceremonies and other non statutory ceremonies such as naming or renewal of vows. Certified copies of the entries made by the registrars over the years are issued on a daily basis either for genealogical research or for modern legal purposes such as supporting passport applications or ensuring eligibility for the appropriate junior sports leagues.

On 1 December 2007 registrars and superintendent registrars became employees of their local authority for the first time following the enactment of the [[Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]].

==== England and Wales ====
Births in England and Wales must be registered within 42 days, whilst deaths must be registered within 5 days unless an inquest is called or a post mortem is held.

Marriages are registered at the time of the ceremony by either
# the officiating [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church in Wales]],
# an authorised person at a [[registered building]], religious,  or 
# a registrar at a [[register office]], [[registered building]] or [[approved premise]].

The official registers are not directly accessible by the general public. Instead, indexes are made available which can be used to find the relevant register entry and then request a certified copy of the details.

The [[General Register Office]]—now merged into the [[Office for National Statistics]]—has overall responsibility for registration administration.

==== Scotland ====
Civil registration came into force in [[Scotland]] on 1 January 1855.  A significant difference from the English system is the greater detail required for a registration.  This means that if a certified copy of an entry is requested, it will contain much more information.

The [[General Register Office for Scotland]] has overall responsibility for registration administration and drafting legislative changes in this area (as well as census data).  They are governed by the [[Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965]] and subsequent legislation (responsibility for which has now been devolved to the [[Scottish Parliament]]).

== North America ==
=== Mexico ===
In [[Mexico]], vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates) are registered in Registro Civil, as called in Spanish. Each state has its own registration form. Until the 1960s, birth certificates were written by hand, in a styled-cursive [[calligraphy]] (almost unreadable for the new generations) and typically issued on security paper. After the 1960s, they were issued typed by machine.

Currently all copies (from people born before and after the 1960s) are standardized in brown-security paper and are typed automatically by a computer and the [[CURP]], (control identification number in Mexico) and the specific dates of issuing are already issued.

=== United States ===
In the United States, [[vital records]] such as [[birth certificates]], [[death certificates]], and frequently [[marriage certificate]]s are maintained by the Office of Vital Statistics or Office of Vital Records in each individual state. Other documents such as [[deed]]s, [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] documents, [[name change]] documents, and [[divorce|divorce records]], as well as marriage certificates for those states not centralizing these records,  are maintained by the [[Clerk of Court]] of each individual [[County (United States)|county]]. However, the term 'civil registry' is not used.

== Asia ==
=== Philippines===
In the Philippines, civil registrations are maintained by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/civilregistration|title=Civil Registration|publisher=[[Philippine Statistics Authority]]|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]] civil registrations are carried out and maintained by state administrations. [[Tasmania]] began registrations in 1838, [[Western Australia]] in 1841,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU |WA|num_act|bdamr45vn9439|Births, deaths and marriages registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdm.dotag.wa.gov.au/I/indexes_history.aspx |accessdate=23 September 2017 |title=Indexes History |date=15 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Australia]] in 1842, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1853,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access.prov.vic.gov.au/public/component/daPublicBaseContainer?component=daViewFunction&amp;breadcrumbPath=Home/Access+the+Collection/Browse+The+Collection/Function+Details&amp;entityId=39|title=Access the Collection - Public Record Office Victoria (PROV)|first=corporateName: Public Record Office|last=Victoria|website=Access.prov.vic.gov.au|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.qld.gov.au/justice-services/births-deaths-and-marriages Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages - Queensland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122022723/http://www.justice.qld.gov.au/justice-services/births-deaths-and-marriages |date=2011-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Territory]] in 1870, and [[Australian Capital Territory]] in 1911. Prior to those dates, records of baptisms, marriages and burials were kept by individual churches. Because early civil registration often involved the churches, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish whether early records are civil or church records. Civil registration was carried out by government employees independent of the churches. The information recorded in records varies from state to state. South Australia calls the appropriate central registry the Principal Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and in Victoria it is the Government Statist Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The other states call the registry the Office of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages.

{{History Of The Cold War}}
The '''Cold War (1979–1985)''' refers to the phase of a deterioration in relations between the [[Soviet Union]] and the West arising from the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in December 1979. With the election of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]], and [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], a corresponding change in Western foreign policy approach toward the Soviet Union was marked with the abandonment of [[détente]] in favor of the [[Reagan Doctrine]] policy of [[rollback]], with the stated goal of dissolving Soviet influence in Soviet Bloc countries. During this time, the threat of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] had reached new heights not seen since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

The Soviet Union [[Soviet–Afghan War|invaded Afghanistan]] following the [[Saur Revolution]] in that country, ultimately leading to the deaths of around one million civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Sliwinski, "Afghanistan: The Decimation of a People," ''Orbis'' (1989), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|Mujahideen]] fighters succeeded in forcing a Soviet military withdrawal in 1989. In response, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced a U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics cold boycott|boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics]]. In 1984, the Soviet Union responded with [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|its own boycott]] of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Tensions increased when the U.S. announced they would deploy [[Pershing II]] missiles in [[West Germany]], followed by Reagan's announcement of the U.S. [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] and were further exacerbated in 1983 when Reagan branded the Soviet Union an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]".

In April 1983, the [[United States Navy]] conducted [[FleetEx '83-1]], the largest fleet exercise held to date in the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]].&lt;ref name="Johnson-55"&gt;Johnson, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richelson-385"&gt;Richelson, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; The conglomeration of approximately forty ships with 23,000 crewmembers and 300 aircraft, was arguably the most powerful naval armada ever assembled. U.S. aircraft and ships attempted to provoke the Soviets into reacting, allowing [[U.S. Naval Intelligence]] to study Soviet radar characteristics, aircraft capabilities, and tactical maneuvers. On April 4, at least six U.S. Navy aircraft flew over one of the [[Kurile Islands]], [[Zeleny Island]], the largest of a set of islets called the [[Habomai Islands]]. The Soviets were outraged and ordered a retaliatory overflight of the [[Aleutian Islands]]. The Soviet Union also issued a formal diplomatic note of protest, which accused the United States of repeated penetrations of Soviet airspace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1902&amp;context=thesesdissertations&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ru%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dfleetex%252083%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D6%26sqi%3D2%26ved%3D0CE0QFjAF%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalscholarship.unlv.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1902%2526context%253Dthesesdissertations%26ei%3Dx09OUJfoFenh4QTYwICwBA%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfeF8YbXtuqsXkw755TiVP19BMXg%26cad%3Drjt#search=%22fleetex%2083%22 ''1983: The most dangerous year'' by Andrew R. Garland,University of Nevada, Las Vegas]
&lt;/ref&gt; In the following September, the civilian airliner [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] was downed by Soviet fighter jets over nearby [[Moneron Island]].

In November 1983, [[NATO]] conducted a military exercise known as "[[Able Archer 83]]". The realistic simulation of a nuclear attack by NATO forces caused considerable alarm in the USSR and is regarded by many historians to be the closest the world came to nuclear war since the [[Cuban missile crisis]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastny|first1=Vojtech|title=How Able Was "Able Archer"?: Nuclear Trigger and Intelligence in Perspective|journal=Journal of Cold War Studies|date=January 2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=108–123|doi=10.1162/jcws.2009.11.1.108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period of the Cold War would continue through U.S. President Reagan's first term (1981–1985), through the death of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet leader]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1982, the brief interim period of Soviet leadership consisting of [[Yuri Andropov]] (1982–1984) and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] (1984–1985). This phase in the Cold War concluded in 1985 with the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] who brought a commitment to reduce tensions between the East and the West and bring about major reforms in Soviet society.

During the [[Cold War (1962–1979)|1970s]], the United States and the Soviet Union had pursued a policy of [[détente]], whereby both sides trying to improve their geopolitical situation while minimizing the risk of direct war between the superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/detente|title=Détente - Cold War - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive trade ties were established between nations of both blocs, to the point that approximately 70 percent of the Soviet Union's grain came from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1983/07/29/grain-sales-to-soviets-to-increase/1a7d8e8a-533d-457a-a7de-24fccab42586/|title=Grain Sales to Soviets to Increase|last=Sinclair|first=Ward|date=July 29, 1983|work=The Washington Post|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, steps to expand political ties between NATO and Soviet-bloc nations (i.e. [[Ostpolitik]]) culminated in the signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]]. Additionally, several major arms control agreements were signed, such as [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT I &amp; II]].

Additionally, efforts were taken by the United States to secure a peace treaty to end its participation in the [[Vietnam War]]. To this end, Nixon attempted to induce China to support the peace process and proceeded to make a historic trip to the communist nation. While this outreach to China would ultimately fail to avert communist victory in the Vietnam War, it is still regarded one of the most important geopolitical acts of the 20th century, fundamentally altering the Cold War dynamic between the U.S. and the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2012/02/23/china-and-the-united-states-nixons-legacy-after-40-years/|title=China and the United States: Nixon's Legacy after 40 Years|last=Bader|first=Jeffrey A.|date=February 23, 2012|website=Brookings Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While such efforts toward détente were generally supported by the publics of both sides (for example 68 percent of Americans believed that Nixon's China Trip would improve world peace)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/9967/timeline-polling-history-events-shaped-united-states-world.aspx|title=Timeline of Polling History:  Events that Shaped the united States, and the World|last=|first=|date=2000|website=Gallup|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were still critics of such efforts.  In the United States, conservatives such as Barry Goldwater condemned détente, going onto say, "Our objective must be the destruction of the enemy as an ideological force possessing the means of power"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1964/10/08/a-long-view-goldwater-in-history/|title=A Long View:  Goldwater in History|last=Hofstadter|first=Richard|date=October 8, 1964|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and warning that trade with the Soviet Union assists in the maintenance of Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conscience of a Conservative|last=Goldwater|first=Barry|publisher=Regnery Gateway|year=1990 (reprint), original in 1960|isbn=0-89526-754-3|location=Washington, D.C., USA|pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; American opposition to détente was also shared by members of the American left, such as Sen. Henry "Scoop" Jackson, who believed the Soviet Union needed to be aggressively confronted by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040112&amp;slug=jackson12m|title=Scoop Jackson's proteges shaping Bush's foreign policy|last=Fryer|first=Alex|date=January 12, 2004|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these criticisms, détente continued throughout the 1970s, enjoying support from members of both sides of the American political divide, with both parties nominating pro-détente candidates in the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 Presidential Election]] (President Ford vs. Governor Jimmy Carter.)

In Western Europe, there was also some opposition to détente.  As a consequence of West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''Ostpolitik,'' the West German government repudiated all claims east of the Oder-Niesse river, forfeiting claims historic German territory that had been lost at the end of World War II.  While this move helped ease fears of German revanchism against the Soviet Union and Poland, it drew criticism from Brandt's chief opponent, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU.)&lt;ref&gt;Helga Haftendorn: Deutsche Außenpolitik zwischen Selbstbeschränkung und Selbstbehauptung 1945–2000. Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt: Stuttgart / München 2001, p. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Union itself, dissidents such as [[Andrei Sakharov]] (also former member of the [[Soviet nuclear program]]), warned that Western security was threatened if détente wasn't accompanied by [[Human rights in the Soviet Union|liberalization in the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/91476/detente-and-dissent|title=Detente and Dissent|last=Astrachan|first=Anthony|date=September 21, 1973|work=The New Republic|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet and Eastern human rights activists came under renewed assault during this time period by communist intelligence services, such as the [[KGB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/irina-borogan/true-andropov-response-to-andrei-konchalovsky|title=The true Andropov:  a response to Andrei Konchalovsky|last=Borogan|first=Irina|date=April 8, 2011|website=Open Democracy:  Russia and Beyond|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of significant western criticism of continued human rights abuses resulted in rising discontent among Eastern European dissidents, with Czech playwright (and future [[President of the Czech Republic|President]]) Vachlav Havel labeling détente as "naive, thickheaded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/05/31/history-of-a-public-enemy/|title=History of a Public Enemy|last=Havel|first=Vaclav|date=May 31, 1990|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|translator=Paul Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collapse of Detente ==
This era of relative cooperation wasn't without conflict.  Throughout the era of détente, both sides continued their stockpiling of nuclear weapons, along with delivery systems for those weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons|title=Nuclear Weapons|last=Roser|first=Max|last2=Nagdy|first2=Mohamed|date=|website=Our World in Data|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vechiles (MIRVs)]] radically increased both the Soviet Union's and the United States' killing capacity in the event of a nuclear war and increased the possibility of a preventive strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armscontrolcenter.org/multiple-independently-targetable-reentry-vehicle-mirv/|title=Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) - The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation|date=2017-08-28|work=The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II]] was signed in 1979 in an attempt to contain the expansion of MIRVs. However, this treaty wasn't ratified by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] due to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]] in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/0604/asumm.html|title=Understanding the forces behind the SALT II controversy|last=Saikowski|first=Charlotte|date=June 4, 1986|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Soviet Union and the United States had taken an interest in Afghanistan during the Cold War vying for influence in the neutral mountainous country. To this end, both the Soviet Union and the United States undertook massive infrastructure projects in the underdeveloped nation. So generous was superpower aid that the [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Afghan Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal]] once said that, "he could light his American cigarettes with Russian matches."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fifty-Year Wound|last=Leebaert|first=Derek|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York City, USA|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan witnessed a period of rising political instability that began with the [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|overthrow of King Zahir Shah]] in 1973.  During the period, Afghanistan witnessed a massive growth in the size of its communist movement, particularly in the ranks of the Afghan military.  This culminated in the [[Saur Revolution|1978 Saur Revolution]], where by members of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]], a Soviet-backed Marxist–Leninist party, seized power in a bloody coup.&lt;ref name="Soviets in Afghanistan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://alphahistory.com/coldwar/soviets-in-afghanistan/|title=Soviets in Afghanistan|date=2012-07-15|work=The Cold War|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communists initiated a radical social and political revolution which saw the liquidation of large numbers of dissidents and "class enemies."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?ei=EEY4TZ2GGsXTrQfdsZmZCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=-4oHrInacy8C&amp;dq=%27%27Soldiers+of+God%3A+With+Islamic+Warriors+in+Afghanistan+and+Pakistan%27%27&amp;q=Pul-i-Charki Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan]'' by Robert D. Kaplan. Vintage, 2001. {{ISBN|1-4000-3025-0}} p.115&lt;/ref&gt;  The coup and subsequent political violence provoked a civil war between the Marxist state and its non-communist opponents, which included, among others, radical [[Islamism|Islamists]]. The deterioration of the communists military position prompted the Soviet Union to intervene in the conflict. The entrance of the Soviet Union into the Afghanistan War is widely credited with ending support for détente and provoked a series of retaliatory responses from the United States, such as the aforementioned withdrawal from SALT II, as well as the imposition of a [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|grain embargo]], [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|the boycotting of the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics]], and the beginning of [[Operation Cyclone|weapons sales to Afghan anti-Soviet rebels]]. Additionally, it diplomatically isolated the Soviet Union on the world stage, particularly in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81B00401R000600190013-5.pdf|title=World Wide Reaction to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan:  An Intelligence Memorandum|last=|first=|publisher=National Foreign Assessment Center of the CIA|year=1980, declassified in 2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States presidential election, 1980|election of Ronald Reagan]] is widely heralded as a turning point in the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. According to Henry Kissinger, Reagan was "the first postwar President to take the offensive both ideologically and strategically."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger, ''Diplomacy'' (New York : Simon and Schuster, 1994), p. 772&lt;/ref&gt;  While Carter had initiated a military buildup after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, it would be under the Reagan Administration that the United States would aggressively buildup its conventional and nuclear stockpile, marking a renewed period of competition in place of cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/us/reagan-acknowledges-carter-s-military-buildup.html|title=Reagan Acknowledges Carter's Military Buildup|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|date=April 6, 1986|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rollback Doctrine==
In 1984, journalist [[Nicholas Lemann]] interviewed Reagan Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]] and summarized the strategy of the Reagan administration to roll back the Soviet Union:
:Their society is economically weak, and it lacks the wealth, education, and technology to enter the information age. They have thrown everything into military production, and their society is starting to show terrible stress as a result. They can't sustain military production the way we can. Eventually it will break them, and then there will be just one superpower in a safe world — if, only if, we can keep spending." &lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, "Reagan: The Triumph of Tone" [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/03/10/reagan-triumph-of-tone/ ''The New York Review of Books'' 10 March, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
Lemann notes that when he wrote that in 1984, he thought the Reaganites were living in a fantasy world. But in 2016, he says, that passage represents "a fairly uncontroversial description of what Reagan actually did."

The Reagan strategy also included escalating conflicts the Soviets were involved in, especially the [[Soviet-Afghan war]]&lt;ref name="Soviets in Afghanistan"/&gt; and the [[Central American crisis]].  It included diplomatic moves to persuade Western European governments to host American missiles pointed at the Soviet Union. Additionally in included an attempt to construct a space based anti-ballistic missile defense known as the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (However many critics dubbed it "Star Wars.")&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E. Busch, "Ronald Reagan and the defeat of the Soviet empire." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 27.3 (1997): 451-466.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategies were continued until the [[Revolutions of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bodenheimer and Robert Gould. ''Rollback!: right-wing power in US foreign policy'' (South End Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/why-ronald-reagan-didnt-r_b_819445.html|title=Why Ronald Reagan Didn't Really Win the Cold War|first=Jonathan|last=Weiler|date=7 February 2011|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in the Eastern European [[satellite state]]s revolted against their dictatorships and became [[parliamentary democracies]].

== Polish Crisis (1980–1981) ==
{{Main|Martial law in Poland|l1=Martial Law in Poland}}

In the 1970s, the Polish economy had experienced a period of declining productivity, cultimating in the nations first post-WWII recession in 1979&lt;ref&gt;''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980–1981 : A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, striking workers at the Gdansk Shipyard announced the formation of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], a non-communist trade union.  On Aug. 31, 1980, the Polish government [[Gdańsk Agreement|agreed]] to many of the union's demands, including its legalization, making Solidarity (now 10 million members strong) the first trade union in the Warsaw Pact to not be under the control of the communist government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/polands-solidarity-movement–1980–1989/|title=Poland's Solidarity Movement (1980–1989)|last=Bartkowski|first=Maciej|date=December 2009|website=International Center on Nonviolent Conflict|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the following year, Poland experienced growing political chaos as the Solidarity protests spread across the country, threatening the survival of the communist state. On Dec. 31, 1981, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]], head of the Polish military, declared a state of martial law across Poland, ordering the arrest of members of Solidarity and other opposition organizations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the period leading up to the declaration of martial law by Poland's government, there was speculation on both sides of the Iron Curtain about the specter of a [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981|Soviet military intervention in the crisis]], similar to previous Soviet interventions in Eastern Europe (i.e. [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], [[Prague Spring]].) However, the Soviets ultimately decided against direct intervention in Poland out of fear of western economic sanctions on the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet deliberations during the Polish Crisis, 1980–1981. Edited, translated, annotated, and introduced by Mark Kramer. Special Working Paper No. 1, [[Cold War International History Project]], Washington, D.C., April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried Loth. Moscow, Prague and Warsaw: Overcoming the Brezhnev Doctrine. ''[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]''1, no. 2 (2001): 103–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland would remain in a state of martial law until 1984, when the Polish government began gradually releasing members of the Polish opposition from prison. The conflict between Solidarity and the Jaruzelski government would ultimately come to an end in 1989, with the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|democratization of Poland]] and the defeat of the ruling communist party in Poland's first free post-World War II [[Polish legislative election, 1989|elections]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Nuclear Buildup (1981–1983) ==

=== Deployment of Intermediate Nuclear Forces to Europe ===
During the 1970s, the Soviet Union had developed a new class of [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile|intermediate range ballistic missiles]] capable of carrying nuclear weapons. By the end of 1979, it deployed 130 [[SS-20]] missiles capable of launching over 390 warheads to the western part of the Soviet Union and to allied [[Warsaw Pact]] states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nato.int/docu/update/70-79/1979e.htm|title=1979:  Summary|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2001|website=NATO Update|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This move set off alarms in the [[NATO]] alliance, which was dependent upon [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear]] superiority to offset the Soviets conventional superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legge|first=J. Michael|date=March 1983|title=Theater Nuclear Weapons and the NATO Strategy of Flexible Response|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2007/R2964.pdf|journal=RAND Corporation|volume=|pages=48–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to enhance the nuclear deterrence of the NATO alliance, member states committed to deploy several hundred missiles to Western Europe, mainly [[Pershing II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb301/index.htm|title=Thirtieth Anniversary of NATO's Dual-Track decision|last=Burr|first=William|date=December 10, 2009|website=The National Security Archive of George Washington University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological Developments ===
During the Cold War prior to the 1970s and 1980s, the primary heavy strategic bomber of the [[United States Air Force]] was the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 Stratofortress]]. However, the development of more sophisticated [[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne Early Warning and Control]] (AWACS) technology rendered the B-52  more vulnerable to attacks from the ground and enemy fighters. The Air Force saw a need for a bomber that could go faster, was more maneuverable, and could still deliver a substantial payload to its target. This led to the development of the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1A Lancer]] in the early to mid 1970s. The B-1A program was cancelled in 1977 but was later brought back by [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] in 1981 under its new and current designation, the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B]]. The B-1B is capable of speeds at or above Mach 1.2 and can deliver a payload of 75,000 pounds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104500/b-1b-lancer/|title=B-1B Lancer|work=U.S. Air Force|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lancer was a nuclear capable bomber until 1994 when the nuclear mission for the bomber was cancelled, and it was switched to conventional weapons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another weapon that was produced during this time frame was the [[Pershing II]] [[Medium-range ballistic missile|Medium-range Ballistic Missile]] ([[Medium-range ballistic missile|MRBM]]). The Pershing II was first deployed in Europe in 1983. It had a range of around 1,000 miles and carried a single [[W85|W-85]] variable yield nuclear warhead, which had a yield between five and 80 kilotons. Although this warhead has a smaller yield than the [[W50 (nuclear warhead)|W-50]] warhead (up to 150 kilotons), the increased accuracy of the Pershing II missile meant that there was not a need for large yield warheads. Instead, the missile was capable of striking very close to its target using its radar and inertial guidance units.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, “Pershing II Weapon System: Technical &amp; Operator’s Manual” in TM 9-1425-386-10-1, (Washington D.C.: Department of the Army, June 1986.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear False Alarms &amp; Close calls ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Never, perhaps, in the postwar decades has the situation in the world been as explosive and, hence, more difficult and unfavorable as in the first half of the 1980's.” - [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], February 1986 &lt;/blockquote&gt;Supposedly one of the closest calls during this period of the Cold War happened during the Able Archer exercise performed by the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] ([[NATO]]) in 1983. Able Archer 83 was a realistic military simulation exercise performed in November 1983. As part of the exercise, the NATO forces simulated a full-scale nuclear assault which may have invoked an unexpected response from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, The Soviet "War Scare", February 15, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; After they had received information on what appeared to be a mobilization of NATO forces in Europe, many military officials in the Soviet Union believed that the United States was using the exercise to disguise a strategic nuclear first strike. This led to an unusual response from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This response involved Soviet military units in East Germany and Poland being put on alert, an abnormal amount of reconnaissance flights.*

=== Peace and anti-nuclear movements ===
Throughout the 70s and 80s, the general public became increasingly concerned with the continuous and growing threat of war and nuclear war in particular, and the - by then - international [[peace movement|peace]] and [[anti-nuclear movement]]s grew dramatically with many protests, happenings and activist events to spread awareness and push for disarmaments and change political agendas. The movements were most active in Europe, the US, Canada and Japan and a culmination was reached in 1982, June 12, when a million people marched in New York for an end to the Cold War arms race and nuclear weapons. It is the largest gathering of protesters in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/spirit-june-12/|title=The Spirit of June 12|publisher=The Nation|author=Jonathan Schell|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third World Conflicts ==

=== Middle East and North Africa ===
The early 1980s saw a continued Afghan resistance to the Soviet invasion.  The United States and other anti-Soviet nations, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan, provided material assistance to the Afghan rebels, who were often referred to as the ''[[Mujahideen|Mujaheddin]]'' (Arabic for "holy warriors.")  The United States provided approximately $750 million year to the Afghan rebels, largely via the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].  This support for the Afghan rebels, which would ultimately go onto include sales of anti-aircraft "[[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]]" missiles, is widely considered as being instrumental in denying the Soviet Union victory in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/25/books/wilson-the-warrior.html|title=Wilson the Warrior|last=Johson|first=David|date=May 25, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 2, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Afghan War, the Middle East saw several other conflicts during this era.  The [[Iran–Iraq War|Iran-Iraq War]], pitted the new [[Government of Iran|Islamic revolutionary government]] of Iran against the Iraqi [[Ba'athist Iraq|Baathist]] state led by [[Saddam Hussein]].  Despite fighting an Iraq that was armed by the both the Soviet Union and the West, Iran fought the invaders to a standstill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/html/export_values.php|title=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|last=|first=|date=April 1, 2018|website=|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The war remained a stalemate until 1988, when a ''status quo ante-bellum'' cease-fire was arranged between the two parties.  The war had claimed the lives of over a million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iran-iraq-war-anniversary|title=Iran and Iraq remember war that cost more than a million lives|last=Black|first=Ian|date=23 September 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 1, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rumel, Rudolph.

The era also saw the continuation of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990), with the American-backed Israelis and the Soviet backed Syrians fighting alongside various Lebanese political factions that they in turn supported.

=== Africa ===
In Africa, neither the Soviet Union nor the United States got directly involved in the numerous conflicts raging on the continent.  However, several African civil wars turned into proxy wars involving foreign powers, with [[South African Army#"Border War" (1966–1989)|South African]] and [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuban]] soldiers fighting one another in the [[Angolan Civil War]].  Other conflicts in Africa were the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], the [[Mozambican Civil War|War in Mozambique]], and the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]].  This combined with a total of 20 successful coups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2013/02/africa-is-more-stable-than-you|title=Africa is More Stable than You've Been Led to Think|last=Berman|first=Jonathan|date=February 28, 2013|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=April 12, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant that Africa was a continued source of instability throughout the 1980s.

Along with the various military confrontations going on across the continent, South Africa, then still under the control the ''[[apartheid]]'' government, faced increasing isolation due to both its domestic repression of the indigenous black population and its assertive foreign policy.  Soviet-bloc states continued their sponsorship of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and other [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-Apartheid movement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s sending both lethal and non-lethal aid.  South Africa witnessed increasing instability as both civil disobedience and militant violence against the Pretoria government intensified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/union-soviet-socialist-republic-ussr-and-anti-apartheid-struggle|title=The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the Anti-Apartheid Struggle|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2012|website=South African History Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In western countries, such as the United States, there was a growing movement calling for the suspension of economic relations with South Africa, often referred to as the [[Disinvestment from South Africa|Disinvestment Movement]].  While the movement failed to bring about an immediate end to Western trade with South Africa, by the end of the decade the United States Congress would pass (over President Reagan's veto) the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act]], which  combined with other nations taking similar measures would strike a major blow to the South African economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sanctioning Apartheid|last=Knight|first=Richard|publisher=Africa World Press|year=1990|isbn=|editor-last=Edgar|editor-first=Robert E.|location=|pages=|chapter=Sanctions, Disinvestment, and U.S. Corporations in South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Yellow Rain ====
In the mid–1970s and early 1980s, evidence of biological warfare had appeared in [[Afghanistan]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia|Kampuchea]] (or [[Cambodia]]). The substance commonly found in many of the attacks was [[T-2 mycotoxin]], a trichothecene mycotoxin which became notorious for its role in the “[[Yellow rain|Yellow Rain]]” attacks in the three countries mentioned previously.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textbook of Military Medicine|last=Zajtchuk|first=Russ|publisher=Office of The Surgeon General, Department of the Army|year=|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called yellow rain because the substance was usually associated with a yellow color and many of those who witnessed an attack described the substance as sounding like rain when it fell to the ground.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The chemical agent was delivered by many different means including: aircraft rockets and bombs, spray tanks, mortar shells, grenades, and traps.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

These chemicals were believed to be either supplied or delivered by the Soviets and were used in at least some of over 400 attacks and contributed to at least a fraction of over ten thousand deaths during these attacks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This chemical agent had many severe symptoms including but not limited to: vomiting, damage to the nervous system, skin and eye irritation, vision impairment or loss, and diarrhea.

==== Cambodia-Vietnam War ====
Following a few years of armed exchanges between the Soviet Union backed Vietnamese and the Chinese backed Cambodian armies, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Cambodia on Christmas Day in 1978. The decision to invade Cambodia was instigated by Cambodia from their many attacks on the Vietnamese, which peaked in 1977-78.

==== Second Malay Insurgency ====
The [[Malayan Communist Party]] ([[Malayan Communist Party|MCP]]) launched their second insurgency on June 17, 1968, twenty years after their first insurgency. On that day, the MCP launched an attack which killed 17 members of security forces near Kroh-Bentong. However, things would quickly take a turn for the worse when, in 1970, issues began to arise within the MCP. It was believed that government spies had infiltrated the MCP and began working to divide the group. Many members of the MCP started to accuse each other of working with the government, and if they were found to actually be government agents, would usually be put to death. By late 1974, the government agents’ actions had proved successful. The MCP had split into two main groups. The remnants of the MCP grew weaker and weaker and by 1987 the last remaining groups surrendered. Thus, it marked the end of the MCP insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malaysia’s Experience In War A gainst Communist Insurgency And Its  Relevance To The Present Situation In Iraq|last=Talib|first=Nazar Bin|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
[[File:Contra commandas 1987.jpg|thumb|The Contras mounted an effective insurgency that threatened the Sandinista government's hold of the countryside.|260x260px]]
The year 1979 witnessed the overthrow of the ruling [[Somoza family]] in [[Nicaragua]] and their subsequent replacement by the left-wing [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] movement, lead by [[Daniel Ortega]].  The incoming Reagan Administration was committed to the removal of the Nicaraguan government and armed anti-communist revolutionary forces, commonly referred to as the "[[Contras]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sandinistas:  The Party and the Revolution|last=Gilbert|first=Dennis|publisher=Pantheon|year=1991|isbn=|location=New York, USA|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1983, the United States Congress limited the Reagan Administration to only $24 million in aid for the Contras. The attempts by members the Reagan Administration to illegally circumvent these restrictions resulted in the [[Iran–Contra affair|Iran-Contra Scandal.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beneath the United States:  A History of US Policy Toward Latin America|last=Scholultz|first=Lars|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA|pages=365|chapter=Chapter 18:  Combating Communism with Economic Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned that Nicaragua was the first "[[Domino theory|domino]]" to fall in Central America, the United States increased arms sales to friendly governments in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, each of whom were dealing with their own leftist-insurgencies.  US aid peaked in 1985 at $1.2 billion before declining to a mere $167 million by 1996 (almost all of the latter was non-military aid.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beneath the United States:  A History of US Policy Toward Latin America|last=Schoultz|first=Lars|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States|pages=364–366|chapter=Chapter 18:  Combating Communism with Economic Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombia witnessed the continuation of their several decade long civil war with the American backed government of [[Julio César Turbay Ayala|Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala]] fighting various Marxist rebels and drug smugglers.  The dominant rebel group, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), received financial and material support from the Cuban government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-11-20/cuba-colombia-s-peacemaker|title=Cuba:  Colombia's Peacemaker?|last=Miroff|first=Nick|date=November 20, 2012|work=PRI|access-date=April 1, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these conflicts would be resolved by the midpoint of the decade, lasting until the early 1990s, or in the case of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] [[Colombian conflict|insurgency]], until 2017.

== 1983: The Year of Crisis ==

=== Operation RYAN ===
[[File:Pershing II on EL.jpg|thumb|555x555px|[[Pershing II]] intermediate-range ballistic missile on an erector launcher in Germany.]]
{{Main|Operation RYAN}}In 1981, the Chairman of the [[KGB]], [[Yuri Andropov]], and General Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] launched the largest ever Soviet intelligence gathering campaign, [[Operation RYAN]] (Russian: ''Raketno Yadernoye Napadenie (Ракетно ядерное нападение)'', meaning "nuclear missile attack"). The purpose of this exercise was to deploy operatives to collect as much information as possible on the possibility of a nuclear first strike from the U.S. or other [[NATO]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/forecasting-nuclear-war|title=Forecasting Nuclear War|last=Schaefer|first=Bernd|last2=Jones|first2=Nate|date=November 13, 2014|website=Wilson Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 8, 2018|last3=Fischer|first3=Benjamin B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This eight year watchdog initiative seemed to unnerve rather than reassure the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. With all of the information flowing in, it was unclear which piece of intelligence marked the initiation of a [[preemptive strike]], which would call for immediate action from the Soviet side, before the U.S. could even get weapons in the air. When the U.S. rolled out a new class of intermediate-range ballistic missiles, the [[Pershing II]], the KGB knew that the Americans were ready to strike, and if it was a preemptive strike, the Soviet arsenal of retaliatory weapons would be at a high risk. In February 1983, the KGB doubled down on Operation RYAN, focusing on any possible indication of a U.S. plan to attack and exponentially increasing tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-08|title=A Cold War Conundrum: The 1983 Soviet War Scare|last=Fischer|first=Benjamin B.|date=March 19, 2007|website=Central Intelligence Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Shooting-down of KAL-007 ===
{{Main|Korean Air Lines Flight 007}}Korean Air Lines flight 007 (KAL-007) was headed toward [[Seoul|Seoul, South Korea]] from [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage, AK]] on Sept. 1, 1983. On its way, the flight passed over the Soviet [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], which was not a part of the flight plan. Soviet fighters launched [[air-to-air missile]]s and shot down the passenger plane under orders from Soviet commanders. KAL-007 crashed into the Pacific Ocean, and the 269 souls on board were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 1984|title=Legal Argumentation in International Crises: The Downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=97|issue=5|pages=1198–1213|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dead was [[Larry McDonald]], a [[US Congressman]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willoughby|first=M.

The timing of this event along with the multiple other conflicts between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in 1983 created an political climate of high tension which could have quickly escalated to disastrous actions by either side in response.

=== ''Exercise Able Archer-83'' ===
{{Main|Able Archer 83}}Just as the USSR intensified its scrutiny of nuclear activity through Operation RYAN, the U.S. and NATO began their most advanced, in-depth, and realistic war simulation yet, known as [[Able Archer 83|Able Archer]]. Launched in November 1983, what made this particular war-game so different, and ultimately so consequential, was the inclusion of an end-game scenario that simulated the nuclear option should the war reach such a level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Soviet intelligence was able to gather that this new aspect had been included, but they were unable to tell whether or not it was all part of the game, or if there was a potential threat of actual nuclear weapons being released. This escalation in the type of simulation being performed by NATO combined with the presence of Pershing II missiles in [[West Germany]] put the USSR on edge. On top of a reported increase in communications from [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw]] forces in [[East Germany]], there was an unusually high number of surveillance flights and large amounts of armed and ready [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23s]] were stationed near the border. Reports from Soviet sources also claim that certain forces were placed on high alert and multiple [[SS-20]] and [[SS–19]] mobile strategic nuclear missiles were moved and waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Barrass (2016) Able Archer 83: What Were the Soviets Thinking?, Survival, 58:6, 7-30, DOI: 10.1080/00396338.2016.1257176&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars list this event as the closest the world came to nuclear war since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], while others argue that the USSR's actions were not far from standard operating procedure during NATO war-games, perhaps erring on the side of caution due to the presence of the new Pershing II missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maloney|first=Sean M.|date=August 2015|title=Remembering Soviet Nuclear Risks|url=|journal=Survival|volume=57|issue=4|pages=77–104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that the accumulating effects of this event and so many others in such a short period caused 1983 to be one of the most intense and nearly disastrous years of the Cold War.

== Soviet Leadership &amp; Succession ==

=== Death of Brezhnev (1982) ===
[[Leonid Brezhnev]] was Soviet Union's leader for 18 years from 1964 until his death in 1982.&lt;ref name="Leonid Brezhnev 2017"&gt;"Leonid Brezhnev." Britannica Academic, Encyclopædia Britannica, 16 Nov. 2017. academic-eb-com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu/levels/collegiate/article/Leonid-Brezhnev/16402. Accessed 10 Apr. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Brezhnev's health was starting to decline due to his heavy smoking and addiction to sleeping pills toward the end of his time leading the Soviet Union. When Brezhnev's health got worse, the Soviet Union started having issues because he could not run the country.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu"&gt;Stevenson, Keira. "Leonid Brezhnev." Leonid Brezhnev, Jan. 2009, pp. 1-2. EBSCOhost, libraries.ou.edu/access.aspx?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=n9h&amp;AN=17292470&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brezhnev tried to help lower nuclear tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States. In 1979, the Brezhnev and United States [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] signed a [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II agreement]]. The agreement was a new bilateral strategic arms limitation treaty.&lt;ref name="Leonid Brezhnev 2017"/&gt; However, on December 27, 1979, the Soviet Union [[Soviet–Afghan War|invaded Afghanistan]], so the United States Senate never ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name="Leonid Brezhnev 2017"/&gt; [[Hafizullah Amin]] played a large role in the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan. Amin's relationship with the Soviet Union was decent but was eventually strained, which was one reason the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="ark.cdlib.org"&gt;Kakar, M. Hassan Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979–1982. Berkeley:  University of California Press,  c1995 1995. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft7b69p12h/&lt;/ref&gt;

Brezhnev help grow the Soviet Union's economy and compete with the United States in an arms race during the 1970s. The 1980s was a different story. Because of Brezhnev's poor health, he could not lead the Soviet Union, which hurt their economy, military, living standards, and politics.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu"/&gt; Brezhnev had to start relying more on his advisors because of his health.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Meaghan 2008"&gt;Bernard, Meaghan. “The End of Stagnation? A Reexamination of Domestic Policy in the Soviet Union from 1982–1985 under the Leadership of Iurii Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.” The End of Stagnation? A Reexamination of Domestic Policy in the Soviet Union from 1982–1985 under the Leadership of Iurii Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, 2008, pp. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses.&lt;/ref&gt; Brezhnev's advisors would make critical decisions, and Brezhnev eventually became a figurehead for the Soviet Union. But political corruption spread throughout the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name="Leonid Brezhnev 2017"/&gt; Brezhnev was eventually criticized for the poor quality of life the Soviet Union's citizens had in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Leonid Brezhnev 2017"/&gt;

=== The Andropov Era (1982–1984) ===
[[Yuri Andropov|Yuri V. Andropov]] succeeded  [[Leonid Brezhnev]], however Andropov's presidency did not last long. He was only the Soviet Union's leader for 15 months, from November 1982 to February 1984. Andropov quickly got ill in February 1983, and his health was bad enough that he had to start staying in a hospital frequently. Andropov spent his last few days in a hospital before he died in February 9, 1984.

Andropov  wanted to clean up Soviet corruption Andropov and attempted a systemic reform.&lt;ref name="Allum, Felia 2003"&gt;Allum, Felia, and Siebert, Renate. Routledge/ECPR Studies in European Political Science : Organised Crime and the Challenge to Democracy (1). Taylor and Francis, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed many party ministers and secretaries due to their corruption. Andropov also established the Soviet Union's rational state-society relations, which was designed to ceate resistance from both the elites and the masses.&lt;ref name="Allum, Felia 2003"/&gt;  The statists plan did not work because Andropov died, and the plan alone did not have the strength to be successful.&lt;ref name="Allum, Felia 2003"/&gt;

Andropov thought invading Afghanistan and starting a war was a mistake.&lt;ref name="HALLIDAY, FRED. 1999, pp. 675"&gt;HALLIDAY, FRED. “Soviet Foreign Policymaking and the Afghanistan War: from ‘Second Mongolia’ to ‘Bleeding Wound.’” Review of International Studies, vol. 25, no. 4, 1999, pp. 675–691.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed it was not in the Soviet Union's best interest, and he gave four main reasons to UN Secretary [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] as to why the invasion is not important.&lt;ref name="HALLIDAY, FRED. 1999, pp. 675"/&gt; Andropov even visited Afghanistan toward the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982, but he realized that there was no military solution. Andropov's response was putting pressure on Afghanistan's leadership, so the Soviet Union could withdraw without having many problems.&lt;ref name="HALLIDAY, FRED. 1999, pp. 675"/&gt; Andropov's death meant his vision for Afghanistan would never materialize.

Andropov wanted to fix the Soviet economy because it was struggling toward the end of Brezhnev's leadership.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Gidadhubli, R. G. “Andropov on Soviet Economy after Brezhnev.” Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 18, no. 4, 1983, pp. 103–104. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4371772.&lt;/ref&gt; Gosplan Baibakov presented the 1983 annual plan of economic and social development, and V. F. Garbuzov presented the economic performance of 1982 for the 1983 budget.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; After listening to these two plans, Andropov had several ideas on how to improve the Soviet economy, especially through agriculture and agricultural workers.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Andropov also wanted the industrial ministry and other ministries to meet their target plans.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The Soviet Union had domestic and foreign problems with its economy, which worried Soviet leaders.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Andropov did agree with some parts of Brezhnev's foreign policies, but he also wanted to create better ones.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; The Soviet Union's leaders also struggled to find different ways to solve multiple problems.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Andropov's death meant his economic vision was never fully developed.

=== Chernenko's Reign (1984–1985) ===
After [[Yuri Andropov|Yuri Andropov's]] death, [[Konstantin Chernenko]] was elected as the next leader for the Soviet Union. Andropov had not wanted Chernenko to become his successor because Chernenko had emphysema health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0310.html|title=Chernenko Is Dead in Moscow at 73; Gorbachev Succeeds Him and Urges Arms Control and Economic Vigor|website=archive.nytimes.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andropov wish was to actually have [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] succeed him. Chernenko's reign was even shorter than Andropov's, 13 months from February 1984 to March 1985.

[[Leonid Brezhnev]] had helped Chernenko move higher in the political ranks. Chernenko followed some of Brezhnev's economic ideals, but he was not open about his economic development plans.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Meaghan 2008"/&gt; Chernenko wanted to improve the Soviet Union's agriculture methods, production and distribution to help jump start the economy.&lt;ref name="Bernard, Meaghan 2008"/&gt;

One of Chernenko's major achievements was negotiating and signing a new trade pact with China, worth $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name="Billion Trade Pact 1984, p. 10"&gt;“China and Soviet Sign $1.2 Billion Trade Pact.” The New York Times, 11 Feb. 1984, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This also helped to ease the relationship between the Soviet Union and China. The trade protocol allowed a 50 percent commerce increase between the Soviet Union and China, but it also allowed the Soviet Union to export machinery, cars and timber.&lt;ref name="Billion Trade Pact 1984, p. 10"/&gt;

Chernenko also did some work to help improve the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the Soviet Union ended the intermediate-range nuclear force negotiations in Geneva, all strategic arm talks ceased and neither side talked to the other for the next 12 months.&lt;ref name="Horelick, Arnold 1984 p. 511"&gt;Horelick, Arnold. “U.S.-Soviet Relations: the Return of Arms Control. (America and the World 1984).” Foreign Affairs, vol. 63, 1985, p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Chernenko, contacted recently re-elected [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] to reopen negotiations and met him in Geneva, on January 7, 1985. After two long days of negotiation, both sides agreed to "resume formal negotiations on the basis of a new framework."&lt;ref name="Horelick, Arnold 1984 p. 511"/&gt; This was a new advance in the Soviet Union and the United States' relationship because it addressed questions regarding both nuclear and space weapons.&lt;ref name="Horelick, Arnold 1984 p. 511"/&gt; This new agreement was one way Chernenko helped the Soviet Union's relationship with the United States. However, Chernenko did not end the Afghanistan invasion, which could have started the process to end the Cold War.&lt;ref name="ark.cdlib.org"/&gt;

Even after the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet Union was still [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotting]] the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] where the United States was hosting the Olympic Games in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieser, Joshua Ryan. “Los Angeles and the 1984 Olympic Games: Cultural Commodification, Corporate Sponsorship, and the Cold War.” 2014, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union said the Reagan administration could not ensure the Soviet athletes' security.&lt;ref name="Hurtz, Howard 1984"&gt;Hurtz, Howard, and Leavy, Jane. “Soviets Withdraw from Los Angeles Olympics; Salvage Effort Promised.” The Washington Post, 9 May 1984, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet National Olympic Committee also felt its participants would have poor training conditions.

The Soviet Union's boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics was also a direct response to the United States' [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] to the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], which the Soviet Union hosted in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="Hurtz, Howard 1984"/&gt; The United States and other countries were boycotting the Soviet Union because of the Afghanistan invasion. But Chernenko continued Soviet intervention in Afghanistan even after the United States' 1980 Summer Olympics boycott.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu"/&gt; Chernenko's Soviet Union and Reagan's United States still had disagreements, so the Cold War could not end before Chernenko died.

==Culture and media==
Dozens of the board wargames were published covering both historical and hypothetical conflicts at scales ranging from man-to-man to global thermonuclear war. Historical conflicts include the [[Falklands War]], the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[invasion of Grenada (1983)|invasion of Grenada]], and the [[Angolan Civil War]]. The vast majority of titles concerned [[List of board wargames#Contemporary WWIII|contemporary World War III]] "what-if" scenarios wherein the Cold War turns hot and focused on a presumed Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. Notable games include ''Ultimatum'' (1979), ''The China War'' (1979), ''NATO Division Commander'' (1980), ''Fifth Corps'' series (1980), and ''MechWar 2'' (1980), ''Task Force'' (1981), ''Harpoon'' (1983), ''Silo 14'' (1983), ''Assault'' series (1983), ''Gulf Strike'' (1983), ''Firepower'' (1984), ''The Third World War'' series (1984), ''Air Cav'' (1985) and ''Main Battle Area'' (1985).

In addition, the period witnessed the release of several videogames dealing with the Cold War and Cold War related issues. Examples include Atari's well-known arcade-game 
[[Missile Command]] (1980), the somewhat infamous 
[[Raid over Moscow]] (1984), which lets you blast through soviet airdefence and finally destroy Moscow (hence the name), as well as 
[[Theatre Europe]] (1985), which simulate an all-out conventional, albeit hypothetical, war between the Warsaw Pact forces and NATO troops over control of Central Europe. Some of these games advise strongly against the use of nuclear weapons, reflecting a widespread fear of [[nuclear holocaust]] at the time.  Additionally, there were several video games released that dealt with Cold War geopolitics, such as [[Balance of Power (video game)|Balance of Power]] (1985) and [[Crisis in the Kremlin]] (1991.)

Two films released in 1983, ''[[WarGames]]'' and ''[[The Day After]]'', dealt with potential all-out nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. President Reagan was given a private screening of ''The Day After'' and was said to be deeply shaken. He revised his posture toward nuclear war in favor of eventual nuclear abolition, at least in part due to his experience watching the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=James|title=The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan: A History of the End of the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTgIFpLuD6kC|year=2009|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cova d'en Daina''' ({{lang-en|Daina's Cave}}) is a [[dolmen]] located near [[Romanyà de la Selva]], in the [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] of [[Santa Cristina d'Aro]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Els monuments megalítics|last=Tarrús i Galter |first=Josep |authorlink= |author2=Júlia Chinchilla |year=1992 |publisher=Diputació de Girona |location=Girona |isbn=84-86377-95-1 |page= |pages=96 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This [[megalith]] monument was built out of [[granite]] blocks and is dated around 2700-2200 BC. It was discovered by Pere Cama i Casas and the first mention of its uncovering was by Agustí Casas in 1894. It was later excavated by Lluís Esteva Cruañas, who unearthed human bones and teeth, flint [[arrowhead]]s, knife and pottery fragments and necklace [[bead]]s. It was partially reconstructed in the 1950s. It is seven metres long and made up of an entrance passage into the funeral chamber, with a circular [[tumulus]] that is 10 metres in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gavarres.cat/Document_Files/Publicacions/00000025/2e5yv_Agust%C3%AD%20Casas.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915055749/http://www.gavarres.cat/Document_Files/Publicacions/00000025/2e5yv_Agust%C3%AD%20Casas.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to the tomb is oriented to the southeast, which allows sunlight to reach the interior on the winter [[solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raco.cat/index.php/mayurqa/article/viewFile/122732/169885&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''DNA repair-deficiency disorder''' is a medical condition due to reduced functionality of [[DNA repair]].

[[DNA]] repair defects can cause an '''[[accelerated aging disease]]''' or an '''increased risk of cancer''', or sometimes both.

==DNA repair defects and accelerated aging==

DNA repair defects are seen in nearly all of the diseases described as  '''[[accelerated aging disease]]''', in which various [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s or systems of the human body [[Senescence|age]] prematurely. Because the '''accelerated aging diseases''' display different aspects of aging, but never every aspect, they are often called '''segmental progerias''' by [[Gerontology#Biogerontology|biogerontologists]].

===Human disorders with accelerated aging===
*[[Ataxia-telangiectasia]]
*[[Bloom syndrome]]
*[[Cockayne syndrome]]
*[[Fanconi anemia]]
*[[Progeria]] (Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome)
*[[Rothmund–Thomson syndrome]]
*[[Trichothiodystrophy]]
*[[Werner syndrome]]
*[[Xeroderma pigmentosum]]

===Examples===
Some examples of DNA repair defects causing [[progeroid syndromes]] in humans or mice are shown in Table 1.

===DNA repair defects distinguished from "accelerated aging"===
Most of the DNA repair deficiency diseases show varying degrees of "accelerated aging" or cancer (often some of both).&lt;ref name="nDNA"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging | journal=Rejuvenation Research  | volume=12 | issue=3 | year=2009 | pages=199–208 | url=http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf | doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 | pmid=19594328 | citeseerx=10.1.1.318.738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But elimination of any [[gene]] essential for  [[base excision repair]] kills the [[embryo]]—it is too lethal to display symptoms (much less symptoms of cancer or "accelerated aging").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasty P, Campisi J, Hoeijmakers J, van Steeg H, Vijg J |title=Aging and genome maintenance: lessons from the mouse? |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5611 |pages=1355–9 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12610296 |doi=10.1126/science.1079161 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum display symptoms dominated by vulnerability to cancer, whereas progeria and Werner syndrome show the most features of "accelerated aging". [[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]] (HNPCC) is very often caused by a defective [[MSH2]] gene leading to defective [[DNA mismatch repair|mismatch repair]], but displays no symptoms of "accelerated aging".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mazurek A, Berardini M, Fishel R |title=Activation of human MutS homologs by 8-oxo-guanine DNA damage |journal=J.

DNA damage, aging, and cancer. N Engl J Med. 2009 Oct 8;361(15):1475-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Some DNA repair defects manifest as [[neurodegeneration]] rather than as cancer or "accelerated aging".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rass U, Ahel I, West SC |title=Defective DNA repair and neurodegenerative disease |journal=Cell |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=991–1004 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17889645 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.043 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Also see the "[[DNA damage theory of aging]]" for a discussion of the evidence that DNA damage is the primary underlying cause of aging.)

===Debate concerning "accelerated aging"===
Some biogerontologists question that such a thing as "accelerated aging" actually exists, at least partly on the grounds that all of the so-called accelerated aging diseases are segmental progerias. Many disease conditions such as [[diabetes]], [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], etc., are associated with increased [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. Without reliable [[biomarkers of aging]] it is hard to support the claim that a disease condition represents more than accelerated mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller RA |title='Accelerated aging': a primrose path to insight? |journal=Aging Cell |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=47–51 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15038817 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9728.2004.00081.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this position other biogerontologists argue that premature aging [[phenotype]]s are identifiable symptoms associated with mechanisms of molecular damage.&lt;ref name="nDNA"/&gt; The fact that these phenotypes are widely recognized justifies classification of the relevant diseases as "accelerated aging".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasty P, Vijg J |title=Accelerating aging by mouse reverse genetics: a rational approach to understanding longevity |journal=Aging Cell |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=55–65 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15038819 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9728.2004.00082.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such conditions, it is argued, are readily distinguishable from [[Genetic disorder|genetic disease]]s associated with increased mortality, but not associated with an aging phenotype, such as [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]]. It is further argued that segmental aging phenotype is a natural part of aging insofar as genetic variation leads to some people being more disposed than others to [[aging-associated diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasty P, Vijg J |title=Rebuttal to Miller: 'Accelerated aging': a primrose path to insight?' |journal=Aging Cell |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=67–9 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15038820 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9728.2004.00087.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA repair defects and increased cancer risk==
Individuals with an inherited impairment in [[DNA repair]] capability are often at increased risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H, Payne CM, Garewal H. DNA repair/pro-apoptotic dual-role proteins in five major DNA repair pathways: fail-safe protection against carcinogenesis. Mutat Res. 2002 Jun;511(2):145-78. Review.&lt;/ref&gt;  When a [[mutation]] is present in a DNA repair gene, the repair gene will either not be expressed or be expressed in an altered form.  Then the repair function will likely be deficient, and, as a consequence, damages will tend to accumulate.  Such DNA damages can cause errors during [[DNA synthesis]] leading to mutations, some of which may give rise to cancer.  Germ-line DNA repair mutations that increase the risk of cancer are listed in the Table.

'''Deep time''' is the concept of [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The modern philosophical concept was developed in the 18th century by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] geologist [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).{{sfn|Palmer|Zen}}{{sfn|Kubicek|2008}} The [[age of the Earth]] has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, around 4.55&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-science-figured-out-the-age-of-the-earth/|title=How Science Figured Out the Age of Earth|last=Braterman|first=Paul S.|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific concept==
{{Life timeline}}
Hutton based his view of deep time on a form of geochemistry that had developed in Scotland and Scandinavia from the 1750s onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Eddy |first = Matthew Daniel |title = The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800 |date = 2008 |publisher = [[Ashgate]] |location = London |page = Ch. 5 |url = https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[mathematician]] [[John Playfair]], one of Hutton's friends and colleagues in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], remarked upon seeing the [[stratum|strata]] of the [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] at [[Siccar Point]] with Hutton and [[Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet|James Hall]] in June 1788, "the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time".{{sfn|Playfair|1805}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McPhee |first= John |date= 1981 |title= Book 1: Basin and Range, in [[Annals of the Former World]] |url= |location= New York |publisher= [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page= 79 |isbn= 0-374-10520-0 |author-link= John McPhee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[geologists]] such as [[Nicolas Steno]] (1638-1686) and [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740-1799) had developed ideas of [[Stratum|geological strata]] forming from water through chemical processes, which [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) developed into a theory known as [[Neptunism]], envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form [[rock (geology)|rock]].  Hutton's innovative 1785 theory, based on [[Plutonism]], visualised an endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea, being uplifted and tilted, then eroded to form new strata under the sea. In 1788 the sight of [[Hutton's Unconformity]] at Siccar Point convinced Playfair and Hall of this extremely slow cycle, and in that same year Hutton memorably wrote "we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end".{{sfn|Montgomery|2003}}{{sfn|Rance|1999}}

Other scientists such as [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769-1832) put forward ideas of past ages, and geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] (1785-1873) incorporated Werner's ideas into concepts of [[catastrophism]]; Sedgwick inspired his university student [[Charles Darwin]] to exclaim "What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!".{{sfn|Darwin|1831}}  In a competing theory, [[Charles Lyell]] in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830–1833) developed Hutton's comprehension of endless deep time as a crucial [[Science|scientific]] concept  into [[uniformitarianism]].  As a young [[Natural history|naturalist]] and geological theorist, Darwin studied the successive volumes of Lyell's book exhaustively during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey voyage]] in the 1830s, before beginning to theorise about [[evolution]].

[[Physicist]] [[Gregory Benford]] addresses the concept in ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia'' (1999), as does [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]] in ''In Search of Deep Time:  Beyond the Fossil Record to a New History of Life'' (2001){{sfn|Korthof|2000}}{{sfn|Campbell|2001}}  [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]'' (1987) also deals in large part with the evolution of the concept.

[[John McPhee]] discussed "deep time" at length with the layperson in mind in ''Basin and Range'' (1981), parts of which originally appeared in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}} In ''Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle'', Gould cited one of the metaphors McPhee used in explaining the concept of deep time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider the Earth's history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King's nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concepts similar to geologic time were recognized in the 11th century by the [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]] and [[polymath]] [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, 973–1037),{{sfn|Toulmin|Goodfield|1965|p=64}} and by the [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese naturalist]] and polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|pp=iii,23-24}}

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[theologian]] [[Thomas Berry]] (1914–2009) explored [[spirituality|spiritual]] implications of the concept of deep time.  Berry proposes that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. This view has greatly influenced the development of [[deep ecology]] and [[ecophilosophy]]. The experiential nature of the experience of deep time has also greatly influenced the work of [[Joanna Macy]] and [[John Seed]].

[[H.G. Wells]] and [[Julian Huxley]] regarded the difficulties of coping with the concept of deep time as exaggerated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of different scales is simply a matter of practice", they said in ''[[The Science of Life]]'' (1929).  "We very soon get used to maps, though they are constructed on scales down to a hundred-millionth of natural size. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; to grasp geological time all that is needed is to stick tight to some magnitude which shall be the unit on the new and magnified scale—a million years is probably the most convenient—to grasp its meaning once and for all by an effort of imagination, and then to think of all passage of geological time in terms of this unit."&lt;ref&gt;
H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: The Literary Guild, 1934; orig. publ. 1929), p. 326.

==Life==
In 1988, he was a Roman Catholic priest at St. Rita's Church, [[New Orleans]].  
He was investigated over his possession of homosexual child [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news5/1991_12_Bennetts_UnholyAlliances.htm "Unholy Alliances", ''Vanity Fair'', Leslie Bennetts, December 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;
He sued over the public release of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romingerlegal.com/fifthcircuit/opinions/92-03781.CV0.wpd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927173355/http://www.romingerlegal.com/fifthcircuit/opinions/92-03781.CV0.wpd.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at [[Tulane University]].
The scholarship of his book, ''From Italy to San Francisco'', has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1420.html "The Disturbing Case of Dino Cinel", ''History News Network'', Sebastian Fichera, 4-28-03]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/comments/11900.html "Dino Cinel", ''History News Network'', Andrew M.

Cinel was stabbed to death in Medellin, Colombia in February 2018 by an 18-year-old man with whom he had been in a relationship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14776">The end of Basque home rule or ''[[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|foruak/fors]]'' in France was an event putting an end to the secular Basque native institutional and legal system during the French revolutionary period (1790-1795). The final violent dissolution of the semi-autonomous [[Basques|Basque]] institutional and legal system was coupled with the arrival of French troops to the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] within the [[War of the Pyrenees]] and a deliberate terror on the Basque population centred in Labourd.

It resulted in the abrupt suppression of all native governmental and jurisdictional organs and the establishment of the departement of the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Lower Pyrenees]] (''Basses-Pyrénées''), as well as the [[Departments of France|''departement'' administrative system]], as everywhere in France.

==Background==
[[File:Carte des Traites 1732.png|thumb|French customs in 1732 roughly clinging to linguistic boundaries]]
Although gradually curtailed starting 1620, the Basques in the [[Kingdom of France]] maintained a semi-autonomous status favoured by their peripheral location and common bonds with their peer [[Southern Basque Country|Basque districts in Spain]], ruled by a similar self-empowerment system. However, each district held a different governmental and legal jurisdiction, whose representatives attended the parliament of [[Gascony]] in [[Bordeaux]] ([[Labourd]]), and [[Kingdom of Navarre#Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees|Navarre]] in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] ([[Lower Navarre]], [[Soule]]).

Labourd was the most dynamic [[French Basque Country|French Basque district]], showing total autonomy in its fiscal system during the mid-18th century, but also a declining fishing industry, half-hearted trade routes with the Americas, and lack of products with added value capable of enticing trade. Its decision making body was the ''Biltzar'', or Assembly of [[Labourd]], a highly participatory, democratic body. The weight of the nobility was remarkably low. 

Lower Navarre nominally remained a kingdom apart from [[France]] located at the feet of the [[Pyrénées|Pyrenean]] passes and benefiting from the cross-border trade routes, e.g. [[Pamplona]]-[[Bayonne]]. Soule's basic legal document was the Custom, or ''Kostüma'', but all relevant powers of its decision making body, the Estates-General, were suppressed by 1733.&lt;ref&gt;The third estate was significantly curtailed, with major decisions remaining thereafter in the hands of the nobility and the clergy.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Estates of Navarre|Estates of Lower Navarre]] went through a similar fate when litigation with officials in [[Pau, Pyrenees-Atlantiques|Pau]] led to their legislating powers being severely curtailed by royal decree in 1748. Relations between the crown and the Basques were increasingly uneasy, due to the crown's demanding nature in terms of fiscal contribution and decision-making attributions.

==Abolition during the French Revolution==
[[File:Dominique Joseph Garet Cadet (1749-1833).jpg|thumb|[[Dominique Joseph Garat|Dominique J. Garat]], last representative of Labourd and chief official in [[Paris]]]]
In 1789, estates representatives were [[Estates-General of 1789|called to the Jeu de Paume in Paris]] by King [[Louis XVI]]. It was attended by the Basque deputies, six per district. In January 1790, a clean-sweep administrative design was put forward in the [[National Assembly]] that superseded Basque home rule.&lt;ref&gt;Labourd protested, stating that they had "our own Constitution". See [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/78335/141326 Auñamendi Entziklopedia. Lapurdi, Edad Contemporanea]&lt;/ref&gt; The new ideological design abolished all ethnic or traditional bonds, with the new [[Basses-Pyrenees|Lower Pyrenees]] department Basques merging [[Viscounty of Bearn|Bearn]] and the Basque districts into one single administrative unit, where Basques remained a minority.

The Basques, spearheaded by the [[enlightened self-interest|enlightened]] Garat brothers, [[Dominique Joseph Garat|Dominique Joseph]] and [[:fr:Dominique Garat|Dominique ''the Old'']], regarded with disbelief the proposal and opposed it in vehement addresses to the assembly, Uhart and Escuret-Laborde, representatives of Soule, equally spoke out against it and stood up for their ''foruak'', for which they were jeered, and abandoned the chamber.{{Sfnp|Bolinaga|2012|pp=32-33}} The Navarrese representatives (Franchisteguy, Polverel) decided not to vote after Louis XVI entitled himself ''King of the French'', instead of the customary ''King of France and Navarre'', arguing that they were not part of France and suggesting the possibility of creating a separate entity.

The Basque representatives, citing their linguistic and cultural difference to Bearn, went on to come up with an alternative design that would merge all three Basque districts into one department.{{Sfnp|Bolinaga|2012|pp=61-66}} During this period, [[Basque language|Basque]] was the common everyday language in all three provinces, with a majority of Basque monolingual population and a number of asymmetric Basque-Gascon ([[Béarnese dialect|Bearnese]]) [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]];&lt;ref&gt;The point of the distinctive linguistic reality of the Basques was raised by their representatives in 1790, see Bolinaga, p. 61-66. Compare with 1866, when 95% of the population used Basque as their primary language, and [[Francization]] policies were not still in full-swing, see Watson, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; at this point, [[Biarritz]], [[Bayonne]], and [[Bidache]] were for the most part [[Gascon language|Gascon]] speaking.

The decree establishing the ''départément'' system, was followed by the creation of the ''[[Basses-Pyrenees]]'' department in February 1790. The bill for a Basque department was also rejected. On hearing the news of the French decision, an astonished ''Biltzar'' of Labourd stripped the Garat brothers of their office for eventually voting in favour of the French departmental design. Likewise minor territorial entities were redesigned, most notably, merging Ustaritz and Bayonne to dysfunctional effects, right after the 1780s separation of Labourd from the latter as demanded by its assembly of representatives (''Biltzar'').&lt;ref&gt; The new municipal constituency conflicted with the opinion of the residents of Ustaritz and the linguistic make-up of both municipalities. A first meeting was almost suspended, since besides not knowing each other, most of the Bayonnaise representatives could not speak Basque. See [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/78335/141326 Auñamendi Entziklopedia. Lapurdi, Edad Contemporanea].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, the new Constitution was passed, confirming the administrative arrangement voted in 1790.{{Sfnp|Bolinaga|2012|pp=62-66}} Dominique Garat ''the Old'' refused to distribute copies of the new constitution on the grounds that there was no Basque-language version. France was still a kingdom, so the ''[[status quo]]'' remained in place, but political developments started to shift from evolutionary to revolutionary. The kingdom turned into a [[First French Republic|Republic in September 1792]], the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and the [[National Convention]] rose to prominence, followed by the arrest, trial and eventual execution of [[King Louis XVI]] (January 1793). An international alliance was formed to counter revolutionary France.

==War of the Pyrenees==
[[File:Sare Larralde.JPG|thumb|Memorial plaque inside the St. Martin church to a victim of the 1793-1795 repression  ([[Sare|Sara]], Labourd)]]
The new order was not implemented until the [[War of the Pyrenees]], with the arrival of the [[Army of the Pyrenees]]. The area came under direct military control. In the run-up to the execution of the King Louis XVI in January 1793, tension mounted when the clergy was required to vow loyalty to the French Constitution and the replacement of local priests by ''constitutional'' clergymen coming from elsewhere in France.

On the outbreak of the War of the Pyrenees, Basque population was required to join the army. Very few attended the call, and the Basques were considered hostile to the French republic. Terror was considered to abash the Basques, and the moment seemed to arrive when scores of youths defected their positions in the French army and fled to the Spanish Basque region across the border.

The regional republican authorities decided the implementation of mass repression in southern Labourd. Basque was prohibited in most public contexts, claiming that "fanaticism speaks Basque."{{Sfnp|Bolinaga|2012|p=87}} In the spring 1794, thousands&lt;ref&gt;Accounts range from to 3,000 to 10,000 residents.&lt;/ref&gt; were forced out of their homes, regrouped, and segregated by age and sex, then conducted in a long column to at least 40 km away of their houses, to the vicinity of [[Capbreton]]. Several hundreds died,&lt;ref&gt;Accounts range from a few hundreds to 1,600.&lt;/ref&gt; and their possessions were burnt or confiscated.

Within months, many deportees managed to come back home when the Jacobin National Convention collapsed, only to find their properties in the hands of French "patriots".{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|p=58}} A trial took place to clarify responsibilities during the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], but no high- or mid-ranking officials were found accountable. Turmoil and unrest ensued in southern Labourd triggered by a desire for restoration and revenge, leading for example to the assassination in Ustaritz of Monsieur Mundutegi, a local proponent of the mass deportation. Many victims and dissidents of the new regime took to exile.{{Sfnp|Douglass|2005|p=130}}

That fact is astounding, for all the individuals of the seven provinces agree, acquiesce on that notion.''"

While the harshest period of the First French Republic was gone, the repressive events were to leave an indelible, damaging effect in the Basque collective psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Watson points to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its dichotomous, exclusive approach to reality as the basis of the new French Republican outlook. See Watson, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; It became the earliest chapter aimed at diluting the Basques in the new French national arrangement. The foundation of the idea of modernity associated to the French nation-state deprived the Basques from a specific cultural and political identity.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|p=59}}

During the next decades, the Basques defected from the French army in alarming numbers amidst accusations of discrimination and mistreatment.&lt;ref&gt;The matter was discussed by [[Dominique Joseph Garat]] with Bonaparte.&lt;/ref&gt; Still [[Dominique Joseph Garat]], a high-ranking official close to Bonaparte at the turn of the 19th century, put forward the possibility of establishing a buffer Basque principality loyal to France. However, while aspects of that idea started to be implemented in the [[Southern Basque Country|Spanish Basque districts]] as of 1810,{{Sfnp|Bolinaga|2012|pp=201-211}}&lt;ref&gt;Bonaparte's arrangement included also the territories of Aragon and Catalonia to the north of the Ebro river.&lt;/ref&gt; no such idea came to be considered by Bonaparte for the French Basque Country.

In 1804, the Napoleonic ''[[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]]'' was decreed, breaking up the native legal approach to inheritance and property, bringing about the fragmentation of the family's farmstead and restriction to communal lands (duties required by the state), prompting yet further emigration waves.{{Sfnp|Douglass|2005|pp=133-134}} These institutional and legal events were coupled with exactions, recruitment and requisitioning implemented by the different military expeditions during the successive wars, e.g. [[Peninsular War]].{{Sfnp|Douglass|2005|p=130}} Half a century later, the [[prefect]] of the [[Basses-Pyrénées]] lamented the decrease of 80.000 inhabitants in the population across the region due to taxation and regular military draft, a remark conveniently highlighted by Fermin Lasala to make a case for the continuation of the Basque institutional specificity on the eve of its [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|permanent suppression in the Basque Provinces (1876)]].{{Sfnp|Mina|1990|pp=307-308}} The bulk of the French Basques continued to oppose the idea of a French republic still for over a century, yearning for the restitution of the [[Ancien Regime|former regime]] and their native institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2381">M.A. '''Erkki Juhani Nordberg''' (17 August 1946, Helsinki &amp;ndash; 28 March 2012, Helsinki) was a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[colonel]] who served as the Chief of the Educational Department of the Main Headquarters of the [[Finnish Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/Kriisien+asiantuntija+eversti+Erkki+Nordberg+kuollut/a1305558855450&lt;/ref&gt;

Before that, Nordberg served in the Finnish Defense Forces as the commander of the Brigade of [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelia]] from 1999 to 2002.

In his educational work, Nordberg focused foremost in the history of the Finnish wars during [[World War II]] and he has researched extensively the war plans of the [[Soviet Union]], related to World War II. He authored and co-authored several books and he wrote numerous columns for various newspapers – nearly all on military- and war-related issues.

In additions to his publishing and educational work, the general public got to know Nordberg as a regular [[war correspondent]] on the Finnish television and radio channels, e.g. during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and the [[Yugoslav Wars]].  
 
In his book, ''Arvio ja ennuste Venäjän sotilaspolitiikasta Suomen suunnalla'' of 2003 ("The Analysis and Prognosis of the Russian Military Politics on the Finnish Front"), Colonel Nordberg explains in detail why and how the Soviet Union planned and intended to invade [[Finland]], following the [[Winter War]] (1939–1940).

'''Felix Dahn''' (9 February 1834 – 3 January 1912) was a German law professor, [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] author, poet and historian.

==Biography==
Ludwig Julius Sophus Felix Dahn was born in [[Hamburg]] as the oldest son of Friedrich (1811–1889) and Constanze Dahn who were notable actors at the city's theatre. The family had both German and French roots. Dahn began his studies in law and philosophy in [[University of Munich|Munich]] (he had moved there with his parents in 1834), and graduated as [[Doctor of Laws]] in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]]. After his [[habilitation treatise]], Dahn became a lecturer of German Law in Munich in 1857. 
In 1863 he became [[senior lecturer]]/[[associate professor]] in [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]], received a professorship in [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]] (in 1872).

Dahn was married to the artist Sophie Fries (1835–1898), with whom he had a son. He tutored baroness Therese von Droste-Hülshoff, a relative of the poet [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]], in poetry from 1867 and entered an illicit love affair with her, which he gave a literary treatment in his ''Sind Götter?'' (1874).
He divorced his wife and married Therese, against opposition from both families, in 1873.

Dahn  relocated to [[University of Breslau]] in 1888, again as a full professor, and was elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university in 1895. As rector, he enforced a ban on Polish student associations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''Microcosm'' (2003), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was an honorary member of [[German Student Corps]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and an active member of the  nationalist ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]''.

Dahn received honorary doctorates in Medicine and in Philosophy. 
Dahn died in [[Breslau]],  a month before his 78th birthday.

==Works==
Dahn's writings were influential in the conception of the European [[Migration Period]] (''Völkerwanderung'' ) in German historiography of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His multi-volume ''Prehistory of the Germanic and Roman Peoples'', a chronology of the   Migration Period that first appeared in print in 1883, was so definitive that abbreviated versions were reprinted until the late 1970s.

From the 1860s, Dahn regularly wrote for ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]''.
His nationalist historical novels were widely received, and according to Houdsen (1997) were influential in the formation of the ''[[völkisch]]'' ideology that formed the "Germany's pre-Hitlerian intellectual background for National Socialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |quote=The philosophies of Fichte, Hegel, or Nietzsche did not contribute as much to Germany's pre-Hitlerian intellectual background for National Socialism as commemorations of the victory at Sedan (in the Franco-Prussian War), Bismarckian blood and iron quotations, the historical novels of Felix Dahn |title=Resistance and Conformity in the Third Reich |first=Martyn |last=Housden |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |page=3 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His 1876  ''[[A Struggle for Rome|Ein Kampf um Rom]]'' according to Kipper (2002) contributed to the [[ethnic essentialism]] and opposition to [[Miscegenation|ethnic miscegenation]] of the  "völkisch avant-garde".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=266781088192848 Rainer Kipper.

Dahn published numerous poems, many with a nationalist bent. His ''Mette von Marienburg'' portrays bands of "[[Masuria|Masures]] and Poles" hiding in the "[[Podolian Voivodeship|Podolian]] forest".&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Werke. Band 5: Gedichte und Balladen'', Leipzig 1912. 
The comparison to packs of wolves is mentioned as stressing the "implacability of the Poles" alongside the writings of [[Arthur Jonetz]] and "many other German nationalists" by  {{Cite book |title=German Nationalism and Religious Conflict: Culture, Ideology, Politics, 1870–1914 |first=Helmut Walser |last=Smith |year=2014 |page=173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his historical and literary production, Dahn also published a large amount of specialist legal literature, on topics such as [[trade law]] and [[international law]].

==Life==
Renier was the child of Johanna Maria Elisabeth Renier and the [[maritime pilot]] Peter Paul Renier,&lt;ref&gt;H. van der Hoeven, [http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn1/renier Renier, Gustaaf Johannes Petrus (1892-1962)] at historic.nl (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; both natives of Flushing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-afens/I4717.php Genealogy page]. Both biographies erroneously describe Renier's mother as [[Walloons|Walloon]]. Both his grandfathers were from [[Ostend]], West Flanders, his grandmothers were locals from Flushing and [[Middelburg]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to school in [[Antwerp]] and [[Leuven]], and studied History at the [[University of Ghent]], beginning a doctorate under [[Henri Pirenne]]. At the outbreak of the First World War he fled to England, and remained there working as a journalist, biographer and translator, before completing a doctorate under [[Pieter Geyl]]. In 1936 he succeeded Geyl as Reader in Dutch History at [[University College London]], retiring in 1957.

In contrast to his former advisor, Geyl, he took the view that Dutch and Belgian nationhood were highly distinct.

'''George Darling Watt''' (12 May 1812 – 24 October 1881)&lt;ref name=birth&gt;Ronald G. Watt wrote in 1977 that the birth was in December 1815 {{Harv|Watt|1977|p=49}}, though in a much later publication he claimed it was 12 May 1812 {{Harv|Watt|2000}}. Additionally Watt's grave has [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=125223&amp;PIpi=30109358 two tombstones], which list both [http://image1.findagrave.com/photos/2010/178/125223_127778476231.jpg January 16 1815] and [http://image1.findagrave.com/photos/2010/178/125223_127778469813.jpg May 18, 1812] as birth dates.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first convert to [[Mormonism]] baptized in the [[British Isles]]. As a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), Watt was a secretary to [[Brigham Young]], the primary editor of the ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' and the primary inventor of the [[Deseret Alphabet]].

Watt was born in [[Manchester]], England. While living in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] as a young man, Watt was a member of the Reverend James Fielding's congregation. Fielding's brother [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph]] had joined the [[Church of Christ (Latter-day Saints)|Latter-day Saint church]] in [[Upper Canada]] and had written to James about the new church. In 1837, [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Latter-day Saint missionaries]] [[Heber C. Kimball]], [[Orson Hyde]], [[Willard Richards]], and Joseph Fielding traveled to Preston and were given permission by James Fielding to preach in his chapel.

Watt was baptized a [[Latter-day Saint]] on July 30, 1837 by [[Heber C. Kimball]] in the [[River Ribble]]. Watt won the right to be the first official British [[Latter-day Saint]] convert by winning a footrace against eight others from Fielding's congregation that desired to join the [[Mormons]]. In 1840 and 1841 Watt served as a Mormon missionary in [[Scotland]]. In 1842, Watt left England to join the gathering of the Latter-day Saints in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]].

In 1846, [[Brigham Young]] sent Watt and his wife back to England as church missionaries. Watt used his skill at [[Pitman shorthand]] in serving as a clerk to [[mission president]] [[George Q. Cannon]]. In late 1850, the Watts returned to America and joined the new gathering of Latter-day Saints in the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in [[Utah Territory]].

In Utah, Watt worked as a reporter for the ''[[Deseret News]]'' and as a private clerk for Brigham Young. Using his skill as a stenographer, Watt began recording the sermons given by Young and other LDS Church leaders. Beginning in 1853, Watt published these sermons in a periodical known as the ''[[Journal of Discourses]]''. Watt remained the primary editor of the ''Journal'' until 1868.

In 1852, Watt was appointed by Young to a committee that was charged with creating a new phonetic alphabet that would assist non-English speaking Latter-day Saint immigrants learn English. The result was the [[Deseret Alphabet]]. Although the alphabet was largely a failure, Watt remained a strong promoter of the language system.

In 1869, Watt was disfellowshipped from the LDS Church for following the teachings of dissident [[William S. Godbe]]. Watt was identified as one of the leaders of the "[[Godbeites]]" and was disciplined by the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]. Although Watt was initially repentant and desired to return to full fellowship in the LDS Church, by 1874 he was a devoted [[Godbeite]] and was excommunicated from the LDS Church on May 3, 1874.

Later, Watt tried to return to the LDS Church. Four times he attempted to rejoin the church but was denied because his beliefs differed from those of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last    = Watt | first   = Ronald G. | title   = Sailing 'The Old Ship Zion': The Life of George D.

Watt died in [[Kaysville, Utah|Kaysville]], [[Utah Territory]], at the age of 65, estranged from the LDS Church and its leaders. Watt's obituary describes him as "honest truthful and sincere although perhaps misguided being a self made man of strong character and exercising vast influence there is not a little in his career which is remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Salt Lake Herald]]'', 25 October 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, Taylor made a special trip to the home to say that he should be buried in his [[temple robes]].

Like many early Latter-day Saints, Watt practiced [[plural marriage]]; he had six wives. One of his wives, Jane Brown, was his half sister—they shared a mother, Mary Ann Wood.&lt;ref name="PolygamyIncest"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Embry|first1=Jessie L|title=Ultimate Taboos: Incest and Mormon Polygamy|journal=Journal of Mormon History|date=January 1, 1992|volume=18|issue=1|pages=93–113|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=mormonhistory|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3471">'''George Kodinos''' or '''Codinus''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Κωδινός}}), also '''[[Pseudepigrapha|Pseudo]]-Kodinos''', ''[[kouropalates]]'' in the [[Byzantine]] court, is the reputed 14th-century author of three extant works in late [[Byzantine literature]].

Their attribution to him is merely a matter of convenience, two of them being anonymous in the manuscripts. Οf Kodinos himself nothing is known; it is supposed that he lived towards the end of the 14th century. The works referred to are the following:
#''[[Patria of Constantinople|Patria]]'' (Πάτρια Κωνσταντινουπόλεως), treating of the history, topography, and monuments of [[Constantinople]]. It is divided into five sections: (a) the foundation of the city; (b) its situation, limits and topography; (c) its statues, works of art, and other notable sights; (d) its buildings; (e) and the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]]. It was written in the reign of [[Basil II]] (976-1025), revised and rearranged under [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (1081–1118), and perhaps copied by Codinus, whose name it bears in some (later) manuscripts. The chief sources are: the ''Patria'' of [[Hesychius of Miletus|Hesychius Illustrius of Miletus]], the anonymous ''[[Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai]]'', and an anonymous account ({{lang|grc|ἔκφρασις}}) of St Sophia (ed. [[Theodor Preger]] in ''Scriptores originum Constantinopolitanarum'', fasc. i, 1901, followed by the ''Patria'' of Codinus). [[Procopius]], ''De Aedificiis'' and the poem of [[Paulus Silentiarius]] on the dedication of St. Sophia should be read in connexion with this subject.
#''De Officiis'' ({{lang|grc|Τακτικόν περί των οφφικίων του Παλατίου Kωνσταντινουπόλεως και των οφφικίων της Μεγάλης Εκκλησίας}}), a treatise, written in an unattractive style between 1347 and 1368, of the court and higher [[ecclesiastical]] dignities and of the ceremonies proper to different occasions, as they had evolved by the middle [[Palaiologan period]]. It should be compared with the earlier ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' of [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] and other ''[[Taktika (disambiguation)|Taktika]]'' of the 9th and 10th centuries [https://books.google.de/books?id=udPOxVbiV70C&amp;hl=el&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].
#A chronological outline of events from the beginning of the world to the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] (called Agarenes in the manuscript title). 

Complete editions are (by [[Immanuel Bekker]]) in the ''Bonn Corpus scriptorum Hist. Byz.'' (1839–1843, where, however, some sections of the ''Patria'' are omitted), and in [[Jacques Paul Migne|JP Migne]], ''[[Patrologia graeca]] civil.''; see also [[Karl Krumbacher]], ''Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur'' (1897).

'''Helen King''' (born 1957) is a British classical scholar. She is Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at the [[Open University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.open.ac.uk/people/hk2455 |title=Professor Helen King |work=OU people profiles |publisher=Open University |accessdate=29 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was previously Professor of the History of Classical Medicine and Head of the Department of Classics at the [[University of Reading]].&lt;ref name="Erskine2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Erskine|first=Andrew|title=A companion to ancient history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Y_aM_74ENMC&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=5 March 2011|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-3150-6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
King was born in 1957. For King going to university or doing a PhD wasn't inevitable, and she had little notion of what doctoral research involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wcc-uk.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2016/08/15/my-classics-career-prof-helen-king/|title=My Classics Career: Prof. Helen King|date=2016-08-15|work=WCC-UK|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she completed her first degree in Ancient History and Social Anthropology at [[University College London]]. She was awarded her doctorate in 1985 for a PhD on [[menstruation]] in [[ancient Greece]] supervised by Sally Humphreys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcc-uk.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2016/08/15/my-classics-career-prof-helen-king/ |title=My Classics Career |first=Helen |last=King |publisher=Women's Classical Committee |date=15 August 2016 |accessdate=29 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From 'parthenos' to 'gyne': the dynamics of category|last=King|first=Helen|publisher=PhD Thesis, University of London|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her thesis was entitled ''From 'parthenos' to 'gyne': the Dynamics of Category.'' 

==Academic career==
[[File:'Bodily Fluids Fluid Bodies in Greek and Roman Antiquity 21.jpg|thumb|278x278px|Helen King delivering her keynote lecture, Cardiff University, 2016]]
Having completed her doctorate, King held research fellowships at the universities of [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]], taught at the [[Liverpool Institute of Higher Education]] for eight years, and moved to Reading on a [[Wellcome Trust]] University Award in 1996. From 2008 she was also Visiting Professor at the [[Peninsula Medical School]] in [[Truro]]. She moved to the Open University to assume the role of Professor of Classical Studies in 2011. She retired in January 2017 and took up the position of Robert E. and Susan T. Rydell Visiting Professor 2017–2018 at [[Gustavus Adolphus College]], St Peter, MN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gustavus.edu/events/nobelconference/concertFiles/media/2017/Nobel_53_Program_2017.pdf|title=Nobel Conference 2017 Program|last=|first=|date=3 October 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was a Women's Studies Area Advisor to the [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]] (1996). She has been a Fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (2001), a Landsdowne Visiting Lecturer at the [[University of Victoria]], British Columbia (2002), a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] (2005), a Käthe Leichter Visiting Professor in Women's Studies and Gender Studies at the University of Vienna (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genderausschuss.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=78116&amp;L=0|title=Käthe-Leichter-GastprofessorInnen ab 1999|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Provost's Distinguished Women Lecturer, Notre Dame, IN (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://provost.nd.edu/diversity/provost-s-distinguished-women-lecturers/|title=Provost’s Distinguished Women Lecturers|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; King has appeared on ''[[History Cold Case]]'', ''Tony Robinson's Gods &amp; Monsters'', and ''Harlots, Housewives &amp; Heroines: A 17th Century History for Girls''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3391707/?ref_=nv_sr_6 |title=Helen King |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has contributed to two episodes of [[In Our Time (radio series)]] on [[BBC Radio 4]], speaking on [[Galen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c4dys|title=In Our Time, Galen|accessdate=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Hippocratic Oath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014gdqq|title=In Our Time, The Hippocratic Oath|accessdate=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research interests ==
With the publication of her book ''[[Hippocrates]]' Woman: Reading the Female Body in Ancient Greece'' (1998), King established herself as the leading authority on the practice and theory of [[History of medicine|ancient medicine]] as relating to women and how it continues to influence thought to the present day.

'''Hernando del Pulgar''' (1436 – c. 1492) was a [[converso]] Spanish writer.

He was born at [[Pulgar]] (near [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) and was educated at the court of [[John II of Castile|John II]]. [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]] made him one of his secretaries, and under [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] he became councillor of state, was charged with a mission to France, and in 1482 was appointed [[historiographer]]-royal. He is said to have died in 1492.

His ''Crónica de los Reyes Católicos'', wrongly ascribed in the first edition (1545) to [[Antonio de Nebrija]], who had composed a Latin history based upon Pulgar's manuscript, is commonly supposed to be propaganda for his patrons, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand; nevertheless, it is often critical of their policies and admonitory in its insistence that monarchs need to respect moral and spiritual ideals.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Boruchoff, "Historiography with License: Isabel, the Catholic Monarch and the Kingdom of God,” ''Isabel la Católica, Queen of Castile: critical essays'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), 225–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Pulgar's ''Claros varones de Castilla'' (1486), a series of portraits of eminent nobles, ecclesiastics, and men of learning, provides interesting insights into the court of Henry IV. These portraits were published together with Pulgar's ''Letras'' (1486), which were directed to both well-known and anonymous correspondents. Pulgar also composed a gloss (ca. 1485) on the ''Coplas de Mingo Revulgo''.

{{Arab-Israeli conflict (topics)}}
The [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] is a modern phenomenon, which has its roots in the end of the 19th century. The conflict became a major international issue with the birth of [[Israel]] in 1948. The Arab–Israeli conflict has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of minor conflicts. It has also been the source of two major [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] uprisings ([[w:intifada|intifada]]s).

==Background==

===Ottoman era===
Tensions between the [[Zionist]] movements and the [[Palestinian people|Arab residents of Palestine]] started to emerge after the 1880s, when [[aliyah|immigration]] of [[Ashkenazi Jews|European Jews]] to Palestine increased. This immigration increased the Jewish communities in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by the acquisition of land from Ottoman and individual Arab landholders, known as [[effendi]]s, and establishment of Jewish agricultural settlements. At the time, Arabs lived in an almost feudal existence on the effendis' land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismi.emory.edu/JournalArticles/MESapr84.html The Jewish National Fund: Land Purchase Methods and Priorities, 1924 - 1939] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517012132/http://www.ismi.emory.edu/JournalArticles/MESapr84.html |date=2008-05-17 }} by Kenneth W. Stein. ''Middle Eastern Studies''. April 1984. Volume 20 Number 2, pp. 190-205&lt;/ref&gt; Demographer [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]] estimated from Ottoman census data that the population of Palestine in 1882–3 was about 468,000, consisting of 408,000 Muslims, 44,000 Christians and 15,000 Jews.&lt;ref name=McCarthy10&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Justin McCarthy (American historian) | author = Justin McCarthy | title = The Population of Palestine | publisher = Columbia University Press | place = New York | pages = 10–19 | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the eve of World War I, these numbers had increased to 602,000 Muslims, 81,000 Christians and 39,000 Jews, plus a similar but uncertain number of Jews who were not Ottoman citizens.&lt;ref name=McCarthy10/&gt; The first Statistician General of Israel, Roberto Bachi, give similar numbers except for a lower count (525,000) of Muslims in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Roberto Bachi | title = The Population of Israel | publisher = C.I.C.R.E.D. | year = 1974 | page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate (1920–1948)===
[[Image:Weizmann and feisal 1918.jpg|left|thumb|1918. [[Faisal I of Iraq|Emir Faisal]] and [[Chaim Weizmann]] (left, also wearing Arab outfit)]]
During the time of the [[Mandatory Palestine]], the [[Balfour Declaration]] signed in 1917, stated that the government of Great Britain supported the establishment of a "Jewish national home" in Palestine. This exacerbated tensions between the Arabs living in [[Mandate Palestine]] and the Jews who emigrated there during the Ottoman period. Signed in January 1919, the [[Faisal–Weizmann Agreement]] promoted Arab-Jewish cooperation on the development of a [[Land of Israel|Jewish national homeland]] in Palestine and an Arab nation in a large part of the [[Middle East]], though this event had little to no effect on the conflict.&lt;ref name = "Sela"&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]]. "Arab-Israeli Conflict." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. Avraham Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 58-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the [[San Remo conference]] largely endorsed the 1916 Anglo-French [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]], allocating to Britain the area of present-day [[Jordan]], the area between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[Iraq]], while [[France]] received [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. In 1922, the [[League of Nations]] formally established the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine and Transjordan]], at least partially fulfilling Britain's commitments from the 1915–16 [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence]] by assigning all of the land east of the Jordan River to the Emirate of Jordan, ruled by [[Hashemite]] king [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] but closely dependent on Britain, leaving the remainder west of the Jordan as the [[League of Nations]] Mandatory Palestine. While the British had made promises to give both Arabs and Jews land, the British claimed they had never promised to give either side all of the land. Rising tensions had given way to violence, such as the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots]], and [[Jaffa riots]] of 1921. To assuage the Arabs, and due to British inability to control Arab violence in the Mandatory Palestine any other way, the semi-autonomous Arab Emirate of Transjordan was created in all Palestinian territory east of the Jordan river (roughly 77% of the mandate).

The conflicting forces of [[Arab nationalism]] and the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement created a situation which the British could neither resolve nor extricate themselves from. [[Pogrom]]s in Russia and the Ukraine as well as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in [[Germany]] created a new urgency in the Zionist movement to create a Jewish state, and the evident intentions of the Zionists provoked increasingly fierce Arab attacks against the Jewish population (most notably in the preceding [[1929 Hebron massacre]], the activities of the [[Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]], and during the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]]). The British-appointed [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], led opposition to the idea of turning part of Palestine into a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Oren"&gt;"Though attracted to the economic benefits generated by Zionist settlement—an estimated 300,000 Arabs would eventually enter the country from neighboring Arab states—thousands of Palestinian fellaheen ... were displaced by Jewish land purchases while urban workers were marginalized by more technologically skilled Jewish laborers." [[Michael Oren|Oren, Michael B.]] ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy: American in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2007. p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

In search for help in expelling British forces from Palestine, thus removing the enforcer of the Zionist enterprise, the Grand Mufti sought alliance with the [[Axis Powers]]. The response of the British government was to banish the Mufti (where he spent much of [[World War II]] in [[Germany]] and helped form a Muslim [[SS]] division in the [[Balkans]]), curb Jewish immigration, and reinforce its police force. The Jewish leadership (''[[Yishuv]]'') "adopted a policy of restraint (''havlaga'') and static defense in response to Arab attacks"&lt;ref&gt;Sela, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized the British for "what they regarded as Britain's retreat from the Balfour Declaration and its conciliation of Arab violence."&lt;ref name="Oren" /&gt; It was at this time that critics of this policy broke away from the ''[[Hagana]]'' (the self-defense organization of the ''Yishuv'') and created the more [[right-wing]] militant ''[[Irgun]]'', which would later be led by [[Menachem Begin]] in 1943. For a list of Irgun attacks on Palestinian civilians and policemen during this period, see [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s]].

A British Royal Commission of Inquiry that came to be known as the [[Peel Commission]] was established in 1936.

[[File:1948 Arab Israeli War - May 15-June 10.svg|right|thumb|May 15 - June 10]]

The fighting ended with signing of the several [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Armistice Agreements]] in 1949 between Israel and its warring neighbors (Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria), which formalized Israeli control of the area allotted to the Jewish state plus just over half of the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|area allotted to the Arab state]]. The [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt]] and the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|West Bank by Jordan]] until June 1967 when they were occupied by Israel during the [[Six-Day War]].

===Aftermath of the 1948 war===
{{Main|List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus|1948 Palestinian exodus|Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}

The about [[1948 Palestinian exodus|711,000 Palestinians]] who fled or were expelled from the areas that became Israel were not allowed to return to their homes, and took up residence in [[refugee camp]]s in surrounding countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the area that was later to be known as the [[Gaza Strip]]; they were usually not allowed to leave refugee camps and mix with the local Arab society either, leaving the Palestinian refugee problem unsolved even today. Around 400 Arab towns and villages were depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus. The [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] was established to alleviate their condition.&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;

After the war, "[t]he Arab states insisted on two main demands", neither of which were accepted by Israel:
1. Israel should withdraw to the borders of the [[UN Partition Plan]] — Israel argued "that the new borders—which could be changed, under consent only—had been established as a result of war, and because the UN blueprint took no account of defense needs and was militarily untenable, there was no going back to that blueprint."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;
2. The [[Palestinian refugee]]s deserved a full [[right of return]] back into [[Israel]] — Israel argued that this was "out of the question, not only because they were hostile to the Jewish state, but they would also fundamentally alter the Jewish character of the state."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;

Over the next two decades after the 1948 war ended, between [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|700,000 and 900,000 Jews]] fled or were expelled from the Arab countries they were living in, in many cases owing to anti-Jewish sentiment, expulsion (in the case of Egypt), or, in the case of Iraq, legal oppression but also quite often to promises of a better life from Israel; of this number, two-thirds ended up in [[ma'abarot|refugee camps]] in Israel, while the remainder migrated to [[France]], the United States and other [[Western world|Western]] or [[Latin America]]n countries. The Jewish refugee camps in Israel were evacuated with time and the refugees were eventually integrated in the Jewish Israeli society (which in fact consisted almost entirely of refugees from Arab and European states). Israel argued that this and the Palestinian exodus represented a [[population exchange]] between Arab nations and the Jewish nation.&lt;ref name="Sela"/&gt;

For the 19 years from the end of the Mandate until the [[Six-Day War]], Jordan controlled the West Bank and Egypt controlled the Gaza Strip. In 1950, Jordan annexed the West Bank, but this [[annexation]] was recognized only by the [[United Kingdom]]. Both territories were conquered (but not annexed) from Jordan and Egypt by Israel in the Six-Day War. Neither Jordan nor Egypt allowed the creation of a Palestinian state in these territories. The effect this had on Israel during this period "were frequent border clashes ... terror and sabotage acts by individuals and small groups of Palestinian Arabs."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;

==War of 1956==
{{main|Suez Crisis}}
The 1956 Suez War was a joint Israeli-British-French operation, in which Israel invaded the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and British and French forces landed at the port of [[Suez]], ostensibly to separate the warring parties, though the real motivation of Great Britain and [[France]] was to protect the interests of investors in those countries who were affected by Egyptian President [[Gamel Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s decision to [[nationalize]] the [[Suez Canal]]. Israel justified its invasion of Egypt as an attempt to stop attacks (see the [[Fedayeen]]) upon Israeli civilians, and to restore Israeli shipping rights through the [[Straits of Tiran]], which Egypt claimed was within its territorial waters. The invading forces agreed to withdraw under U.S. and international pressure, and Israel withdrew from the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] as well, in return for the installation of [[United Nations Emergency Force]]s and guarantees of Israeli freedom of shipment. The canal was left in Egyptian (rather than British and French) hands.

==Between 1956 and 1967==
This period saw the rise of [[Nasserism]]; the founding of the [[United Arab Republic]] in 1958 and its collapse in 1961; Syrian plans for the diversion of water from the [[Jordan River]]; continued [[fedayeen]] raids, mostly from Syria and Jordan, and Israeli reprisals; and the increasing alignment of the Arab states with the [[Soviet Union]], who became their largest arms supplier.

In 1964, the [[PLO]] was established by mostly Palestinian refugees mostly from [[Jordan]].&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; The Article 24 of the [[Palestinian National Charter]] of 1964 [https://web.archive.org/web/20001217042800/http://palestine-un.org/plo/pna_two.html] stated: "This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the [[West Bank]] in the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], on the [[Gaza Strip]] or in the [[Himmah Area]]."

==War of 1967==
{{main|Six-Day War}}

The background from which erupted the Six-Day War was caused by an erroneous information given to Nasser from the Soviet intelligence services that Israel was amassing troops near the Israeli-Syrian border. The state of conflict was also very tense after increased conflicts between Israel and Syria and Israel and Jordan - i.e. the [[Samu Incident|Samu incident]]. On 14 May 1967 [[Mohamed Fawzi (general)]] left for Syria for one day tour, verified that the Soviet report was false and reported that there were no Israeli armed forces near the Syrian border.&lt;ref name="Gluska2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ami Gluska|title=The Israeli Military and the Origins of the 1967 War: Government, Armed Forces and Defence Policy 1963 67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQp2fvnSDm0C|accessdate=18 September 2013|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-96596-2|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Nasser declared full mobilisation in Egypt as of 14 May 1967, citing the joint defence agreement with Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 64, 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, "Fawzi reported to Nasser that: 'There is nothing there. No massing of forces. Nothing.'" p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian further steps were stationing of 100,000 Egyptian troops at the [[Sinai Peninsula]], expulsion of [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] peacekeeping forces (UNEF II) from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] along the border with [[Israel]], and closure of the [[Straits of Tiran]] on May 21–22, 1967 (thus "blocking all shipping to and from Eilat ... a ''[[casus belli]]''" according to a possible interpretation of international law).&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; The Israeli army had a potential strength, including the not fully mobilized reserves, of 264,000 troops.

Following the breakdown of international diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis, the fighting in the Six-Day War of 1967 began on 6 June 1967 with surprise Israeli air strikes that destroyed the entire Egyptian air force while it was still on the ground. In spite of Israel's request to Jordan to desist from attacking it, Jordan along with Syria began to shell Israeli targets. In addition, Hussein, reluctant at first, sent ineffective bomber strikes because of Nasser's requests and affirmation of a sound Egyptian victory. Attacks on other Arab air forces took place later in the day as hostilities broke out on other fronts. A subsequent ground invasion into Egyptian territory led to Israel's conquest of the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. With the rapid and rather unexpected success on the Egyptian front, Israel decided to attack and successfully captured the [[West Bank]] from Jordan on June 7, and the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria on June 9.

===Khartoum Resolution, UN Resolution 242, and peace proposals===
The '''Khartoum Resolution''' of September 1, 1967, was issued at the conclusion of [[1967 Arab League summit]] convened in the wake of the [[Six-Day War]], in [[Khartoum]], the capital of [[Sudan]]. The summit lasted from August 29  to September 1 and was attended by eight Arab heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Khartoum Resolutions|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/three_noes.html|work=[[American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]]|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution called for: a continued state of belligerency with [[Israel]], ending the [[1967 Oil Embargo|Arab oil boycott]] declared during the [[Six-Day War]], an end to the [[North Yemen Civil War]], and economic assistance for [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]]. It is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the "Three No's": "no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/14841/khartoum_resolution.html?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fpublication_list%3Ftype%3Dessential_document%26page%3D69|title=Essential Documents: Khartoum Resolution|work=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=2009-11-08}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Six-Day War]], the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[Resolution 242]] which proposed a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The resolution was accepted by Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, but rejected by Syria until 1972–73 and the [[Yom Kippur War]]. To this day, Resolution 242 remains controversial due to conflicting interpretations over how much territory Israel would be required to withdraw from in order to conform with the resolution. Also, after the Israeli occupation of the West Bank following the war, [[Palestinian nationalism]] substantially increased. Armed resistance was encouraged from within the newly [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] and from the Arab nations that lost in the war.&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;

[[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]] proposed the [[Rogers Plan]], which called for a 90-day ceasefire, a military standstill zone on each side of the Suez Canal, and an effort to reach agreement in the framework of UN Resolution 242.&lt;ref&gt;“The Ceasefire/Standstill Proposal” 19 June 1970,

[[Image:Yom Kippur War map.svg|right|thumb|250px|When the ceasefire came into effect, Israel had lost ground on the east side of the Suez Canal to Egypt (shown in red) but gained ground west of the canal and in the Golan Heights (shown in gray/brown)]]
The 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] began when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise joint attack, on the Jewish day of fasting, in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. The Egyptians and Syrians advanced during the first 24&amp;ndash;48 hours, after which momentum began to swing in Israel's favor. By the second week of the war, the Syrians had been pushed entirely out of the Golan Heights. In the Sinai to the south, the Israelis had struck at the "hinge" between two invading Egyptian armies, crossed the Suez Canal (where the old ceasefire line had been), and cut off an entire Egyptian army just as a [[United Nations]] ceasefire came into effect. During this time, the [[United States]] airlifted military supplies to Israel while the Soviet Union airlifted military supplies to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;

Israeli troops eventually withdrew from the west of the Canal and the Egyptians kept their positions on a narrow strip on the east allowing them to re-open the Suez Canal and claim victory.&lt;ref&gt;Slantchev, Branislav L.

{{main|1978 South Lebanon conflict}}
Operation Litani was the official name of [[Israel]]'s 1978 invasion of [[Lebanon]] up to the [[Litani River|Litani]] river. The invasion was a military success, as [[PLO]] forces were pushed north of the river. However, international outcry led to the creation of the [[UNIFIL]] peacekeeping force and a partial Israeli retreat.

===1982 Lebanon War===
{{main|1982 Lebanon War}}
The 1982 Lebanon War began when Israel attacked Lebanon, justified by Israel as an attempt to remove the [[Fatah]] militants led by [[Yasser Arafat]] from Southern Lebanon (where they had established, during the country's civil war, a semi-independent enclave used to launch attacks on Israel). The invasion was widely criticized both in and outside Israel, especially after the Israeli-backed [[Phalangist]] Christian militia's [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], and ultimately led to the death of roughly 1,000 Palestinians. Although through the war, Israel succeeded in exiling the PLO military personnel, including Arafat to [[Tunisia]], it became entangled with various local [[Muslim]] militias (particularly [[Hezbollah]]), which fought to end the Israeli [[Military occupation|occupation]].

By 1985, Israel retreated from all but a narrow stretch of Lebanese territory designated by Israel as the [[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|Israeli Security Zone]]. [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]] (calling on Israel to completely withdraw from Lebanon) was not completely fulfilled until 16 June 2000.[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html] Despite UN Security Council resolutions [[UN Security Council Resolution 1559|1559]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 1583|1583]], [[Hezbollah#Hezbollah after the Israeli withdrawal|Hezbollah continues to have a military wing]].

==Intifada of 1987–1993==
{{main|First Intifada}}
The [[First Intifada]], 1987–1993, began as an uprising of Palestinians, particularly the young, against the Israeli military occupation of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] after the failure of the PLO to achieve any kind of meaningful diplomatic solution to the Palestinian issue. The exiled PLO leadership in Tunisia quickly assumed a role in the ''intifada'', but the uprising also brought a rise in the importance of Palestinian national and Islamic movements, and helped lead to the [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] in 1988. The ''intifada'' was started by a group of young Palestinians who began throwing rocks at the Israeli occupying forces in [[Jabalia]] (Gaza Strip) in December 1987. In May 1989, the government of [[Yitzhak Shamir]], the [[prime minister of Israel]] at the time, "suggested that violence cease, and that elections should be held in the West Bank and Gaza for a political delegation with whom Israel would come to terms regarding the implementation of Palestinian interim self-governing authority in these areas."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; These elections however never materialized.

During the Gulf War, 1990–1991, Iraq tried draw Israel into the confrontation and thereby make it difficult for Arab regimes to remain in the coalition. During the war, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and King [[Hussein of Jordan]] supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, while PLO chairman Yasser Arafat had allegedly received $100 million from [[Saddam Hussein]]. However, under strong pressure from the US, which feared direct Israeli involvement would threaten the unity of the coalition, Israel did not retaliate against Iraq and the multinational coalition ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The defeat of Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War "was a devastating blow to ... the Palestinians."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. ''The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror''. New York: The Modern Library, 2003. p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait.&lt;ref name=ppp&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven J. Rosen|work=Middle East Quarterly|title=Kuwait Expels Thousands of Palestinians|url=http://www.meforum.org/3391/kuwait-expels-palestinians|year=2012|quote=From March to September 1991, about 200,000 Palestinians were expelled from the emirate in a systematic campaign of terror, violence, and economic pressure while another 200,000 who fled during the Iraqi occupation were denied return.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of [[PLO]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] with [[Saddam Hussein]]. They also withdrew their financial support from the Palestinian cause due to PLO support of Saddam Hussein. It was this political environment that allowed for the PLO to begin talks with the United States and Israel. The First Palestinian Intifada ended with the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] and the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] by Israel and the PLO in 1993.

==Oslo peace process (1993–2000)==
{{main|Oslo Accords}}
In September 1993, Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat signed the Declaration of Principles (DOP) which "shaped the principles for a prospective process of the establishment of a five-year interim self-governing authority" in the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; In May 1994, the first stage of the DOP was implemented, Arafat arrived in the Gaza Strip, and financial aid started pouring in from the parts of the [[Western world]] and [[Japan]]. Unfortunately, "the new trend in Israeli-Palestinian relations also entailed a wave of violence by religious fanatics."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; In September 1996, after the opening of some ancient tunnels near the [[Temple Mount]], a small wave of violence occurred. This frightened many Israelis into believing that "the new reality created by the Oslo Agreements, namely the presence of an armed police force of approximately 30,000 Palestinians, ... could easily shift from cooperation to hostility."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;

In October 1998, Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] signed the [[Wye River Memorandum|Wye Memorandum]] which "called for the implementation of Israel's first and second redeployments according to the DOP in three phases."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; Shortly after, Netanyahu's government fell and the [[Labor (Israel)|Labor Party]] (under [[Ehud Barak]]) won control of the [[Knesset]]. Barak's election campaign was mostly geared toward a lasting peace in the Middle East by further implementation of the Wye Memorandum and the Oslo Accord.  Barak won the election and attempted to deliver on his promises in 2000, when he and Arafat met at Camp David.  Barak had offered Arafat a Palestinian state in all of the Gaza Strip and most of the West Bank with a capital in East Jerusalem.  Arafat rejected the proposal, did not make a counteroffer, and walked away from the negotiating table.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jeffrey.  ''Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror''.  New York: Vintage Books, 2008.  p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intifada of 2000==
{{main|Second Intifada}}
The al-Aqsa Intifada, or [[Second Intifada]], began in late September 2000, around the time Israeli opposition leader [[Ariel Sharon]] and a large contingent of armed bodyguards visited the [[Temple Mount]] (Haram al-Sharif) complex in Jerusalem and declared the area as an eternal Israeli territory. Widespread riots and attacks broke out among Palestinians and [[Arab citizens of Israel]] in Jerusalem and many major Israeli cities, and spread throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) involvement in the Intifada was handled by the [[Tanzim]] organization, which was the secret armed branch of Arafat's Fatah party within the PLO. In January 2002, the "PA's direct involvement in the Intifada was confirmed ... when the IDF intercepted a cargo ship in the Red Sea carrying tons of rockets, mortars, and other weapons and ammunition from [[Iran]], earmarked for smuggling into PA &lt;nowiki&gt;[Palestinian Authority]&lt;/nowiki&gt; areas."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; In March 2002, just prior to the [[Arab Peace Initiative]], [[suicide bombing]]s committed by Palestinians against Israeli civilians "intensified ... in buses, restaurants, coffee shops, and other public places in Israel."&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt; An Israeli [[human rights]] group, [[B'Tselem]], estimated the death toll to be 3,396 Palestinians and 994 Israelis,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3694350.stm] although this number is criticized for not showing the whole picture, and not differentiating between combatants and civilians (suicide bombers, for example, are counted in that death toll).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
The Intifada also created "heavy economic losses to both sides" of the conflict.&lt;ref name = "Sela" /&gt;

==Arab Peace Initiative of 2002==
{{main|Arab Peace Initiative}}
In 2002, [[Saudi Arabia]] offered a [[Arab Peace Initiative|peace plan]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and at a summit meeting of the [[Arab League]] in [[Beirut]]. The plan is based on, but goes beyond [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 338|Resolution 338]]. It essentially calls for full withdrawal, solution of the [[Palestinian refugee|refugee problem]] through the Palestinian "[[right of return]]", a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]] with its capital in [[East Jerusalem]] in return for fully normalized relations with the whole Arab world. This proposal was the first to receive the unanimous backing of the Arab League.

In response, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]] said: "... the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in [[Netanya]]", referring to the [[Netanya suicide attack]].[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About+the+Ministry/MFA+Spokesman/2002/Response+of+FM+Peres+to+the+decisions+of+the+Arab.htm]

In 2005, the [[United States Congress]] acknowledged that Saudi Arabia has been funding to [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian insurgency groups.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Matthew and [[Dennis Ross]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=saudi+arabia+funding+hamas+2005&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BP3gByg_3R&amp;sig=aV-i3wgRl1-UzOwqUi5GzN0CFJo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gpMsTYCGKYLSsAOkzuWRBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=saudi%20arabia%20funding%20hamas%202005&amp;f=false "Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad."] ''Google Books''. 11 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel's Disengagement of 2005==
{{main|Israel's unilateral disengagement plan}}
In 2005 Israel unilaterally evacuated settlements, and military outposts from the Gaza Strip and the northern West Bank.

The Disengagement Plan was a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, adopted by the government and enacted in August 2005, to remove a permanent Israeli presence from the Gaza Strip and from four [[Israeli settlement]]s in the northern West Bank. The civilians were evacuated (many forcibly) and the residential buildings demolished after August 15, and the disengagement from the Gaza Strip was completed on 12 September 2005, when the last Israeli soldier left. The military disengagement from the northern West Bank was completed ten days later.

==Israel–Lebanon conflict of 2006==
{{main|2006 Lebanon War}}
The 2006 Lebanon War began on 12 July 2006, with an attack by Hezbollah on Israel. Three Israeli soldiers were killed, and two were kidnapped and taken prisoner into [[Lebanon]]. In a search and rescue operation to return the captured soldiers, a further five [[Israeli Defense Forces]] troops were killed. It marked the beginning of a new wave of clashes between Israel and Hezbollah which saw the Lebanese capital, the sole Lebanese international airport, and much of southern Lebanon attacked by the Israelis, while Lebanese militias, presumably Hezbollah, bombarded northern Israeli cities, striking as far south as the city of [[Haifa]]. The conflict killed more than a thousand people, most of whom were Lebanese civilians and Hezbollah fighters; and displaced 974,184 Lebanese&lt;ref name="hrc"&gt;Lebanon Higher Relief Council (2007).

From the election of Mahmud Ahmedinijad as Iranian President, the Islamic Republic of Iran has actively supported numerous Arab organizations opposing Israel and has also actively called for waging war against it. Iran was widely referred as attempting to create a Shi'a Islam dominated axis, including the Syrian Ba'athist government, dominated by Alawites, Lebanon with Hezbollah dominance and making a strategic alliance with Sunni Hamas in Gaza Strip, which lasted until 2012 (terminating due to Shi'a - Sunni discourse in the [[Syrian civil war]]). In January 2007, concerns increased among Israel's leaders that President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] of [[Iran]] might be planning some sort of nuclear arms buildup, which might be considered for use in opposition to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.threat19jan19,0,2874659.story?coll=bal-pe-asection For Israelis, a new worry: Iran's nuclear intentions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123054626/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.threat19jan19,0,2874659.story?coll=bal-pe-asection |date=2007-01-23 }}, John Murphy, Baltimore Sun, 1/19/07&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council voted to put sanctions on Iran for its pursuit of nuclear technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6205295.stm UN passes Iran nuclear sanctions], BBC, 12/23/06.&lt;/ref&gt; There was evidence that international sanctions were creating discontent among Iranians with Ahmadinejad's policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared-gen/ap/Middle_East/Iran_Ahmadinejads_Woes.html Iran's Discontent With Ahmadinejad Grows] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911042033/http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared-gen/ap/Middle_East/Iran_Ahmadinejads_Woes.html |date=2012-09-11 }}, Ali Akbar Dareini, Associated Press, 1/17/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Israeli officials asserted in January 2007 that there had been some constructive progress in unpublicized talks with Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6267117.stm Syrians and Israelis 'held talks'], BBC, 1/16/07; [https://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/20070118/wl_csm/otalking_1 Syrian, Israeli backdoor talks now emerging]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Christian Science Monitor, 1/18/07; [http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8559692 Why can't they just make peace?], Economist, 1/18/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fatah-Hamas conflict|Gaza-Israel conflict}}
{{further|History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict}}
In January 2006, elections were held for the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]. [[Hamas]] won these elections, and thus secured a majority of seats. Due to the nature of their [[Parliamentary system]], this meant they also controlled the executive posts of the [[Palestinian Authority]], including the [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority|Prime Minister's]] post, and the cabinet. [[Ismail Haniyeh]] became Prime Minister. [[Mahmoud Abbas]] of [[Fatah]] remained as [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|President]].

Hamas gained popular support because it appeared much more efficient and much less corrupt than [[Fatah]]. It built various institutions and social services. Hamas openly declared that it did not intend to accept any recognition of [[Israel]]. It stated it would not accept the [[Oslo Accords]], and would not accept or recognize any negotiations with Israel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Throughout previous years, it had openly stated that it encouraged and organized attacks against Israel. This created a major change in previous Israeli-Palestinian interactions, which had previously been going through various periods of negotiations.

Most Western nations and international organizations did not give the Hamas lead government official recognition and responded by cutting off funds and imposing other sanctions. Mahmoud Abbas, the [[President of the Palestinian Authority|Palestinian President]] and head of [[Fatah]], met with [[Khaled Meshal]], the exiled head of [[Hamas]], in [[Syria]], in an effort to resolve differences over the direction of the Palestinian Authority and negotiations with Israel and to try to form a unity government with Hamas. The two parties did not reach a resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070121/ap_on_re_mi_ea/syria_palestinians_16 Abbas, Hamas chief can't agree on gov't]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Associated Press, 1/21/07; [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070121/wl_mideast_afp/mideastpalestinian_070121221113 Abbas and Hamas rival hold talks, differences remain]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, AFP, 1/21/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meeting between [[Ehud Olmert]] and Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] in January 2007, the latter called on Israel to pursue peace more actively, but also stated that [[Egypt]] would seek to block the flow of illegal arms being smuggled into the [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/809303.html Mubarak: Israel must avoid steps that impede peace], Haaretz, 1/5/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, [[Hamas]] took control of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], violently routing the forces of [[Fatah]]. This effectively severed control of the Palestinian territories. Those in the [[West Bank]] were under [[Palestinian Authority|Fatah's control]], with those in Gaza under the [[Hamas government in Gaza|control of Hamas]]. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, dissolved the government. The fighting had numerous casualties, and gave rise to refugees, who fled to Egypt and other countries. During the conflict between Hamas and Fatah, Egypt granted safe haven to several Fatah officials who fled Gaza.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Egypt also stated it would help in policing the border, and impeding the flow of illegal arms.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Israel and Hamas were engaged in violent conflicts in [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008–09]], [[Operation Pillar of Defense|2012]] and [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|2014]].

The Russian language in Ukraine has primarily come to exist in that country through two channels: the migration of ethnic [[Russians]] into what later became Ukraine and through the adoption of the [[Russian language]] as a language of communication by Ukrainians.

==Russian migration==
The first waves of Russian settlers onto what became Ukrainian territory came in the late 16th century to the area known as [[Slobozhanschyna]] or Sloboda Ukraina, in what is now northeastern Ukraine. This territory was settled after being abandoned by the [[Golden Horde|Tatars]].&lt;ref name="kongr" /&gt; Russian settlers however were outnumbered by Ukrainian settlers who were escaping harsh exploitative conditions in the west.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\S\L\SlobidskaUkraine.htm Display Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

More [[Russian speakers]] appeared in the northern, central and eastern territories that are now Ukraine during the late 17th century, following the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Cossack Rebellion]] (1648–1657) which [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] led against Poland. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to a massive movement of Ukrainian settlers to the [[Sloboda Ukraine|Slobozhanschyna]] region, which converted it from a sparsely inhabited frontier area to one of the major populated regions of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Following the [[Pereyaslav Rada]] of 1654 the parts which were under the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] (a predecessor of modern [[Ukraine]] entered the Russian Tsardom. This brought significant, but still small, wave of Russian settlers into what is now central Ukraine (primarily several thousand soldiers stationed in garrisons,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; out of a population of approximately 1.2 million&lt;ref name="Subtelny2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Subtelny|first=Orest|authorlink=Orest Subtelny|title=Ukraine: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=PA149|accessdate=6 November 2017|year=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8390-6|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-Russians).

Beginning in the late 18th century, large numbers of Russians settled in newly acquired lands in what is now southern Ukraine, a region then known as [[Novorossiya]] ("New Russia").  These lands had been largely empty prior to the 18th century due to the threat of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatar]] raids, but once [[Russia]] had eliminated the Tatar state as a threat, [[Russian nobility|Russian nobles]] were granted large tracts of fertile land that was worked by newly arrived peasants, most of whom were ethnic Ukrainians but many of whom were Russians.

The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in the urban Russian population in [[Novorossiya]] and other parts which are now [[Ukraine]], as ethnic Russian settlers moved into and populated the newly industrialised and growing towns.  At the beginning of the 20th century, Russians were the largest ethnic group in almost all large cities within Ukraine's modern borders, including the following: [[Kiev]] (54.2%), [[Kharkiv]] (63.1%), [[Odessa]] (49.09%), [[Mykolaiv]] (66.33%), [[Mariupol]] (63.22%), [[Luhansk]], (68.16%), [[Kherson]] (47.21%), [[Melitopol]] (42.8%), [[Dnipropetrovsk]], (41.78%), [[Kropyvnytskyi]] (34.64%), [[Simferopol]] (45.64%), [[Yalta]] (66.17%), [[Kerch]] (57.8%), [[Sevastopol]] (63.46%).&lt;ref name="dnistr 342"&gt;Дністрянський М.С. Етнополітична географія України. Лівів Літопис, видавництво ЛНУ імені Івана Франка, 2006, page 342 {{ISBN|966-7007-60-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ukrainian migrants who settled in these cities entered a Russian-speaking milieu (particularly with Russian-speaking administration) and needed to adopt the Russian language.

==Adoption of Russian language==
With the gradual urbanization of Society in the late 19th century, Ukrainian migrants from rural areas who settled in the cities entered a Russian-speaking milieu. With all State educational instruction  and cultural establishments using Russian many Ukrainians were forced to use the Russian language.

The [[Russian Empire|Russian government]] promoted the spread of the Russian language among the native Ukrainian population by actively suppressing the Ukrainian language.  Alarmed by the threat of Ukrainian separatism implied by a growing number of school textbooks teaching the Ukrainian language, the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs [[Pyotr Valuev]] in 1863 issued a [[Valuev Circular|secret decree]] that banned the publication of religious texts and educational texts written in the Ukrainian language.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book| author=Miller, Alexei | title=''The Ukrainian Question. The Russian Empire and Nationalism in the Nineteenth Century| location= Budapest-New York | publisher= Central European University Press| year = 203 | ISBN =963-9241-60-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ban was expanded by Tsar Alexander II who issued the [[Ems Ukaz]] in 1876.  All Ukrainian language books and song lyrics were banned, as was the importation of such works.  Furthermore, Ukrainian-language public performances, plays, and lectures were forbidden.&lt;ref name=Magosci&gt;{{cite book| author=Magoscy, R. | title=A History of Ukraine| location= Toronto | publisher= University of Toronto Press | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881, the decree was amended to allow the publishing of lyrics and dictionaries, and the performances of some plays in the Ukrainian language with local officials' approval.  Ukrainian-only troupes were forbidden.

&lt;!--more needs to be added about the changing policies of Ukrainization followed by Russification in the Soviet period--&gt;
While officially, there was no state language in the Soviet Union, Russian was in practice in a privileged position. The Ukrainian language was often frowned upon or quietly discouraged, which led to the gradual decline in its usage.

In independent Ukraine, although Russian is not an official language of the country, it continues to hold a privileged position and is widely spoken, in particular in regions of Ukraine where Soviet Russification policies were the strongest, notably most of the urban areas of the east and south.

In 1994 a referendum took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast]] and the [[Luhansk Oblast]], with around 90% supporting the [[Russian language]] gaining status of an official language alongside [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and for the [[Russian language]] to be an official language on a regional level; however, the referendum was annulled by the [[Kiev]] government.&lt;ref&gt;http://thekievtimes.ua/society/372400-donbass-zabytyj-referendum-1994.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Holocaust Survivors &amp; Grown-Up Green Leaf Party''' ({{lang-he|ניצולי השואה עם בוגרי עלה ירוק}}) was a political party in [[Israel]], formed as an alliance of some members of [[Ale Yarok]] ("Green Leaf" in Hebrew) - a liberal political party best known for its ideology of [[legalization|legalizing]] [[cannabis]], and members of the "New Zionism" party, whose head was a [[Holocaust survivor]] and an activist for this cause.&lt;ref name="3_News_90279"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/News/InternationalNews/Holocaust-survivors-team-up-with-marijuana-activists-in-odd-coalition/tabid/417/articleID/90279/cat/61/Default.aspx |title=Holocaust survivors team up with marijuana activists in odd coalition |date=9 February 2009 |publisher=[[3 News]] |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004142300/http://www.3news.co.nz/News/InternationalNews/Holocaust-survivors-team-up-with-marijuana-activists-in-odd-coalition/tabid/417/articleID/90279/cat/61/Default.aspx |archivedate=4 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz.com 2009"&gt;{{cite web | title=The pro-marijuana Holocaust survivors party is the hottest match-up | website=haaretz.com | date=February 8, 2009 | url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.5072400 | access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party ran in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Knesset elections]].

The party's chairman and first person on the list was Ohad Shem-Tov, former chairman of the Green Leaf party. On the second spot was Yaakov Peri, a Holocaust survivor and activist, who had founded the "New Zionism - The People's Party" in 2006 (which didn't win any seats in the government in that year's general election). The alliance between the two came as a result of disagreements within the Green Leaf party, and discussions between Shem-Tov and Peri.

The unusual alliance between these parties, one focused on Holocaust issues and the other on the legalization of recreational drugs, sparked some public controversy in Israel - critics said that this pairing was inappropriate as it was disrespecting the cause of the Holocaust. 

The party's platform included: Improving government treatment of the rights of Holocaust survivors, better [[health care]] system, [[environmental protection]], reforms in [[mandatory education]], [[animal experimentation]]s and other [[social economic]]-related issues. 

It won 2,346 votes (0.07%), well below the 2% [[electoral threshold]].

'''Ioan Talpeș''' (born 24 August 1944) was a [[Romania]]n [[Romanian Army|Army]] general, military historian and politician. He served as head of the [[Serviciul de Informaţii Externe|Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SIE) from 1992 to 1997. In 1997-8, Talpeș served as Ambassador to [[Bulgaria]] and acted as an advisor to [[President of Romania|President]] [[Ion Iliescu]] from 1999 to 2000. He is currently an independent [[Senate of Romania|Senator]] representing [[Caraş-Severin County]], having resigned from the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) in May 2005 because of a scandal involving the party.

==Biography==

===Communist period===

Talpeș was born in [[Topleţ]] [[Commune in Romania|commune]], Caraș-Severin County. He graduated from the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of History in 1970, and received a [[PhD]] in History in 1980. The same year, he graduated from the [[Nicolae Bălcescu Land Forces Military Academy|Nicolae Bǎlcescu School of Active Officers]] in [[Sibiu]].

Talpeș served as a research military officer at the [[Bucharest]] Center for Study and Research in the Field of History and Military Theory (within the Defense Ministry) from 1970-1988.

===Post-1989 career===

Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] and the fall of the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], Talpeș relinquished his position at [[Editura Militară]], and served President Ion Iliescu as an advisor from July 1990 to April 1992. In March 1992, Talpeș was appointed head of SIE, a position he held until 1997. During this period, Talpeș was promoted to the rank of general.

Immediately following the [[Romanian presidential election, 1996|1996 elections]], Talpeș was immediately appointed ambassador to Bulgaria by the head of state, [[Emil Constantinescu]]. He served in that capacity until 20 December 1998, following his resignation in November.

In January 1999, Talpeș resumed his duties as a personal advisor to Ion Iliescu, who was at the time leader of the PSD. When Iliescu was again elected president of Romania in December 2000, he appointed Talpeș head of the National Security Department and chief of the Presidential Administration.

On 8 March 2004, [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Adrian Năstase]] appointed Talpeș State Minister for the Coordination of National Defense, [[Accession of Romania to the European Union|European Integration]], and Justice, one of three "super minister" positions created as part of the government reshuffle to prepare for entry in the [[European Union]].

Talpeș was elected to the [[Parliament of Romania]] in December 2004, where he continues to serve as a Senator representing his home county of Caraș-Severin.

Ioan Talpeș is particular mentioned in the report of the investigator of the [[Council of Europe]] to illegal activities of the U.S. secret service [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in Europe, [[Dick Marty]], as one of the persons, who authorized or at least knew about and have to stand accountable for [[Black site|torture prisons]] on the military base [[Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport|Mihail Kogălniceanu]] from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2007/EMarty_20070608_NoEmbargo.pdf |title=Secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states: second report |author=Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights |date=7 June 2007 |work=Parliamentary Assembly |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, Talpeș confirmed to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' that from 2003-2006, he had allowed the CIA use of a building in Bucharest. Talpeș stated he never visited the building and explicitly told his CIA counterpart that the Romanians did not want to know what was taking place inside.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 2015-04-22"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verseck |first=Keno |date=22 April 2015 |title=Folter in Rumänien: Ex-Staatschef Iliescu gibt Existenz von CIA-Gefängnis zu |trans-title=Torture in Romania: Former Head of State Iliescu Acknowledges Existence of CIA Prison |language=German |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/cia-foltergefaengnisse-in-rumaenien-ion-iliescu-gibt-existenz-zu-a-1028917.html |journal=[[Der Spiegel]] |location=Hamburg, Germany  |access-date=22 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Jakob Fugger''' or '''Hans Jakob Fugger''' (23 December 1516, [[Augsburg]] - 14 July 1575, [[Munich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ADB|8|179|185|Fugger|Christian Meyer, Carl von Landmann|ADB:Fugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a German banker and patron of the arts and sciences from the ''von der Lilie'' (''of the Lily'') line of the noted [[Fugger]] banking family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gw1.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=hwember1&amp;m=NG&amp;lang=de&amp;pz=max&amp;nz=von+bayern&amp;ocz=1&amp;n=Johann_1516+Fugger&amp;t=PN&amp;x=23&amp;y=9|title=Family of Johann Fugger|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Augsburg.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to Johann Jakob Fugger in Augsburg, put up by [[Louis I of Bavaria]].]]
He was the son of [[Raymund Fugger]] (1489–1535) and his wife Katharina  (1488–1535), daughter of [[János Thurzó]], owner of a mining company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/fugger/fugger1.html|title=Fugger family tree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Jakob inherited the business from his father's brother [[Anton Fugger]] in 1560 but did not prove so fortunate in his business dealings - the family had lent money to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], landing them in deep trouble when Spain went bankrupt. Johann Jakob had to sell off his whole collection (except his library) to improve matters and handed the business over to his cousin [[Markus Fugger|Marcus]] (1529–1597), who was able to consolidate it. In 1565 he entered [[Albert V, Duke of Bavaria|Albert V]]'s service and later became president of his privy chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|5|720|721|Fugger, Johann Jakob|Wolfgang Zorn|118703501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Titian]]'s advice, Johann Jakob brought Titian's pupil [[Antonio Ponzano]] to Augsburg to paint frescoes in the inner courtyard of the [[Fuggerhäuser]] - frescoes had already been painted on the building's inner courtyard and outer wall by Hans Burckmair the Younger (1500–1562) and [[Albrecht Altdorfer]]. [[Jacopo Strada]] also acted as Johann Jakob's art agent in Italy. He was in correspondence with cardinal [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|de Grandvelle]] - one of his letters to him was included in [[Paul Pelisson-Fontanier|Pelisson]]'s ''Traité de la Tolérance des religions'' (''Treatise on Tolerance of religions''). He also had a major library and tried to convince [[Hieronymus Wolf]] to become its librarian. In 1571 he sold it to Albert V, making it the nucleus of the [[Bayerische Staatsbibliothek]].

Johann Jakob is also thought to be the author of the two folio-volume ''Wahrhaftigen Beschreibung des österreichischen und habsburgischen Rahmens, Herkommens, Geschlechte, Fortpflanzung'' (''True Description of the Austrian and Habsburg Houses...''), written in German, with over 30,000 coats of arms, seals, portraits and other images. Copies of it survive in libraries in [[Vienna]] and [[Dresden]], Lambécius and Rollar published fragments from it and Sigismond de Birken published an extract under the title ''Spiegel der Ehren des höchstlöblichen Kayser- und Königlichen Ertzhauses Oesterreich'' (''Mirror of the Lords of the most high Imperial and Kingly House of Austria'').&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/drwFugger1668 Spiegel der Ehren des Erzhauses Österreich digital] der [[Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DDB|Person|118703501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-general]] '''Sir John Malcolm''' [[Order of Bath|GCB]], [[Order of the Lion and the Sun|KLS]] (2 May 1769 – 30 May 1833) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] soldier, [[diplomat]], [[East India Company]] administrator, [[politician|statesman]], and [[historian]].

==Early life==
Sir John Malcolm was born in 1769, one of seventeen children of George Malcolm, an impoverished tenant farmer in [[Eskdale, Dumfries and Galloway|Eskdale]] in the Scottish Border country, and his wife Margaret (‘Bonnie Peggy’), née [[Pasley]]. He left school, family and country at the age of thirteen, and achieved distinction in the [[East India Company]] over the next half century. A spirited character, he was nicknamed ‘Boy Malcolm’; for throughout his life he retained a youthful enthusiasm for field sports and fun and games. But behind this boisterous exterior lay serious intellectual ability and a considerable talent for government.

==Career==
Arriving at [[Madras]] in 1783 as an ensign in the [[East India Company]]’s Madras Army, he served as a regimental soldier for eleven years, before spending a year in Britain to restore his health. He returned to India in 1795 as Military Secretary to General Sir [[Alured Clarke]], participating en route in Clarke’s capture of the [[Cape of Good Hope]].
In the Anglo-Mysore war of 1799 he served with the [[Hyderabad]] contingent, and later as joint secretary of the Peace Commission setting up the new government of [[Mysore]]. Later that year he was selected by the Governor-General ([[Lord Mornington]], later Marquess Wellesley) to lead a diplomatic mission to Iran. Following his return in 1801 he became Wellesley’s private secretary, based in [[Kolkata|Calcutta (Kolkata)]].

In the Anglo-Maratha war of 1803-05 he accompanied [[Sir Arthur Wellesley]] (later Duke of Wellington) as the Governor-General’s representative and diplomatic agent; the two men forming a lifelong friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Rory Muir. Wellington, The Path to Victory, 1769-1814 (2014), C H Philips, The Young Wellington in India (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804 he was appointed British Resident at Mysore, but in 1805-6 saw further service in north India with General Lake.

In early 1808 the Governor-General, [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]], sent him on a second mission to [[Iran]], but at this time French influence was dominant in [[Tehran]], and he was rebuffed. Later that year a separate mission from London under Sir Harford Jones arrived in Iran and achieved success, the Iran government having by then become disenchanted with the French. Malcolm was again sent to Iran in 1810, but by that time the British government had decided to conduct diplomatic relations with [[Iran]] directly from London, and appointed [[Sir Gore Ouseley]] as ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;R M Savory. British and French Diplomacy in Iran, 1808-1810. British Institute of Iran Studies (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 Malcolm returned to Britain for five years’ furlough, and spent much of his time as a writer, completing his ''History of Iran'' (the first in English derived directly from Iran sources) in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;A K S Lambton. Sir John Malcolm and the History of Iran. British Institute of Iran Studies (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; For this he received an honorary DCL from the [[University of Oxford]]. Returning to India in 1817, he acted as the Governor-General’s agent in negotiations leading up to the third (and last) Anglo-Maratha war. He also acted as a general, leading Company troops to victory against Maharajah [[Holkar]] at the decisive battle of Mehidpoor (Mahidpur) in December 1817. In January 1818, Malcolm was placed by the [[Marquis of Hastings]] in the military and political charge of Central India (roughly, today’s [[Madhya Pradesh]]); during the four years he filled that station, his attention was directed to the object of collecting materials for the illustration of its past and present condition. The report hereof he sent to Calcutte, where it was printed by order of Government.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Central India, Preface&lt;/ref&gt; Disappointed to being superseded for the governorship of Bombay and Madras by his juniors, Malcolm left for Britain in 1822&lt;ref&gt;Parshotam Mehra: ''A Dictionary of Modern Indian History, 1707-1947''. Delhi. Bombay. Calcutta. Madras : OUP 1985, p.427-428&lt;/ref&gt;, where he lived with his family as a country gentleman, completing two more books.

In 1827 he was appointed Governor of [[Bombay]]. His governorship was generally successful, despite controversy over an unfortunate quarrel with the judges of the Bombay Supreme Court, who sought to extend their jurisdiction beyond Bombay to the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] hinterland, newly acquired by the Company from the Maratha [[Peshwa]] of [[Poona]]. In seeking to end both [[sati (practice)|sati]] (the [[self-immolation]] of widows on their husband's funeral pyres) and female infanticide by moral persuasion, Malcolm visited [[Gujarat]] in February 1830 and met Sahajanand Swami, the founder of the [[Swaminarayan]] sect of Hinduism, who was advocating similar reforms. He has ever since been remembered in Swaminarayan literature.&lt;ref&gt;R Brady Williams. An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism Cambridge (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his predecessor, Mountstuart Elphinstone, he was a pioneer in the promotion of Indian education and the training of Indians for the higher ranks of government. He also served as president of the [[Asiatic Society of Bombay|Literary Society of Bombay]]

In 1831 Malcolm finally returned to Britain, and immediately became a [[Member of Parliament]] for the rotten borough of [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]], supporting his friend the Duke of Wellington in opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]]. He bought [[Warfield Hall]] from the Parry family and busied himself renovating it. His last public act was a speech in April 1833 to the Proprietors (shareholders) of the East India Company, persuading them to accept the Government’s terms for renewal of its Charter. Immediately afterwards he suffered a stroke, and died on 30 May 1833. He was buried in [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]].

There are statues of Sir John Malcolm in  [[Westminster Abbey]]'s north transept and in the Town Hall in Bombay. There is also a 100 foot high obelisk celebrating Malcolm’s achievements on the top of Whita Hill, above [[Langholm]] in Scotland.

==Family==
In 1807 he married (in Mysore) Isabella Charlotte, the second daughter of General [[Sir Alexander Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir Alexander Campbell]]. She bore five children, including [[George Alexander Malcolm]].

==Legacy==

[[Image:Malcolm Monument - geograph.org.uk - 1383313.jpg|thumb|200px|Malcolm Monument]]
Together with his contemporaries [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] and [[Sir Thomas Munro]], Malcolm was an architect of three early principles of British rule, whose wisdom “was too soon forgotten and remembered too late”.
Four main themes can be identified. Firstly, India was to be ruled for the benefit of the Company – but also of Indians, i.e. no British settlers. 
Secondly, [[indirect rule]] was to be preferred, leaving existing Indian rulers in place wherever possible, with minimal disturbance of traditional methods of governance, religion and social structure.
Thirdly, Malcolm helped to develop the role of the [[Colonial_Service#Ranks|District Officer]], a small group of powerful administrators with minimal overt force to support them.
Fourthly, Malcolm promoted a ‘forward’ foreign policy; meaning diplomatic engagement with neighbouring states such as [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Central Asia]].

He was a mentor and inspiration to several celebrated Anglo-Indian statesmen – among them [[Henry Pottinger]], [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe|Charles Metcalfe]], [[Alexander Burnes]] and [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]]

==Literary works==
Malcolm wrote nine books, plus a volume of poetry, as follows:

'''John of Tynemouth''' (sometimes '''John of York'''&lt;ref name=Handlist333&gt;Sharpe ''Handlist of Latin Writers'' pp. 333–334&lt;/ref&gt;) was a medieval English chronicler who flourished in the mid-14th-century.

Little is known of his background. According to medieval accounts, he was claimed to have been the [[vicar]] of the parish of [[Tynemouth]] in [[Northumberland]]. From his writings, he was familiar with the area around [[Wheatley, Hampshire|Wheatley]], near [[Winchester]], which might mean that he could be identified with John Whetely, who is known to have been the vicar at Tynemouth during the 1350s and 1360s. Or possibly, the Wheatley was the one in [[Yorkshire]], which would explain the alternate name he is occasionally given in manuscripts, John York. John may have been a monk of [[St Albans Abbey]], for his work was early associated with that monastery, and the vicar at Tynemouth was appointed by the prior of the monastic priory at Tynemouth that was a dependent priory of St Albans.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Taylor "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27466 Tynemouth , John (fl. c.1350)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

John was the author of a chronicle, the ''[[Historia aurea]]'', which was a work composed about 1350. It was a history of the world from the creation to 1347. He used as sources a shortened version of the ''[[Polychronicon]]''. The ''Historia'' survives in full in manuscripts that were originally from [[Durham Cathedral]], [[Bury St Edmunds Abbey]], and St Albans. The St Albans copies, however, are only dated to the 15th-century, which undercuts the idea that John might have been a monk at that abbey. The ''Historia'' also survives in shortened versions.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Besides the ''Historia'', he also authored a ''Sanctilogium'', or ''Sanctilogium Angliae Walliae Scotiae et Hiberniae'',&lt;ref name=Handlist333/&gt; which gave the lives of 156 English saints. The ''Sanctilogium'' survives in a single manuscript, now in the [[British Library]], where it is [[Cotton Library]] [[MS Tiberius]] E.i.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He also wrote a ''Martyrologium'', which survives in some extracts that are appended to one of the manuscripts of the ''Historia aurea''.&lt;ref name=Handlist333/&gt;

'''King Tut''' is the name of different fictional characters in [[DC Comics]]. The first depiction of the character made his television debut in ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman: The Curse of Tut]]'' (April 13, 1966). He was created by Earl Barret, Robert C. Dennis and Charles R. Rondeau, and portrayed by [[Victor Buono]]. In his memoir ''Back to the Batcave'', [[Adam West]] describes him as the only villain created for the TV series to be a real success.

A second depiction of King Tut made his comic book debut in ''[[Batman Confidential]]'' No. 26, (April 2009), this version was created by [[Christina Weir]], [[Nunzio DeFilippis]] and [[José Luis García-López]].	 	

==Publication history==
The character of King Tut started out on the [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] television line episodes of the series' original run.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0120658/filmoseries#tt0059968&lt;/ref&gt;

King Tut recently made his debut in the [[DC Universe|DC Comics Universe]], appearing in the pages of ''[[Batman Confidential]]'' No. 26 (April 2009).

==Fictional character biography==
===Batman (TV series)===
King Tut began as Professor William Omaha McElroy (portrayed by [[Victor Buono]]), an Egyptologist at [[Yale University]]. After a blow to the head during a student riot, the Professor developed [[amnesia]] and thereafter believed he was a [[reincarnation]] of [[King Tut]]. He sought to take over [[Gotham City]] and defeat [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. He was defeated by another blow to the head, returning him to his normal state.

The pattern would follow for subsequent appearances—he would suffer a blow to the head, believe himself to be King Tut, fight Batman and Robin for control of Gotham City, only to suffer another blow to the head, which would return him to his [[real self]]. As such, he would be the only villain not to be jailed for his actions (the [[insanity defense]] would apply here). Completely cognizant of what happens during his states of [[amnesia]], Professor McElroy tried to prevent the personality switching by wearing a reinforced hat to prevent unwanted blows, but without success.

King Tut attempted to release a handful of ancient [[Scarabaeidae|scarab]] [[beetles]] on Gotham City in the second season of the series. With the beetles in his possession, Tut would have the ability to create a terrible ancient potion called ''abu raubu simbu tu'', which can be used to subdue the human will. Tut planned on concocting 95,000 gallons of the drug, more than enough to put all of Gotham under his power. His first victim was the head of the Gotham City Police, Chief O'Hara, who Tut commanded to perform acrobatics on the ledge of a building. King Tut nearly succeeded in his sinister plot, having tricked Batman into taking the drug as well. However, Batman protected himself from the drug's hypnotic power by coating his [[stomach]] with [[buttermilk]]. While trying to escape, Tut accidentally swallowed the drug himself and became Batman's [[slave]], which allowed Batman and Robin to safely take King Tut to [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]'s office where he reverted to his normal self.

In the episodes "King Tut's Coup" and "Batman's Waterloo," Professor McElroy is approached by two Yale students who ask him about his King Tut side. He tells them about it while he mentions that he had to wear a reinforced hat to prevent unwanted blows. The moment he shows off his hat, three flower pots hit the three of them on the head. While Professor McElroy became King Tut again, the two students develop the personalities of King Tut's Royal Jester and Lord Chancellor. Together with a female moll named Neila, they plotted to capture Lisa Carson. With help from Neila, Batman and Robin were able to get King Tut hit on the head again regressing him back to Professor McElroy.

In "The Unkindliest Tut of All," it was mentioned by Commissioner Gordon to Batman that Professor McElroy was hit on the head by a brick while at a love-in. King Tut sets himself up as a crime predictor and even claims that Bruce Wayne is Batman. While claiming that there will be a raid on Gotham State Penitentiary to free all of its arch-criminals, King Tut targets a scroll that will take him to the statue of a god. With help from Batgirl, Batman and Robin defeat King Tut and his henchmen. While at the Gotham City Police Department, King Tut still claims that Batman is Bruce Wayne when Commissioner Gordon gets a call from a beat cop that Louie the Lilac was sighted.

In his final appearance in the series titled "I'll Be a Mummy's Uncle," King Tut gets out of his therapy lesson and buys a plot of land adjacent to [[Wayne Manor]] as part of a plan to obtain a rare mineral. The villain tunneled beneath the manor and accidentally discovered the subterranean [[Batcave]]. He realized that Batman and Bruce Wayne were the same person. Batman and Robin then battled Tut and his henchmen in the Batcave. The Dynamic Duo administered a drug spray to the henchmen that would erase their recent memory. Tut, however, fled to the surface via the tunnel after all the spray ran out from the can. Once at the top of the tunnel, Tut was about to reveal his discovery of the Batcave—and Batman's true identity of Bruce Wayne—to [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], when Batman provoked Tut to raise his voice, thereby causing a rock to fall on his head, knocking him out. When Tut regained consciousness, he was once again Prof. McElroy, with no memories of Batman's secret identity. Seeing that he is late for his class, Professor McElroy runs off with Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara still asking who Batman is.

King Tut later popped up in "The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra" yet a body double (Guy Way) was portraying King Tut at the time. He alongside [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Riddler]], [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Egghead (DC Comics)|Egghead]] were freed from Gotham State Penitentiary by Dr. Cassandra Spellcraft and Cabala. When explaining her plans to rule Gotham City, she gives King Tut the job to rob the museums. The villains were defeated by Batman, Robin, and Batgirl.

Tut's hideouts sometimes included an "[[apothecary]]", the only one in Gotham, in the "Pyramid" building.

===Comics===
The comic book version of King Tut is shown to be Victor Goodman, a criminal [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who targets and murders wealthy citizens, and leaves Egyptian-themed riddles, similar to the [[Riddle of the Sphinx]]. Batman teams up with the [[Riddler]], who does not appreciate his [[modus operandi]] being stolen, and agrees to help to stop Goodman. They managed to defeat King Tut who is sent to prison until he is transferred to [[Arkham Asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;As seen in ''Batman Confidential'' #26–28, (April–June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

His alter-ego is an homage to actor Victor Buono.

==In other media==
===Television===
King Tut appears on ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. Due to copyright issues with FOX, King Tut is referred to in the synopsis as "Pharaoh". In "Day of the Dark Knight!", he is shown as a convict trying to escape [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]], but was foiled by Batman and [[Green Arrow]]. The other convicts that Tut escapes with are either common criminals, the show's supervillains, or other villains from the Adam West series (including [[Egghead (Batman)|Egghead]], The Bookworm, Archer, Louie The Lilac and Shame who are recognized both by face features and their trademark hats). Tut makes another jailbreak cameo at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] in "Night of the Huntress!". In "Battle of the Superheroes!", Batman and Robin wear special mummified suits in order to fight Pharaoh when he uses a special staff to turn people into zombies that obey his every command (The wrappings are coated in buttermilk, another reference to the live-action Batman series). With some pictures taken by [[Vicki Vale]], Batman and Robin managed to defeat Pharaoh and freed his victims.

===Film===

{{For|the Latin term ''legio''|Roman legion}}
[[File:Legion VI Megiddo 070715 02.jpg|thumb|Legio excavations]] 
'''Legio''' was a Roman military camp south of [[Tel Megiddo]] in the [[Roman province]] of [[Galilee]]. 
==History==
The approximate location of the camp of the [[Legio VI Ferrata]] was known from the persistence of its name in the form [[Lajjun]] by which  a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Arab]] village was known. It was close to the ancient town of Rimmon, perhaps the Hadad-rimmon of {{Bibleverse||Zechariah|12:11|ESV}}, which in the 3rd century was renamed [[Maximianopolis (Palestine)|Maximianopolis]] (City of Maximian)  by [[Diocletian]] in honour of his co-emperor [[Maximian]]. Both places were within a single episcopal see, generally called Maximianopolis, but in one list of such sees the name ''Legionum'' (genitive plural of the [[Latin]] word ''Legio'') is used, where the Greek original has "Maximianopolis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Legio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
In 2002–2003, an archaeological survey was conducted in the Legio region by [[Yotam Tepper]] as part of his master's thesis. The survey located the legionary camp on the northern slope of El-Manach hill, the village of Ceparcotani on the adjacent hill, and the city of Maximianopolis on the site of the contemporary Kibbutz [[Megiddo, Israel|Megiddo]].&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, Y. 2003. Survey of the Legio Area near Megiddo: Historical and Geographical Research. MA thesis, Tel Aviv University. Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Tepper and the Jezreel Valley Regional Project dug test trenches measuring approximately 295 feet by 16.5 feet that revealed clear evidence of the camp.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Adams, Jonathan David and Yotam Tepper, [http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/biblical-archaeology-sites/legio/ ''Legio: Excavations at the Camp of the Roman Sixth Ferrata Legion in Israel''], Bible History Daily, Biblical Archaeology Society, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; No military headquarters of this type for this particular period had yet been excavated in the entire Eastern Empire, and the 2013 excavations uncovered defensive earthworks, a circumvallation rampart, barracks areas and artefacts including roof tiles stamped with the name of the Sixth Legion, coins and fragments of scale armor.

In 2017, a monumental gate to the camp’s headquarters, a stone mark and a dedicatory inscription were discovered that may be a listing of camp commanders or celebrated heroes of the Sixth Legion. In the camp’s latrines, more than 200 Roman coins dating to the 2nd and 3rd centuries were found. Cremated human remains were discovered in a cooking pot. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archaeology.org/news/6232-171226-israel-roman-military-camp Evidence of Roman Army Camp Uncovered in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael ab Isselt''' (1530/40–1597), sometimes cited in the German form '''von Isselt''', was a Dutch Catholic exile in Cologne and a chronicler of the late 16th century. He is best known as the compiler (under the pseudonym "D. M. Jansonio") of the first ''[[Mercurius Gallobelgicus]]'', a semi-annual overview of important current events.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel De Wind, ''Bibliotheek der Nederlandsche geschiedschrijvers'' (Middelburg, Gebroeders Abrahams, 1835), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Isselt was born between 1530 and 1540 in [[Amersfoort]] in the [[Lordship of Utrecht]]. He studied at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] and became a priest. During the [[Dutch Revolt]] he went into exile in [[Cologne]], where he became an active writer, recording contemporary events from a Catholic perspective. He died in Hamburg on 17 October 1597.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Xaver von Wegele]], [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Isselt,_Michael_von "Isselt: Michael von"], ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'', vol. 14 (Leipzig, 1881), p. 641.&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the works of [[Louis of Granada]] for publication in Cologne, translating some from Spanish or Italian into Latin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3914">'''Ronald Wayne Langacker''' (born December 27, 1942) is an American [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[professor]] [[emeritus]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. He is best known as one of the founders of the [[cognitive linguistics]] movement and the creator of [[cognitive grammar]]. He has also made significant contributions to the comparative study of [[Uto-Aztecan languages]], publishing several articles on historical Uto-Aztecan linguistics, as well as editing collections of grammar sketches of under-described Uto-Aztecan languages.

Born in [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin]], Langacker received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] in 1966. From 1966 until 2003, he was professor of linguistics at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. From 1997 until 1999 he also served as president of the [[International Cognitive Linguistics Association]].

Langacker develops the central ideas of [[cognitive grammar]] in his seminal, two-volume ''Foundations of Cognitive Grammar'', which became a major departure point for the emerging field of cognitive linguistics. Cognitive grammar treats human languages as consisting solely of semantic units, phonological units, and symbolic units (conventional pairings of phonological and semantic units). Like  [[construction grammar]], and unlike many mainstream linguistic theories, cognitive grammar extends the notion of symbolic units to the grammar of languages. Langacker further assumes that linguistic structures are motivated by general cognitive processes. In formulating his theory, he makes extensive use of principles of [[gestalt psychology]] and draws analogies between linguistic structure and aspects of visual perception.

==Life==
Her father was Ernest Kaipoleimanu Kinney (1906–1987) and mother was Esther Kauikeaulani Ka{{okina}}ulili (1913–1979).
Her maternal grandparents were Solomon Kamaha Ka{{okina}}ulili and Kawena Ah Chong. Her paternal grandparents were William Kihapi{{okina}}ilani Kinney (1868–1953) and Mary Francesca Vierra (c. 1879–1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= John Keny, d. 1693, Milton, MA |work= DNA test results |author= Georgia Kinney Bopp |date= June 4, 2010 |url= http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gkbopp/KINNEY/Research/LINES2/73491.htm |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her paternal great-grandfather was William Kinney (1832–1915) who came to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] from [[Nova Scotia]].
She was named for the mineral [[rubellite]] which is more commonly called [[tourmaline]].
Her grandfather was also known as K. W. Kinney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH019f/6ded92fa.dir/Kinney,%20K%20W.jpg |title= Kinney, K.W. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid confusion with his half-brother [[William Ansel Kinney]] who became a prominent lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH016c/205230a5.dir/Kinney,%20William%20A.jpg  |title= Kinney, William Ansel office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another of her grandfather's half-brothers, [[Ray Kinney]] (1900–1979), became a popular Hawaiian musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Nick Hayes &amp; Sue Drake - root and branch |work= Rootsweb |url = http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=hayes-drake&amp;id=I17983 |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born on the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]].&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite news |title= A Talk with Rubellite "Ruby" Kawena Johnson |author= Mark Coleman |newspaper= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date= February 2, 2003 |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2003/02/02/editorial/coleman.html |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She married geophysicist Rockne H.

From 1967 to 1993 she was on the faculty of the [[University of Hawaii]], where she helped establish its Hawaiian studies program. She then became [[Professor Emeritus]] of Hawaiian Language and Literature and continued to publish. She researched the history of the [[Kumulipo]], a sacred chant of [[Hawaiian mythology]], and early newspapers in the [[Hawaiian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ka Nupepa Kuokoa |url= http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/nupepa_kuokoa/kuokoa_htm/Kuokoa_Essay.pdf |work= Digital Collection |publisher= University of Hawaii Library |accessdate= August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was named one of the [[Living Treasures of Hawai'i]] in 1983 by the [[Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai'i]].&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt;
She was selected as an advisory committee to the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]. She generally opposes the [[Akaka Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Panel tables Akaka Bill debate |newspaper= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date= November 17, 2007 |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/17/news/briefs.html |accessdate= August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Saint Jerome]] of the [[Croats]]''' is the national Catholic church of [[Croatia]] on Via Tomacelli in the [[Campus Martius]] of [[Rome]]. It is now a chapel of the [[Pontifical Croatian College of Saint Jerome]] in Rome and is only open to visitors by arrangement with the College.

[[File:San Girolamo degli Schiavoni.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Frontal section]]

==Name==

It is also known as "St. Jerome of the [[South Slavs|Illyrians]]" ({{lang-it|San Girolamo degli Illirici}}), and was formerly known as "St. Jerome of the Slavs" ({{lang-it|San Girolamo degli [[Schiavone|Schiavoni]]}}). It changed its name after [[Croatia]] gained independence from [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Yugoslavia]] in 1991.

==History==
It was first built in 1585-1587 for refugees from areas ruled by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], and dedicated to St Jerome, who was from [[Dalmatia]] (former Roman "[[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romaspqr.it/ROMA/Chiese_rinascimentali/interno_s_girolamo_degli_illirici.htm Interior of San Girolamo degli illirici]&lt;/ref&gt; The site had been given to them in 1453 (the year of the [[Fall of Constantinople]]) by [[Pope Nicholas V]], for the construction of a [[Hospice care|hospice]]. It once faced the port built on the [[Tiber River]], called the [[Porto di Ripetta]].

[[File:MARIANA_DE_MELO.JPG|thumb|Two people wearing shorts. (Argentina, 2011)]]

'''Shorts''' are a [[garment]] worn over the [[human pelvis|pelvic]] area, circling the [[waist]] and splitting to cover the upper part of the legs, sometimes extending down to the knees but not covering the entire length of the [[leg]]. They are called "shorts" because they are a shortened version of [[trousers]], which cover the entire leg, but not the foot. Shorts are typically worn in warm weather or in an environment where comfort and air flow are more important than the protection of the legs.
 
There are a variety of shorts, ranging from knee-length short trousers that can in some situations be worn as formal clothes to [[beachwear]] and athletic shorts. Some types of shorts are typically worn by women, such as [[culotte]]s, which are a divided [[skirt]] resembling a pair of loose-cut shorts.

==Terminological differences==
In British English the term "short trousers" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real{{clarify|date=November 2015}} trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of [[school uniform]] for boys up to their early teens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/short-trousers |title= Short trousers |publisher= Oxford Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog3c.shtml |title= Short trousers for boys |publisher= BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ppparchive.durham.gov.uk/photos/picviewer.asp?previous=1550&amp;submit.x=37&amp;submit.y=48 |title= People past and present |publisher= Durham County Council Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term "short pants" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called "dress shorts", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called "[[Stubbies (brand)|stubbies]]". "Shorts" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.

The term "boxer shorts" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's [[underwear]], and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as "boxers" in the USA. The word "pants" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to "[[underpants]]") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.

In much of Europe and the Americas during the 19th and early 20th centuries, shorts were worn as outerwear only by young boys until they reached a certain height or maturity. When boys got older, typically around puberty, they would receive their first pair of long trousers. This produced the perception that shorts were only for young boys.  Because of this, men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature. Women tended not to wear shorts in most cultures, due to social mores: they were expected to wear [[dress]]es, or [[skirt]]s and [[blouse]]s.

In the 1890s, knee pants (an early type of short pants) became the standard wear for American boys. Many urban school portraits from the 1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histclo.com/schun/country/us/is/chron/19/us-isc1890.html U.S. School Clothes: Individual Schools--The 1890s] at Boys' Historical Clothing School Uniform Pages.&lt;/ref&gt; North American boys normally wore knee pants with short stockings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histclo.com/Country/us/gar/pants/knee/us-pantk.html North America Boys Garments: Pants--Knee Pants] at Boys' Historical Clothing School Uniform Pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This began to change after the 1900s when North American boys began wearing [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]], while short pants became more popular in Europe. In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men and women. However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain activities.

Since about the time of [[The First World War]], when many soldiers served in tropical locations, adult men have worn shorts more often, especially in summer weather, but the perception of shorts as being only for young boys took several decades to change, and to some extent still exists in certain circles. By the late 20th century however it became common for men to wear shorts as casual wear in summer.

However, in many countries there are few formal settings where wearing shorts would be acceptable, as they are considered [[casual wear]]. Notable exceptions where men may wear short trousers to the office or at a formal gathering are South Africa, Bermuda, Australia and New Zealand. Since the 1990s, casual office dress has grown to include formal shorts in some U.K. and U.S. businesses, but by no means universally.

Adults are also commonly seen wearing shorts, however wearing shorts is less common among women in traditional eastern countries than in the West, although this varies widely by region - women more often wear shorts in large, cosmopolitan cities. In some countries adult women can be seen wearing loose-fitting shorts that end at or just below the knee, as these are seen as sufficiently modest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/04/07/397804245/when-wearing-shorts-was-taboo When wearing shorts was taboo in USA -by www.npr.org ]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Slavery}}
A '''thrall''' ([[Old Norse]]/[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''þræll'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''trell'', [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''træl'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''träl'')&lt;ref name="vikings"&gt;{{cite book|author=Junius P Rodriguez, Ph.D.|title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery. vol 1. A - K|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=PA674|year=1997|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[slave]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/thrall%27s?r=14 ''Thrall'' Random House Unabridged Dictionary, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Serfdom|serf]] in [[history of Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] lands during the [[Viking Age]]. The corresponding term in [[Old English]] was '''''þēow'''''. The status of slave (''þræll'', ''þēow '') contrasts with that of the [[Franklin (class)|freeman]] (''karl'', ''ceorl'') and the nobleman (''[[Earl|jarl]]'', ''[[earl|eorl]]''). The [[Middle Latin]] rendition of the term in [[early Germanic law]] is ''servus''. The social system of [[serfdom]] was continued in [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] [[feudalism]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|thrall}}
[[File:En-us-thrall.ogg|thumb|Pronunciation of the term in US English]]
Thrall is from the [[Old Norse]] ''[[:wikt:þræll#Old Norse|þræll]]'', meaning a person who is in bondage or serfdom. The Old Norse term was lent into late Old English, as ''þræl''. 
The term is from a [[Common Germanic]] ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/þragilaz|þragilaz]]'' ("runner", from a root *''þreh-'' "to run"). [[Old High German]] had a cognate, ''dregil'', meaning "servant, runner".
The English derivation ''thraldom'' is of High Medieval date. The verb "to enthrall" is of Early Modern origin (metaphorical use from the 1570s, literal use from 1610).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding native term in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] society was ''þeow'' (from Germanic *''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/þewaz|þewa-]]'', perhaps from a [[Proto-Indo-European|PIE]] root *''tek&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;-'', "to run") 
A related Old English term is ''esne'' "labourer, hireling"  (from Germanic *''asniz'', cognate with Gothic ''asneis'' "hireling", a derivation  from ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/asunz|*asunz]]'' "reward", from the same root as English ''[[:wikt:earn|earn]]'').

==Early Germanic law==
The ''thrall'' represents the lowest of the three-tiered social order of the [[Germanic peoples]], noblemen, freemen and slaves, in Old Norse ''[[Earl|jarl]]'', ''karl'' and ''þræll'' (c.f. ''[[Rígsþula]]''), in [[Old English]] corresponding to ''[[earl|eorl]]'', ''ceorl'' and '''''þēow''''', in Old Frisian ''etheling'', ''friling'', ''lēt'', etc.
The division is of importance in the [[Germanic law|Germanic law codes]], which make special provisions for slaves: Slaves are property, and may be bought and sold, but they also enjoy some amount of protection under the law.&lt;ref&gt;in [[Leges Alamannorum|Alemannic law]], slaves may not be sold outside of one's own province (37.1). A slave's owner is entitled to pass judgement on him, but only within the law (37.2). Slaves may not work (and may not be  forced to work) on a Sunday (38)&lt;/ref&gt;
While the death of a freeman was compensated by means of a [[weregild]], usually calculated at 200 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] ([[shilling]]s) for a freeman, the death of a slave was treated as loss of property to his owner and compensated depending on the value of the worker.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, in [[Alemanni]]c law, the death of an (unfree) blacksmith was to be compensated by 40 shillings, the death of a goldsmith by 
50 shillings. If either a blacksmith or a goldsmith was maimed (losing their ability to do skilled work), the compensation was 15 shillings (''Leges Alamannorum'' 41).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
Thralls were the lowest class of workers in Scandinavian society. They were Northern and Eastern Europeans who were enslaved due to being prisoners of war, incurring debt, or being born into the class via their parents. Thralls in Scandinavia had no rights and their living conditions were variable depending on the master. The thrall trade as the prize of plunder was a key part of the Viking economy. While there are some estimates of as many as thirty slaves per household, most families only owned one or two slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = P.H. Sawyer| title = Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe AD 700–1100| year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-203-40782-0| page = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1043, [[Hallvard Vebjørnsson]], the son of a local nobleman in the district of greater [[Lier, Norway|Lier]], was killed while trying to defend a thrall woman from men who accused her of theft. The Church strongly approved of his action, recognizing him as a [[martyr]] and [[Canonization|canonizing]] him as Saint Hallvard, the [[patron saint]] of [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=658 ''St.&amp;nbsp;Hallvard'' in Catholic Online. (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the existence of a caste system, thralls could experience a level of social fluidity. Thralls could be freed by their masters at any time, be freed in a will, or even buy their own freedom. Once a thrall was freed, he became a "freedman"—a member of an intermediary group between slaves and freemen. He still owed allegiance to his former master and would have to vote according to his former master's wishes. It took at least two generations for freedmen to lose the allegiance to their former masters and become full freemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = P.H. Sawyer| title = Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe AD 700–1100| year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-203-40782-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a freedman had no descendants, his former master inherited his land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Eyrbyggja Saga, Chapter 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

While thralls and freedmen did not have much economic or political power in Scandinavia, they were still given a ''[[wergeld]]'', or a man's price, which is to say, there was a monetary penalty for unlawfully killing a slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = P.H. Sawyer| title = Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe AD 700–1100| year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-203-40782-0| page = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The era of Viking raids resulting in the capture of slaves slowly ended in the 11th century. In the following centuries, more and more thralls obtained their freedom, either by purchasing it or on the initiative of their masters, the church or the secular authority.&lt;ref name="vikings" /&gt; The thrall system was finally abolished in Scandinavia in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Skyum-Nielsen, "Nordic Slavery in an International Context," ''Medieval Scandinavia'' 11 (1978–79) 126-48&lt;/ref&gt;

*Early 11th century: According to Serer tradition [[Lamane Jegan Joof]] founded [[Tukar]] (part of present-day [[Senegal]]).
*1030 : [[War Jabi]] usurped the throne of [[Tekrur]] following a revolution and made himself King of Tekrur.
*1035 : Around this time, [[War Jabi]] the revolutionist converted to Islam and introduced [[Forced conversion#Islam|forced conversion]] of his subjects as well as [[Sharia law]] with the guidance of his [[Almoravid]] allies, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] in particular.  Much of his [[religious persecution]] was directed at the [[Serer people]] who refused to submit to [[Islam]] as well as the Serer [[Lamane|Lamanic class]], the guardians of [[Serer religion]] and holders of economic and political power (see [[Religious persecution#Persecution of the Serers|Persecution of the Serers]]). From this point to 1042, the Serers of Tekrur became the subject of persecution and jihads by the African converts to Islam such as the [[Fula people|Fula]] and [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]] with their Almoravid allies.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Willie F., "Encyclopedia of African history and culture: African kingdoms (500 to 1500)", p209. Vol.2, Facts on File (2001), {{ISBN|0-8160-4472-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serers defeated the Muslim coalition army forcing them to seek refuge in Mauritania, but were later finally subdued and defeated by the powerful Muslim coalition army.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
This era marks the exodus of the Serers of Tekrur. Those who survived the wars and refused to convert migrated southwards to what later became known as the Serer Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Kingdom of Saloum|Saloum]] and previously [[Kingdom of Baol|Baol]], rather than convert to Islam. In the south, they were granted asylum by their distant Serer relatives, endorsed by [[Lamane|the Great Council of Lamanes]], the highest [[court of law|court]] in Serer country. Trimingham notes that, Tekrur was the first in the region to adopt Islam but lost completely its Serer identity.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham, John Spencer, "A history of Islam in West Africa", pp 174, 176 &amp; 234, Oxford University Press, USA (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; War Jabi died in 1040 and was succeeded by his son Leb (or Labi), also a major ally of the Almoravids.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Willie F., "Encyclopedia of African history and culture: African kingdoms (500 to 1500)", p 676,  Vol.2, Facts on File (2001), {{ISBN|0-8160-4472-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leb is reported to have been fighting for the Almoravids in 1056&lt;ref&gt;[[Djibril Tamsir Niane|Niane, Djibril Tamsir]], "General History of Africa: Africa from the twelfth to the sixteenth century", pp 119–120, UNESCO, 1984, {{ISBN|9231017101}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TpjwF--kPL4C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Labi+Almoravids&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YbR-T73zHI_Z8QPsu4X7BQ&amp;ved=0CFwQuwUwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; probably as a result of the subjugation of Tekrur by the Almoravids in 1042 and a well enforced Sharia law.&lt;ref&gt;Abdur Rahman I.

{{main|Guelowar|Kingdom of Sine}}

*1350–1400 : The [[Kingdom of Sine]] renamed. The Guelowar period starts from 1350. [[Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh]] elected first Guelowar king to ever rule in one of the Serer countries (Kingdom of Sine). Nominated and elected by the Serers of Sine and the Great Council of Lamanes whose Council he served as legal adviser for 15 years and gave his sisters and nieces to in marriage.  Maysa Wali ruled in 1350–1370. The marriages between the descendants of the ancient Serer Lamanic class and the Guelowar women created the Serer paternal dynasties and the Guelowar maternal dynasty which lasted for over 600 years. Some members of the Serer nobility were opposed to the nomination and election of Maysa Wali, in particular [[Lamane Pangha Yaya Sarr]] (many variations: Penga Yaye Sarr, etc.), because Maysa Wali did not have a Serer father nor a Serer mother in spite of his assimilation into Serer culture, long service to the Great Council and coming from royalty himself. None of [[Maad a Sinig]] Maysa Wali's descendants ruled in any of the Serer kingdoms after him. The children and descendants of the Serer men and Guelowar women became Serers with loyalty to [[Serer religion]], the [[Serer people]], the Serer countries, culture and language, and all ties with Kaabu were severed. In this period, the old Serer paternal dynasties survived but the old [[Wagadou]] maternal dynasty collapsed in Sine and later Saloum, except in Baol and other places.

*1455 : the  [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] slave trader and chronicler [[Alvise Cadamosto]] having bought [[Wolof people|Wolof]] slaves in  [[Cayor]], decided to stop his ship at the Serer community living on the border of Wolof Cayor. Alvise wrote how these Serer community looked menacing and unwelcoming. He then went on to say that, after seeing their ship approaching, this Serer community stood guard at the beach. The captain of the ship gave the order for no one to come off the ship and the ship was parked further away from the beach. Alvise Cadamosto sent his Wolof interpreter to go and negotiate slave terms with this Serer community whilst he (Alvise) and his Portuguese party remained in the ship. The Wolof interpreter was killed on the spot by these Serers for bringing slave traders into their territory. None of Alvise's party came off, instead, the ship departed and headed towards the [[Gambia]]. Alvise also corrupted the Kingdom of Sine by calling it the Kingdom of ''Barbaçim'' and the Serer people of Sine as ''Barbacins'' among other names which many Europeans of this era referred to the Serer people as in their old maps (See : [[Kingdom of Sine]]).&lt;ref&gt;It was a corruption by Alvise, see : Boulègue, Jean, "Le Grand Jolof, (XVIIIe&amp;nbsp;– XVIe Siècle)", (Paris, Edition Façades), Karthala (1987), p 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alvise Cadamosto, the 15th century explorer in modern day Senegambia had never set foot in Serer country. His ship proceeded to the Gambia after one of his Wolof interpreters sent to negotiate slave terms with the local Serer community living in the Cayor border was killed on the spot by this Serer community. Neither Alvise nor any of his party left the ship. The ship proceeded to the Gambia. Since Alvise had never entered Serer country, most of his opinions about the Serers were coming from his Wolof interpreters. The Wolofs of Cayor were in constant war with Serer community living on their border and were fearful of these Serers as narrated by Alvise himself. In Kerr, Alvise refer to the Serers as without kings. However, these Serers were those living on the Wolof Cayor border and refused to submit to the kings of Cayor. Alvise did not know that the Kingdom of Sine was actually a Serer kingdom, where the Barbacini&amp;nbsp;– (a corruption of the Wolof "Bur Ba Sine" which means "king of Sine") took residence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6650">'''Victor Vitensis''' (or Victor of Vita; born circa 430) was an African bishop of the Province of [[Byzacena]] (called Vitensis from his See of [[Diocese of Vita|Vita]]). His importance rests on his ''Historia persecutionis Africanae Provinciae, temporibus Genserici et Hunirici regum Wandalorum'' (''A History of the African Province Persecution, in the Times of Genseric and Huneric, the Kings of the Vandals'').

Divided into three books, the work is a predominantly contemporary narrative of the cruelties practiced against the orthodox Nicene Christians of Northern Africa by the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Vandals]]. The first book provides an account of the reign of [[Genseric]], from the Vandal invasion of Africa in 429 until the king's death in 477; whilst, the second and third record events of [[Huneric]]'s reign (477-484) - of which Victor was an eyewitness. Andy Merrills and Richard Miles have argued that with the work Victor 'created a coherent narrative of a Vandal persecution where previously there had been none'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/426065943|title=The Vandals|last=1975-|first=Merrills, A. H. (Andrew H.),|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Miles, Richard, 1969-|year=|isbn=9781405160681|location=Chichester, U.K.|pages=185|oclc=426065943}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Little is known of the author or his circumstances and so historians have put forward deductions based on the internal evidence of his work. It has been argued by John Moorhead that Victor wrote the ''Historia persecutionis'' whilst he was a priest in Carthage and that he 'had access to the archives of the see of Carthage'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Vandal Persecution|last=Victor of Vita|first=|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=1992|isbn=0 85323 127 3|location=Liverpool|pages=xv|translator-last=John Moorhead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'text originated in the Church of Carthage' and was published circa 488; however, scholars contend that Victor wrote much of his work in 484 but subsequently added perspectives from after Huneric's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Vandal Persecution|last=Victor of Vita|first=|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=1992|isbn=0 85323 127 3|location=Liverpool|pages=xvii|translator-last=John Moorhead}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vandals, Romans and Berbers: New Perspectives on Late Antique North Africa|last=Danuta Shanzer|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|year=2004|isbn=0754641457|editor-last=A.H. Merrills|location=Aldershot|pages=272-273|chapter=Intentions and Audiences: History, Hagiography, Martyrdom, and Confession in Victor of Vita's Historia Persecutionis}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Danuta Shanzer has argued that the use of medical terminology in Victor's descriptions of torture indicate that he may have had a medical background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vandals, Romans and Berbers: New Perspectives on Late Antique North Africa.|last=Danuta Shanzer|first=|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|year=2004|isbn=0754641457|editor-last=A.H. Merrills|location=Aldershot|pages=278|chapter='Intentions and Audiences: History, Hagiography, Martyrdom, and Confession in Victor of Vita's Historia Persecutionis'}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is contested in academic discourse whether or not Victor was actually the bishop of Vita or simply born there.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Victor throws much light on social and religious conditions in [[Carthage]] and on the [[African Rite|African liturgy]] of [[Late Roman Empire|the period]], portraying 'the Vandals as being implacably and violently opposed to the true Catholic Faith'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His history contains many documents not otherwise accessible, e.g. the Confession of Faith drawn up for the orthodox bishops by [[Eugenius of Carthage]] and presented to [[Huneric]] at the [[Council of Carthage (484)|conference in 484]] of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Arian]] bishops. Two documents: a ''Passio beatissimorum martyrum qui apud Carthaginem passi sunt sub impio rege Hunerico (die VI. Non. Julias 484)'' and a ''[[Notitia Provinciarum et Civitatum Africae]]'' (List of the Provinces and Cities of Africa), formerly appended to all the manuscripts and now incorporated in the printed editions, are probably not Victor's. The former may be the work of one of his contemporaries.  The latter is a list of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[bishop]]s who were summoned to the 484 conference and their [[Episcopal see]]s in the [[Roman province|Latin province]]s of North Africa, arranged according to provinces in this order: [[Africa Proconsularis]], [[Numidia]], [[Byzacena]], [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], [[Mauretania Sitifensis]], [[Tripolitana]], [[Sardinia]].

This is a [[chronology]] of the artist [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is based as far as possible on Van Gogh's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/ Van Gogh's Letters, Unabridged and Annotated]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has only been possible to construct the chronology by drawing on additional sources. Most of his letters are not dated, and it was only in 1973 that a sufficient dating was established by [[Jan Hulsker]], subsequently revised by Ronald Pickvance and marginally corrected by others. Many other relevant dates in the chronology derive from the biographies of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], his uncle and godfather Cent, his friends [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], and others.

Facts and dates which are undisputed (see Resources), remain unreferenced.

'''Zaharije Orfelin''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Захаријa Орфелин}}; 1726 – 19 January 1785) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[polymath]] who lived and worked in the [[Austrian Monarchy]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. Described as a [[Renaissance man]], he was an educator, [[theologist]], [[Academic administration|administrator]], poet, [[engraver]], [[lexicographer]], [[herbalist]], historian, translator, editor, publisher, [[polemic]]ist, [[polyglot]], a prominent [[oenologist]], and [[travel]]er.

==Life==
In 1757 Orfelin became the secretary to [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|Metropolitan]] [[Pavle Nenadović]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]], the Serbian political and spiritual centre at the time. Metropolitan Pavle wanted to establish Karlovci as an independent educational centre and evade Imperial Austrian control over censorship. In collaboration with Zaharije Orfelin, he founded the "Copper Publishing House", where the first modern Orthodox literary works and a considerable number of prints were made. Soon Orfelin began publishing poems, translating books, and creating [[etchings]] and [[engravings]], inspired by the work of his contemporaries. To fulfill his ambition to print more books, he moved to Venice where he founded and edited the first Serbian review, ''Slaveno-Serbski Magazin'' (1768). Poem ''Plač Serbii [The Lament of Serbia]'' and biography of [[Peter I of Russia]] ''Istorija o žitija i slavnih djelah velikago gosudarja i imperatora Petra Pervago'' are considered his most notable works.  His ''Slaveno-Serbski Magazin'' paved the way to the [[Slavonic-Serbian|Slavonic-Serbian language]]. He was the first to publish in the 18th century texts pertaining to Serbian social and cultural history when other European nations had yet to entertain the subjects. During this period Orfelin first began to write ''The Big Serbian Herbalium'', in which he detailed the sanative effects of 500 species of herbs. And, in the ''Experienced Winemaker'' he listed several hundreds of recipes for preparation of herbal wines and other potions. Orfelin was fluent in Russian, [[Latin]], German, and French.

[[File:Knez Lazar (Orfelinov bakrorez).jpg|thumb|220px|left|''[[Saint Lazar]], Serbian Great Prince'', a [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copperplate]] by Orfelin (1773).]]
''The Lament of Serbia'' is regarded as the most notable among his poetic works of that period. He first published it anonymously in Venice in 1761. In this ode he fiercely pilloried the establishment of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while also emphasizing the difficult position and unjust treatment of the Serbs under the Imperial protection. Even though the poem bore no signature, the authorship was soon discovered. It is believed that this was a reason for his hurried exit from Karlovci the following year.

After leaving Metropolitan Pavle, Orfelin moved to [[Timisoara]], the capital of the [[Eparchy of Banat]], where he secured employment as the [[Chancellor#Ecclesiastical|chancellor]] of the Serbian Bishop of [[Banat]], Vikentije Jovanović Vidak. In the years he spent in Timisoara he produced ''The Apostolic Milk'', a catechism dedicated to his infant son in 1763.

In 1764, Orfelin came to Dimitrios Theodosios's publishing house in [[Venice]], where he spent the next six years before moving back to Karlovci. Theodosios, who began to print Serbian books in Venice in 1758, needed Orfelin to edit and proofread the abundant material being brought to him. Theodosios remained the only outlet for Serbian literature and printed books in Russo-Slavonic until the emergence of Kurtbek's publishing house in Vienna in 1770. Orfelin's editorial work gave a special impetus to the success of this Slavic publishing house. In a span of a few years many important books – "Catechisis" by [[Peter Mohyla]] and another "Catechisis" by [[Jovan Rajić]], "Srbljak" (a compedium of old Serbian writings) and "Short Stories" by [[Feofan Prokopovich]] – were published there. Many of the books published were either translated or edited by Orfelin himself. He also published his own, original works, including "A Melody for the Spring" and "A Historical Poem" in 1765, "Latin Alphabet" in 1767, and "Latin Grammar" and "Slavic Alphabet" in 1768. A large number of the books printed in Theodosios's shop in Venice were purposefully mislabelled as printed in either Moscow or Sankt Petersburg publishing houses. The reasoning behind it was that Serbs under the Austrian rule had more faith in books published in Russia than in the West. While still in Venice, Orfelin also printed one of the most important copper engravings, ''St. George with the Image of the Monastery of Sendjuradj'' (1767), and the first one that he signed as a member of the Imperial Engraving Academy founded by Austrian Jacob Schmutzer.

==Legacy==
[[File:Orfelin The first Serbian Magazine 1764.jpg|thumb|220px|right| The first Serbian magazine by Zaharije Orfelin, published in 1764.]]
Orfelin was one of the most notable representatives of the Serbian Baroque literature (although he worked in the first half of the 18th century, as Baroque trends in Serbian literature emerged in the late 17th century); yet his writings bear certain ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Through the whole of the 18th century, Serbian literature was mostly under the sway of Russia, or rather of the Russian Orthodox Church. As the Russo-Slavonic language was not readily understood by the Serbian reading public, its form used by the Serbs came under the influence of their living dialect and began soon to approach nearer to Serbian than to Russian. This artificial literary jargon was called Slaveno-Serbski, Slavo-Serbian. (In the 19th century it was eventually superseded by the modern Serbian language owing to the efforts and reforms of Vuk Karadžić). Of the Serbian authors who followed the Russian models it is worth to mention Zaharije Orfelin, [[Gligorije Trlajić]] (1766–1811), and [[Pavle Solarić]] (1781–1821).

In Serbian eighteenth-century literature Orfelin's authorship of ''"The Life of [[Peter the Great]]"'' was recorded for the first time in 1786, by [[Jovan Muškatirović]]. The illustrations of Peter's Life had been announced by Orfelin in 1772, but he began to produce them in 1774, and the whole enterprise was not completed until 1779, when the authorship of the book had been indubitably established. All this, however, was forgotten and [[Dimitrije Ruvarac]] discovered again in 1887, on the basis of the signed illustrated copies of the ''"Life of Peter the Great"'', that Orfelin was the author of the Russian emperor's biography. This nineteenth-century discovery was accepted by both Serbs and Russians.

In 1776 Orfelin's name appears in a lexicon of Austrian artists, ''Des Gelehte Osterisch'' by de Luca, where he is listed as both an engraver and a writer, elected as an academician in the newly established Academy of Engraving in Vienna. He is the main character of a novel "Drugo Telo" by [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]].
