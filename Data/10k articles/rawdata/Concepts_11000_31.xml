{{legal status}}
'''Administrative detention''' is [[arrest]] and detention of individuals by the [[State (polity)|state]] without [[trial]], usually for [[National security|security]] reasons. A large number of countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/migration/taskforce/docs/administrativedetentionrev5.pdf ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION OF MIGRANTS, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Democracy|democratic]] and undemocratic, resort to administrative detention as a means to combat [[terrorism]], to control [[illegal immigration]], or to protect the ruling regime.{{fact?|date=November 2016}}

Unlike [[Crime|criminal]] [[incarceration]] (imprisonment) imposed upon [[conviction]] following a trial, administrative detention is a forward-looking mechanism. While criminal proceedings have a retrospective focus – they seek to determine whether a defendant committed an offense in the past – the reasoning behind administrative detention often is based upon contentions that the suspect is likely to pose a threat in the future. It is meant to be preventive in nature rather than punitive (see [[preventive detention]]). The practice has been criticized by [[human rights]] organizations as a breach of [[civil and political rights]].

==Counter-terrorism==
Administrative detentions are defined in the law of many of the world's states.  In democratic countries using administrative detention as a [[counter-terrorism]] measure, the rationale given by its proponents is that legal existing systems are ill suited to handle the specific challenges presented by terrorism. Proponents of administrative detention maintain that criminal law's reliance on defendant rights and strict rules of evidence cannot be used effectively to remove the threat of dangerous terrorists. Some of the reasons often used to support this claim are that the information used to identify terrorists and their plots may include extremely sensitive intelligence sources and methods, the disclosure of which during trial would undermine future counter-terrorism operations. It is also claimed that the conditions under which some suspected terrorists are captured, especially in combat zones, make it impossible to prove criminal cases using normal evidentiary rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf Administrative Detention: The Integration of Strategy and Legal Process,  Matthew C. Waxman, p. 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616123121/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents also maintain that criminal prosecution is designed primarily to punish past behavior, thus it is deliberately skewed in favor of defendant, in order to assure that few, if any, innocents are punished. Counter-terrorism, on the other hand, aims to prevent future action, and thus requires a system that is weighed more heavily toward reducing the possibility of future harm, by ensuring that no guilty party will go free.

The [[Laws of War]] are also seen by the proponents as inadequate. These laws allow the capture of enemy fighters, and also allow holding them for the duration of hostilities without [[trial]]. However, these laws grew out of the need to regulate combat between professional armies accountable to a sovereign state, who were engaged in combat of possibly lengthy, but finite duration. Attempting to apply these laws to terrorists who are intermingled with a civilian population and accountable to no-one opens the possibility of [[indefinite detention without trial]], combined with a substantial likelihood of error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf Administrative Detention: The Integration of Strategy and Legal Process,  Matthew C. Waxman, p. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616123121/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of administrative detention challenge the above assumptions. While acknowledging the need to protect the sources and methods used to obtain sensitive intelligence, they maintain that existing laws, such as the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]  (FISA) and the [[Classified Information Procedures Act]] (CIPA), successfully balance the need to protect sensitive information, including the sources and means of intelligence gathering, with defendants' fair trial rights. They point to the historical record of prosecutors who were able to obtain convictions against terrorists on the basis of existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/usls/2008/alert/115 Post 9-11 Terrorism Cases Show Federal Courts Bring Terrorists to Justice Without Administrative Detention, Military Commissions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617221231/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/usls/2008/alert/115 |date=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents maintain that in essence, administrative detention is a form of [[collective punishment]]. Since it does not require proof of individual guilt, it attributes to all members of a group the actions of a few.

==Immigration control==
{{Main article|Immigration detention}}
Many countries utilize administrative detention to hold illegal immigrants – those arriving at a country's borders without proper authorization – as an interim step to either [[deportation]] or the obtainment of proper legal status. Immigration detention is controversial because it presents a clash between traditional notions of individual liberty and the territorial [[sovereignty]] of states. Comparative studies on administrative detention practices of different countries found that those experiencing large-scale influxes of illegal migrants by sea (such as the United States and Australia) typically have the most draconian systems. Proponents of administrative detention for illegal immigrants claim that detention is required since these immigrants have not committed any crime for which they could be prosecuted under existing laws, and that allowing them to await their potential deportation while not in custody runs a risk of their absconding. Opponents maintain that alternatives to detention exist, and that such alternatives are preferable because they do not violate personal liberty, as well as being less of a financial burden to the state. Among the alternatives suggested are supervised release to a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO),  the release into the custody of a private citizen who will guarantee the immigrant's participation in immigration hearings, and "open detention" centers with mandatory reporting requirements.&lt;ref name="ecre"&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3c0273224.html Research Paper on Alternatives to Detention], European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), London, September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection of the ruling regime==
In many non-democratic countries, administrative detention is used by the ruling regime to suppress dissent and sanction opponents of the government. In [[Asia]] in particular, administrative detention was first introduced by the British and French colonial authorities prior to and during [[World War II]]. Created as a mechanism to control political dissent, it has ironically survived and made its way into the law books of the now-independent former colonies, who legitimized its use against their own political opponents in their constitutions.&lt;ref name="omar"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULRev/2003/9.html BOOK REVIEW: RIGHTS, EMERGENCIES AND JUDICIAL REVIEW, Imtiaz Omar, Kluwer Law International Hague, Netherlands 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, they were and codified as "emergency measures" or "internal security" acts. [[Bangladesh]], India, [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Pakistan]], [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]] are notable examples of such former colonies who hold political prisoners under administrative detention which has its legal roots in British [[Colonialism|colonial]] practices.&lt;ref name="omar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7616147.stm Malaysia resignation amid arrests]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vietnam]] is an example where administrative detention was widely used by the French colonial authorities in the 1930s,  to arrest those suspected of [[Communist]] activities. Post-independence, the now-ruling Communist authorities have employed very similar means to detain those suspected of ``counter-revolutionary" offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/vietnm/Vietn97d-03.htm Human Rights wtah - RURAL UNREST IN VIETNAM]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of these political prisoners, such as [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] in Myanmar, have become known worldwide due to the detention, and their cause is championed by human rights organizations.

==Instances of administrative detention==

===Armenia===
[[Armenia]] has been criticized by [[Human Rights Watch]] for not fully reforming the legal framework it inherited from the former [[Soviet Union]], and failing to bring its administrative detention system into accord with prevailing international norms. During the 2003 Presidential elections,  Armenian police arbitrarily applied the Code of Administrative Offenses, under which administrative detention is authorized, to lock up dozens of opposition activists and supporters for periods of up to fifteen days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/armenia/armenia052303bck0.htm#P61_1497 The Use of Administrative Detention in the 2003 Armenian Presidential Election]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main article|Mandatory detention in Australia}}
Like many other countries experiencing large scale illegal immigration, such as Canada and the United States, Australia has a system of mandatory administrative detention for illegal immigrants, or asylum seekers who arrive at its shores without proper visas.&lt;ref&gt;The Administrative Detention of Non-Nationals Pursuant to Immigration Control: International and Constitutional Law Perspectives, Daniel Wilsher, International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 53, No. 4, pp. 897-934, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The legal basis for this system is found in Australia's [[Migration Act 1958]] (Cth), which authorized the indefinite detention of an unlawful non-citizen who can not be deported immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Migration and Refugee Law in Australia, Mirko Bagaric, Kim Boyd, John Vrachnas, Penny Dimopoulos, Sue Tongue, p. 471, Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch criticized this Australian policy, claiming it seriously contravenes Australia's obligations to non-citizens, refugees and asylum seekers under international human rights and refugee law. Additionally, opposition to the system on humanitarian grounds came from a range of religious, community and political groups including the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]], Amnesty International, the [[Australian Greens]] and Rural Australians for Refugees

===Brazil===
Administrative detentions in [[Brazil]] are admitted only for members of the military. Any member of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]] may be imprisoned if found to be repeatedly in violation of the Military Disciplinary Regulations (''Regulamento Disciplinar'') by his or her superiors. Each military branch has issued a list of "transgressions" in their Disciplinary Regulations. The harshest punishment of this kind, in the Brazilian Army, is a 30-day imprisonment penalty.

Notwithstanding, members of the Brazilian Armed Forces under administrative detention may be granted a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' by the justice system to deliver them from imprisonment. They retain their full rights as citizens.

===Myanmar===
In an overview that describes [[Myanmar]] as "one of the most repressive countries in Asia", Human Rights Watch quotes a [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] report that states that in 2002, there were approximately 3,500 detainees in Myanmar, of which 1,300 are political prisoners, including parliament members. Burmese authorities often extend the detention of prisoners who have already served their prison sentences, by placing them under administrative detention. This practice is used even with elderly and infirm prisoners. One of the most notable cases of this practice was the detention of  [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/burma9826.htm Human Rights Overview – Burma]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The use of administrative detention in China has been commonplace since before 1949. At that time, it was used primarily against minor offenders as well as against [[opium]] addicts, [[prostitute]]s, vagrants and those considered to be insane. Since the 1978 legal reforms in China, the public security organs (gong'an jiguan), primarily the police, hold administrative detention powers which are used alongside the state's criminal justice system. Administrative detention is used against subjects that are viewed by the ruling regime as "socially undesirable", in order to maintain public order, social stability and political stability of the ruling regime.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Reform and Administrative Detention Powers in China, pp. 3-8, Sarah Biddulph, Cambridge Studies in Law and Society, Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This target group includes prostitutes and their clients, drug addicts, political dissenters and petty criminals, who perform legal misdemeanors that are not serious enough for criminal prosecution. [[Custody and repatriation]] (Chinese: 收容遣送; Pinyin: shōuróng qiǎnsòng) was also used until 2003 for people, especially peasants, who did not have required papers.

There are three main forms of these administrative detentions: "detention for education" ("Shourong jiaoyu"), coercive [[drug rehabilitation]] ("Qiangzhi jiedu"), and "reeducation through labor" ("Laodong jiaoyang"). In addition, administrative detention is used for several internal security reasons, such as detention under the Security Administrative Punishments Law ("Xingzheng juliu"); Administrative detention for questioning of suspects ("Luizhi panwen");  and detention of juvenile offenders in work-study schools ("Gongdu Xuexiao")

The use of administrative detention in China has been criticized by international human rights organizations, as well as by domestic groups. These criticisms maintain that the police often abuse their power, that the execution of these powers is at the complete discretion of the police, and that there are no legal constraints placed on their execution.

===Egypt===
Egypt's Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 authorizes the government to suspend basic civil liberties by declaring a state of emergency. Such a state of emergency has been in force almost continuously since 1967. Acting under this law, Egyptian authorities have administratively detained individuals who were suspected of membership in banned organizations such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15966 21-year-old blogger detained despite release order]&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as individuals engaged in peaceful demonstrations expressing opposition to the war in Iraq or support for the Palestinian uprising. [[Human Rights Watch]] has criticized this practice as the use of emergency legislation for 'repression of public dissent'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/02/egypt021403.htm Egypt: Growing Numbers of Arrests]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] charges that relatives of political prisoners in Egypt have been administratively detained solely because of their family relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde12/035/2002/en/ Document - Egypt: Torture or ill-treatment/Incommunicado detention, Al-Sayid Muhammad Hassan 'Abd al-Ghani] &lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian government refuses to disclose how many administrative detainees are held, but human rights groups estimate that 16,000-20,000 are held in detention without charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eipr.org/en/press/05/opinion%205%7B1%7D.htm Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights - OPINION No.  5/2005 (EGYPT)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122020525/http://www.eipr.org/en/press/05/opinion%205%7B1%7D.htm |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Ireland utilizes administrative detention to control illegal immigration. Beginning in 1996, a legal framework was put in place to authorize the use of administrative detention for this purpose. This legal framework includes the Refugee Act, 1996, the Immigration Acts, 1999, 2003 and 2004, and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000. According to official Irish government statistics, in 2003-2004, a total of 2,798 people were administratively detained for immigration-related reasons, two thirds of whom were held in prison for periods of longer than 51 days. The vast majority (more than 90%) of detainees are held in one of two [[Dublin]] prisons, Cloverhill Prison (male detainees) and the [[Dóchas Centre]] at Mountjoy Prison (female detainees). The rest are held in prisons as well as border control (Garda Síochána) stations.

The [[Council of Europe]] and human rights organizations have criticized the overcrowded conditions in which the detainees are held, as well as the fact that detainees are held together with convicted criminals. In addition, Human Rights Consultants have reported that Irish law does not protect the rights of detainees, by not informing them of their right to challenge the legality of their detention, nor recognizing their rights to have access to a lawyer and to have access to medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detention-in-europe.org/images/stories/detention%20ireland.pdf Immigration-related detention in Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116191803/http://www.detention-in-europe.org/images/stories/detention%20ireland.pdf |date=2016-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{See also|Palestinian prisoners in Israel#Administrative detention}}
The legal basis for Israel's use of Administrative Detention is the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] 1945 [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations]] which were amended in 1979 to form the Israeli Law on Authority in States of Emergency. Administrative detention is for six-month terms, although they can be extended barring appeal.&lt;ref&gt;B'Tselem, 1 January 2011, [http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention/criticism_on_the_administrative_detention_order ''Criticism of administrative detention under the Administrative Detention Order'']&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative detention is also used in cases where the available evidence consists of information obtained by the security services (particularly the [[Shin Bet]]), and where a trial would reveal sensitive security information, such as the identities of informers or infiltrators.

Although it is commonly applied to alleged Palestinian militants, it has occasionally been applied to Jewish Israeli citizens, including Jewish right-wing public-figures and activists (notably in the aftermath of the [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin]]) and in more recent years sometimes to [[Israeli settlement|settlers]] for short periods.&lt;ref&gt;B'Tselem, 22 July 2012 [http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention Administrative Detention]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Israel, the Minister of Defense has the authority to issue Administrative Detention orders for up to 6 months in cases where there is a reasonable chance that the person harms the security of the state. The same officeholder has the authority to renew such orders. Likewise, the Chief of the General Staff can issue such orders, but valid for only 48 hours. Law enforcement authorities have to show cause within 48 hours (in a hearing behind closed doors). Administrative Detention orders can be appealed to the District Court and, if denied there, to the [[Supreme Court of Israel]]. The District Court can annul such orders if it finds the administrative detention occurred for reasons other than security (mainly for common crimes or the exercise of freedom of expression). Overall supervisory authority on the application of the relevant law rests with the Minister of Justice.

Within the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], any Israeli district army commander can issue an administrative detention order, and the order can be appealed at the Israeli district military court, or, if denied there, at the Supreme Court. Here too, an administrative detention order is valid for at most six months, but can be renewed by the appropriate authority. Israel refers its use of administrative detention in the occupied territories to Article 78 of the Fourth [[Geneva Convention]] 1949, which states that "If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected persons, it may, at the most, subject them to assigned residence or to internment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Israel Yearbook on Human Rights vol. 23| publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | pages=49–50 | volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Addameer, Israel held 285 Palestinians in administrative detention in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Addameer, [http://www.addameer.org/etemplate.php?id=496 ''Addameer Monthly Detention Report - 1 July 2012''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019163115/http://www.addameer.org/etemplate.php?id=496 |date=19 October 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen of them were members of parliament, out of 4,706 prisoners. According to [[B'Tselem]], as of April 2012, about 308 Palestinians were being held under administrative detention by the [[Israel Prisons Service]] (IPS) and statistics on those held by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] were unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention/statistics |title=Statistics on administrative detention |publisher=[[B'Tselem]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606145620/http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention/statistics |archivedate=June 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IPS figures for December 2012, 178 Palestinians were being held in administrative detention (without charge or trial).&lt;ref name=bbc20130221&gt;{{cite news|title=Many injured in West Bank protests over hunger strikes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21532020|newspaper=BBC|date=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2013, B'Tselem reported that 140 Palestinians were being held under administrative detention by the IPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Administrative_Detention/Statistics.asp |title=Statistics on administrative detention |publisher=[[B'Tselem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the Israeli Government has approved the usage of administrative detention against Israeli terror suspects in order to combat the growing [[price tag policy|"price tag" conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Mairav Zonszein, the Guardian.

===Japan===
In Japan, [[immigration detention]] is a form of administration detention under the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, Act No. 319 of 1951 (ICRRA). Minors and asylum seekers can also be subject to administrative detention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globaldetentionproject.org/countries/asia-pacific/japan  Japan Immigration Detention], accessed Feb 14th, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative Decree No. 51 of 22 December 1962 introduced the State of Emergency Law, which came into force on 8 March 1963, that allowed the security forces to hold suspects in preventive detention without judicial oversight for indefinite periods.&lt;ref name = "UNHCR Sep11"&gt;{{citation |title= Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic |url= http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/countries/SY/Syria_Report_2011-08-17.pdf |publisher= UN Human Rights Council |date= 15 September 2011 |accessdate= 30 June 2012 |page= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has maintained many forms of administrative detention over the years. The most recent forms were a series of Acts intended to introduce a form of administrative detention to Northern Ireland under the auspices of the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974]]. This Act allowed the security forces to apprehend and detain persons suspected of terrorist activities without trial for an unlimited period. The introduction of the Act led directly to the creation of internment camps (particularly [[Long Kesh]] (the Maze) and the prison ship [[HMS Maidstone (1937)|HMS ''Maidstone'']] where suspects were detained, some for protracted periods.
The Act of 1974 was amended a number of times during the late 20th and early 21st century, the most recent incarnation being the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] which introduced the concept of the [[control order]], itself a more politically palatable means of limiting the freedom of a suspect without the need to provide a court of law with ''prima facie'' evidence of any wrongdoing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===United States===

{{further|Extrajudicial prisoners of the United States}}

The United States currently uses indefinite detention without trial –  known under various names as internment, [[civil commitment]], preventive detention or administrative detention – to hold people who fall within a few narrow categories, including the mentally ill ([[involuntary commitment]]), and "[[Sexual predator|sexually violent predators]]",&lt;ref name="mariner"&gt;[http://writ.news.findlaw.com/mariner/20020610.html INDEFINITE DETENTION OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS]&lt;/ref&gt; though the right of [[habeas corpus]] still applies, and some determinations regarding mental illness and sexual dangerousness are made by juries.

During [[World War II]], the United States detained over 100,000 [[Japanese American]]s in [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]]; smaller numbers of [[German American internment|German Americans]] and [[Italian American internment|Italian Americans]] were interned.

The United States also utilizes administrative detention as a counter-terrorism measure, and as a means to control illegal immigration. There are approximately 100,000 persons in removal proceedings at any one time,&lt;ref name="ecre" /&gt; and about 31,000 held in detention during these proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_detention_us/incustody_deaths/index.html New York Times Topics:In-Custody Deaths], accessed October 28, 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914160753/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_detention_us/incustody_deaths/index.html |date=September 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Patriot Act]] was passed. The Act expanded the authority of law enforcement agencies to use administrative detention for the stated purpose of fighting [[terrorism]] in the United States and abroad. Under the Act, any person ([[United States nationality law|citizen]] or alien) suspected of terrorist connections may be administratively detained for up to seven days without the benefit of an ''[[habeas corpus]]'' proceeding. The [[Attorney General of the United States]], at his discretion, may extend this seven-day period to six months, and this extension itself may be renewed indefinitely – legally creating the possibility of lifetime imprisonment without ever facing charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lsbM0USTAa8C&amp;pg=PA578 Administrative Law in the Political System, Kenneth F. Warren], Westview Press, 2004, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticisms of the PATRIOT Act is that the Attorney General's decision is not subject to any judicial review, unlike the situation in other democratic countries which have similar administrative detention laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lsbM0USTAa8C&amp;pg=PA578 Administrative Law in the Political System, Kenneth F. Warren], Westview Press, 2004, p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[War on Terror]], and particularly during and after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], U.S. forces captured hundreds of terrorists, who were subsequently detained without trial at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. The United States initially refused to grant these detainees [[prisoner of war]] status, holding that they were [[Unlawful combatant|illegal]] [[enemy combatant]]s because they did not meet the requirements set down by the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. Of the 775 detainees incarcerated at Guantanamo, 420 have been released without charge, and only one has been tried and convicted. U.S. authorities claim that they intend to put 60 to 80 more on trial.

==Criticism by human rights groups==
Administrative detention practices have come under severe criticism, with critics claiming that it breaches human rights.
[[Amnesty International]] believes that administrative detention breaches Article 9 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]  (ICCPR) which "makes clear that no-one should be subjected to arbitrary detention and that deprivation of liberty must be based on grounds and procedures established by law". The ICCPR does allow a government, under narrow circumstances, such as a public emergency threatening the life of a nation, to temporarily derogate from its obligation not to engage in arbitrary detention.&lt;ref name="mariner"/&gt;

Amnesty International is also concerned that [[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]] are being "held solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |publisher    = [[Amnesty International]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has created the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] on the issue. One of the issues the group has focused on is the determination whether a detention is arbitrary or not – which is not as clear-cut in the case of administrative detention as it is in the case of criminal arrest. The group has proposed certain guidelines to aid in such determination. For example, it has suggested that any deprivations of liberty that violate the [[freedom of association]] must be deemed arbitrary. Based on these guidelines, the group has condemned countries who have used long-term administrative detention when the detainees were held for the mere fact of belonging to an "illegal organization".&lt;ref name="mariner"/&gt;

'''Andre Bernard Gurode''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|d}}; born March 6, 1978) is a former [[American football]] [[Center (American football)|center]] and [[Guard (American football)|guard]] who played 11 seasons in the NFL. He played [[college football]] for the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], earning consensus [[All-America]]n recognition. The [[Dallas Cowboys]] selected him in the second round of the [[2002 NFL Draft]]. He is a five-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection, and has also played for the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Oakland Raiders]].

==Early years==
Gurode was born in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name=ProFootballReference.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurode on Pro-Football-Reference |work=fbref.com |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GuroAn20.htm|accessdate=2007-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071229021430/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GuroAn20.htm| archivedate= 29 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played [[high school football]] at [[North Shore Senior High School (Texas)|North Shore High School]] in Houston.  As a senior, ''[[USA Today]]'', [[PrepStar]] and SuperPrep selected him as an honorable mention high school [[All-America]]. He was also named to the '' [[Houston Chronicle]]'' Top 100 List and made the [[Austin American-Statesman]] "Fab 55" team.  He earned All-Area honors as a senior (second team honors as a junior), and was All-District and All-Greater Houston as a junior and senior (when he also was his team's most outstanding offensive lineman).

Gurode lettered three times in [[basketball]] and four times in [[Track and field athletics|track]] with personal bests of 186' 0" in the [[Discus throw|discus]] and 54' 1" in the [[shot put]].

==College career==
Gurode attended the [[University of Colorado]], where he played for the [[Colorado Buffaloes football]] team from 1998 to 2001.  He was a four-year starter for the Buffaloes, playing both [[center (American football)|center]] and [[guard (American football)|guard]] on the [[offensive line]].  He started his first two and a half seasons at center, before moving to guard in the middle of his junior year.  As a junior in 2000, he started the first six games of the year at center and the final five games at guard.  He received the John Mack Award, as selected by the coaches for being Colorado's most outstanding offensive player and was also selected honorable mention All-[[Big 12 Conference]] honors while helping the Buffaloes to a 7–5 record and a win over the [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College Eagles]] in the [[Insight.com Bowl]].  As a senior, he started every game at right guard.

Gurode was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team [[All-America]]n as a senior in 2001.&lt;ref name=ncaarecordsbook&gt;''2011 NCAA Football Records Book'', [http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2011/Awards.pdf  Award Winners], National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 11 (2011).  Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  During his career he allowed just 7.5 sacks in 2,653 plays as a starter for the Buffaloes.

He earned a degree in ethnic studies from the University of Colorado, where he was a member of the school's "Academic Starters" team.

==Professional career==

===2002 NFL Draft===
Gurode initially projected as a [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and was ranked the best available in the [[2002 NFL Draft]], along with [[Kendall Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/players.php?genpos=OG&amp;draftyear=2002&amp;sortorder=tsxpos&amp;order=ASC |title=2002 Draft OG Ranking |work=NFLDraftScout.com |accessdate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded as an early second round pick,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2002/draft/players/99600.html |title=Andre Gurode Draft Profile |work=Sports Illustrated |date=April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually selected 37th overall by the [[Dallas Cowboys]].

}}

===Dallas Cowboys (2002–2010)===
Gurode was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the second round of the [[2002 NFL Draft]] as a [[Center (American football)|center]]. He started fast by becoming the first rookie in club history to start at [[Center (American football)|center]] on opening day.

It is believed [[2002 NFL season|2002]] was the first time a [[NFL]] franchise had five African-American starters on their [[offensive line]], when the Cowboys lined up Gurode at [[Center (American and Canadian football)|center]], [[Tackle (American and Canadian football)|tackle]]s [[Flozell Adams]] and [[Solomon Page]], [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]]s [[Larry Allen]] and [[Kelvin Garmon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://a.espncdn.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1417470.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gurode also became part of history as the starting [[Center (American and Canadian football)|center]] on the Cowboys [[offensive line]] that helped [[Emmitt Smith]] eclipse [[Walter Payton]] as the [[NFL]]'s all-time leading rusher, playing against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] on October 27. While he started the first six games of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]] at [[Center (American football)|center]], Gurode was moved to help compensate for the number of injuries along the [[offensive line]], compiling another eight starts at [[Guard (American football)|right guard]].

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], [[Bill Parcells]] was hired as the Cowboys [[head coach]] and decided that Gurode's best position was at [[Guard (American football)|guard]], starting 15 games at that position in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and 13 games in [[2004 NFL season|2004]] with mixed results, before getting benched for the final two games.

At the start of the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], Parcells accepted he made a misjudgment by moving Gurode to [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and switched him back to [[Center (American football)|center]], with the Cowboys also signing [[Marco Rivera]] to take his place at [[Guard (American football)|guard]]. That season, he was a versatile backup, playing behind [[Al Johnson (guard)|Al Johnson]] at [[Center (American football)|center]] and Rivera at [[Guard (American football)|right guard]].

In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], he rededicated himself to football and won the starting center job again, over [[Al Johnson (guard)|Al Johnson]]. On October 1, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], in the third quarter of a game against the [[Tennessee Titans]], Titans [[defensive tackle]] [[Albert Haynesworth]] stomped on Gurode's head. Haynesworth's cleats caused a laceration requiring thirty stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsline.com/nfl/story/9700905 |title=Titans DT Haynesworth nailed with five-game suspension |publisher=Associated Press |work=Sportsline.com |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=2008-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628222456/http://sportsline.com/nfl/story/9700905 |archivedate=June 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth was ejected, and subsequently suspended by the NFL for five games without pay.

Following the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], Gurode was named to his first [[2007 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] as an injury replacement. On February 20, [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the Cowboys re-signed Gurode to a six-year contract worth US$30 million including a $10 million signing bonus.

Gurode developed into one of the league's most respected [[Center (American football)|centers]] since returning to being a full-time starter in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], and has been selected to the [[All-Pro]] Team ([[2007 All-Pro Team|2007]], [[2009 All-Pro Team|2009]]), as well as to five straight [[Pro Bowl]]s ([[2006 Pro Bowl|2006]], [[2007 Pro Bowl|2007]], [[2008 Pro Bowl|2008]], [[2009 Pro Bowl|2009]], [[2010 Pro Bowl|2010]])

He had offseason left knee surgery and missed the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]] training camp and three out of four preseason games.  With the emergence of second-year player [[Phil Costa (American football)|Phil Costa]], he was released after the preseason following failed negotiations regarding a restructured contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurode's departure shows Garrett means business |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/08/29/3321072/gurodes-departure-shows-garrett.html?storylink=digger-topic |author=Jaime Aron |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore Ravens (2011)===
Gurode reportedly visited the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[New England Patriots]] [http://bleacherbumsports.net/2011/09/02/pats-to-work-out-gurode/] before signing a 1-year, $3 million contract with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on September 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravens sign Pro Bowl center Andre Gurode to one-year contract |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/sports/football/other_nfl/view/20110905ravens_sign_pro_bowl_center_andre_gurode_to_one-year_contract/srvc=home&amp;position=recent |author=Jamison Hensley |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Bears (2012)===
On November 27, 2012, the [[Chicago Bears]] signed Gurode after losing guards [[Lance Louis]] and [[Chris Spencer (American football)|Chris Spencer]] to injuries sustained in a game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on November 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bears add veteran lineman Gurode |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-chicago-bears-sign-andre-gurode-20121127,0,2615470.story |author=Brad Biggs |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2012-11-27 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was waived by the Bears on December 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Gould-among-three-Bears-played-on-injured-reserve/12d03969-41b4-4d61-8eda-d89419979835|title=Gould among three Bears played on injured reserve|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=2012-12-11|accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oakland Raiders (2013)===
On July 26, 2013, Gurode signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=McDonald |title=Oakland Raiders sign veteran lineman Andre Gurode |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/raiders/ci_23742202/oakland-raiders-sign-veteran-lineman-andre-gurode |work=San Jose Mercury News |date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the 2013 NFL season Gurode became a free agent.

==Biography==
Capping what was already a long and distinguished career, in 2012 Annette Kolodny published ''In Search of First Contact: The Vikings of Vinland, the Peoples of the Dawnland, and the Anglo-American Anxiety of Discovery'' (Duke University Press). The influential magazine ''Indian Country Today'' immediately named it as one of the 12 most important books in Native American Studies published in 2012. The Western Literature Association awarded the book the Thomas Lyon Prize as "the best book in Western literary and cultural studies published in 2012." Professor Kolodny had earlier made her mark in the field of Native American Studies with the publication of the long-lost 1893 masterpiece of Native American literature, [[Joseph Nicolar]]'s ''The Life and Traditions of the Red Man'' (Duke University Press, 2007). This new edition included an interpretive analysis of Nicolar's text as well as a fascinating history of the [[Penobscot Nation]] in Maine. These two latest books mark the culmination of a scholarly career that began with studies of the American frontiers and moved into breakthrough examinations of trans-Atlantic contacts between Europeans and Native Americans.

Kolodny was born in [[New York City]] to Esther Rifkind Kolodny and David Kolodny.&lt;ref name="Jay 211"&gt;Jay, Gregory (ed.), ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', Detroit: Gale Research Company, 1988, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; She did her undergraduate work at Brooklyn College, from which she graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] [[magna cum laude]] in 1962.  After graduation, she took a position on the editorial staff at ''[[Newsweek]]''. Kolodny left to return to graduate studies in 1964, citing a desire “to teach people to think critically and because she wanted to be able to publish her own ideas, not merely report the ideas of others."&lt;ref name="Jay 211" /&gt; Her [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] work were completed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she earned the latter degree in 1969. &lt;ref name="Leitch 2143"&gt;"Annette Kolodny", Leitch, Vincent B. (ed.), ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism.'' New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2001, p. 2143.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first teaching position at [[Yale University]] was cut short as she left after a year to move to [[Canada]] with her husband, whose [[conscription|draft]] board appeal for [[conscientious objector]] status for the duration of the [[Vietnam War]] was rejected.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2143" /&gt; Finding a position at the [[University of British Columbia]], she helped develop western Canada’s first accredited interdisciplinary [[women’s studies]] program before returning to the United States in 1974 to teach at the [[University of New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="Jay 212"&gt;Jay, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In [[New Hampshire]], she wrote her first major work of feminist eco-criticism, ''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters'' (1975). While the book got positive reviews and pioneered the field of feminist [[ecocriticism]], Kolodny was denied promotion and [[tenure]] in the English Department at the University of New Hampshire. (Richter 1387) Active in the student movements while in Berkeley, she continued to advocate for the right to establish a program in women’s studies. She later [[lawsuit|sued]] the University of New Hampshire charging sex discrimination and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144"&gt;Leitch, p. 2144.&lt;/ref&gt; She settled with the "largest financial award in history in a case of this kind".&lt;ref name="Jay 212" /&gt; She used this money to establish the Legal Fund of the Task Force on Discrimination for the [[National Women's Studies Association]] (NWSA),&lt;ref name="Jay 212" /&gt; an organization she had helped found, and served as director of the task force from 1980 to 1985.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The Task Force is now renamed Feminists Against Academic Discrimination within the NWSA.

Kolodny taught at several universities, including the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] before being named Dean of the College of Humanities at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. Following her tenure as dean, which spanned from 1988 to 1993, Kolodny was named College of Humanities Professor of American Literature and Culture at the University of Arizona. Currently, she is Professor Emerita of Comparative Cultural and Literary Studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

In 1993 she was elected to lifetime membership in the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40106|title=Gruppe 4: Litteraturvitenskap|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate= January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her books have won many awards both in the United States and abroad. Over the course of her scholarly career, Kolodny has received grants and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Humanities Fellowship, and others. She retired from the University of Arizona in July 2007 and has continued an active professional life as a consultant in higher education policy issues and as a scholar of American literature and culture.

==Works==
Kolodny’s first two books were ''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1975) and ''The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860 ''(University of North Carolina Press, 1984); both of these texts deal with [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns and the historic destruction of the land (Jay 217). Based on her experience as a senior administrator in higher education, Kolodny published ''Failing the Future: A Dean Looks at Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century'' (Duke University Press, 1998), which "details the extent to which women and non-white students are still outsiders on American campuses."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The book also examines the status of the humanities disciplines in higher education, the value of tenure, and the need for family friendly policies on campus. It is a book about needed educational innovations in the twenty-first century.

Kolodny is also well known for two essays published in 1980: "Dancing Through the Minefield: Some Observations on the Theory, Practice, and Politics of a Feminist Literary Criticism" (''Feminist Studies'', Spring 1980) and "A Map for Re-Reading: Gender and the Interpretation of Literary Texts" (''New Literary History'', Spring 1980). Of these, "Dancing Through the Minefield" is the most well-known, and has been called "the most reprinted essay of American feminist literary criticism".&lt;ref name="Leitch 2143" /&gt; It has been translated and reprinted worldwide.

In 2007, Kolodny published a long-lost masterpiece of Native American literature, Joseph Nicolar’s ''The Life and Traditions of the Red Man'' (Duke University Press), originally published in 1893. Nicolar’s work traces the history of his people, the Penobscot Nation, from the first moments of creation through the arrival of the white man. Kolodny’s reprint of this important work includes a history of the Penobscot Nation and an interpretive introduction to the text. It was stipulated that the royalties from this text go to the Penobscot. In 2012, Kolodny published ''In Search of First Contact: The Vikings of Vinland, the Peoples of the Dawnland, and the Anglo-American Anxiety of Discovery'' (Duke University Press). A major contribution to the field of American Studies, this book examines both Native American and Euroamerican stories of first contacts between the peoples of the New and Old Worlds. It examines the competition between [[Leif Eiriksson]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] for the title of "first discoverer".

===Literary theory and criticism===

====Landscape symbolism and ecofeminism====

=====''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor As Experience and History in American Life and Letters''=====

In her first book, ''The Lay of the Land'', Kolodny explores the [[colony|colonization]] of America, both in reality and in the realm of [[metaphor]]. She examines "the continued repetition of the land-as-woman symbolization in American life and letters" (Kolodny, ix). The projection of female imagery onto the landscape was essential to its colonization, she argued; in her introduction, she asks, "was there perhaps a need to experience the land as a nurturing, giving maternal breast because of the threatening, alien, and potentially emasculating terror of the unknown?" (9) By construing the land as female, she argued, it was possible for the colonists to remove some of the terror and mystery from an unknown land. Instead, it became either a nurturing maternal figure, existing to provide sustenance, or a passive virginal figure, existing only to be dominated, sexually or otherwise. With these metaphors firmly in sight, the colonists had a framework through which to view the vast stretches of [[North America]] as less alien and terrifying. Through an examination of several male writers, such as [[Philip Freneau]], [[James Fenimore Cooper]], and [[John James Audubon]], Kolodny pursues the implications of this metaphorically female land.

Different chapters of the book correspond to different chronological eras after the discovery and colonization of the Americas and to different metaphorical mindsets as manifested in the writings of the authors considered. In chapter 2, "Surveying the Virgin Land: The Documents of Exploration and Colonization, 1500–1740", the comparison of the land to an untouched, virginal paradise begins the exploration. Chapter 3, "Laying Waste Her Fields of Plenty: The Eighteenth Century", discusses the romanticized [[agriculture|agrarian]] and [[pastoral]] ideals that coloured the view of America, especially in its comparisons to ideal lands like [[Elysium]] and [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], and the consequences that arose from such ideals, such as the exploitation and alteration of the land. Chapter 4, "Singing Her Past and Singing Her Praises: The Nineteenth Century", examines the dual images of Mother and Mistress in the land, as well as the frustration of the pastoral impulse with the closing of the American frontier and the victory of the industrialized North in the [[American Civil War]]. Finally, chapter 5, "Making It with Paradise: The Twentieth Century", deals with the increase of [[industrialization]] and the yearning both "to return to and to master the beautiful and bountiful femininity of the new continent." (139)

[[Freud]]ian and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] influences are apparent in this text, especially in the "psychosexual dynamic of a virginal paradise" (Kolodny, ''Land Before Her'', 3). It also has tones of [[ecofeminism]], which will be discussed below.

=====''The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860''=====

In the preface to this book, Kolodny states that "[t]he purpose of this study is to chart women’s private responses to the successive American frontiers and to trace a tradition of women’s public statements about the west." (Kolodny, ''Land Before Her'', xi) Thus, she approaches the same topic as that of ''Lay of the Land'' ("landscape as a symbolic…realm" [xii]), but from a different direction. In the writings she examined, she noticed a different theme from that of the male writers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like their husbands and fathers, women too shared in economic motives behind [[emigration]]; and like the men, women also dreamed of transforming the wilderness. But the emphases were different…Avoiding for a time male assertions of a rediscovered [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], women claimed the frontiers as a potential sanctuary for an idealized domesticity. Massive exploitation and alteration of the continent do not seem to have been a part of women’s [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]].  They dreamed, more modestly, of locating a home and a familial human community within a cultivated garden. (xii–xiii)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is little sense of the conquering-of-the-[[frontier]] mentality that Kolodny discovered in the male writers she discussed in ''Lay of the Land''. There were no triumphant [[hero]]es of the order of [[Daniel Boone]] or [[Davey Crockett]]; rather, the narratives of these women focused on the triumph of domesticity and order in a wild land.

The book is organized chronologically, in much the same way as ''Lay of the Land''. The first section is titled "Book One: From Captivity to Accommodation, 1630-1833", and traces the writings of and about women as they moved from captivity both literal ([[Mary Rowlandson]]’s account of being captured by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s) and figurative (the sense of being forcibly confined in a new and strange land) to adaptation in the form of survival skills, such as those reputedly possessed by [[Rebecca Boone]], the wife of Daniel Boone. Book two, "From Promotion to Literature, 1833–1850", follows attempts to encourage women to move westward by male writers to western narratives by the women themselves. The third and final section, "Book Three: Repossessing Eden, 1850–1860", documents the attempts by women to create a familiar order in a still unfamiliar country.

=====Ecofeminism=====

Both of these books relate to a subgenre of feminism called ecological feminism or ecofeminism, a social and political doctrine that posits a relationship between the subjugation of women and the destruction of nature. Ecofeminists theorize that a culture based on dominating women is directly connected to social ideals that promote the environmental abuse of the earth. 

These two books have a connection to ecofeminism, particularly ''Lay of the Land''. The feminization of the land and the images of the earth as a passive, giving female figure show the social ideas that ecofeminism protests against. Likewise, ''The Land Before Her'' exemplifies the same ideas from a different point of view in the ideal of the domestic garden, or the altering of nature.

===="Dancing Through the Minefield"====

Perhaps her best known work, Kolodny’s 1980 essay "Dancing Through the Minefield" was the "first work to attempt both a survey of the first ten years of feminist literary inquiry and an analysis of the informing theoretical propositions".&lt;ref&gt;Jay, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the subject of criticism in the years since its initial publication, but can still be seen as a guide to "feminist concerns and methodologies."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt;

=====Social constructionism=====
{{Main article|Social constructionism}}
Kolodny emphasizes Social constructionism in this essay, although she herself never uses the term. Briefly, social constructionism is a school of thought that involves looking at the ways social phenomena are created, by people. (See full article on Social constructionism) Using this theory, social entities are seen as always being in a state of change as society itself changes, and the relationships of the entities change. "[T]hings in the world … are the products of ongoing social processes of interaction, and thus do not have fixed or inherent meanings."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt;

In "Dancing Through the Minefield", Kolodny applies this theory to the [[wiktionary:canon|literary canon]], those works of [[literature]] that are considered appropriate for study. But such a canon is formed by critics whose values of [[Literary Criticism|aestheticism]] are not neutral. The critical interpretation is formed by the interaction between two objects: the text and the reader. According to Kolodny, the reader’s ability to read any given text is shaped by the social conventions and assumptions of their time and place; Reading becomes a social product. But neither is the text pure; it is also moulded by social relations and customs. So any critical interpretation is necessarily a product of two forms of social construction. "Readers and texts are both made &amp;mdash; and they are continually being remade."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The dynamic nature of both texts and readers must be taken into consideration when examining any text, or the established criticism of that text.

=====Theory=====
Kolodny’s essay has a clear theoretical outline. In light of the social constructionist view that aesthetic values, as assigned to the literary canon, are in actuality the products of social conventions and values, Kolodny claims that feminist criticism should "discover how aesthetic value is assigned in the first place" (Kolodny 2147) and then assess the socially-constructed reading patterns that lead to those value judgements. "Having become embroiled in value disagreements, feminism should consider the processes underlying value judgements."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; "Dancing Through the Minefield" outlines a three-part nucleus assumed by most contemporary feminist literary critics to be essential. First, any construction of a literary canon is a social construction; second, readers unconsciously engage texts from a certain point-of-view; and third, this unconscious bias present in all readers must be consciously and critically re-examined. 

First, she writes, "literary history…is a fiction." (Kolodny 2153) This refers to the traditional formation of the literary canon and literary history as a social construction. Literary histories define the major, minor, and ignored texts according to their own social values and conventions, not out of any inherent aesthetic value on the text itself. For example, the western literary canon has been largely created by well-educated white men, and the focus of the canon is therefore on works by well-educated white men. It embodied, as well as upheld, the dominant ideology of the time, and had implications beyond aesthetic values. To give preference to texts by this group was to ignore texts created by other social groups. In recent years, the monolithic nature of the canon has been challenged, and works by previously ignored sections of the literary world (women, [[homosexual]]s, and [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]) have gained some footholds in the canon.

Secondly, readers of texts "engage…not texts but [[paradigm]]s." (2155) Just as texts and canons are socially constructed, so are the vantage points from which readers engage with any given text. This was also mentioned by [[Stanley Fish]], who called these vantage points [[interpretive communities]]. Kolodny states that "we appropriate meaning from a text…according the critical assumptions or predispositions (conscious or not) that we bring to it." (2155)

Finally, Kolodny "strives to undo the unconsciousness of the reader identified"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145"&gt;Leitch, p. 2145.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second part of her theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the grounds upon which we assign aesthetic value to texts are never infallible, unchangeable, or universal, we must re-examine not only our [[aesthetics]] but, as well, the inherent biases and assumptions informing the critical methods which (in part) shape our aesthetic responses. (Kolodny 2158)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
These three general theoretical principles are then supported by the concept of pluralism. Pluralism in this context refers to a conscious effort not to limit oneself to a single critical approach when reading a text. Rather, the object of pluralism is to make use of multiple critical approaches and to get a fuller appreciation of the variety of meanings which can be present in a single text. Kolodny specifically refers to a feminist pluralism, which validates "multiple interpretations of various texts"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; according to the usefulness of a pluralistic view of a text. This method of reading would give equality to different approaches as well as allow critical examinations of those same approaches, which in turn helps create the "broad critical awareness"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; advocated by Kolodny’s third principle as outlined above.

The essay emphasizes the real situation of contemporary women. Kolodny believes that feminism and women’s studies should not be confined to books or classrooms. “[I]deas are important because they determine the ways we live, or want to live, in the world” (Kolodny 2164); ideas are therefore not meant to exist in a vacuum. Rather, they must be taken into the world through [[activism]].

=====Criticism=====
Several authors have criticized "Dancing Through the Minefield". The most well-known of these criticisms appeared in a collaborative article Kolodny wrote with Judith Gardiner, Elly Bulkin, and Rena Patterson entitled "An Interchange on Feminist Criticism: On ‘Dancing Through the Minefield’", which was published in the journal ''Feminist Studies'' in 1983. 

Both Bulkin and Patterson believe that Kolodny, while speaking to women in her essay, is only speaking to a certain group of women &amp;mdash; those who are white, [[middle class]], and [[heterosexual]]. Patterson states that "despite its language and intent, [the essay]…represents [[classism|classist]], white, and [[heterosexism|heterosexist]] attitudes which are common in feminist literary criticism and which contradict the best of feminist thought and the aims of the women's movement" (Patterson, 654). This is a common criticism of [[second-wave feminism]]: that it tended to ignore the problems of non-white and non-heterosexual women in favor of a homogenized white heterosexual feminist culture. However, Kolodny’s advocacy of the concept of pluralism may offset this claim. While she does not specify that alternative critical approaches should come from different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] or [[Sexual orientation|sexualities]], there is no reason why they could not and such inclusion would only increase the scope of the "broad critical awareness"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; mentioned above.

Gardiner, on the other hand, disagrees with Kolodny about the use of pluralism. While there can be no single ideology to which all feminist theories belong, Gardiner writes, there are some strong ideological concepts that define areas of feminism. Examples of this would include [[liberal feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[ecofeminism]]. In Gardiner’s view, the strong ideological beliefs shared by these groups would "limit their susceptibility to pluralism." (Gardiner 634)

====''Failing the Future: A Dean Looks at Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century''====
Kolodny’s 1998 book is not a work of literary criticism, but rather one of institutional criticism. After serving as dean of Humanities for five years at the University of Arizona, Kolodny wrote this book in order to outline some of the problems facing academic institutions. These include the ability of legislators and administrators to make uninformed decisions about budget cuts without realizing the effect of such cuts on quality education; a myriad of problems about [[tenure]] and promotions processes, which Kolodny believes still reflect an attitude antagonistic to women or ethnic minorities; a problem with anti-feminist and anti-[[intellectual]] harassment; the lack of support available for students with children; the extent to which women and non-whites are still considered outsiders on university campuses; and the effect of an outdated curriculum in the face of greater demographic diversity and changing student learning needs. She outlines a number of changes which can be made to improve conditions and, realizing that any substantial change will require equally substantial money, encourages government reinvestment in higher education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3828">In mathematics, '''BCI and BCK algebras''' are [[algebraic structure]]s, introduced by Y. Imai,  K. Iséki and S. Tanaka in 1966, that describe fragments of the propositional calculus involving implication known as BCI and [[BCK logic]]s.

==Definition==

===BCI algebra===
An algebra &lt;math&gt;\left( X;\ast
,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;\left( 2,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''BCI-algebra'' if, for any &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in X&lt;/math&gt;, it satisfies the following conditions. (Informally, we may read &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as "truth" and &lt;math&gt;x\ast y&lt;/math&gt; as "&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;".)
; BCI-1: &lt;math&gt;\left( \left( x\ast y\right) \ast \left( x\ast z\right)
\right) \ast \left( z\ast y\right) =0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-2: &lt;math&gt;\left( x\ast \left( x\ast y\right) \right) \ast y=0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-3: &lt;math&gt;x\ast x=0&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-4: &lt;math&gt;x\ast y=0 \land y\ast x=0\implies x=y&lt;/math&gt;
; BCI-5: &lt;math&gt;x\ast 0=0 \implies x=0&lt;/math&gt;

===BCK algebra===
A BCI-algebra &lt;math&gt;\left( X;\ast ,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''BCK-algebra'' if it
satisfies the following condition:
; BCK-1: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in X: 0\ast x=0. &lt;/math&gt;

A partial order can then be defined as ''x'' ≤ ''y'' iff x * y = 0.

A BCK-algebra is said to be ''commutative'' if it satisfies:
: &lt;math&gt;x\ast (x\ast y)= y\ast (y\ast x)&lt;/math&gt;
In a commutative BCK-algebra ''x'' * (''x'' * ''y'') = ''x'' ∧ ''y'' is the [[greatest lower bound]] of ''x'' and ''y'' under the partial order ≤.

A BCK-algebra is said to be bounded if it has a largest element, usually denoted by 1. In a bounded commutative BCK-algebra the least upper bound of two elements satisfies ''x'' ∨ ''y'' = 1 * ((1 * ''x'') ∧ (1 * ''y'')); that makes it a [[distributive lattice]].

==Examples==

Every [[abelian group]] is a BCI-algebra, with * defined as group subtraction and 0 defined as the group identity.

The subsets of a set form a BCK-algebra, where A*B is the [[Complement (set theory)|difference]] A\B (the elements in A but not in B), and 0 is the [[empty set]].

A [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is a BCK algebra if ''A''*''B'' is defined to be ''A''&amp;and;&amp;not;''B'' (''A'' does not imply ''B'').

The bounded commutative BCK-algebras are precisely the [[MV-algebra]]s.

A '''battery electric vehicle''' ('''BEV'''), '''pure electric vehicle''' or '''all-electric vehicle''' is a type of [[electric vehicle]] (EV) that uses [[chemical energy]] stored in [[rechargeable battery]] [[battery pack|packs]]. BEVs use [[electric motor]]s and [[motor controller]]s instead of [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICEs) for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, [[fuel cell]], or [[fuel tank]]. BEVs include - but are not limited to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/|title=FAQ|website=The Boring Company|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"literally hundreds of electric thrusters now operating in orbit on communications satellites, and ion and Hall thrusters both having  been  successfully  used..." -https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/SciTechBook/series1/Goebel__cmprsd_opt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, rail cars, watercraft, forklifts, buses, trucks, and cars.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Hybrid electric vehicle|Plug-in hybrid|Plug-in electric vehicle}}
Vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged (operate in charge-sustaining mode) and instead they are continually recharged with power from the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[regenerative braking]].&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;

[[Hybrid vehicle]]s with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and [[gasoline]] fuel are called [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles (PHEV), and run as BEVs during their [[charge-depleting]] mode. PHEVs with a [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain#Series hybrid|series]] [[powertrain]] are also called range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Fisker Karma]].

[[Plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PEVs) are a subcategory of [[electric vehicle]]s that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B.

In China, plug-in electric vehicles, together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).&lt;ref name=NEVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNEWSCHINESE/Resources/3196537-1202098669693/EV_Report_en.pdf|title=The China New Energy Vehicles Program - Challenges and Opportunities |author=PRTM Management Consultants |publisher=World Bank |date=April 2011|accessdate=2012-02-29}} ''See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour (72&amp;nbsp;km/h), are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour (48&amp;nbsp;km/h), and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/02/06/greenlings-what-is-a-neighborhood-electric-vehicle-nev/|title=What is a neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV)?|date=2009-02-06|publisher= AutoblogGreen| accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles by type==
The concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged [[electric vehicle battery|batteries]] on board vehicles for propulsion. Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology ([[Lithium Ion]]) that have higher power and [[energy density]] (i.e., greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries) and higher oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|title=-|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205073246/http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|archivedate=5 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BEVs include [[automobile]]s, [[Truck#Light trucks|light trucks]], and [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s.

A battery-powered [[electric car]] is an [[automobile]] which is [[ground propulsion|propelled]] by [[electric motor]]s.

Although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed, the lower [[specific energy]] of production batteries available in 2015 compared with [[carbon-based fuel]]s means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges. Recharging can also take significant lengths of time. For journeys within a single battery charge, rather than long journeys, electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight.

[[Formula E]] is a fully electric international single seater championship. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is sanctioned by the FIA. Alejandro Agag is the current CEO of Formula E.

The Formula E championship is currently contested by ten teams with two drivers each (after the withdrawal of Team Trulli, there are temporarily only nine teams competing). Racing generally takes place on temporary city-center street circuits which are approximately 2 to 3.4&amp;nbsp;km (1.2 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;mi) long. Currently, only the Mexico City ePrix takes place on a road course, a modified version of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

===Environmental benefits of the use of electric vehicles===
Electric vehicles produce no [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions, at the tailpipe.
So they are considered 'green' because they have no emissions in the place where they are used.
However, battery electric vehicles can be considered [[Zero emission engines]] only locally, because they generally produce GHG in the power plants where electricity is generated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-exec-summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two factors driving these GHG emissions of Battery Electric Vehicles are:
* the Carbon intensity of the electricity used to recharge the Electric Vehicle (commonly expressed in grams of CO2 per kWh)
* the consumption of the specific vehicle (in kilometers/kWh)
The Carbon Intensity of electricity can largely vary, depending on the electricity mix of the geographic region where electricity is consumed (a Country with high shares of renewables in his electricity mix will have a low C.I.).
In the European Union, in 2013, the Carbon Intensity had a strong geographic variability, but in almost all the Member States Electric vehicles were "greener" than conventional ones. On average, Electric car saved 50%-60% of CO2 emissions compared to diesel and gasoline fuelled engines. 
Moreover, the de-carbonisation process is constantly reducing the GHG emissions due to the use of Electric Vehicles. In the European Union, on average, between 2009 and 2013 there was a reduction of the electricity Carbon Intensity of 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research part D, 2017|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Life-cycle assessment]] perspective, considering the GHG necessary to build the battery and its end-of-life, the GHG savings are 10-13% lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special-purpose vehicles===
[[File:Special people Electric Vehicle.jpg|thumb|Electric vehicles for disabled people in [[Årdalstangen]], Norway|alt=Electric vehicles for the disabled, in Årdalstangen, Norway]]
{{See also|Electrathon}}
[[Special-purpose vehicle]]s come in a wide range of types, ranging from relatively common ones such as [[golf cart]]s, things like [[electric golf trolley]]s, [[milk float]]s, [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, and a wide range of other devices. Certain manufacturers specialize in electric-powered "in plant" work machines.

===Electric motorcycles, scooters and rickshaws===
{{main|Electric motorcycles and scooters}}
Three-wheeled vehicles include [[electric rickshaw]]s, a powered variant of the [[cycle rickshaw]].

China is the world's leading manufacturer of e-bikes, with 22.2 million units produced in 2009. Some of the biggest manufacturers of E-bikes in the world are [[BYD Company|BYD]], Geoby.

===Personal transporters===
An increasing variety of [[personal transporter]]s are being manufactured, including the one-wheeled [[self-balancing unicycle]]s, [[self-balancing scooter]]s, [[electric kick scooter]]s, and [[electric skateboard]]s.

===Motor controllers===
{{Main|Motor controller}}
The motor controller receives a signal from [[potentiometers]] linked to the accelerator pedal, and it uses this signal to determine how much electric power is needed&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Exactly Do Electric Cars Work? |url=https://www.greencarfuture.com/electric/2018/11/11/how-exactly-do-electric-cars-work.html|website=Green Car Future |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This [[DC power]] is supplied by the battery pack, and the controller regulates the power to the motor, supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on the motor type. The controller also handles [[regenerative braking]], whereby electrical power is gathered as the vehicle slows down and this power recharges the battery&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;. In addition to power and motor management, the controller performs various safety checks such as anomaly detection, functional safety tests and failure diagnostics&lt;ref name="HitachiReview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Components and Systems for Electric Vehicles (HEVs/EVs) |url=http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2018/r2018_01/10b02/index.html|website=Hitachi Review |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Battery Pack===
{{main|Battery (electricity)}}

Most electric vehicles today use an [[electric battery]], consisting of [[electrochemical cell]]s with external connections in order to provide power to the vehicle.&lt;ref name=battRef2000&gt;
{{cite book |title=Battery Reference Book |edition=third|last=Crompton|first=T. R. |date=2000-03-20 |publisher=Newnes |page=Glossary 3 |isbn=0080499953 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QmVR7qiB5AUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=ckHhIPVdcC&amp;dq=battery%20one%20or%20more%20cells&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2016-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Battery technology for EVs has developed from early [[lead-acid batteries]] used in the late 19th Century to the 2010s, to [[lithium-ion batteries]] which are found in most EVs today&lt;ref name="HitachiReview" /&gt;. The overall battery is referred to as a [[battery pack]], which is a group of multiple battery modules and cells. The battery pack powering modern EVs can have as little as 96 battery cells to as many as 2,976 cells&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

===Motors===
{{Main|Traction motor}}
Electric cars have traditionally used series wound DC motors, a form of [[brushed DC electric motor]]. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of [[AC motor]] types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually [[induction motor]]s or [[brushless AC electric motor]]s which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the [[brushless DC electric motor]].

Once electric power is supplied to the motor (from the controller), the magnetic field interaction inside the motor will turn the [[drive shaft]] and ultimately the vehicle's wheels&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

The '''''Belgian Linguistic case (No. 2)''''' (1968) [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695402&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 1 EHRR 252] is a formative case on the [[right to education]] under the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], Protocol 1, art 2. It related to "certain aspects of the laws on the use of [[languages of Belgium|languages]] in [[education in Belgium]]",  was decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1968.

==Facts==
The applicants submitted six applications (Applications No: 1474/62, 1677/62, 1691/62, 1769/63, 1994/63, 2126/64) between 1962 and 1964 on their own behalf and on the behalf of their  children, alleging that Belgian linguistic legislation, relating to education, infringed on their rights under the  European Convention, namely [[Article 8 ECHR|Article 8]] (family life) in conjunction with Article 14 (non-discrimination), and Article 2 of the Protocol 1 (right to education) of March 1952. 
The Acts they brought litigation against basically stated the language of education shall be [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the Dutch-speaking region, [[French language|French]] in the French-speaking region and [[German language|German]] in the German-speaking region.

===Counsel submissions===
The applicants, whose children totalled more than 800, asserted that the law of the Dutch-speaking regions where they lived did not include adequate provisions for French-language education. They also complained that the Belgian state withheld grants from institutions in these regions that did not comply with the linguistic provisions set out in the legislation for schools and refused to homologate certificates issued by these institutions.  Further, the state did not allow the applicants’ children to attend French classes in certain places,  forcing  applicants  to  enrol  their  children  in  local  schools,  contrary  to their aspirations, or send them further afield, which entailed risks and hardships.

The Government argued that the right to education in one’s own language was not included in the Convention and the Protocol, and that the applicants did not belong to a national minority within the meaning of Article 14.

==Judgment==
The Court found by a majority of 8 to 7 that one of the Acts violated Art 14. But the Court also found unanimously that there had been no breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, and Article 2 of the protocol, with regard to the other contested legislation and points at issue. In reaching its decision the Court considered that the principle of equality of treatment enshrined in Article 14 was violated if the distinction had no objective and reasonable justification, did not pursue a legitimate aim, and was not proportionate to the aim pursued. Further to this, the Court opined that the right to education implied the right to be educated in the national language, and did not include the provision that the parent’s linguistic preferences be respected.

The operative part of the Court's judgment read as follows.

{{Cquote|2.  The Court will address itself first to Article 2 of the Protocol because the Contracting States made express provision with reference to the right to education in this Article.

3.  By the terms of the first sentence of this Article, 'no person shall be denied the right to education'.

In spite of its negative formulation, this provision uses the term 'right' and speaks of a 'right to education'. Likewise the preamble to the Protocol specifies that the object of the Protocol lies in the collective enforcement of 'rights and freedoms'. There is therefore no doubt that Article 2 does enshrine a right. It remains, however, to determine the content of this right and the scope of the obligation it places upon States.

The negative formulation indicates, as is confirmed by the preparatory work, that the Contracting Parties do not recognise such a right to education as would require them to establish at their own expense, or to subsidise, education of any particular type or at any particular level. However, it cannot be concluded from this that the State has no positive obligation to ensure respect for such a right as is protected by Article 2 of the Protocol. As a 'right' does exist, it is secured, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, to everyone within the jurisdiction of a Contracting State.

To determine the scope of the 'right to education', within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, the Court must bear in mind the aim of this provision. It notes in this context that all member States of the Council of Europe possessed, at the time of the opening of the Protocol to their signature, and still do possess, a general and official educational system. There neither was, nor is now, therefore, any question of requiring each State to establish such a system, but merely of guaranteeing to persons subject to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties the right, in principle, to avail themselves of the means of instruction existing at a given time.

The Convention lays down no specific obligations concerning the extent of these means and the manner of their organisation or subsidisation. In particular, the first sentence of Article 2 does not specify the language in which education must be conducted in order that the right to education should be respected. It does not contain precise provisions similar to those in Articles 5(2) and 6(3)(a) and (e). However, the right to education would be meaningless if it did not imply, in favour of its beneficiaries, the right to be educated in the national language or in one of the national languages, as the case may be.

4.  The first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol consequently guarantees, in the first place, a right of access to educational institutions existing at a given time, but such access constitutes only a part of the right to education. For the 'right to education' to be effective, it is further necessary that, inter alia, the individual who is the beneficiary should have the possibility of drawing profit from the education received, that is to say, the right to obtain, in conformity with the rules in force in each State, and in one form or another, official recognition of the studies he has completed. The Court will deal with this matter in greater detail when it examines the last of the six specific questions listed in the submissions of those who appeared before it.

5.  The right to education guaranteed by the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation that may vary in time and place according to needs and resources of the community and of individuals. It goes without saying that such regulation must never injure the substance of the right to education nor conflict with other rights enshrined in the Convention.

The Court considers that the general aim set for themselves by the Contracting Parties through the medium of the European Convention on Human Rights was to provide effective protection of fundamental human rights, and this, without doubt, not only because of the historical context in which the Convention concluded, but also of the social and technical developments in our age that offer States considerable possibilities for regulating the exercise of these rights. The Convention therefore implies a just balance between the protection of the general interest of the community and the respect due to fundamental human rights while attaching particular importance to the latter....

7.  The first sentence of Article 2 contains in itself no linguistic requirement. It guarantees the right of access to educational establishments existing at a given time and the right to obtain, in conformity with the rules in force in each State and, in one form or another, the official recognition of completed studies, this last right not being relevant to the point dealt with here."}}

In [[statistical process control|statistical quality control]], the '''CUSUM''' (or '''cumulative sum [[control chart]]''') is a [[sequential analysis]] technique developed by [[E. S. Page]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]. It is typically used for monitoring [[change detection]].&lt;ref name=grigg&gt;{{cite journal

CUSUM was announced in [[Biometrika]], in 1954, a few years after the publication of [[Abraham Wald|Wald]]'s [[SPRT]] algorithm.&lt;ref name=page&gt;{{cite journal
|first=E. S.
|last=Page

|doi=10.1093/biomet/41.1-2.100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page referred to a "quality number" &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, by which he meant a parameter of the [[probability distribution]]; for example, the [[mean]]. He devised CUSUM as a method to determine changes in it, and proposed a criterion for deciding when to take corrective action. When the CUSUM method is applied to changes in mean, it can be used for [[step detection]] of a [[time series]].

A few years later, [[George Alfred Barnard]] developed a visualization method, the V-mask chart, to detect both increases and decreases in &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|first=G.A.
|last=Barnard
|authorlink=George Alfred Barnard
|title=Control charts and stochastic processes
|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]
|volume=B (Methodological)
|issue=21, number 2
|year=1959
|pages=239–71
|jstor=2983801
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
As its name implies, CUSUM involves the calculation of a '''cu'''mulative '''sum''' (which is what makes it "sequential"). Samples from a process &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; are assigned weights &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;, and summed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;S_0=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_{n+1}=\max(0, S_n+x_n-\omega_n)&lt;/math&gt;

When the value of ''S'' exceeds a certain threshold value, a change in value has been found. The above formula only detects changes in the positive direction. When negative changes need to be found as well, the min operation should be used instead of the max operation, and this time a change has been found when the value of ''S'' is ''below'' the (negative) value of the threshold value.

Page did not explicitly say that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[likelihood function]], but this is common usage.

Note that this differs from SPRT by always using zero function as the lower "holding barrier" rather than a lower "holding barrier".&lt;ref name=grigg/&gt; Also, CUSUM does not require the use of the likelihood function.

As a means of assessing CUSUM's performance, Page defined the ''average run length'' (A.R.L.) [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]; "the expected number of articles sampled before action is taken." He further wrote:&lt;ref name=page/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When  the  quality  of  the output  is  satisfactory  the A.R.L.  is  a measure  of  the expense incurred by the scheme when it gives false alarms, i.e., [[Type I error]]s ([[Neyman–Pearson lemma|Neyman &amp; Pearson]], 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=[[Sufficient statistic]]s and [[statistical power|uniformly most powerful tests]] of statistical hypotheses
|journal=[[Statistical Research Memoirs]]
|volume=I
|pages=113–137
}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  On  the other  hand,  for  constant  poor  quality  the A.R.L.  measures  the delay and thus  the amount of scrap produced before the rectifying action is taken,  i.e., [[Type II error]]s.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Example==
The following example shows 20 observations of a process with a mean value of X equal to 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5. It can be seen as the value of Z is never greater than 3, so other control charts should not be detected as a failure while using the Cusum 17 that shows the value of SH is greater than 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11609">In [[mathematics]], a '''cancellative semigroup''' (also called a '''cancellation semigroup''') is a [[semigroup]] having the [[cancellation property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Clifford|Preston|1967|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In intuitive terms, the cancellation property asserts that from an [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] of the form ''a'' · ''b'' = ''a'' · ''c'', where · is a [[binary operation]], one can cancel the element ''a'' and deduce the equality ''b'' = ''c''.  In this case the element being canceled out is appearing as the left factors of {{nowrap|''a'' · ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' · ''c''}} and hence it is a case of '''left cancellation property'''.  The '''right cancellation property''' can be defined analogously.  [[Prototype|Prototypical]] examples of cancellative semigroups are the [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and the [[semigroup]] of [[positive integer]]s under [[addition]] or [[multiplication]].  Cancellative semigroups are considered to be very close to being groups because cancellability is one of the necessary conditions for a semigroup to be embeddable in a group. Moreover, every finite cancellative semigroup is a group. One of the main problems associated with the study of cancellative semigroups is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for embedding a cancellative semigroup in a group.

The origins of the study of cancellative semigroups can be traced to the first substantial paper on semigroups, {{harv|Suschkewitsch|1928}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Preston_semigroups.html |title=Personal reminiscences of the early history of semigroups |author=[[Gordon Preston|G. B.

==Formal definitions==

Let ''S'' be a semigroup.  An element ''a'' in ''S'' is '''left cancellative''' (or, is ''left cancellable'', or,  has the ''left cancellation property'') if {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = ''ac''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S''.  If every element in ''S'' is left cancellative, then ''S'' is called a '''left cancellative semigroup'''.

Let ''S'' be a semigroup.  An element ''a'' in ''S'' is '''right cancellative''' (or, is ''right cancellable'', or,  has the ''right cancellation property'') if {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = ''ca''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S''.  If every element in ''S'' is right cancellative, then ''S'' is called a '''right cancellative semigroup'''.

Let ''S'' be a semigroup.  If every element in ''S'' is both left cancellative and right cancellative, then ''S'' is called a '''cancellative semigroup'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id= 5926|title=Cancellative semigroup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to restate the characteristic property of a cancellative element in terms of a property held by the corresponding left multiplication {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''S'' → ''S''}} and right multiplication {{nowrap|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''S'' → ''S''}} maps defined by {{nowrap|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''b'') = ''ab''}}, {{nowrap|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''b'') = ''ba''}}. An element ''a'' in ''S'' is '''left cancellative''' if and only if ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[injective]]. An element ''a'' is '''right cancellative''' if and only if ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is injective.

==Examples==

#Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a cancellative semigroup.
#The set of [[natural number|positive integer]]s under addition is a cancellative semigroup.
#The set of nonnegative integers under addition is a cancellative [[monoid]].
#The set of positive integers under multiplication is a cancellative monoid.
#A [[left zero semigroup]] is right cancellative but not left cancellative, unless it is trivial.
#A [[right zero semigroup]] is left cancellative but not right cancellative, unless it is trivial.
#A [[null semigroup]] with more than one element is neither left cancellative nor right cancellative. In such a semigroup there is no element which is either left cancellative or right cancellative.
#Let ''S'' be the semigroup of real square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of order ''n'' under [[matrix multiplication]]. Let ''a'' be any element in ''S''. If ''a'' is [[nonsingular]] then ''a'' is both left cancellative and right cancellative. If ''a'' is singular then ''a'' is neither left cancellative nor right cancellative.

==Finite cancellative semigroups==

It is an elementary result in [[group theory]] that a finite cancellative semigroup is a group. Let ''S'' be a finite cancellative semigroup. Cancellativity and finiteness taken together imply that {{nowrap|1=''Sa'' = ''aS'' = ''S''}} for all ''a'' in ''S''. So given an element ''a'' in ''S'', there is an element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on ''a'',   in ''S'' such that {{nowrap|1=''ae''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''}}. Cancellativity now further implies that this ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is independent of ''a'' and that {{nowrap|1=''xe''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''S''.  Thus ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the identity element of ''S'' which may from now on be denoted by ''e''.   Using the  property {{nowrap|1=''Sa'' = ''S''}}   one now sees that there is ''b'' in ''S'' such that {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = ''e''}}.  Cancellativity can be invoked to show that ''ab'' = ''e'' also, thereby establishing that every element ''a'' in ''S'' has an inverse in ''S''. Thus ''S'' must necessarily be a group.

Furthermore, every cancellative [[epigroup]] is also a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embeddability in groups==

A [[commutative]] semigroup can be embedded in a group (i.e., is isomorphic to a subset of a group) if and only if it is cancellative. The procedure for doing this is similar to that of embedding an integral domain in a field, {{harv|Clifford|Preston|1961|p=34}}. See also [[Grothendieck group]], the universal mapping from a commutative semigroup to [[abelian group]]s that is an embedding if the semigroup is cancellative.

For the embeddability of noncommutative semigroups in groups, cancellativity is obviously a necessary condition. However, it is not sufficient: there are (noncommutative and infinite) cancellative semigroups that cannot be embedded in a group.&lt;ref&gt;A. Malcev, ''On the Immersion of an Algebraic Ring into a Field'', 
Mathematische Annalen
1937, Volume 113, Issue 1, pp 686-691&lt;/ref&gt;
To obtain a sufficient (but not necessary) condition, it may be observed that the proof of the result that a finite cancellative semigroup ''S'' is a group critically depended on the fact that ''Sa'' = ''S'' for all ''a'' in ''S''. The paper {{harv|Dubreil|1941}} generalized this idea and introduced the concept of a ''right reversible'' semigroup. A semigroup ''S'' is said to be ''right reversible'' if any two principal ideals of ''S'' intersect, that is, ''Sa'' ∩ ''Sb'' ≠  Ø  for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S''. The sufficient condition for the embeddability of semigroups in groups can now be stated as follows: ([[Ore condition|Ore's Theorem]]) Any right reversible cancellative semigroup can be embedded in a group, {{harv|Clifford|Preston|1961|p=35}}.

The first set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the embeddability of a semigroup in a group were given in {{harv|Malcev|1939}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Paul M Cohn |title=Universal Algebra |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |year=1981 |pages=268–269 |isbn=90-277-1254-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though theoretically important, the conditions are countably infinite in number and no finite subset will suffice, as shown in {{harv|Malcev|1940}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=John Rhodes |date=April 1970 |title=Book Review of 'The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol I &amp; II' by A H Clifford &amp; G B Preston |journal=Bulletin of the AMS |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |postscript=.}} [http://www.ams.org/bull/1970-76-04/S0002-9904-1970-12504-6/S0002-9904-1970-12504-6.pdf] (Accessed on 11 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; A different (but also countably infinite) set of necessary and sufficient conditions were given in {{harv|Lambek|1951}}, where it was shown that a semigroup can be embedded in a group if and only if it is cancellative and satisfies a so-called "polyhedral condition". The two embedding theorems by Malcev and Lambek were later compared in {{harv|Bush|1963}}.

'''Christian persecution complex''' is a belief, attitude or world view that Christian values and Christians are being oppressed by social groups and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoover|2015|p=23}}: According to  Hoover Linda "''...Castelli (2007) believed the reluctance to
self-disclose could be the “Christian persecution complex” (p. 156), an ideology that Christian values are unfavorably targeted by social and governmental opposition...''"&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is thought to be held by certain American Protestant Churches&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christians-in-the-us-are-not-persecuted-an-intersectional_us_59161b18e4b02d6199b2ef05 "Christians In The U.S. Are Not Persecuted", Huffpost, 05/12/2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian- or Bible-based cults.

==Early Christianity==

According to [[Candida Moss]]{{efn|Candida Moss is the Edward Cadbury Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/moss-candida.aspx|title=Professor Candida Moss|website=birmingham.ac.uk|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the Christian "persecution complex" appeared during the era of [[early Christianity]] due to internal Christian identity politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janes|Houen|2014|p=24}}: Indeed, a recent study by Candida Moss, ''The Myth of Persecution]]'' has suggested that Christian "persecution complex" was the result of internal christian identity politics''&lt;/ref&gt; Moss suggested that the idea of persecution is cardinal to the worldview of Christianity, noting that it creates the impression that Christians are a minority that are facing a war - even though they are numerically superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Årsheim|2016|p=7}}: Candida Moss has argued that the notion of persecution is all but essential to Christianity as a worldview, tracing the discursive construction of martyrdom from Antiquity and up to the present, pointing to its constitutive role for the self-understanding of Christians as embattled minorities – even while numerically superior&lt;/ref&gt; This perception is grounded in the [[Manichaeism|manichaeistic]] belief that the world is divided into two factions, one led by [[God]] and the other by [[Satan]]. In this view there can be no compromise between the two, and even attempting to dialogue or engage with "the other" is seen as a form of collaboration with it. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moss|2013|p=254}}: The myth of persecution is theologically grounded in the division of the world into two parties, one backed by [[God]] and the other by [[Satan]]...And everyone knows you cannot reason with devil. Even when devil is not explicity invoked, the rhetoric of persecution suggests that the persecutors are irrational and immoral and the persecuted are innocent and brave. In a world filled with persecution, efforts to negotiate or even reason with one's persecutors are interpreted as collaboration and moral compromise. We should not attempt to understand the other party, because to do so would be to cede ground to injustice and hatred&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Cavill{{efn| Paul Cavill is a Lecturer in Early Modern British History at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/pc504@cam.ac.uk|title=Dr Paul Cavill
|website=hist.cam.ac.uk|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} claims that the [[New Testament|New Testament]] teaches that persecutions are inherent to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavill|2013|p=81}}: The early christian persecution complex is often underemphasised, but is important. The New Testament teaches that persecution is the inevidable by-product of effective Christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th and 21st centuries ==
Many find it difficult to define the origin of the Christian persecution complex. According to Elizabeth Castelli,{{efn| Elizabeth A. Castelli is the Ann Whitney Olin Professor of Religion at [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://barnard.edu/profiles/elizabeth-castelli|title=Elizabeth Castelli Barnard College|website=barnard.edu|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castelli|2008}}: "There is no precise origin point for the contemporary discursive project of the Christian persecution complex"&lt;/ref&gt; some set the starting point in the middle of the 20th century, following a series of court rulings that declared public places to be out of bounds for religious activity (e.g. [[School prayer|morning prayer in schools]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castelli|2007|p=157}}:For those who have upped the ante by recently deciding to characterize the circumstances of Christians in the United States as the “war on Christians, the historical turning point tends to reside in the mid-twentieth century, when a series of federal and Supreme court decisions declared certain public institutions off-limits for sectarian religious activity (e.g., prayer and Bible reading in public schools). For the Christian activists who view these court decisions as opening skirmishes in the war on Christians, the decisions and the “activist judges” who promulgated them effectively—and dangerously— banned God from the public square.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it{{clarify|reason=what?|date=December 2018}} became apparent in the United States in the 1990s with the adoption of the [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] as the official foreign policy. A few years later, the [[September 11 attacks]] boosted its development. This complex "mobilizes the language of [[religious persecution]] to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of anti-religious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the [[martyr]] as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Årsheim|2016|p=7}}:According to Elizabeth Castelli, this engagement can be ascribed to a ‘Christian persecution complex’ that gathered pace throughout the 1990s, with the adoption of the US International Religious Freedom Act in 1998 as a significant milestone, and with the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as an accelerating factor (Castelli 2007: 173). This complex ''“…mobilizes the language of [[religious persecution]] to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of antireligious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority.”'' (Castelli 2007: 154).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hostility towards Christians ==
American sociologist [[George Yancey]] finds that the perception of some Christians that they are persecuted is not unfounded, and that anti-Christian hostility is real. Yancey, in a 2017 publication, suggests that levels of anti-Christian hostility have not significantly risen over the past few decades (in the United States), however those with this hostility have gained economic power and thus "... Christian activists may be correct in that they now pay a stiffer price for that animosity.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13644-017-0303-8 George Yancey, "Has Society Grown More Hostile Towards Conservative Christians? Evidence from ANES Surveys", ''Review of Religious Research'', pp 1–24, Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/october/anti-christian-bias-richer-evangelicals-persecution-complex.html KATE SHELLNUTT,  "Study: Anti-Christian Bias Hasn’t Grown. It’s Just Gotten Richer", ''Christianity Today'', OCTOBER 10, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian journalists point out that "American Christians have a [[persecution complex]]" while noting that the persecution of Christians is real in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.religionnews.com/2013/04/03/in-the-middle-east-not-america-christians-are-actually-persecuted/  Jonathan Merritt, "In the Middle East, not America, Christians are actually persecuted", Religion News Service, April 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], [[economics]], and [[political science]], the '''common good''' (also [[commonwealth]], '''common weal''' or '''general welfare''') refers to either what is shared and beneficial for all or most members of a given [[community]], or alternatively, what is achieved by citizenship, collective action, and active participation in the realm of politics and public service. The concept of the common good differs significantly among [[List of philosophies|philosophical doctrines]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Simon|title=Common good|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/common-good|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early conceptions of the common good were set out by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle's philosophy remains in common usage today, referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the "good proper to, and attainable only by, the community, yet individually shared by its members."&lt;ref name="Dupré"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupré|first1=Louis|title=The Common Good and the Open Society|journal=The Review of Politics|date=5 August 2009|volume=55|issue=04|pages=687|doi=10.1017/S0034670500018052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists, moral philosophers, and public economists, including [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[James Madison]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Rawls]], and many other thinkers. In contemporary economic theory, ''a'' common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable, while ''the'' common good, by contrast, arises in the subfield of [[welfare economics]] and refers to the outcome of a [[social welfare function]]. Such a social welfare function, in turn, would be rooted in a moral theory of the good (such as [[utilitarianism]]). [[Social choice theory]] aims to understand processes by which the common good may or may not be realized in societies through the study of [[Group decision-making|collective decision rules]]. And [[public choice theory]] applies [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests affect political activities and outcomes.

==Definition==
The term "common good" has been used in many disparate ways and escapes a single definition. Most philosophical conceptions of the common good fall into one of two families: substantive and procedural. According to substantive conceptions, the common good is that which is shared by and beneficial to all or most members of a given community: particular substantive conceptions will specify precisely what factors or values are beneficial and shared. According to procedural formulations, by contrast, the common good consists of the outcome that is achieved through collective participation in the formation of a shared will.

==In the history of moral and political thought==
=== Historical overview ===
Under one name or another, the common good has been a recurring theme throughout the history of political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diggs|first=B. J.|date=1973-01-01|title=The Common Good as Reason for Political Action|jstor=2379966|journal=Ethics|volume=83|issue=4|pages=283|doi=10.1086/291887}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one contemporary scholar observes, [[Aristotle]] used the idea of "the common interest" (''to koinei sympheron,'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) as the basis for his distinction between "right" constitutions, which are in the common interest, and "wrong" constitutions, which are in the interest of rulers;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics|last=Aristotle|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=3, 6–7, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] held "the common good" (''bonum commune,'' in [[Latin]]) to be the end of law and government;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1, 2. 90. 2 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] declared that "the peace, safety, and public good of the people" are the ends of political society, and further argued that "the well being of the people shall be the supreme law";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Treatise of Government|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=131, 158.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] contended that "social conventions" are adopted and given moral support in virtue of the fact that they serve the "public" or "common" interest;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teatise 3, 2. 2.|last=Hume|first=David|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]] wrote of the "public," "common," or "general" good as closely tied with justice and declared that justice is the end of government and civil society;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Federalist|last=Publius|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=10, 51.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] understood "the common good" (''le bien commun'', in [[French language|French]]) to be the object of a society's [[general will]] and the highest end pursued by government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Contract|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diggs|first=B. J.|date=1973-01-01|title=The Common Good as Reason for Political Action|jstor=2379966|journal=Ethics|volume=83|issue=4|pages=283–284|doi=10.1086/291887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though these thinkers differed significantly in their views of what the common good consists in, as well as over what the state should do to promote it, they nonetheless agreed that the common good is the end of government, that it is a good of all the citizens, and that no government should become the "perverted servant of special interests,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; whether these special interests be understood as Aristotle's "interest of the rulers," Locke's "private good," Hume's and Madison's "interested factions," or Rousseau's "particular wills."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Ancient Greeks===
Though the phrase "common good" does not appear in texts of [[Plato]], the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher indicates repeatedly that a particular common goal exists in politics and society.&lt;ref name="Simm"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simm|first1=Kadri|title=The Concepts of Common Good and Public Interest: From Plato to Biobanking|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|date=16 August 2011|volume=20|issue=04|page=555|doi=10.1017/S0963180111000296}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, the best political order is the one which best promotes social harmony and an environment of cooperation and friendship among different social groups, each benefiting from and adding to the common good. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato's character [[Socrates]] contends that the greatest social good is the "cohesion and unity" that "result[s] from the common feelings of pleasure and pain which you get when all members of a society are glad or sorry for the same successes and failures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|title=Republic|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|pages=462a–b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's student [[Aristotle]], considered by many to be the father of the idea of a common good, uses the concept of "the common interest" (''to koinei sympheron,'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) as the basis for his distinction between "right" constitutions, which are in the common interest, and "wrong" constitutions, which are in the interest of rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diggs|first=B. J.|date=1973-01-01|title=The Common Good as Reason for Political Action|jstor=2379966|journal=Ethics|volume=83|issue=4|pages=283–293|doi=10.1086/291887}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aristotle, the common good is constituted in the good of individuals. Individual good, in turn, consists in human flourishing—the fulfillment of the human's purpose—which is the right and natural thing for humans to do. On this teleological view, the good stems from objective facts about human life and purpose.&lt;ref name="Simm" /&gt; Aristotle is clear that there is greater value in the common good than in the individual good, noting in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' that "''even if the end is the same for a single man and for a state, that of the state seems at all events something greater and more complete; … though it is worthwhile to attain the end merely for one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for a nation or for city-states''."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics [Internet]. The Internet Classics Archive; available at http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html. I.2.1094b7–10 (last accessed 30 Jan 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; When Aristotle discusses the types of political regime in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', he speaks of [[monarchy]] (rule by one man for the common good), [[aristocracy]] (rule by a few for the common good), and polity (rule by the many for the common good).&lt;ref name="Clayton"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Edward|title=Aristotle: Politics|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet by "common good" here, Aristotle means specifically the common good of the citizens, and not necessarily the good of non-citizen residents of the city, such as women, slaves, and manual laborers, who reside in the city for the good of the citizens.&lt;ref name="Clayton" /&gt;

According to one common contemporary usage, rooted in Aristotle's philosophy, common good refers to "a good proper to, and attainable only by, the community, yet individually shared by its members."&lt;ref name="Dupré"/&gt;

===Renaissance Florence===
During the 15th and 16th centuries, the common good was one of several important themes of political thought in Renaissance Florence. The thought goes back to Thomas Aquinas theory of common good being virulent in whole premodern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantin Langmaier, Dem Land Ere und Nucz, Frid und Gemach: Das Land als Ehr-, Nutz- und Friedensgemeinschaft: Ein Beitrag zur Diskussion um den Gemeinen Nutzen. In: . In: Vierteljahrschrift für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Band 103, 2016, S. 178–200.]&lt;/ref&gt; In a later work, Niccolo Machiavelli speaks of the ''bene commune'' (common good) or ''comune utilità'' (common utility), which refers to the general well-being of a community as a whole.&lt;ref name="Waldemar"/&gt; In key passages of the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', he indicates that "the common good (''comune utilità'') . . . is drawn from a free way of life (''vivere libero'')" but is not identical with it.&lt;ref name="Waldemar"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldemar | first1 = Hanasz | year = 2010 | title = The common good in Machiavelli | url = | journal = History of Political Thought | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 57–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses,'' I 16, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the ''Discourses,'' freedom, safety and dignity are explicitly stated to be elements of the common good and some form of property and family life are also implied.&lt;ref name="Waldemar"/&gt; Furthermore, the common good brought by freedom includes wealth, economic prosperity, security, enjoyment and good life.&lt;ref name="Waldemar"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that though Machiavelli speaks of an instrumental relationship between freedom and common good, the general well-being is not precisely identical with political freedom: elsewhere in the ''Discourses,'' Machiavelli argues that an impressive level of common good can be achieved by sufficiently good autocratic rulers.&lt;ref name="Waldemar"/&gt; Nevertheless, he insists that bringing common benefit to everyone requires intrepid courage by leaders, and the most unique people in this respect are the founders of ancient republics and kingdoms (such as [[Moses]], Lycurgus, [[Solon]] and Romulus) who governed themselves 'according to the laws ordered by them, placing the common utility (''commune utilità'') before their own advantage'.&lt;ref name="Waldemar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses,'' I 2, p. 132;''Discourses,'' I 9, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
In [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] ''[[The Social Contract]]'', composed in the mid-18th century, Rousseau argues that society can function only to the extent that individuals have interests in common, and that the end goal of any state is the realization of the common good. He further posits that the common good can be identified and implemented only by heeding the general will of a political community, specifically as expressed by that community's sovereign. Rousseau maintains that the general will always tends toward the common good, though he concedes that democratic deliberations of individuals will not always express the general will. Furthermore, Rousseau distinguished between the general will and the will of all, stressing that while the latter is simply the sum total of each individual's desires, the former is the "one will which is directed towards their common preservation and general well-being."&lt;ref&gt;''Of the Social Contract'', Book IV, Chapter 1, Paragraphs 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt; Political authority, to Rousseau, should be understood as legitimate only if it exists according to the general will and toward the common good. The pursuit of the common good, then, enables the state to act as a moral community.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

===Adam Smith===
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Individual ambition serves the common good."
—Adam Smith&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 18th-century Scottish moral philosopher and political economist [[Adam Smith]] famously argues in his [[Wealth of Nations]] what has become known as the [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics|First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics]]: that the [[invisible hand]] of [[Competition (economics)|market competition]] automatically transforms individual self-interest into the common good.&lt;ref name="fee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/articles/it-all-started-with-adam/|title=It All Started with Adam|author=Mark Skousen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's thesis is that in a "system of natural liberty," an economic system that allows individuals to pursue their own self-interest under conditions of free competition and common law, would result in a self-regulating and highly prosperous economy, generating the most welfare for the most number.&lt;ref name="fee"/&gt; Thus, he argues, eliminating restrictions on prices, labor, and trade will result in advancing the common good through "universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people," via lower prices, higher wages, better products, and so on.&lt;ref name="fee"/&gt;

===John Rawls's Theory of Justice===
[[John Rawls]] defines the common good as "certain general conditions that are...equally to everyone's advantage". In his [[A Theory of Justice|Theory of Justice]], Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality, applied to the basic structure of a well-ordered society, which will specify exactly such general conditions. Starting with an artificial device he calls the [[original position]], Rawls defends two particular principles of justice by arguing that these are the positions reasonable persons would choose were they to choose principles from behind a veil of ignorance. Such a "veil" is one that essentially blinds people to all facts about themselves so they cannot tailor principles to their own advantage. According to Rawls, ignorance of these details about oneself will lead to principles that are fair to all. If an individual does not know how he will end up in his own conceived society, he is likely not going to privilege any one class of people, but rather develop a scheme of justice that treats all fairly. In particular, Rawls claims that those in the original position would all adopt a [[Minimax#Maximin_in_philosophy|"maximin"]] strategy which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off individual or group. In this sense, Rawls's understanding of the common good is intimately tied with the well-being of the least advantaged. 
Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two governing principles, which would then regulate the assignment of rights and duties and regulate the distribution of social and economic advantages across society. The [[John Rawls|First Principle of Justice]] states that ""First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others".&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, p.53 revised edition; p.60 old 1971 first edition&lt;/ref&gt; The [[John Rawls|Second Principle of Justice]] provides that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged such that "(a) they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle" (''the difference principle''); and "(b) offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of 'fair equality of opportunity'".&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;302; revised edition, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In non-Western moral and political thought ===
The idea of a common good plays a role in [[Confucianism|Confucian political philosophy]], which on most interpretations stresses the importance of the subordinination of individual interests to group or collective interests,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Confucian Political Philosophy - Oxford Handbooks|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238804-e-48|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238804-e-48}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the very least, the mutual dependence between the flourishing of the individual and the flourishing of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Irene (2009) (trans.). ''Mencius''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islamic political thought]], many modern thinkers have identified conceptions of the common good while endeavoring to ascertain the fundamental or universal principles underlying divine [[Sharia|shari‘a law]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bulliet, R. &amp; Bowering, G. &amp; Cook, D. &amp; Crone, P. &amp; Kadi, W. &amp; Euben, R. L..''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These fundamentals or universal principles have been largely identified with the "objectives" of the shari‘a (''maqāṣid al-sharī‘a''), including concepts of the common good or public interest (''maṣlaḥa ‘āmma'', in modern terminology).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A notion of the common good arises in contemporary Islamic discussions of the distinction between the fixed and the flexible (''al-thābit wa-l-mutaghayyir''), especially as it relates to modern Islamic conceptions of tolerance, equality, and citizenship: according to some, for instance, universal principles carry greater weight than specific injunctions of the [[Quran|Qur’an]], and in case of conflict, can even supersede or suspend explicit textual injunctions (''naṣṣ'') if this serves the common good.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==In political economic theory==
In economics, the terms “[[public good]]” and “[[common good (economics)|common good]]” have technical definitions. A public good is a good that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. A common good is simply non-excludable. A simple typology illustrates the differences between various kinds of goods:

{{Good (economics)}}

The field of [[welfare economics]] studies social well-being. The approach begins with the specification of a social welfare function. The choice of a social welfare function is rooted in an ethical theory. A utilitarian social welfare function weights the well-being of each individual equally, while a Rawlsian social welfare function only considers the welfare of the least well-off individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roemer|first1=John E.|title=Theories of Distributive Justice|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economic theory provides two conflicting lenses for thinking about the genesis of the common good, two distinct sets of microfoundations. On one view, the common good arises due to social gains from cooperation. Such a view might appeal to the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner’s dilemma]] to illustrate how cooperation can result in superior welfare outcomes. Moreover, a cooperative equilibrium is stable in an iterated Prisoner’s dilemma. Under these conditions, an individual does best by pursuing the course of action that is also optimal for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Axelrod|first1=Robert|title=The Evolution of Cooperation|date=1984|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, economic theory typically points to social gains from competition as a rationale for the use of markets. Thus, Smith described the “invisible hand,” whereby the mechanism of the market converts individuals’ self-interested activity into gains for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Adam|title=The Wealth of Nations|date=1776}}&lt;/ref&gt; This insight is formalized in the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. However, economic theory also points to market failures, including the underprovision of public goods by markets and the failure of self-interested individuals to internalize [[externalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pigou|first1=Arthur|title=Economics of Welfare|date=1920|publisher=Macmillan and Co|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these factors, purely self-interested behaviour often detracts from the common good.

===Social choice theory===
[[Social choice theory]] studies collective decision rules. [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's Impossibility Theorem]], an important result in social choice theory, states that no aggregative mechanism of collective choice (restricted to ordinal inputs) can consistently transform individual preferences into a collective preference-ordering, across the universal domain of possible preference profiles, while also satisfying a set of minimal normative criteria of rationality and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arrow|first1=Kenneth|title=Social Choice and Individual Values|date=1951|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem]] further demonstrates that non-dictatorial voting systems are inevitably subject to strategic manipulation of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibbard|first1=Allan|title=Manipulation of voting schemes: A general result|journal=Econometrica|date=1973|volume=41|issue=4|pages=587–601|doi=10.2307/1914083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Satterthwaite|first1=Mark Allen|title=Strategy-proofness and Arrow's conditions: Existence and correspondence theorems for voting procedures and social welfare functions|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|date=1975|volume=10|issue=2|pages=187–217|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(75)90050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William H. Riker]] articulates the standard public choice interpretation of social choice theory, arguing that Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem “forces us to doubt that the content of 'social welfare' or the 'public interest' can ever be discovered by amalgamating individual value judgments. It even leads us to suspect that no such thing as the 'public interest' exists, aside from the subjective (and hence dubious) claims of self-proclaimed saviors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riker|first1=William|title=Liberalism Against Populism: A Confrontation Between the Theory of Democracy and the Theory of Social Choice |date=1982|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Long Grove, IL|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Riker defends a “liberal” conception of democracy, which centers on the role of constitutional checks on government. Public choice theorists have tended to share this approach. Buchanan and Tullock pursued this program in developing the field of "constitutional political economy" in their book ''[[The Calculus of Consent]]''.

More recent work in social choice theory, however, has demonstrated that Arrow's impossibility result can be obviated at little or no normative cost. Amartya Sen, for instance, argues that a range of social choice mechanisms emerge unscathed given certain reasonable restrictions on the domain of admissible preference profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=A Possibility Theorem on Majority Decisions|journal=Econometrica|date=1966|volume=34|pages=491–499|doi=10.2307/1909947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, requiring that preferences are single-peaked on a single dimension ensures a [[Condorcet winner]]. Moreover, many of Riker's empirical claims have been refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackie|first1=Gerry|title=Democracy Defended|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public choice theory===
[[Public choice theory]] (sometimes called "positive political theory") applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests inform political activities. Whereas welfare economics, in line with classical political economy, typically assumes a public-interest perspective on policymaking, public choice analysis adopts a private-interest perspective in order to identify how the objectives of policymakers affect policy outcomes. Public choice analysis thus diagnoses deviations from the common good resulting from activities such as [[rent-seeking]]. In ''The Logic of Collective Action'', [[Mancur Olson]] argues that public goods will tend to be underprovided due to individuals' incentives to [[free-riding|free-ride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=Mancur|title=The Logic of Collective Action|date=1965|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Downs]] provided an application of this logic to the theory of voting, identifying the [[paradox of voting]] whereby rational individuals prefer to abstain from voting, because the marginal cost exceeds the private marginal benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Downs|first1=Anthony|title=An Economic Theory of Democracy|date=1957|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downs argues further that voters generally prefer to remain uninformed due to "rational ignorance."

Public choice scholarship can have more constructive applications. For instance, [[Elinor Ostrom]]'s study of schemes for the regulation of common property resources resulted in the discovery of mechanisms for overcoming the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ostrom|first1=Elinor|title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In democratic theory==
In [[deliberative democracy]], the common good is taken to be a regulative ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elster|first1=Jon|chapter=The Market and the Forum: Three Varieties of Political Theory|title=Philosophy and Democracy|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, participants in democratic deliberation aim at the realization of the common good. This feature distinguishes deliberative democracy from aggregative conceptions of democracy, which focus solely on the aggregation of preferences. In contrast to aggregative conceptions, deliberative democracy emphasizes the processes by which agents justify political claims on the basis of judgments about the common good. [[Epistemic democracy]], a leading contemporary approach to deliberative democracy, advances a [[cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivist]] account of the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landemore|first1=Hélène|title=Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Catholic social teaching ==
{{Main|Catholic social teaching}}
One of the earliest references in Christian literature to the concept of the common good is found in the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'': "Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into yourselves, as if you were already [fully] justified, but gather instead to seek together the common good."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/barnabas.html Epistle of Barnabas]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', 4, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is strongly present in [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''magnum opus'' ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''. Book XIX of this, the main locus of Augustine's normative political thought, is focused on the question, 'Is the good life social?' In other words, 'Is human wellbeing found in the good of the whole society, the common good?' Chapters 5-17 of Book XIX address this question. Augustine's emphatic answer is yes (see start of chap. 5).

Augustine's understanding was taken up and, under the influence of [[Aristotle]], developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas's conception of the common good became standard in Roman Catholic moral theology.

Against that background, the common good became a central concept in the modern tradition of [[Catholic social teaching]], beginning with the foundational document, ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', a [[papal encyclical]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]], issued in 1891. This addressed the crisis of the conditions of industrial workers in Europe and argued for a position different from both [[laissez-faire capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. In this letter, Pope Leo guarantees the right to [[private property]] while insisting on the role of collective bargaining to establish a [[living wage]].

Contemporary Catholic social teaching on the common good is summarised in the 2004 ''Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church'', chapter 4, part II.&lt;ref&gt;Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace, [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_en.html Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801220128/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_en.html |date=August 1, 2016 }} (2004), Chapter 4, part II&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting the [[Second Vatican Council]] document, ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' (1965), this says, "According to its primary and broadly accepted sense, ''the common good'' indicates 'the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfilment more fully and more easily'" (#164, quoting ''Gaudium et spes'', #26; italics original).

The ''Compendium'' later gives statements that communicate what can be seen as a partly different sense of the concept - as not only "social conditions" that enable persons to reach fulfilment, but as the ''end'' of ''goal'' of human life. "''[T]he common good [is] the good of all people and of the whole person… The human person cannot find fulfilment in himself, that is, apart from the fact that he exists "with" others and "for" others''" (#165; italics original). "The goal of life in society is in fact the historically attainable common good" (#168).

The Roman Catholic [[International Theological Commission]] drew attention to these two partly different understandings of the common good in its 2009 publication, ''In Search of a Universal Ethic: A New Look at the Natural Law''. It referred to them as "two levels" of the common good.&lt;ref&gt;International Theological Commission, ''[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20090520_legge-naturale_en.html ''In Search of a Universal Ethic: A New Look at the Natural Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311183453/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20090520_legge-naturale_en.html |date=March 11, 2013 }}'' (2009), #85&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relevant document is ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]'', a papal encyclical by [[Pope John Paul II]], issued in 1993 to combat the relaxation of moral norms and the [[political corruption]] (see Paragraph 98) that affects millions of persons. In this letter, Pope John Paul describes the characteristics and virtues that political [[leadership]] should require, which are [[truthfullness]], honesty, fairness, [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[solidarity]] (as described in paragraph 98 to 100), given that truth extends from honesty, good faith, and sincerity in general, to agreement with fact or reality in particular.

==In contemporary politics==
=== United States ===
In contemporary [[Politics of the United States|American politics]], language of the common good (or public wealth) is sometimes adopted by political actors on the [[progressivism|progressive]] left to describe their values. Jonathan Dolhenty argues that one should distinguish in American politics between the common good, which may "be shared wholly by each individual in the family without its becoming a private good for any individual family member", and the collective good, which, "though possessed by all as a group, is not really participated in by the members of a group. It is actually divided up into several private goods when apportioned to the different individual members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/commongood.htm|title=Radical Academy|publisher=Radicalacademy.com|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717015332/http://www.radicalacademy.com/commongood.htm|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First described by [[Michael Tomasky]] in ''[[The American Prospect]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=11424] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615161620/http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=11424 |date=June 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Halpin at the [[Center for American Progress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2006/06/b1728259.html |title=Reclaiming the Common Good &amp;#124; Center for American Progress |publisher=Americanprogress.org |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American political understanding of the common good has grown in recent times. The liberal magazine ''[[The Nation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060717/kvh |title=July 17, 2006 |publisher=The Nation |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rockridge Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/thinkingpoints] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611211308/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/thinkingpoints |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, have identified the common good as a salient political message for progressive candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://straighttalk.ourfuture.org/Straight-Talk-2006.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, non-partisan advocacy groups like [[The Common Good (non-profit)|Common Good]] are championing political reform efforts to support the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commongood-forum.org |title=Common Good Forum |publisher=Commongood-forum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213556/http://www.commongood-forum.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- == Recognizing education and knowledge as global common goods ==
[[Knowledge]] is the [[Common heritage of mankind|common heritage of humanity]]. Knowledge, like [[education]], must therefore be considered a global common good. If knowledge is considered only a global [[public good]], access to it is often restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Public Goods. International Cooperation in the 21st Century|last=Kaul|first=I.|last2=le Goulven|first2=K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current trend towards the privatization of knowledge production, reproduction and dissemination is a cause for serious concern. The knowledge commons is gradually being privatized through [[law]] and, more specifically, through the [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property Rights]] regime, which dominates knowledge production. The progressive privatization of the production and reproduction of knowledge is evident in the work of universities, [[think tank]]s, consultancy  firms and publishing. As a result, much of the knowledge considered to be a public good, and which belongs to the knowledge commons, is actually being privatized. This is disturbing, especially when it comes to the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Medicine|medicinal]] knowledge of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]] that is being appropriated by global [[corporation]]s. Some resistance to this trend is emerging among indigenous peoples. It is also producing counter movements of sharing in the digital world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Given the central concern for [[sustainable development]] in an increasingly interdependent world, education and knowledge should thus be considered global common goods. This means that the creation of knowledge, its control, acquisition, validation, and use, are common to all people as a collective social endeavour.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychiatry]], '''confabulation''' (verb: '''confabulate''') is a [[memory error]] defined as the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without the conscious intention to deceive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fotopoulou A. |author2=Conway M.

== Description ==

Confabulation is distinguished from [[Lie|lying]] as there is no intent to deceive and the person is unaware the information is false.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch"&gt;Moscovitch M. 1995. "Confabulation". In (Eds. Schacter D.L., Coyle J.T., Fischbach G.D., Mesulum M.M. &amp; Sullivan L.G.), ''Memory Distortion''. pp. 226–51. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can also seem to be coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch" /&gt;

Most known cases of confabulation are symptomatic of brain damage or dementias, such as [[aneurysm]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or [[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]] (a common manifestation of [[thiamine]] deficiency caused by [[alcoholism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23887463 | volume=113 | issue=6 Pt 2 | title=[Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis: clinical-pathophysiological correlation, diagnostics and treatment] | year=2013 | journal=Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova | pages=20–26 | author = Sivolap IuP Damulin IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally confabulation often occurs in people who are suffering from anticholinergic [[toxidrome]] when interrogated about bizarre or irrational behaviour.

Confabulated memories of all types most often occur in [[autobiographical memory]] and are indicative of a complicated and intricate process that can be led astray at any point during [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Storage (memory)|storage]], or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] of a memory.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; This type of confabulation is commonly seen in [[Korsakoff's syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Korsakoff Syndrome: Clinical Aspects, Psychology and Treatment|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=44|issue=2|pages=148–54|doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn118|url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/148.full|pmid=19151162 |year=2009|author1=Kopelman |first1=M. D. |last2=Thomson |first2=A. D. |last3=Guerrini |first3=I |last4=Marshall |first4=E. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinctions ===
Two types of confabulation are often distinguished:
* '''Provoked''' (momentary, or secondary) confabulations represent a normal response to a faulty memory, are common in both amnesia and dementia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and can become apparent during memory tests.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt;
* '''Spontaneous''' (or primary) confabulations do not occur in response to a cue&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; and seem to be involuntary.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilboa|first=A.|title=Mechanisms of spontaneous confabulations: a strategic retrieval account|journal=Brain|date=13 April 2006|volume=129|issue=6|pages=1399–1414|doi=10.1093/brain/awl093|pmid=16638795}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are relatively rare, more common in cases of dementia, and may result from the interaction between frontal lobe pathology and organic amnesia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3694207|pmc=1032561|year=1987|author1=Kopelman|first1=M. D.|title=Two types of confabulation|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|volume=50|issue=11|pages=1482–87|doi=10.1136/jnnp.50.11.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinction is that between:&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt;
* '''Verbal''' confabulations, spoken false memories are more common, and 
* '''Behavioral''' confabulations, occur when an individual acts on their false memories.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Confabulation is associated with several characteristics:
# Typically verbal statements but can also be non-verbal gestures or actions.
# Can include autobiographical and non-personal information, such as historical facts, fairy-tales, or other aspects of semantic memory.
# The account can be fantastic or coherent.
# Both the premise and the details of the account can be false.
# The account is usually drawn from the patient's memory of actual experiences, including past and current thoughts.
# The patient is unaware of the accounts' distortions or inappropriateness, and is not concerned when errors are pointed out.
# There is no hidden motivation behind the account.
# The patient's personality structure may play a role in his/her readiness to confabulate.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch" /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of confabulation range in emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G.E. (1998) Confabulation: a conceptual history. ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'' 7: 225-241. &lt;/ref&gt; Some theories propose that confabulations represent a way for memory-disabled people to maintain their self-identity.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metcalf|first=Kasey |author2=Langdon, Robyn |author3=Coltheart, Max|title=Models of confabulation: A critical review and a new framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 February 2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=23–47|doi=10.1080/02643290600694901|pmid=18416482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories use neurocognitive links to explain the process of confabulation.&lt;ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glowinski|first=Remy |author2=Payman, Vahid |author3=Frencham, Kate|title=Confabulation: a spontaneous and fantastic review|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|date=2008|volume=42|issue=11|pages=932–40|doi=10.1080/00048670802415335|pmid=18941957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other theories frame confabulation around the more familiar concept of delusion.&lt;ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=Varieties of confabulation and delusion|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=14–37|doi=10.1080/13546800902732830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers frame confabulation within the [[fuzzy-trace theory]].&lt;ref name="fuzzy trace theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|author2=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-Trace Theory and Children's False Memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=1 November 1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jecp.1998.2464|pmid=9843617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some researchers call for theories that rely less on neurocognitive explanations and more on [[epistemic]] accounts.&lt;ref name="faultless ignorance"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bortolotti|first=Lisa|author2=Cox, Rochelle E.|title='Faultless' ignorance: Strengths and limitations of epistemic definitions of confabulation|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1 December 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=952–65|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2009.08.011|pmid=19773185}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Neuropsychological theories===
The most popular theories of confabulation come from the field of neuropsychology or cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review"/&gt; Research suggests that confabulation is associated with dysfunction of cognitive processes that control the retrieval from long-term memory. Frontal lobe damage often disrupts this process, preventing the retrieval of information and the evaluation of its output.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511558313.020|chapter=Amnesia, autobiographical memory, and confabulation|title=Autobiographical Memory|pages=225–52|year=1986|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan|last2=Wilson|first2=Barbara|isbn=9780511558313|editor-last1= Rubin |editor-first1=David C.|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moscovitch M. |author2=Melo B. | year = 1997 | title = Strategic retrieval and the frontal lobes: evidence from confabulation and amnesia | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 1017–34 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(97)00028-6|pmid=9226662 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, researchers argue that confabulation is a disorder resulting from failed "reality monitoring/source monitoring" (i.e. deciding whether a memory is based on an actual event or whether it is imagined).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M.K. (1991). Reality monitoring: Evidence from confabulation in organic brain disease patients. In G.P. Prigatano &amp; D.L. Schacter (Eds.), Awareness of deficit after brain injury. pp. 176–97. New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Some neuropsychologists suggest that errors in retrieval of information from long-term memory that are made by normal subjects involve different components of control processes than errors made by confabulators.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8817460|year=1996|author1=Burgess|first1=P. W.|title=Confabulation and the control of recollection|journal=Memory|volume=4|issue=4|pages=359–411|last2=Shallice|first2=T|doi=10.1080/096582196388906}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] distinguished two subtypes of confabulation, one of which he called simple confabulation, caused partly by errors in the temporal ordering of real events. The other variety he called fantastic confabulation, which was bizarre and patently impossible statements not rooted in true memory. Simple confabulation may result from damage to memory systems in the medial temporal lobe. Fantastic confabulations reveal a dysfunction of the Supervisory System,&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D.A., &amp; Shallice, T. (1980). Attention to action. Willed and automatic control of behavior. University of California San Diego CHIP Report 99. Later published as: {{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0629-1_1|chapter=Attention to Action: Willed and Automatic Control of Behavior|title=Consciousness and Self-Regulation|pages=1–18|year=1986|last1=Norman|first1=Donald A.|last2=Shallice|first2=Tim|isbn=978-1-4757-0631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to be a function of the frontal cortex.

===Self-identity theory===
Some argue confabulations have a self-serving, emotional component in those with memory deficits that aids to maintain a coherent self-concept.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; In other words, people who confabulate are motivated to do so, because they have gaps in their memory that they want to fill in and cover up.

===Temporality theory===
Support for the temporality account suggests that confabulations occur when an individual is unable to place events properly in time.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; Thus, an individual might correctly state an action he/she performed, but say he/she did it yesterday, when he/she did it weeks ago. In the Memory, Consciousness, and Temporality Theory, confabulation occurs because of a deficit in temporal consciousness or awareness.&lt;ref name="temporal theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalla Barba|first=Gianfranco|author2=Boissé, Marie-Françoise|title=Temporal consciousness and confabulation: Is the medial temporal lobe "temporal"?|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=95–117|doi=10.1080/13546800902758017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring theory===
Along a similar notion are the theories of reality and source monitoring theories.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; In these theories, confabulation occurs when individuals incorrectly attribute memories as reality, or incorrectly attribute memories to a certain source. Thus, an individual might claim an imagined event happened in reality, or that a friend told him/her about an event he/she actually heard about on television.

===Strategic retrieval account theory===
Supporters of the strategic retrieval account suggest that confabulations occur when an individual cannot actively monitor a memory for truthfulness after its retrieval.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; An individual recalls a memory, but there is some deficit after recall that interferes with the person establishing its falseness.

===Executive control theory===
Still others propose that all types of false memories, including confabulation, fit into a general memory and executive function model.&lt;ref name="varieties of false memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=Varieties of False Memory|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 May 1999|volume=16|issue=3–5|pages=197–214|doi=10.1080/026432999380762}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a framework for confabulation was proposed that stated confabulation is the result of two things: Problems with executive control and problems with evaluation. In the executive control deficit, the incorrect memory is retrieved from the brain. In the evaluative deficit, the memory will be accepted as a truth due to an inability to distinguish a belief from an actual memory.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt;

===In the context of delusion theories===
Recent models of confabulation have attempted to build upon the link between [[delusion]] and confabulation.&lt;ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion"/&gt; More recently, a monitoring account for delusion, applied to confabulation, proposed both the inclusion of conscious and unconscious processing. The claim was that by encompassing the notion of both processes, spontaneous versus provoked confabulations could be better explained. In other words, there are two ways to confabulate. One is the unconscious, spontaneous way in which a memory goes through no logical, explanatory processing. The other is the conscious, provoked way in which a memory is recalled intentionally by the individual to explain something confusing or unusual.&lt;ref name="confabulation and delusion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha|author2=Coltheart, Max|title=Confabulation and delusion: A common monitoring framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=346–76|doi=10.1080/13546800903441902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], or FTT, is a concept more commonly applied to the explanation of judgement decisions.&lt;ref name="fuzzy trace theory" /&gt; According to this theory, memories are encoded generally (gist), as well as specifically (verbatim). Thus, a confabulation could result from recalling the incorrect verbatim memory or from being able to recall the gist portion, but not the verbatim portion, of a memory.

FTT uses a set of five principles to explain false-memory phenomena. Principle 1 suggests that subjects store verbatim information and gist information parallel to one another. Both forms of storage involve the surface content of an experience. Principle 2 shares factors of retrieval of gist and verbatim traces. Principle 3 is based on dual-opponent processes in [[false memory]]. Generally, gist retrieval supports false memory, while verbatim retrieval suppresses it. Developmental variability is the topic of Principle 4. As a child develops into an adult, there is obvious improvement in the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of both verbatim and gist memory. However, during late adulthood, there will be a decline in these abilities. Finally, Principle 5 explains that verbatim and gist processing cause vivid remembering. Fuzzy-trace Theory, governed by these 5 principles, has proved useful in explaining false memory and generating new predictions about it.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory"&gt;Brainerd, C. J., &amp; Reyna, V. F. (2002). Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory. Current Directions In Psychological Science (Wiley–Blackwell), 11(5), 164–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemic theory===
However, not all accounts are so embedded in the neurocognitive aspects of confabulation. Some attribute confabulation to epistemic accounts.&lt;ref name="faultless ignorance"/&gt; In 2009, theories underlying the causation and mechanisms for confabulation were criticized for their focus on neural processes, which are somewhat unclear, as well as their emphasis on the negativity of false remembering. Researchers proposed that an epistemic account of confabulation would be more encompassing of both the advantages and disadvantages of the process.

==Presentation==

===Associated neurological and psychological conditions===
Confabulations are often symptoms of various syndromes and psychopathologies in the adult population including: [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[traumatic brain injury]].

[[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]] is a neurological disorder typically characterized by years of chronic alcohol abuse and a nutritional thiamine deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10487391|year=1999|author1=Homewood|first1=J|title=Thiamin deficiency and Korsakoff's syndrome: Failure to find memory impairments following nonalcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy|journal=Alcohol |location=Fayetteville, N.Y.|volume=19|issue=1|pages=75–84|last2=Bond|first2=N. W.|doi=10.1016/s0741-8329(99)00027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confabulation is one salient symptom of this syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dalla Barba G. |author2=Cipolotti L. |author3=Denes G. | year = 1990 | title = Autobiographical memory loss and confabulation in Korsakoff's syndrome: A case report | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 525–34 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80302-4|pmid=2081390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessels RP, Kortrijk HE, Wester AJ, Nys GM. Confabulation behavior and false memories in Korsakoff's syndrome: role of source memory and executive functioning. Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2008 Apr; 62(2) 220–25.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on confabulation in Korsakoff’s patients found that they are subject to provoked confabulation when prompted with questions pertaining to [[episodic memory]], not [[semantic memory]], and when prompted with questions where the appropriate response would be "I don’t know."&lt;ref name="Korsakoff's"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damme|first=Ilse|author2=d'Ydewalle, Géry|title=Confabulation versus experimentally induced false memories in Korsakoff patients|journal=Journal of Neuropsychology|year=2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=211–30|doi=10.1348/174866409X478231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that confabulation in these patients is "domain-specific." Korsakoff’s patients who confabulate are more likely than healthy adults to falsely recognize [[Negative priming#Distractor inhibition model|distractor]] words, suggesting that false recognition is a "confabulatory behavior."

[[Alzheimer's disease]] is a condition with both neurological and psychological components. It is a form of dementia associated with severe frontal lobe dysfunction. Confabulation in individuals with Alzheimer's is often more spontaneous than it is in other conditions, especially in the advanced stages of the disease. Alzheimer's patients demonstrate comparable abilities to encode information as healthy elderly adults, suggesting that impairments in encoding are not associated with confabulation.&lt;ref name=Alzheimer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Janine M.|author2=Shanks, Michael F. |author3=Venneri, Annalena |title=Provoked confabulations in Alzheimer's disease|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=11 May 2006|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1697–1707|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.029|pmid=16697019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as seen in Korsakoff's patients, confabulation in Alzheimer's patients is higher when prompted with questions investigating episodic memory. Researchers suggest this is due to damage in the posterior cortical regions of the brain, which is a symptom characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease.

[[Schizophrenia]] is a psychological disorder in which confabulation is sometimes observed. Although confabulation is usually coherent in its presentation, confabulations of schizophrenic patients are often delusional&lt;ref&gt;Wing, J. K., Cooper, J. E., [[Norman Sartorius|Sartorius, N.]] 1974. The description and classification of psychiatric symptoms: An instruction manual for the PSE and catego system. London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have noted that these patients tend to make up delusions on the spot which are often fantastic and become increasingly elaborate with questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17506924|year=2007|author1=Lorente-Rovira|first1=E|title=Confabulation in schizophrenia and its relationship to clinical and neuropsychological features of the disorder|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1403–12|last2=Pomarol-Clotet|first2=E|last3=McCarthy|first3=R. A.|last4=Berrios|first4=G. E.|last5=McKenna|first5=P. J.|doi=10.1017/S0033291707000566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike patients with Korsakoff's and Alzheimer's, patients with schizophrenia are more likely to confabulate when prompted with questions regarding their semantic memories, as opposed to episodic memory prompting.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia&gt;{{cite journal|title=Confabulation in schizophrenia: A neuropsychological study|journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society|date=1 November 2010|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1018–26|doi=10.1017/S1355617710000718|pmid=20630120|author1=Lorente-Rovira|first1=E|last2=Santos-Gómez|first2=J. L.|last3=Moro|first3=M|last4=Villagrán|first4=J. M.|last5=McKenna|first5=P. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, confabulation does not appear to be related to any memory deficit in schizophrenic patients. This is contrary to most forms of confabulation. Also, confabulations made by schizophrenic patients often do not involve the creation of new information, but instead involve an attempt by the patient to reconstruct actual details of a past event.

[[Traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) can also result in confabulation. Research has shown that patients with damage to the inferior medial frontal lobe confabulate significantly more than patients with damage to the posterior area and healthy controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha S. |author2=Cipolotti, Lisa |author3=Yousry, Tarek A. |author4=Shallice, Tim|title=Confabulation: Damage to a specific inferior medial prefrontal system|journal=Cortex|date=1 June 2008|volume=44|issue=6|pages=637–48|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.01.002|pmid=18472034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that this region is key in producing confabulatory responses, and that memory deficit is important but not necessary in confabulation. Additionally, research suggests that confabulation can be seen in patients with frontal lobe syndrome, which involves an insult to the frontal lobe as a result of disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1988 | title = Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 212–30 | doi=10.1016/0278-2626(88)90031-0|pmid=3377900 | author1 = Baddeley | first1 = A | last2 = Wilson | first2 = B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1997 | title = Confabulation in a dysexecutive patient: Implications for models of retrieval | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 743–52 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70731-7|pmid=9444475 | author1 = Papagno | first1 = C | last2 = Baddeley | first2 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | year = 1996 | title = Exploring the Central Executive | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 49A | issue = 1| pages = 5–28 |doi=10.1080/713755608| last1 = Baddeley | first1 = Alan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, rupture of the anterior or posterior communicating artery, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and encephalitis are also possible causes of confabulation.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986/&gt;&lt;ref name="DallaBarba1993a"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dalla Barba G | year = 1993 | title = Confabulation: knowledge and recollective experience | url = | journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/02643299308253454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of brain lesions===
Confabulation is believed to be a result of damage to the right frontal lobe of the brain.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch"/&gt; In particular, damage can be localized to the ventromedial frontal lobes and other structures fed by the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), including the basal forebrain, septum, fornix, cingulate gyrus, cingulum, anterior hypothalamus, and head of the caudate nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=6539437 |year=1984 |author1=Alexander |first1=M. P. |title=Amnesia after anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture |journal=Neurology |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=752–57 |last2=Freedman |first2=M |doi=10.1212/wnl.34.6.752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 1596082 |year= 1992 |author1= Irle |first1= E |title= Memory disturbances following anterior communicating artery rupture |journal= Annals of Neurology |volume= 31 |issue= 5 |pages= 473–80 |last2= Wowra |first2= B |last3= Kunert |first3= H. J. |last4= Hampl |first4= J |last5= Kunze |first5= S |doi= 10.1002/ana.410310503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental differences===
While some recent literature has suggested that older adults may be more susceptible than their younger counterparts to have false memories, the majority of research on forced confabulation centers around children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brainerd |first=C. J. |author2=Reyna, V. F. |author3=Ceci, S. J.  |title=Developmental reversals in false memory: A review of data and theory |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|issue=3|pages=343–82|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.3.343|pmid=18444700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are particularly susceptible to forced confabulations based on their high suggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Lauren R. |author2=Purdy, Telisa L. |title=Suggestibility and source monitoring errors: blame the interview style, interviewer consistency, and the child's personality|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=489–506 |doi=10.1002/acp.1093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Lauren R. |author2=Blackford, Cheryl |author3=Chen, Chiung-Fen |title=Eyewitness memory for a simulated misdemeanor crime: the role of age and temperament in suggestibility |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=3|pages=267–89 |doi=10.1002/acp.1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; When forced to recall confabulated events, children are less likely to remember that they had previously confabulated these situations, and they are more likely than their adult counterparts to come to remember these confabulations as real events that transpired.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ackil |first=Jennifer K. |author2=Zaragoza, Maria S. |title=Memorial consequences of forced confabulation: Age differences in susceptibility to false memories |journal=Developmental Psychology |date=1 November 1998 |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1358–72 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.34.6.1358|pmid=9823517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that this inability to distinguish between past confabulatory and real events is centered on developmental differences in source monitoring. Due to underdeveloped encoding and critical reasoning skills, children's ability to distinguish real memories from false memories may be impaired. It may also be that younger children lack the meta-memory processes required to remember confabulated versus non-confabulated events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |author2=Castelli, Paola |author3=Lyons, Kristen E. |title=Knowing about not remembering: developmental dissociations in lack-of-memory monitoring |journal=Developmental Science |year=2010 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=611–21 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00908.x|pmid=20590725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's meta-memory processes may also be influenced by expectancies or biases, in that they believe that highly plausible false scenarios are not confabulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |author2=Alexander, Kristen Weede|title="If It Happened, I Would Remember It": Strategic Use of Event Memorability in the Rejection of False Autobiographical Events |journal=Child Development |year=2004 |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=542–61 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00692.x|pmid=15056205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when knowingly being tested for accuracy, children are more likely to respond, "I don’t know" at a rate comparable to adults for unanswerable questions than they are to confabulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roebers |first=Claudia |author2=Fernandez, Olivia |title=The Effects of Accuracy Motivation on Children's and Adults' Event Recall, Suggestibility, and Their Answers to Unanswerable Questions |journal=Journal of Cognition and Development |year=2002 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=415–43 |doi=10.1207/S15327647JCD3,4-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scoboria|first=Alan |author2=Mazzoni, Giuliana |author3=Kirsch, Irving|title="Don't know" responding to answerable and unanswerable questions during misleading and hypnotic interviews |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–65 |doi=10.1037/1076-898X.14.3.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, misinformation effects can be minimized by tailoring individual interviews to the specific developmental stage, often based on age, of the participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holliday |first=Robyn E. |author2=Albon, Amanda J. |title=Minimising misinformation effects in young children with cognitive interview mnemonics |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2004 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=263–81 |doi=10.1002/acp.973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provoked versus spontaneous confabulations===
There is evidence to support different cognitive mechanisms for provoked and spontaneous confabulation.&lt;ref name="Provoked Versus Spontaneous"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schnider|first=Armin |author2=von Däniken, Christine |author3=Gutbrod, Klemens|title=The mechanisms of spontaneous and provoked confabulations|journal=Brain|date=19 February 1996|volume=119|issue=4|pages=1365–75|doi=10.1093/brain/119.4.1365}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggested that spontaneous confabulation may be a result of an amnesic patient’s inability to distinguish the chronological order of events in their memory. In contrast, provoked confabulation may be a compensatory mechanism, in which the patient tries to make up for their memory deficiency by attempting to demonstrate competency in recollection.

===Confidence in false memories===
Confabulation of events or situations may lead to an eventual acceptance of the confabulated information as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|title=When a lie becomes the truth: The effects of self-generated misinformation on eyewitness memory|journal=Memory|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=14–26|doi=10.1080/09658210244000072|pmid=15098618}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, people who knowingly lie about a situation may eventually come to believe that their lies are truthful with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polage|first=Danielle C.|title=Fabrication deflation? The mixed effects of lying on memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=455–65|doi=10.1002/acp.995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview setting, people are more likely to confabulate in situations in which they are presented false information by another person, as opposed to when they self-generate these falsehoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pezdek|first=Kathy|author2=Lam, Shirley T. |author3=Sperry, Kathryn |title=Forced confabulation more strongly influences event memory if suggestions are other-generated than self-generated|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=2009|volume=14|issue=2|pages=241–52|doi=10.1348/135532508X344773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, people are more likely to accept false information as true when they are interviewed at a later time (after the event in question) than those who are interviewed immediately or soon after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melnyk|first=Laura|author2=Bruck, Maggie|title=Timing moderates the effects of repeated suggestive interviewing on children's eyewitness memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=5|pages=613–31|doi=10.1002/acp.1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative feedback for confabulated responses is also shown to increase the confabulator’s confidence in their response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hafstad|first=Gertrud Sofie |author2=Memon, Amina |author3=Logie, Robert|title=Post-identification feedback, confidence and recollections of witnessing conditions in child witnesses|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=7|pages=901–12|doi=10.1002/acp.1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in culprit identification, if a witness falsely identifies a member of a line-up, he will be more confident in his identification if the interviewer provides affirmative feedback. This effect of confirmatory feedback appears to last over time, as witnesses will even remember the confabulated information months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaragoza|first=M. S.|author2=Payment, K. E. |author3=Ackil, J. K. |author4=Drivdahl, S. B. |author5=Beck, M. |title=Interviewing Witnesses: Forced Confabulation and Confirmatory Feedback Increase False Memories|journal=Psychological Science|year=2001|volume=12|issue=6|pages=473–77|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00388|pmid=11760134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Among normal subjects===
On rare occasions, confabulation can also be seen in normal subjects.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; It is currently unclear how completely healthy individuals produce confabulations. It is possible that these individuals are in the process of developing some type of organic condition that is causing their confabulation symptoms. It is not uncommon, however, for the general population to display some very mild symptoms of provoked confabulations. Subtle distortions and intrusions in memory are commonly produced by normal subjects when they remember something poorly.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Spontaneous confabulations, due to their involuntary nature, cannot be manipulated in a laboratory setting.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; However, provoked confabulations can be researched in various theoretical contexts. The mechanisms found to underlie provoked confabulations can be applied to spontaneous confabulation mechanisms. The basic premise of researching confabulation comprises finding errors and distortions in memory tests of an individual.

===Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists===
Confabulations can be detected in the context of the [[Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm]] by using the Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists.&lt;ref name="True and False"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Mark L. |author2=Cicchetti, Dante |author3=[[Sheree Toth|Toth, Sheree L.]] |author4=Cerrito, Beth M.|title=True and False Memories in Maltreated Children|journal=Child Development|date=1 September 2004|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1402–17|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00748.x|pmid=15369522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants listen to audio recordings of several lists of words centered around a theme, known as the critical word. The participants are later asked to recall the words on their list. If the participant recalls the critical word, which was never explicitly stated in the list, it is considered a confabulation. Participants often have a false memory for the critical word.

===Recognition tasks===
Confabulations can also be researched by using continuous recognition tasks.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; These tasks are often used in conjunction with confidence ratings. Generally, in a recognition task, participants are rapidly presented with pictures. Some of these pictures are shown once; others are shown multiple times. Participants press a key if they have seen the picture previously. Following a period of time, participants repeat the task. More errors on the second task, versus the first, are indicative of confusion, representing false memories.

===Free recall tasks===
Confabulations can also be detected using a free recall task, such as a self-narrative task.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; Participants are asked to recall stories ([[Semantic memory|semantic]] or [[Autobiographical memory|autobiographical]]) that are highly familiar to them. The stories recalled are encoded for errors that could be classified as distortions in memory. Distortions could include falsifying true story elements or including details from a completely different story. Errors such as these would be indicative of confabulations.

===Treatment===
Treatment for confabulation is somewhat dependent on the cause or source, if identifiable. For example, treatment of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome involves large doses of vitamin B in order to reverse the thiamine deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3140893|year=2011|author1=Spiegel|first1=D. R.|title=A Case of Probable Korsakoff's Syndrome: A Syndrome of Frontal Lobe and Diencephalic Structural Pathogenesis and a Comparison with Medial Temporal Lobe Dementias|journal=Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=6|pages=15–19|last2=Lim|first2=K. J.|pmid=21779537}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no known physiological cause, more general cognitive techniques may be used to treat confabulation. A case study published in 2000 showed that [[Self-Monitoring Training]] (SMT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/096020100411998|title=Treatment of stable delusional confabulations using self-monitoring training|journal=Neuropsychological Rehabilitation|volume=10|issue=4|pages=415–27|year=2000|last1=Dayus|first1=B.|last2=Van Den Broek|first2=M.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced delusional confabulations. Furthermore, improvements were maintained at a three-month follow-up and were found to generalize to everyday settings. Although this treatment seems promising, more rigorous research is necessary to determine the efficacy of SMT in the general confabulation population.

==Research==
Although significant gains have been made in the understanding of confabulation in recent years, there is still much to be learned. One group of researchers in particular has laid-out several important questions for future-study. They suggest more information is needed regarding the neural-systems that support the different cognitive processes necessary for normal source-monitoring. They also proposed the idea of developing a standard neuro-psychological test battery able to discriminate between the different types of confabulations. And there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the best approach to organizing and combining neuro-imaging, pharmacological, and cognitive/behavioral approaches to understand confabulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01152-8|pmid=21227110|title=False memories and confabulation|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=2|issue=4|pages=137–45|year=1998|last1=Johnson|first1=M|last2=Raye|first2=C. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent review article, another group of researchers contemplate issues concerning the distinctions between delusions and confabulation. They question whether delusions and confabulation should be considered distinct or overlapping disorders and, if overlapping, to what degree? They also discuss the role of unconscious processes in confabulation. Some researchers suggest that unconscious emotional and motivational processes are potentially just as important as cognitive and memory problems. Finally, they raise the question of where to draw the line between the pathological and the nonpathological. Delusion-like beliefs and confabulation-like fabrications are commonly seen in healthy individuals. What are the important differences between patients with similar etiology who do and do not confabulate? Since the line between pathological and nonpathological is likely blurry, should we take a more dimensional approach to confabulation? Research suggests that confabulation occurs along a continuum of implausibility, bizarreness, content, conviction, preoccupation, and distress, and impact on daily life.&lt;ref name=LangdonTurne2010&gt;{{citation |date=2010 |author1=Langdon, R.  |author2=Turner, M |title=Delusion and confabulation: Overlapping or distinct distortions in reality? |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume= 15 |issue=1 |pages= 1–13 |pmid=20043251|doi=10.1080/13546800903519095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct instruction''' ('''DI''') is a general term for the explicit teaching of a skill-set using [[lecture]]s or demonstrations of the material to students. A particular subset of '''direct instruction''', denoted by capitalization as '''Direct Instruction''', refers to a specific example of the approach developed by [[Siegfried Engelmann]] and Wesley C. Becker. DI teaches by explicit instruction,&lt;ref name=LearnLab&gt;[http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Explicit_instruction] Explicit Instruction. LearnLab. Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Retrieved 2017-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to exploratory models such as [[inquiry-based learning]]. DI includes [[tutorial]]s, participatory laboratory classes, [[discussion]], [[recitation]], [[seminar]]s, [[workshop]]s, [[observation]], [[active learning]], [[practicum|practica]], or [[internship]]s.

DI relies on a systematic curriculum design, delivered by implementation of a prescribed [[behavioral script]]. On the premise that all students can learn and all teachers successfully teach if given effective training in specific techniques, teachers may be evaluated based on measurable student learning.

In some special education programs, direct instruction is used in [[resource rooms]], when teachers assist with [[homework]] completion and academic remediation.&lt;ref name=Englert &gt;[http://rse.sagepub.com/content/5/2/38.abstract Effective direct instruction practices in special education settings]. Englert, Carol S. ''Remedial &amp; Special Education'', Vol 5(2), Mar-Apr 1984, 38-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engelmann's Direct Instruction method and DISTAR ==

The term ''Direct Instruction'' applies specifically to a pedagogical model developed by Siegfried Engelmann in 1964 at the University of Illinois Institute for Research on Exceptional Children.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. (2007) Teaching Needy Kids in our Backward System.Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[DISTAR]] was a specific direct instruction model developed by Siegfried Engelmann and Wesley C. Becker. Engelmann and Becker sought to identify teaching methods that would accelerate the progress of historically disadvantaged elementary school students.&lt;ref&gt;Englemann, S.E.(1968). Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching. ''Journal of School Psychology, 6,'' 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim &gt;Kim, T. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2005). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26452612_Direct_Instruction_An_Educators'_Guide_and_a_Plea_for_Action Direct Instruction: An Educators’ Guide and a Plea for Action]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 6.(2),'' Page 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DISTAR]], an acronym for '''D'''irect '''I'''nstruction '''S'''ystem for '''T'''eaching '''A'''rithmetic and '''R'''eading, gained prominence during [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational study ever conducted in America.

Features of DI include:
*Explicit instruction based on lesson plans, often with specific teacher "scripts."
*[[Ability grouping]]. Students are grouped based on their rate of progress through the program.
*Emphasis on pace and efficiency of instruction. Lessons are designed to bring students to mastery as quickly as possible.
*Frequent assessment.
*Embedded professional development/coaching. Program developers recommend careful monitoring and coaching.

Direct Instruction has been effectively delivered through peers to students with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella &gt;Marchand-Martella, &amp; Martella (2002) [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/3/2/213.pdf&amp;productCode=pa An Overview and Research Summary of Peer-Delivered Corrective Reading]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (2),'' 214 -235&lt;/ref&gt;
Peer delivery offers teachers new ways to use the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella /&gt; The approach has also been examined as a model to assist students in a [[resource room]] with homework completion, bolster executive functioning skills and improve teacher efficiency.&lt;ref name=Englert /&gt;

==Success for All==
Another popular direct instruction approach is the [[Success for All]] program, which uses [[scripted teaching]] to instruct elementary children in [[phonics]] intensive reading instruction program. What the teacher says is carefully scripted in the program. The program was designed by [[Johns Hopkins University]] professor [[Robert Slavin]] in the mid 1980s for failing schools in [[Baltimore]]. The program requires a dedicated 90 minutes of reading instruction each day in which the teacher must follow a pre-ordained lesson plan that has every minute filled with scripted instruction and specific activities designed to teach reading. [[Jonathan Kozol|Kozol]] criticized the program in his book, ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]'', for being excessively dogmatic, utilitarian, and authoritarian.&lt;ref name=Kozol &gt;{{cite book |last=Kozol |first=Jonathan |date=2005 |title=The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America |url= |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page= |isbn=1-4000-5244-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Debates about the efficacy of DI have raged since before the final results of [[Project Follow Through]] were published; however, there is substantial empirical research supporting its effectiveness. A meta-analysis published by Adams &amp; Engelmann (1996), a chief architect of the DI program, finds a "mean effect size average per study...(as) more than .75, which confirms that the overall effect is substantial."

In some special education programs, it is used in a [[resource room]] with small groups of students. Some research has shown benefit with this model.&lt;ref&gt;Resource Room Teachers' use of Strategies that Promote the Success of Handicapped Students in Regular Classrooms Nancy K. Glomb and Daniel P. Morgan Journal of Special Education, Jan 1991; vol. 25: pp. 221 - 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct Instruction is used with students from every population segment (with regard to poverty, culture, and race). In [[Project Follow Through]], the DI model was ranked first in achievement for poor students, students who were not poor, urban students, rural students, [[African American]] students, [[Hispanic]] students, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students.  Today, many of the Bureau of Indian Affair's highest-performing schools use Direct Instruction materials. The Baltimore Curriculum Project has many schools with Free and Reduced Lunch Rates above 75% serving student populations that are more than 90% African American. These schools have shown strong achievement gains using Direct Instruction.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007&gt;Rebar, M. (2007).  [http://www.ewu.edu/getset/Academic_Acceleration_G1_TR_2007-1.pdf Academic acceleration in first grade using the Direct Instruction model]. (Report No. 2007-1). Cheney, WA: Eastern Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analysis of 85 [[single-subject design]] studies comparing direct instruction to other teaching strategies found the effects to be substantial for students with learning disabilities;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, H.L. &amp; Sachse-Lee, C. (2000). A Meta-Analysis of Single-Subject-Design Intervention Research for Students with LD. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' Vol. 33, No. 2, 114-136 {{doi|10.1177/002221940003300201}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, when qualified by IQ and reading levels [[strategy instruction]] (SI) had better effects for the high IQ group. For the low-IQ discrepancy groups, higher effect sizes were yielded for a Combined DI and SI Model when compared to all competing models. With the exception of handwriting, DI's effects were all above .8 (i.e., reading and mathematics).{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

John Hattie's Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement (2009) summarizes the results of four meta-analyses that examined Direct Instruction. These analyses incorporated 304 studies of over 42,000 students. Across all of these students, the average effect size was .59 and was significantly larger than those of any other curriculum Hattie studied.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

Direct Instruction is recognized as one of two effective models of comprehensive school reform and, in many cases, can be integrated into a tiered model system{{Definition needed|date=May 2016}} to address students with developing problems.&lt;ref name=Stewart &gt;Stewart, R.M.,  Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. &amp;  Benner, G.J. (2005). [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ846760.pdf Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior]. ''JEIBI''  2 (3), 115-123&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from [[Project Follow Through]], conducted in a variety of selected communities throughout the United States, suggested that Direct Instruction is the most effective model for teaching academic skills and for affective outcomes (e.g., [[self-esteem]]) of children. Recent large-scale studies (1997–2003), such as the Baltimore Curriculum Project, show that it is possible to help schools that are in the lowest twenty percent with respect to academic achievement steadily improve until they are performing well above average. In some cases, school achievement improved from the 16th percentile to above the 90th percentile.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007/&gt;

==Criticism==
One three-year study of methods of teaching reading showed that highly scripted, teacher-directed methods of teaching reading were not as effective as traditional methods that allowed a more flexible approach.&lt;ref name=Ryder2006&gt;Ryder RJ, Burton JL, Silberg A. 2006. Longitudinal study of direct instruction effects from first through third grade. Journal of Educational Research, 99, 3, 179-191&lt;/ref&gt; Urban teachers in particular expressed great concern over the DI's lack of sensitivity to issues of [[poverty]], [[culture]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref name=Ryder2006/&gt;

The former president of the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), Anne Tweed, questioned whether direct instruction was the most effective science teaching strategy. In the December 15, 2004 NSTA Reports she concluded that "direct instruction alone cannot replace the in-depth experience with science concepts that inquiry-based strategies provide."&lt;ref&gt;Tweed, a. (2004). [http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=50045 Direct Instruction: Is It the Most Effective Science Teaching Strategy?] ''NSTA Reports'', 15 December 2004. Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics also see DI as a betrayal of the [[humanism|humanistic]], [[egalitarian]] foundations of public education, or as a "canned" or "teacher proof" curriculum deliverable via unskilled teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-distance.syr.edu/sdlhuman.html From behaviorism to humanism: Incorporating self-direction in learning concepts into the instructional design process.] In H. B. Long &amp; Associates, New ideas about self-directed learning. Norman, OK: Oklahoma Research Center for Continuing Professional and Higher Education, University of Oklahoma, 1994 (Roger Hiemstra &amp; Ralph Brockett)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, where DI has been used in schools among several remote Indigenous Australians communities in Queensland, DI has been criticised for its high cost in return for at best modest improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, as well as its US-centric theme which is alien to indigenous Australian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Misty Adoniou.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4670">'''Dotfuscator''' is a tool that hinders reverse engineering and tampering for [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[Xamarin]] and [[Universal Windows Platform]] applications. It implements a combination of code [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]], [[Program optimization|optimization]], shrinking, and hardening technologies.

A free version of the .NET Obfuscator, called the Dotfuscator Community Edition, is distributed as part of Microsoft's [[Visual Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bethmassi/archive/2010/02/23/dotfuscator-gets-better-and-still-free-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx |title=Dotfuscator Gets Better and Still Free in Visual Studio | author=Beth Massi |date=23 February 2010 |work=msdn.com |publisher=Microsoft, Inc. |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

.NET executables can easily be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] by free tools (such as dotPeek and JustDecompile), potentially exposing algorithms and [[intellectual property]] (trade secrets), licensing and security mechanisms. Also, code can be run through a debugger and its data inspected. Using a .NET obfuscator can make all of these things more difficult.

Dotfuscator was developed by PreEmptive Solutions and a version has been free inside Microsoft's [[Visual Studio]] since 2003.

{{Other uses of|Empty}}

[[File:Nullset.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|The empty set is the set containing no elements.]]
In [[mathematics]], and more specifically [[set theory]], the '''empty set''' or '''null set''' is the unique [[Set (mathematics)|set]] having no [[Element (mathematics)|elements]]; its size or [[cardinality]] (count of elements in a set) is [[0|zero]]. Some [[axiomatic set theories]] ensure that the empty set exists by including an [[axiom of empty set]]; in other theories, its existence can be deduced. Many possible properties of sets are [[vacuously true]] for the empty set.

''[[Null set]]'' is a distinct notion within the context of [[measure theory]]. In that setting, it describes a set of measure zero; such a set is not necessarily empty.  The empty set may also be called the ''void set''.

==Notation==
{{Main|Null sign}}
[[Image:Empty set.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|A symbol for the empty set]]
Common notations for the empty set include "{}", "&lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;", and "∅". The latter two symbols were introduced by the [[Bourbaki group]] (specifically [[André Weil]]) in 1939, inspired by the letter [[Ø]] in the [[Norwegian orthography|Norwegian]] and [[Danish orthography|Danish]] alphabets (and not related in any way to the Greek letter [[phi (letter)|Φ]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, "0" was occasionally used as a symbol for the empty set, but this is now considered to be an improper use of notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=007054235X|edition=3rd|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol ∅ is available at [[Unicode]] point U+2205.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2200.pdf Unicode Standard 5.2]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be coded in [[HTML]] as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;emptyset;&lt;/tt&gt; and as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#8709;&lt;/tt&gt;. It can be coded in [[LaTeX]] as &lt;tt&gt;\varnothing&lt;/tt&gt;. The symbol &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; is coded in LaTeX as &lt;tt&gt;\emptyset&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Properties ==
In standard [[axiomatic set theory]], by the [[axiom of extensionality|principle of extensionality]], two sets are equal if they have the same elements; therefore there can be only one set with no elements. Hence there is but one empty set, and we speak of "the empty set" rather than "an empty set".

The mathematical symbols employed below are explained [[table of mathematical symbols|here]].

[[For any]] set ''A'':
* The empty set is a [[subset]] of ''A'':
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall A: \varnothing  \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[union (set theory)|union]] of ''A'' with the empty set is ''A'':
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall A: A \cup \varnothing  = A&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of ''A'' with the empty set is the empty set:
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall A: A \cap \varnothing  = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;
* The [[Cartesian product]] of ''A'' and the empty set is the empty set:
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall A: A \times \varnothing  = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;

The empty set has the following properties:
* Its only subset is the empty set itself:
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall A: A \subseteq \varnothing  \Rightarrow A = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;
* The [[power set]] of the empty set is the set containing only the empty set:
*:&lt;math&gt;2^{\varnothing } = \{\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt;
* Its number of elements (that is, its [[cardinality]]) is zero:
*:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{card}(\varnothing) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The connection between the empty set and zero goes further, however: in the standard [[set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]], sets are used to [[model theory|model]] the natural numbers. In this context, zero is modelled by the empty set.

For any [[property (philosophy)|property]]:
* For every element of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; the property holds ([[vacuous truth]]);
* There is no element of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; for which the property holds.

Conversely, if for some property and some set ''V'', the following two statements hold:
* For every element of ''V'' the property holds;
* There is no element of ''V'' for which the property holds,
:then &lt;math&gt;V = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

By the definition of [[subset]], the empty set is a subset of any set ''A''. That is, ''every'' element ''x'' of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''A''. Indeed, if it were not true that every element of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is in ''A'' then there would be at least one element of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; that is not present in ''A''. Since there are ''no'' elements of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; at all, there is no element of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; that is not in ''A''. Any statement that begins "for every element of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;" is not making any substantive claim; it is a [[vacuous truth]]. This is often paraphrased as "everything is true of the elements of the empty set."

=== Operations on the empty set ===

When speaking of the [[summation|sum]] of the elements of a finite set, one is inevitably led to the convention that the sum of the elements of the empty set is zero. The reason for this is that zero is the [[identity element]] for addition. Similarly, the [[multiplication|product]] of the elements of the empty set should be considered to be [[1 (number)|one]] (see [[empty product]]), since one is the identity element for multiplication.

A [[derangement]] is a [[permutation]] of a set without [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s.  The empty set can be considered a derangement of itself, because it has only one permutation (&lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;), and it is vacuously true that no element (of the empty set) can be found that retains its original position.

==In other areas of mathematics==
=== Extended real numbers ===

Since the empty set has no members, when it is considered as a subset of any [[ordered set]], then every member of that set will be an upper bound and lower bound for the empty set. For example, when considered as a subset of the real numbers, with its usual ordering, represented by the [[real number line]], every real number is both an upper and lower bound for the empty set.&lt;ref&gt;Bruckner, A.N., Bruckner, J.B., and Thomson, B.S., 2008. ''[http://classicalrealanalysis.com/download.aspx Elementary Real Analysis]'', 2nd ed. Prentice Hall. P. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; When considered as a subset of the [[extended reals]] formed by adding two "numbers" or "points" to the real numbers, namely [[negative infinity]], denoted &lt;math&gt;-\infty\!\,,&lt;/math&gt; which is defined to be less than every other extended real number, and [[positive infinity]], denoted &lt;math&gt;+\infty\!\,,&lt;/math&gt; which is defined to be greater than every other extended real number, then: 

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\varnothing=\min(\{-\infty, +\infty \} \cup \mathbb{R})=-\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\inf\varnothing=\max(\{-\infty, +\infty \} \cup \mathbb{R})=+\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the least upper bound (sup or [[supremum]]) of the empty set is negative infinity, while the greatest lower bound (inf or [[infimum]]) is positive infinity. By analogy with the above, in the domain of the extended reals, negative infinity is the identity element for the maximum and supremum operators, while positive infinity is the identity element for minimum and infimum.

=== Topology ===
In any [[topological space]] ''X'', the empty set is [[open set|open]] by definition, as is ''X''. Since the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of an open set is [[closed set|closed]] and the empty set and ''X'' are complements of each other, the empty set is also closed, making it a [[clopen set]]. Moreover, the empty set is [[compact set|compact]] by the fact that every [[finite set]] is compact.

The [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the empty set is empty. This is known as "preservation of [[nullary]] [[union (set theory)|unions]]."

=== Category theory ===
If ''A'' is a set, then there exists precisely one [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from {} to ''A'', the [[empty function]]. As a result, the empty set is the unique [[initial object]] of the [[category theory|category]] of sets and functions.

The empty set can be turned into a [[topological space]], called the empty space, in just one way: by defining the empty set to be [[open set|open]]. This empty topological space is the unique initial object in the [[category of topological spaces]] with [[continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]]. In fact, it is a [[strict initial object]]: only the empty set has a function to the empty set.

=== Set theory ===
In the [[von Neumann ordinal|von Neumann construction of the ordinals]], 0 is defined as the empty set, and the successor of an ordinal is defined as &lt;math&gt;S(\alpha)=\alpha\cup\{\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we have &lt;math&gt;0=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1 = 0\cup\{0\}=\{\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2=1\cup\{1\}=\{\{\varnothing\},\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.  The von Neumann construction, along with the [[axiom of infinity]], which guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, can be used to construct the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;, such that the [[Peano axioms]] of arithmetic are satisfied.

==Questioned existence==
=== Axiomatic set theory ===
In [[Zermelo set theory]], the existence of the empty set is assured by the [[axiom of empty set]], and its uniqueness follows from the [[axiom of extensionality]]. However, the axiom of empty set can be shown redundant in either of two ways:
*There is already an axiom implying the existence of at least one set. Given such an axiom together with the [[axiom of separation]], the existence of the empty set is easily proved.
*In the presence of [[urelement]]s, it is easy to prove that at least one set exists, viz. the set of all urelements (assuming there is not a proper class of them). Again, given the [[axiom of separation]], the empty set is easily proved.

=== Philosophical issues ===
While the empty set is a standard and widely accepted mathematical concept, it remains an [[ontological]] curiosity, whose meaning and usefulness are debated by philosophers and logicians.

The empty set is not the same thing as ''[[nothing]]''; rather, it is a set with nothing ''inside'' it and a set is always ''something''. This issue can be overcome by viewing a set as a bag—an empty bag undoubtedly still exists. Darling (2004) explains that the empty set is not nothing, but rather "the set of all triangles with four sides, the set of all numbers that are bigger than nine but smaller than eight, and the set of all [[chess opening|opening moves]] in [[chess]] that involve a [[king (chess)|king]]."&lt;ref name="Darling" /&gt;

The popular [[syllogism]]
:Nothing is better than eternal happiness; a ham sandwich is better than nothing; therefore, a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness
is often used to demonstrate the philosophical relation between the concept of nothing and the empty set. Darling writes that the contrast can be seen by rewriting the statements "Nothing is better than eternal happiness" and "[A] ham sandwich is better than nothing" in a mathematical tone. According to Darling, the former is equivalent to "The set of all things that are better than eternal happiness is &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;" and the latter to "The set {ham sandwich} is better than the set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;". It is noted that the first compares elements of sets, while the second compares the sets themselves.&lt;ref name="Darling"&gt;{{cite book|title=The universal book of mathematics|author=D. J. Darling|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2004|isbn=0-471-27047-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Lowe]] argues that while the empty set:
:"...was undoubtedly an important landmark in the history of mathematics, … we should not assume that its utility in calculation is dependent upon its actually denoting some object."

it is also the case that:
:"All that we are ever informed about the empty set is that it (1) is a set, (2) has no members, and (3) is unique amongst sets in having no members. However, there are very many things that 'have no members', in the set-theoretical sense&amp;mdash;namely, all non-sets. It is perfectly clear why these things have no members, for they are not sets. What is unclear is how there can be, uniquely amongst sets, a ''set'' which has no members. We cannot conjure such an entity into existence by mere stipulation."&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;{{cite book|title=Locke|author=E. J. Lowe|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Boolos]] argued that much of what has been heretofore obtained by set theory can just as easily be obtained by [[plural quantification]] over individuals, without [[wikt:reification|reifying]] sets as singular entities having other entities as members.&lt;ref&gt;*[[George Boolos]], 1984, "To be is to be the value of a variable," ''The Journal of Philosophy'' 91: 430–49. Reprinted in his 1998 ''Logic, Logic and Logic'' ([[Richard Jeffrey]], and Burgess, J., eds.) Harvard Univ. Press: 54–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Under the [[1975 Indira–Sheikh accord|1975 accord]], [[Sheikh Abdullah]] agreed to measures previously undertaken by the central government in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to integrate the state into India.{{sfn|Hussain, Kashmiri Visions of Freedom|2015|pp=102, 103}} Sociologist Farrukh Faheem states that it was met with of hostility among people of Kashmir and laid the groundwork for the future insurgency.{{sfn|Faheem, Interrogating the Ordinary|2018|pp=233, 234}} Those opposed to it included [[Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir]] and People's League in Indian Jammu and Kashmir, and [[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF) based in [[Azad Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chowdhary|first1=Rekha |title=Jammu and Kashmir: Politics of identity and separatism |year=2015 |publisher= Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-2oCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 |isbn=1317414055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1970s, communalist rhetoric was being exploited in the state for [[votebank]] politics. This fit together with the plan of Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) which was trying to Islamise Kashmir and replace its prevalent [[Sufism|Sufi culture]] with [[Wahhabism]] in order to create an atmosphere of religious unity with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahadevan|first1=Prem |title= The Politics of Counterterrorism in India: Strategic Intelligence and National Security in South Asia |year = 2011 | publisher= I.T.

Critics of the then Chief Minister, Farooq Abdullah, charged that Abdullah was losing control. His visit to Pakistan administered Kashmir during then became an embarrassment, where according to [[Hashim Qureshi]], he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of [[Indira Gandhi]] and his father, so that sentiments there could "be known first hand", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On July 2, 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M. Shah]], who had support from Indira Gandhi, replaced his brother-in-law Farooq Abdullah and became the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, after Abdullah was dismissed, in what was termed as a political "coup".{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947–2004|2007|p=157}} 

G. M. Shah's administration, which did not have people's mandate, turned to Islamists and opponents of India, notably the [[Molvi Iftikhar Hussain Ansari]], [[Mohammad Shafi Qureshi]] and Mohinuddin Salati, to gain some legitimacy through religious sentiments. This gave political space to Islamists who previously lost overwhelmingly in the 1983 state elections.{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947–2004|2007|p=157}} In 1986, Shah decided to construct a mosque within the premises of an ancient Hindu temple inside the New Civil Secretariat area in Jammu to be made available to the Muslim employees for 'Namaz'. People of Jammu took to streets to protest against this decision, which led to a Hindu-Muslim clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verma|first1=P.

Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Pandits were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.&lt;ref name="Tikoo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colonel Tej K Tikoo|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&amp;pg=PT397|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-58-9|pages=397–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on March 12, 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly. The political fight was hence being portrayed as a conflict between "Hindu" New Delhi (Central Government), and its efforts to impose its will in the state, and "Muslim" Kashmir, represented by political Islamists and clerics.{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947– 19472004|2007|p=158}}

This instilled fear in the Kashmiri Pandit community especially as Taploo's killers were never caught which also emboldened the terrorists.

In order to undermine his political rival [[Farooq Abdullah]] who at that time was the Chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, the [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] [[Mufti Mohammad Sayeed]] convinced [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[V.P. Singh]] to appoint Jagmohan as the governor of the state. Abdullah resented Jagmohan who had been appointed as the governor earlier in April 1984 as well and had recommended Abdullah's dismissal to [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in July 1984. Mufti was convinced that such a move will irritate Abdullah and make him quit. Abdullah had earlier declared that he would resign if Jagmohan was made the Governor. However, the Central government went ahead and appointed him as Governor on 19 January 1990. In response, Abdullah resigned on the same day and Jagmohan suggested the dissolution of the State Assembly. On 21 January 1990, two days after Jagmohan took over as governor, the [[Gawkadal massacre]] took place in Srinagar, in which the Indian security forces had opened fire on protesters, leading to the death of at least 50 people, and likely over 100. These events led to chaos. Lawlessness took over the valley and the crowd with slogans and guns started roaming around the streets. News kept coming of violent incidents and those Hindus who survived the night saved their lives by traveling out of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ananth|first=V.

The militancy in Kashmir had increased after the exodus. The militants had targeted the properties of Kashmiri Pandits after their exodus.&lt;ref name="Tikoo p.468"&gt;{{citation |last=Tikoo |first=Colonel Tej K |title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&amp;pg=PT468 |year=2012 |publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC |isbn=978-1-935501-58-9 |pages=468–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian Defence Review: Volume 8 |year=1994 |page=32 |publisher=Lancer International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] passed a resolution to recognise 14 September 2007, as Martyrs Day to acknowledge ethnic cleansing and campaigns of terror inflicted on non-Muslim minorities of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] by militant seeking to establish an [[Islamic state]].&lt;ref&gt;

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Pandit families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Pandits faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Pandits to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question. Later the Indian Government has taken up the issue of education of the displaced students from Kashmir, and helped them get admissions in various [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]s and major educational institutions &amp; universities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SP49MH_vl7UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kashmiri+pandit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ3pq06bbTAhVE9YMKHXH0Bl8Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kashmiri%20pandit&amp;f=false |title=Kashmiri Pandits: A Contemporary Perspective |last=Pandit |first=T.

Further, whilst significantly higher figures of death, in thousands, have been reported by certain Pandit-organisations, scholars have rejected the claims, instead choosing to roughly rely upon the official figures.{{sfn|Evans, A departure from history|2002|pp=23–24}} According to the government of Jammu and Kashmir 219 Kashmiri Pandits were killed and 24,202 families migrated out of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ldquo219-Kashmiri-Pandits-killed-by-militants-since-1989rdquo/article16006510.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
The Indian Government has tried to rehabilitate the Pandits and the separatists have also invited the Pandits back  to Kashmir. Tahir, the commander of a separatist Islamic group, ensured full protection to the Kashmiri Pandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_land/page9.shtml |title=BBC World Service {{!}} World Agenda - Give me land |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=2017-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109093913/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_land/page9.shtml |archive-date=9 November 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apathy on the part of the government and the sufferings of the Kashmiri Pandits have been highlighted in a play titled 'Kaash Kashmir'.&lt;ref&gt;https://nehagargblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/br-kaash-kashmir/&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts or claims have lacked political will as journalist Rahul Pandita writes in a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/22/rahul-panditas-book-on-a-kashmir-exodus/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider Article 370 as a roadblock in the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits as the [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir]] does not allow those living in India outside Jammu and Kashmir to freely settle in the state and become its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwW3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113 |title=Jammu &amp; Kashmir: A State in Turbulence |last=Sahagala |first=Narendra |date=2011-01-01 |publisher=Suruchi Prakashan |year= |isbn=9788189622831 |location= |pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tikoo1"&gt;{{citation |last=Tikoo |first=Colonel Tej K |title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&amp;pg=PT281 |year=2012 |publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC |isbn=978-1-935501-58-9 |pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf Election Manifesto 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704041114/http://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf |date=4 July 2017 }}, Bharatiya Janata Party, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanjay Tickoo, president of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), says that the 'Article 370' affair is different from the issue of exodus of Kashmiri Hindus and both should be dealt with separately. He remarks that, linking both the affairs is an "utterly insensitive way to deal with a highly sensitive and emotive issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2659432/Dont-confuse-Kashmiri-Pandit-issue-Artcle-370-expert-warns.html |title='Don't confuse Kashmiri Pandit issue with Article 370' expert warns |date=16 June 2014 |work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, a total of 1,800 Kashmiri Pandit youths have returned to the Valley since the announcing of Rs. 1,168-crore package in 2008 by the UPA government. R.K. Bhat, president of Youth All India Kashmiri Samaj criticised the package to be a mere eyewash and claimed that most of the youths were living in cramped prefabricated sheds or in rented accommodation. He also said that 4,000 vacancies have been lying vacant since 2010 and alleged that the BJP government was repeating the same rhetoric and was not serious about helping them. In an interview with NDTV on January 19, Farooq Abdullah commented that the onus was on Kashmiri Pandits to come back themselves and nobody would beg them to do so. His comments were met with disagreement by Kashmiri Pandit authors Neeru Kaul, [[Siddhartha Gigoo]], Congress MP [[Shashi Tharoor]] and retired General [[Syed Ata Hasnain]]. He also said that during his tenure as Chief Minister in 1996, he had asked them to return but they refused to do so. He reiterated his comments on January 23 and said that the time had come for them to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/when-will-we-finally-return-home-ask-displaced-kashmiri-pandits-2590640.html |title=When will we finally return home, ask displaced Kashmiri Pandits |work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Gabo Reform''', also known as the '''Kabo Reform''', describes a series of sweeping reforms suggested to the government of [[Korea]] beginning in 1894 and ending in 1896 during the reign of [[Gojong of Korea]] in response to the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. Historians debate the degree of Japanese influence in this program,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} as well as its effect in encouraging modernization. The name Gabo (갑오, 甲午) comes from the name of the year 1894 in the traditional [[sexagenary cycle]].&lt;ref name="gabo nate"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 Gabo Reforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610003901/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Nate Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The disarray and blatant corruption in the Korean government, particularly in the three main areas of revenues – land tax, military service and the state granary system – weighed heavily on the Korean peasantry which represented 90% of the population and was uniformly illiterate. Of special note is the corruption of the local functionaries (Hyangi) who could purchase an appointment as administrators and so cloak their predations on the farmers with an aura of officialdom. [[Yangban]] families, formerly well-respected for their status as a noble class, were increasingly seen as little more than commoners who were unwilling to meet their responsibilities to their communities. Faced with increasing corruption in the government, [[brigandage]] of the disenfranchised -(such as the mounted fire brigands, or ''Hwajok'', and the boat-borne water brigands or ''Sujok'')- as well as abuse by the military, many poor village folk sought to pool their resources such as land, tools and production in order to survive. Despite the government abolishing slavery and burning the records in 1801, increasing numbers of peasants and farmers become involved in KYE or "mutual assistance associations". Institutions such as the Catholic and Protestant missions, with the egalitarian nature of their teachings garnered followings among the Yangban, though commonly in the more urban areas.

Arguably of greater influence were the religious teachings of Choi Che-u, (최제우, 崔濟愚, 1824–1864) called [[Donghak]] or "Eastern Learning" which became especially popular in rural areas. Themes of Exclusionism (of foreign influences), Nationalism, Salvation and Social Consciousness were set to music allowing illiterate farmers to understand and accept them more readily. Choe, as well as many Koreans, was also alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing during the 2nd Opium War. He believed that the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democratic and human rights reforms internally. Nationalism and social reform struck a chord among the peasant guerrillas, and [[Donghak]] spread all across Korea. Progressive revolutionaries organized the peasants into a cohesive structure. Arrested in 1863 following the Chinju Uprising led by YU Kye-cheun, Choe was charged with "misleading the people and sowing discord in society". Choe was executed in 1864, sending many of his followers into hiding in the mountains and leaving the Korean populace to continue to suffer.

[[Gojong of Korea|King Kojong]] (r. 1864-1910), enthroned at the age of twelve, succeeded [[Cheoljong of Joseon|King Cheolchong]] (r. 1849 - 1863). King Kojong's father, [[Heungseon Daewongun]](Yi Ha-Ung; 1820-1898), ruled as the de facto regent and inaugurated far-ranging reform to strengthen the central administration.  Among his targeted reforms was addressing the inherited rule by a few elite ruling families by the adoption of a merit system for official appointments. In addition, [Seowon] (private academies), which threatened to develop a parallel system to the corrupt government and enjoyed special privileges and large land-holdings, were repressed through taxes despite bitter opposition from Confucian scholars. The decision to rebuild palace buildings and finance it through additional levies on the population caused [[Heungseon Daewongun]]'s attempted reforms to antagonize the three largest constituencies supporting the government: the ruling elite, the Confucian scholars and the general population. [[Heungseon Daewongun]] was impeached in 1873 and forced into retirement by the supporters of [[Empress Myeongseong]].

On 27 February 1876, the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876]], also known in Japan as the Japanese-Korea Treaty of Amity (Japanese language: 日朝修好条規 Nitchō-shūkōjōki, Korean language: 강화도조약 江華島條約 Ganghwado joyak) was signed. It was designed to open up Korea to Japanese trade, and the rights granted to Japan under the treaty were similar to those granted Western powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Perry in 1854.[9]. However, the treaty ended Korea's status as a protectorate of China, forced open three Korean ports to Japanese trade, granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens and was an unequal treaty signed under duress of the [[Unyo Incident|Unyo Incident of 1875]] (gunboat diplomacy).[9] Daewongun remained opposed to any concessions to Japan or the West, helped organize the Mutiny of 1882 [[Imo Incident]], an anti-Japanese outbreak against the Empress and her allies.&lt;ref name="Marius B.

Jansen"/&gt;

The struggle between Heungseon Daewongun's followers and those of Empress Myeongseong was further complicated by competition from a Korean independence faction known as the Progressive Party (Kaehwadang) as well as Conservative faction. While the former sought Japan's support, the latter sought China's support.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; On 4 December 1884, the Korean independence group, assisted by the Japanese, attempted a coup (Kapsin Chongbyon; Coup d'État of 1884) and established a pro-Japanese government under the reigning king, dedicated to the independence of Korea from Chinese suzerainty.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; However, this proved short-lived, as conservative Korean officials requested the help of Chinese forces stationed in Korea.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; The coup was put down by Chinese troops, and a Korean mob killed both Japanese officers and Japanese residents in retaliation.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; Some leaders of the independence faction, including [[Kim Okgyun]], fled to Japan, while others were executed.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt;

== Donghak revolution, and first Sino-Japanese war, 1894 ==
{{Main|Donghak Peasant Revolution|First Sino-Japanese War}}

The outbreak of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] in 1894 provided a seminal pretext for direct military intervention by Japan in the affairs of Korea. Seeking redress of long-standing hardship and corruption disparate factions among the Korean peasant population coalesced into a militant force and revolted against the Korean administration. In April, 1894 the Korean government asked for Chinese assistance in ending the Donghak Peasant Revolt. In response Japanese leaders, citing a violation of Convention of Tientsin as a pretext, decided upon military intervention to challenge China. China requested Japan withdraw her troops, Japan refused and proposed that the Qing and Japan co-ordinate to reform the Korean government. The Qing refused. On May 3, 1894, 1,500 Qing Dynasty forces appeared in Incheon. The same day, 6,000 Japanese forces also landed in Incheon leading to the Sino-Japanese War.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Japan deposed the Korean government and installed a new government which demanded the Qing leave, and began a programme of reform. Japan won the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], and China signed the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895. Among its many stipulations, the treaty recognized "the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea," thus ending Korea's [[Tributary state|tributary]] relationship with the Chinese Qing Dynasty, leading to the proclamation of full independence of Joseon Korea in 1895. At the same time, Japan suppressed the Donghak Revolution with Korean government forces. Though the revolt had been ended, the issues and complaints of the Korean peasant population remained unaddressed.

==Reforms==
The reforms were done largely in three stages, according to the changing members of the reform council and the involvement of Japan. There were three stages of development.

===First reforms===
The first reforms took place from July to October 1894, based on the original reform bill presented by Japanese ambassador [[Ōtori Keisuke|Otori Keisuke (大鳥圭介)]], that had been previously refused by the [[Joseon]] court and [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt; As Japan was focused more on the Sino-Japanese War, many of the first reforms reflected the desired reforms of the progressive council members and some of the reforms demanded by the peasants of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] did not go undenied.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt; The deliberate Council passed 210 reform bills by Kim Hongjip. At the first stage of reform, there was little interference from Japan.

Two-hundred and ten articles were established, most notably the restructuring of central government by greatly reducing the king's responsibilities and placing more power in the ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]''. The ''gwageo'' system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; 
Other social reforms were addressed as well; discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry. These reforms would legally change the traditional feudal system that had been followed for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

===Second reforms===
The second state of reform took place from December 1894 to July 1895. Japan closed down the ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' in December 1894 as the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War was leaning to their favor and set up a new coalition cabinet consisting of Kim Hongjip and Park Younghyo. The cabinet presented a new law, ''Hongbeom 14jo'' (홍범 14조, "Exemplary Rules" 14 articles), which proclaimed the severance of the subordinate relationship with China, abolishment of nepotism in government, restructure of government offices and their duties. With this law as foundation, 213 new articles were created.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;
The names of ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]'' and its subsidiaries were changed to the modern ''naegak'' (내각, cabinet) and ''bu'' (부, department). Administrative districts were reorganized to 23 ''bu''(부, region) and 337 ''gun''(군, district). New financial bureaus were installed throughout the nation to overlook tax affairs, military and police systems were rehauled and modernized, judicial systems were changed with new courthouse and judiciary laws.&lt;ref name="gabo daum"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b01g1339a Gabo Reforms] at Daum Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

The second reform measures were halted when Park Young Hyo, who had been at the center of the reform efforts, fled to Japan after being accused of conspiracy to treason by those who were against the reformations that were taking place.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} Kang Junman (강준만), ''Walk through Korea's Modern History 2'' (한국근대사산책 2) p291, [http://inmul.co.kr/ Inmul Publishing Co.(인물과 사상사)], Seoul, 2007. {{ISBN|978-89-5906-072-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination of Queen Min, 1895 ===

When he heard the news, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] returned to the royal palace the same day.&lt;ref name="Dong-a 2002"/&gt; On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and the crown prince moved from Gyeongbokgung to the [[Russia]]n legation in [[Jeong-dong]], Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation]]. After returning to the royal palace, the royal family was still guarded by Russian guards.

In the midst of disarray in Joseon politics at this time, a series of [[Seonbi]] scholars mobilized volunteers to fight against the external foreign influence on the government. This also led to the uprising of the Eulmi temporary armies aimed at avenging the assassination of Queen Min.

===Third reforms===
Spurred greatly by the assassination of the queen and subsequent unrest, the government, then led by a new progressive cabinet headed by [[Kim Hong-jip]] and [[Yu Kil-chun]], carried out reforms from October 1895 to February 1896.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=4790 Gabo Reforms] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"&gt;''Korea through the Ages Vol. 2'' p40-p43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books id=XB4UYXNQK1wC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;dq=Gabo+reforms+Kim+Hong+jip&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Y64Oh8n2h&amp;sig=WaF0OZsvJAANg-ispTdZ6V_Be3c&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; A special reform body, ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' (군국기무처, Deliberative Council), was created to establish rules.&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; Their policies resulted in the official discarding of the [[lunar calendar]] in favor of the modern Gregorian [[solar calendar]], the official designation of [[regnal years]] independent of the Chinese tradition, the creation of a [[mail|postal service]], the introduction of primary schools and a new educational system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/04/181_24875.html Gabo Reforms], [[Korea Times]], 2008-05-28. Retrieved 2010-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; and the renewal of the military system.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

The most controversial reform at this time was the proclamation of the "Short Hair Act" ({{korean|hangul=단발령|hanja=斷髮令}}), i.e. cutting off the traditional Korean male sangtu and reformation of traditional attire. It triggered many protests among the people, most notably the conservative scholars, who were already disillusioned by the pro-Japanese cabinet. They had created the [[Righteous Army]] and had actively protested nationwide; protests which escalated after the assassination of Empress Myeongseong in 1895. After King Gojong and the [[Sunjong of Korea|Crown Prince]] fled for refuge to the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation|Russian legation]] in 1896, this opposition resulted in the murders of Kim Hongjip and other cabinet members, and the reformations came to an end.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;

===Main provisions of the Gabo Reform===
The Gabo Reform was similar to the [[Meiji Restoration]] in [[Japan]] and produced the following sweeping changes and declarations:&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt;
# Korea is a sovereign country (i.e., completely independent from [[China]]'s external interference).
# Hierarchical society ([[social class|class]] system) is abolished. Social privileges of the yangban class are eliminated.
# Those with talent are to be allowed to study and appointed to government posts based on merit alone, regardless of social class.
# The army is to be established on the basis of conscription, regardless of background. A modern police force and military are established.
# All official documents are to be written in [[Hangul]], and not [[hanja]] (Chinese characters).
# [[Tanning (leather)|Leather working]], [[acting]], and so on are to no longer be regarded as degrading work, and the people who do them are no longer outcastes. 
# A sound system of fiscal management and to use the government's fiscal resources to create wealth for the country is developed.
# Torture of suspects and witnesses was banned, guilt by association ended (punishment of family members of criminals)
# End of merchant monopolies
# Ban of sale of slaves from 1886 confirmed, and all forms of [[slavery in Korea|legal slavery]] ended
# Marriage age raised to twenty for men, sixteen for women (outlawing child marriage)

=== Protests for democracy and the proclamation of Korean Empire, 1896-1898 ===
{{Main|Independence Club|Korean Empire}}
After the Royal Refuge, some Korean activists established the [[Independence Club]] (독립협회, 獨立協會) in 1896. They claimed that Korea should negotiate with Western powers, particularly Russia, to counterbalance the growing influence of Japan and Russia. This club had contributed to the construction of [[Independence Gate]], and they held regular meetings at the [[Jongno]] streets, demanding [[democracy|democratic]] reforms as Korea became a constitutional monarchy, and an end to Japanese and Russian influence in Korean affairs. In October 1897, King Gojong decided to return to his other palace, [[Deoksugung]], and proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]]. During this period, the Korean government conducted a westernization policy. It was not an enduring reform, however, and the Independence Club was dissolved on 25 December 1898 as [[Emperor Gojong]] officially announced a prohibition on unofficial congresses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17042">The '''Groves Classification''' is a numbering system to enable the shape of any [[academic dress|academic gown or hood]] to be easily described and identified. It was devised by Nicholas Groves to establish a common terminology for hoods and gown to remedy the situation of individual universities using differing terms to describe the same item. As such it is used in same manner as an heraldic blazon whereby a textual description enables a coat of arms to be drawn. The system was first described in the Burgon Society's annual in 2001 and adopted as standard by robe makers and scholars of academic dress.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'&gt;{{Citation | surname=Groves| given=Nicholas | author-link= | title=Towards a Standard Terminology for Describing Academic Dress | journal=The Burgon Society Annual |volume=1 |issue= | year=2001 | pages=9–12 | url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/library/trans/annual2001.pdf }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Groves Classification included a standardization for shapes and patterns of hoods and gowns worn by graduates and undergraduates. Further information was given regarding the use of different fabrics and standardization of colors, but the focus was placed on gowns and hoods which are explained further below.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'/&gt;

The Classification undergoes periodic revision as new hood and gown patterns emerge.

===Hoods===
Hoods in the Classification are divided into three different types as summarised in the table below. Unlike the gowns and robes, these are based on the shape of the hood rather than the degrees for which they are worn.

*'''[f]''' full shape hoods are those that have a [[cape]], a [[cowl]] and a [[liripipe]].
*'''[s]''' simple shape hoods have only a cowl and a liripipe.
*'''[a]''' Aberdeen shape hoods have only a cape and a vestigial cowl.

===Gowns===
Gowns in the Groves system are divided into three classes. These generally follow the shapes associated with each different [[academic degree]] in the British educational system. 
*[b] [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] gowns typically have large open sleeves
*[m] [[master's degree|master's]] gowns typically have long closed sleeves with armhole at elbow level
*[d] [[doctoral degree|doctor's]] robes vary in shape widely between institutions and are all classed as [d].

==Phylogeny and evolution==
The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[Crotalinae|pitviper]]s and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[Pythonidae|pythons]]. It evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.&lt;ref name="Pou92"&gt;Pough ''et al.'' 1992. Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[loreal pit]]s), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales (labial pits). Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. 
	
In [[viperidae|vipers]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily [[Crotalinae]]: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively by them to detect and target [[warm-blooded]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. In an experiment that tested snakes' abilities to locate a cool thermal refuge in an uncomfortably hot maze, all pitvipers were able to locate the refuge quickly and easily, while [[Viperinae|true vipers]] were unable to do so. This suggests that the pitvipers were using their pit organs to aid in thermoregulatory decisions.&lt;ref name="KBLaD"/&gt; It is also possible that the organ may even have evolved as a defensive adaptation rather than a predatory one, or that multiple pressures may have potentially contributed to the organ's development.&lt;ref name="Gre92"/&gt; The use of the heat pit to direct thermoregulation in pythons and boas has not yet been determined. [[Viperinae|Viperinae]] snakes (which lack pit organs) also use thermal cues to guide strike behavior, but not to guide thermoregulation.&lt;ref name="KBLaD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bre90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breidenbach | first1 = CV | year = 1990 | title = Thermal cues influence strikes in pitless vipers | url = | journal = Journal of Herpetology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 448–450 | doi=10.2307/1565074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
In [[Crotalinae|pitvipers]], the heat pit consists of a deep pocket in the rostrum with a [[Biological membrane|membrane]] stretched across it. Behind the membrane, an air-filled chamber provides air contact on either side of the membrane. The pit membrane is highly vascular and heavily innervated with numerous heat-sensitive receptors formed from terminal masses of the [[trigeminal nerve]] (terminal nerve masses, or TNMs). The receptors are therefore not discrete cells, but a part of the trigeminal nerve itself. The labial pit found in [[Boidae|boas]] and [[Pythonidae|pythons]] lacks the suspended membrane and consists more simply of a pit lined with a membrane that is similarly innervated and vascular, though the morphology of the [[vasculature]] differs between these snakes and [[Crotalinae|crotalines]]. The purpose of the vasculature, in addition to providing oxygen to the receptor terminals, is to rapidly cool the receptors to their thermo-neutral state after being heated by thermal radiation from a stimulus. Were it not for this vasculature, the receptor would remain in a warm state after being exposed to a warm stimulus, and would present the animal with afterimages even after the stimulus was removed.&lt;ref name="Gor03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goris | first1 = CR | display-authors = etal   | year = 2003 | title = The microvasculature of python pit organs: morphology and blood flow kinetics | url = | journal = Microvascular Research | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 179–185 | doi=10.1016/s0026-2862(03)00003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Diagram of the Crotaline Pit Organ.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the Crotaline pit organ.]]

===Neuroanatomy===
In all cases, the facial pit is innervated by the trigeminal nerve. In [[Crotalinae|crotalines]], information from the pit organ is relayed to the nucleus reticularus caloris in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] via the lateral descending trigeminal tract. From there, it is relayed to the contralateral [[optic tectum]]. In [[Boidae|boas]] and [[Pythonidae|pythons]], information from the labial pit is sent directly to the contralateral optic tectum via the lateral descending trigeminal tract, bypassing the nucleus reticularus caloris.&lt;ref name="New80"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = EA | last2 = Gruberd | first2 = ER | last3 = Hartline | first3 = PH | year = 1980 | title = The infrared trigemino-tectal pathway in the rattlesnake and in the python | url = | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1002/cne.901910309 | pmid=7410602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the optic tectum of the brain which eventually processes these infrared cues. This portion of the brain receives other sensory information as well, most notably [[optic]] stimulation, but also motor, [[proprioceptive]] and [[Sound|auditory]]. Some [[neurons]] in the tectum respond to visual or infrared stimulation alone; others respond more strongly to combined visual and infrared stimulation, and still others respond only to a combination of visual and infrared. Some neurons appear to be tuned to detect movement in one direction. It has been found that the snake’s visual and infrared maps of the world are overlaid in the optic tectum. This combined information is relayed via the tectum to the forebrain.&lt;ref name="Har78"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nerve fibers in the pit organ are constantly firing at a very low rate. Objects that are within a neutral temperature range do not change the rate of firing; the neutral range is determined by the average thermal radiation of all objects in the [[receptive field]] of the organ. The thermal radiation above a given threshold causes an increase in the temperature of the nerve fiber, resulting in stimulation of the nerve and subsequent firing, with increased temperature resulting in increased firing rate.&lt;ref name="Bul52"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = TH | last2 = Cowles | first2 = RB | year = 1952 | title = Physiology of an infrared receptor: the facial pit of pit vipers | url = | journal = Science | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 541–543 | doi=10.1126/science.115.2994.541-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity of the nerve fibers is estimated to be &gt;0.001&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Bak07"&gt;{{Citation| title = The imaging properties and sensitivity of the facial pits of pitvipers as determined by optical and heat-transfer analysis

The pit organ will adapt to a repeated stimulus; if an adapted stimulus is removed, there will be a fluctuation in the opposite direction. For example, if a warm object is placed in front of the snake, the organ will increase in firing rate at first, but after a while will adapt to the warm object and the firing rate of the nerves in the pit organ will return to normal. If that warm object is then removed, the pit organ will now register the space that it used to occupy as being colder, and as such the firing rate will be depressed until it adapts to the removal of the object. The [[Incubation period|latency period]] of adaptation is approximately 50-150&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="Bul52"/&gt;

The facial pit actually visualizes thermal radiation using the same optical principles as a [[pinhole camera]], wherein the location of a source of thermal radiation is determined by the location of the radiation on the membrane of the heat pit. However, studies that have visualized the thermal images seen by the facial pit using computer analysis have suggested that the resolution is actually extremely poor. The size of the opening of the pit results in poor resolution of small, warm objects, and coupled with the pit's small size and subsequent poor [[heat conduction]], the image produced is of extremely low resolution and contrast. It is known that some focusing and sharpening of the image occurs in the lateral descending trigeminal tract, and it is possible that the visual and infrared integration that occurs in the tectum may also be used to help sharpen the image. In addition, snakes may deliberately choose ambush sites with low thermal [[background radiation]] (colder areas) to maximize the contrast of their warm prey in order to achieve such a high degree of accuracy from their thermal “vision”.&lt;ref name="Bak07"/&gt;

===Molecular mechanism===
In spite of its detection of infrared light, the infrared detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors - while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is a type of [[transient receptor potential channel]], [[TRPA1]] which is a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.&lt;ref name="Gracheva09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gracheva|first=Elena O. |author2=Nicholas T. Ingolia |author3=Yvonne M. Kelly |author4=Julio F. Cordero-Morales |author5=Gunther Hollopeter |author6=Alexander T. Chesler |author7=Elda E. Sánchez |author8=John C. Perez |author9=Jonathan S.

This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which would allow incoming infrared radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as the vascularization of the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original temperature state.  While the molecular precursors of this mechanism are found in other snakes, the protein is both expressed to a much lower degree and is much less sensitive to heat.&lt;ref name="Gracheva09"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6739">{{Judicial interpretation}}
'''Judicial interpretation''' refers to different ways that the [[judiciary]] uses to [[statutory interpretation|interpret]] the [[law]], particularly [[constitution]]al documents and legislation. This is an important issue in some [[common law jurisdictions]] such as the [[Law of the United States|United States]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]] and [[Law of Canada|Canada]], because the [[Supreme court|supreme courts]] of those nations can overturn laws made by their legislatures via a process called [[judicial review]]. 

For example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has decided such topics as the legality of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as in the [[Dred Scott decision]], and [[desegregation]] as in the ''[[Brown v Board of Education]]'' decision, and [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] as in the ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' decision. As a result, how justices interpret the constitution, and the ways in which they approach this task has a political aspect. Terms describing types of judicial interpretation can be ambiguous; for example, the term ''judicial conservatism'' can vary in meaning depending on what is trying to be "conserved". One can look at judicial interpretation along a continuum from [[judicial restraint]] to [[judicial activism]], with different viewpoints along the continuum.

==Basis for judicial interpretation==

In the [[United States]], there are different ways to do judicial interpretation:

* ''Balancing'' happens when judges weigh one set of interests or rights against an opposing set, typically used to make rulings in [[First Amendment to the Constitution|First Amendment]] cases. For example, cases involving [[freedom of speech]] sometimes require justices to make a distinction between legally permissible speech and speech that can be restricted or banned for, say, reasons of safety, and the task then is for justices to balance these conflicting claims. The balancing approach was criticized by Supreme Court justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] who argued that the Constitution gives no guidance about how to weigh or measure divergent interests.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs&gt;{{cite book
 |author= John E. Finn
 |title= Civil Liberties and the Bill of Rights
 |publisher= The Teaching Company
 |chapter= Part I: Lecture 4: The Court and Constitutional Interpretation |pages=52, 53, 54
 |year= 2006
 |accessdate= 2013-01-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doctrinalism considers how various parts of the Constitution have been "shaped by the Court's own jurisprudence", according to Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* Functionalism.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* ''Founders' Intent'' involves judges trying to gauge the intentions of the authors of the Constitution. Problems can arise when judges try to determine which particular Founders or Framers to consult, as well as trying to determine what they meant based on often sparse and incomplete documentation.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* [[Originalism]] involves judges trying to apply the "original" meanings of different constitutional provisions.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt; To determine the original meaning, a constitutional provision is interpreted in its ''original'' context, i.e. the historical, literary, and political context of the framers. From that interpretation, the underlying principle is derived which is then applied to the contemporary situation. Former [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] justice [[Antonin Scalia]] believed that the text of the constitution should mean the same thing today as it did when it had been written. A report in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' suggested that originalism was the "view that the Constitution should be interpreted in accordance with its original meaning — that is, the meaning it had at the time of its enactment."&lt;ref name=twsWashPostJan2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/01/neil-gorsuch-antonin-scalia-and-originalism-explained/?wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;wpmm=1 |title=Neil Gorsuch, Antonin Scalia and originalism, explained |last=Blake |first=Aaron |date=February 1, 2017 |website= |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=February 1, 2017 |quote=...the view that law laid down by the framers in the Constitution remains binding until we legally change it, such as through the amendment process....}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Meaning" based on ''original'' principles.
* [[Prudentialism]] discourages judges from setting broad rules for possible future cases, and advises courts to play a limited role.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* ''Precedent'' is judges deciding a case by looking to the decision of a previous and similar case according to the legal principle of [[stare decisis]], by finding a rule or principle in an earlier case to guide their judgment in a current case.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* [[Strict constructionism]] involves judges interpreting the text only as it was written; once a clear meaning has been established, there is no need for further analysis, based on this way, which advocates that judges should avoid drawing inferences from previous statutes or the constitution and instead focus on exactly what was written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/APGOV_Judiciary.htm "The Judiciary: The Power of the Federal Judiciary"], The Social Studies Help Center&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Justice [[Hugo Black]] argued that the First Amendment's wording in reference to certain civil rights that ''Congress shall make no law'' should mean exactly that: ''no'' law, ''no'' exceptions.
* [[Structuralism]] is a way judges use by searching for the meaning of a particular constitutional principle only by "reading it against the larger constitutional document or context," according to Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt; Judges try to understand how a particular ruling fits within the larger structure of the entire constitution.
* [[Textualism]]  primarily interprets the [[law]] based on the ordinary meaning of the legal text.

[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 anti-race.svg|thumb|right|An example Karnaugh map. This image actually shows two Karnaugh maps: for the function ''ƒ'', using [[minterm]]s (colored rectangles) and for its complement, using [[maxterm]]s (gray rectangles). In the image, ''E''() signifies a sum of minterms, denoted in the article as &lt;math&gt;\sum m_i&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The '''Karnaugh map''' ('''KM''' or '''K-map''') is a method of simplifying [[Boolean algebra]] expressions. [[Maurice Karnaugh]] introduced it in 1953&lt;ref name="Karnaugh_1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis_1962"/&gt; as a refinement of [[Edward Veitch]]'s 1952 '''Veitch chart''',&lt;ref name="Veitch_1952"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; which actually was a rediscovery of [[Allan Marquand]]'s 1881 ''logical diagram''&lt;ref name="Marquand_1881"/&gt; aka '''Marquand diagram'''&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; but with a focus now set on its utility for switching circuits.&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; Veitch charts are therefore also known as ''Marquand–Veitch diagrams'',&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; and Karnaugh maps as ''Karnaugh–Veitch maps'' (''KV maps'').

The Karnaugh map reduces the need for extensive calculations by taking advantage of humans' pattern-recognition capability.&lt;ref name="Karnaugh_1953"/&gt; It also permits the rapid identification and elimination of potential [[race condition]]s.

The required Boolean results are transferred from a [[truth table]] onto a two-dimensional grid where, in Karnaugh maps, the cells are ordered in [[Gray code]],&lt;ref name="Wakerly_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2012"/&gt; and each cell position represents one combination of input conditions, while each cell value represents the corresponding output value. Optimal groups of 1s or 0s are identified, which represent the terms of a [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical form]] of the logic in the original truth table.&lt;ref name="Belton_1998"/&gt; These terms can be used to write a minimal Boolean expression representing the required logic.

Karnaugh maps are used to simplify real-world logic requirements so that they can be implemented using a minimum number of physical logic gates. A [[Conjunctive normal form|sum-of-products expression]] can always be implemented using [[AND gate]]s feeding into an [[OR gate]], and a [[Disjunctive normal form|product-of-sums expression]] leads to OR gates feeding an AND gate.&lt;ref name="Dodge_2016"/&gt; Karnaugh maps can also be used to simplify logic expressions in software design. Boolean conditions, as used for example in [[Conditional (programming)|conditional statements]], can get very complicated, which makes the code difficult to read and to maintain. Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.&lt;ref name="Cook_2012"/&gt; Diagrammatic and mechanical methods for minimizing simple logic expressions have existed since at least the medieval times. More systematic methods for minimizing complex expressions began to be developed in the early 1950s, but until the mid to late 1980's the Karnaugh map was the most common used in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1097|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Karnaugh maps are used to facilitate the simplification of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] functions. For example, consider the Boolean function described by the following [[truth table]].

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"

Following are two different notations describing the same function in unsimplified Boolean algebra, using the Boolean variables {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}}, {{mvar|C}}, {{mvar|D}}, and their inverses.

*&lt;math&gt;f(A, B, C, D) = \sum_{}m_i, i \in \{6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; are the [[minterm]]s to map (i.e., rows that have output 1 in the truth table).
*&lt;math&gt;f(A, B, C, D) = \prod_{}M_i, i \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 15\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; are the [[maxterm]]s to map (i.e., rows that have output 0 in the truth table).

===Karnaugh map===
[[File:Karnaugh6.gif|center|thumb|400px|K-map drawn on a torus, and in a plane. The dot-marked cells are adjacent.]]
[[File:K-map minterms A.svg|thumb|right|K-map construction. Instead of the output values (the rightmost values in the truth table), this diagram shows a decimal representation of the input ABCD (the leftmost values in the truth table), therefore it is not a Karnaugh map.]]
[[File:Torus from rectangle.gif|thumb|right|In three dimensions, one can bend a rectangle into a torus.]]

1)In this time the four input variables can be combined in 16 different ways, so the truth table has 16 rows, and the K-map has 16 positions. The K-map is therefore arranged in a 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 grid.

The row and column indices (shown across the top, and down the left side of the Karnaugh map) are ordered in [[Gray code]] rather than binary numerical order. Gray code ensures that only one variable changes between each pair of adjacent cells. Each cell of the completed Karnaugh map contains a binary digit representing the function's output for that combination ofÀ inputs.

After the Karnaugh map has been constructed, it is used to find one of the simplest possible forms — a [[Canonical form (Boolean expression)|canonical form]] — for the information in the truth table. Adjacent 1s in the Karnaugh map represent opportunities to simplify the expression. The minterms ('minimal terms') for the final expression are found by encircling groups of 1s in the map. Minterm groups must be rectangular and must have an area that is a power of two (i.e., 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;8…). Minterm rectangles should be as large as possible without containing any 0s. Groups may overlap in order to make each one larger. The optimal groupings in the example below are marked by the green, red and blue lines, and the red and green groups overlap. The red group is a 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 square, the green group is a 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1 rectangle, and the overlap area is indicated in brown.

The cells are often denoted by a shorthand which describes the logical value of the inputs that the cell covers. For example, {{mvar|AD}} would mean a cell which covers the 2x2 area where {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|D}} are true, i.e. the cells numbered 13, 9, 15, 11 in the diagram above. On the other hand, {{mvar|A{{overline|D}}}} would mean the cells where {{mvar|A}} is true and {{mvar|D}} is false (that is, {{mvar|{{overline|D}}}} is true).

The grid is [[torus|toroidally]] connected, which means that rectangular groups can wrap across the edges (see picture). Cells on the extreme right are actually 'adjacent' to those on the far left, in the sense that the corresponding input values only differ by one bit's; similarly, so are those at the very top and those at the bottom. Therefore, {{mvar|A{{overline|D}}}} can be a valid term—it includes cells 12 and 8 at the top, and wraps to the bottom to include cells 10 and 14—as is {{mvar|{{overline|B}}, {{overline|D}}}}, which includes the four corners.

===Solution===
[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.svg|thumb|Diagram showing two K-maps. The K-map for the function f(A, B, C, D) is shown as colored rectangles which correspond to minterms. The brown region is an overlap of the red 2×2 square and the green 4×1 rectangle. The K-map for the inverse of f is shown as gray rectangles, which correspond to maxterms.]]

Once the Karnaugh map has been constructed and the adjacent 1s linked by rectangular and square boxes, the algebraic minterms can be found by examining which variables stay the same within each box.

For the red grouping:
* ''A'' is the same and is equal to 1 throughout the box, therefore it should be included in the algebraic representation of the red minterm.
* ''B'' does not maintain the same state (it shifts from 1 to 0), and should therefore be excluded.
* ''C'' does not change. It is always 0, so its complement, NOT-C, should be included. Thus, {{mvar|{{overline|C}}}} should be included.
* ''D'' changes, so it is excluded.

Thus the first minterm in the Boolean sum-of-products expression is {{mvar|A{{overline|C}}}}.

For the green grouping, ''A'' and ''B'' maintain the same state, while ''C'' and ''D'' change. ''B'' is 0 and has to be negated before it can be included. The second term is therefore {{mvar|A{{overline|B}}}}. Note that it is acceptable that the green grouping overlaps with the red one.

In the same way, the blue grouping gives the term {{mvar|BC{{overline|D}}}}.

The solutions of each grouping are combined: the normal form of the circuit is &lt;math&gt;AB\overline{C} + A\overline{B} + BC\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the Karnaugh map has guided a simplification of
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              f(A, B, C, D) = {} &amp;\overline{A}BC\overline{D} + A\overline{B}\,\overline{C}\,\overline{D} + A\overline{B}\,\overline{C}D + A\overline{B}C\overline{D} + {}\\
                                 &amp;A\overline{B}CD + AB\overline{C}\,\overline{D} + AB\overline{C}D + ABC\overline{D}\\
                            = {} &amp;AB\overline{C} + A\overline{B} + BC\overline{D}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It would also have been possible to derive this simplification by carefully applying the [[Boolean algebra (logic)#Axiomatizing Boolean algebra|axioms of boolean algebra]], but the time it takes to do that grows exponentially with the number of terms.

===Inverse===
The inverse of a function is solved in the same way by grouping the 0s instead.

The three terms to cover the inverse are all shown with grey boxes with different colored borders:
*brown: {{mvar|{{overline|A}}, {{overline|B}}}}
*gold: {{mvar|{{overline|A}}, {{overline|C}}}}
*blue: {{mvar|BCD}}

This yields the inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{f(A,B,C,D)} = \overline{A}\,\overline{B} + \overline{A}\,\overline{C} + BCD&lt;/math&gt;

Through the use of [[De Morgan's laws]], the [[product of sums]] can be determined:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(A,B,C,D) &amp;= \overline{\overline{f(A,B,C,D)}} \\
            &amp;= \overline{\overline{A}\,\overline{B} + \overline{A}\,\overline{C} + BCD} \\
            &amp;= \left(\overline{\overline{A}\,\overline{B}}\right) \left(\overline{\overline{A}\,\overline{C}}\right) \left(\overline{BCD}\right) \\
            &amp;= \left(A + B\right)\left(A + C\right)\left(\overline{B} + \overline{C} + \overline{D}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Don't cares===
[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 don't care.svg|thumb|The value of {{tmath|f(A,B,C,D)}} for ''ABCD'' = 1111 is replaced by a "don't care". This removes the green term completely and allows the red term to be larger. It also allows blue inverse term to shift and become larger]]

Karnaugh maps also allow easy minimizations of functions whose truth tables include "[[Don't-care (logic)|don't care]]" conditions. A "don't care" condition is a combination of inputs for which the designer doesn't care what the output is. Therefore, "don't care" conditions can either be included in or excluded from any rectangular group, whichever makes it larger. They are usually indicated on the map with a dash or X.

The example on the right is the same as the example above but with the value of ''f''(1,1,1,1) replaced by a "don't care". This allows the red term to expand all the way down and, thus, removes the green term completely.

This yields the new minimum equation:
:&lt;math&gt;f(A,B,C,D) = A + BC\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the first term is just {{mvar|A}}, not {{mvar|A{{overline|C}}}}. In this case, the don't care has dropped a term (the green rectangle); simplified another (the red one); and removed the race hazard (removing the yellow term as shown in the following section on race hazards).

The inverse case is simplified as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{f(A,B,C,D)} = \overline{A}\,\overline{B} + \overline{A}\,\overline{C} + \overline{A}D&lt;/math&gt;

==Race hazards==
===Elimination===
Karnaugh maps are useful for detecting and eliminating [[race condition]]s. Race hazards are very easy to spot using a Karnaugh map, because a race condition may exist when moving between any pair of adjacent, but disjoint, regions circumscribed on the map. However, because of the nature of Gray coding, ''adjacent'' has a special definition explained above – we're in fact moving on a torus, rather than a rectangle, wrapping around the top, bottom, and the sides.

* In the example [[Karnaugh map#Solution|above]], a potential race condition exists when ''C'' is 1 and ''D'' is 0, ''A'' is 1, and ''B'' changes from 1 to 0 (moving from the blue state to the green state). For this case, the output is defined to remain unchanged at 1, but because this transition is not covered by a specific term in the equation, a potential for a ''glitch'' (a momentary transition of the output to 0) exists.
* There is a second potential glitch in the same example that is more difficult to spot: when ''D'' is 0 and ''A'' and ''B'' are both 1, with C changing from 1 to 0 (moving from the blue state to the red state). In this case the glitch wraps around from the top of the map to the bottom.

[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.svg|thumb|Race hazards are present in this diagram.]]
[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 anti-race.svg|thumb|Above diagram with consensus terms added to avoid race hazards.]]

Whether glitches will actually occur depends on the physical nature of the implementation, and whether we need to worry about it depends on the application. In clocked logic, it is enough that the logic settles on the desired value in time to meet the timing deadline. In our example, we are not considering clocked logic.

In our case, an additional term of &lt;math&gt;A\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt; would eliminate the potential race hazard, bridging between the green and blue output states or blue and red output states: this is shown as the yellow region (which wraps around from the bottom to the top of the right half) in the adjacent diagram.

The term is [[logic redundancy|redundant]] in terms of the static logic of the system, but such redundant, or [[consensus theorem|consensus terms]], are often needed to assure race-free dynamic performance.

Similarly, an additional term of &lt;math&gt;\overline{A}D&lt;/math&gt; must be added to the inverse to eliminate another potential race hazard. Applying De Morgan's laws creates another product of sums expression for ''f'', but with a new factor of &lt;math&gt;\left(A + \overline{D}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===2-variable map examples===
The following are all the possible 2-variable, 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 Karnaugh maps. Listed with each is the minterms as a function of &lt;math&gt;\sum m()&lt;/math&gt; and the race hazard free (''see [[#Race hazards|previous section]]'') minimum equation. A minterm is defined as an expression that gives the most minimal form of expression of the mapped variables. All possible horizontal and vertical interconnected blocks can be formed. These blocks must be of the size of the powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...). These expressions create a minimal logical mapping of the minimal logic variable expressions for the binary expressions to be mapped. Here are all the blocks with one field.

A block can be continued across the bottom, top, left, or right of the chart. That can even wrap beyond the edge of the chart for variable minimization. This is because each logic variable corresponds to each vertical column and horizontal row. A visualization of the k-map can be considered cylindrical. The fields at edges on the left and right are adjacent, and the top and bottom are adjacent. K-Maps for four variables must be depicted as a donut or torus shape. The four corners of the square drawn by the k-map are adjacent. Still more complex maps are needed for 5 variables and more.

'''Krogh's principle''' states that "for such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied." This concept is central to those disciplines of [[biology]] that rely on the [[comparative method]], such as [[neuroethology]], [[comparative physiology]], and more recently [[functional genomics]].

==History==
Krogh's principle is named after the Danish physiologist [[August Krogh]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] for his contributions to understanding the anatomy and physiology of the [[capillary|capillary system]], who described it in The American Journal of Physiology in 1929.   However, the principle was first elucidated nearly 60 years prior to this, and in almost the same words as Krogh, in 1865 by [[Claude Bernard]], the French instigator of experimental medicine, on page 27 of his "Introduction à l'étude de la médecine expérimentale":

Dans l'investigation scientifique, les moindres procédés sont de la plus haute importance. '''Le choix heureux d'un animal''', d'un instrument construit d'une certaine façon, l'emploi d'un réactif au lieu d'un autre, suffisent souvent pour résoudre les questions générales les plus élevées.

Claude Bernard: ''Introduction à l'étude de la médecine expérimentale'', J.B. Baillière et Fils, Libraires de L'Académie Impériale de Médecine, 1865. pp. 400}}

Krogh wrote the following in his 1929 treatise on the then current 'status' of physiology (emphasis added):
{{quote|

...I want to emphasize that the route by which we can strive toward the ideal is by a study of the vital functions in all their aspects throughout the myriads of [[organism]]s. We may find out, nay, we will find out before very long the essential mechanisms of [[mammal]]ian [[renal function|kidney function]], but the general problem of [[excretion]] can be solved only when excretory [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s are studied wherever we find them and in all their essential modifications. Such studies will be sure, moreover, to expand and deepen our insight into problems of the [[human]] [[kidney]] and will prove of value also from the narrowest [[utilitarian]] point of view.

'''For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied'''.  Many years ago when my teacher, [[Christian Bohr]], was interested in the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] mechanism of the [[lung]] and devised the method of studying the exchange through each lung separately, he found that a certain kind of [[tortoise]] possessed a [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] dividing into the main [[bronchus|bronchi]] high up in the neck, and we used to say as a laboratory joke that this animal had been created expressly for the purposes of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration physiology]].  I have no doubt that there is quite a number of animals which are similarly "created" for special [[physiology|physiological]] purposes, but I am afraid that most of them are unknown to the men for whom they were "created," and we must apply to the [[zoologist]]s to find them and lay our hands on them."

August Krogh ''The Progress of Physiology'', The American Journal of Physiology, 1929. 90(2) pp. 243-251}}

"Krogh's principle" was not utilized as a formal term until 1975 when the biochemist [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] (who initially described the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]), first referred to it.

More recently, at the International Society for Neuroethology meeting in [[Nyborg]], [[Denmark]] in 2004, Krogh's principle was cited as a central principle by the group at their 7th Congress.  Krogh's principle has also been receiving attention in the area of [[functional genomics]], where there has been increasing pressure and desire to expand genomics research to a more wide variety of organisms beyond the traditional scope of the field.

==Philosophy and applications==
A central concept to Krogh's principle is evolutionary adaptation.  Evolutionary theory maintains that organisms are suited to particular [[Ecological niche|niches]], some of which are highly specialized for solving particular biological problems.  These adaptations are typically exploited by biologists in several ways:

[[Image:Thermus aquaticus.JPG|thumb|''Thermus aquaticus'']]
*'''Methodology''': (e.g. [[Taq polymerase]] and [[PCR]]): The need to manipulate biological systems in the laboratory has driven the use of an organismal specialization.  One example of Krogh's principle presents itself in the heavily used [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR), a method which relies on the rapid exposure of [[DNA]] to high heat for amplification of particular sequences of interest.  [[DNA polymerase]] [[enzyme]] from many organisms would denature at high temperatures, however, to solve this problem, Chien and colleagues turned to ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', a strain of bacteria native to [[hydrothermal vent]]s.  ''Thermus aquaticus'' has a polymerase that is heat stable at temperatures necessary for PCR.  Biochemically modified Taq polymerase, as it is usually called, is now routinely used in PCR applications.
*'''Overcoming technical limitations''': (e.g. large  [[neuron]]s in [[Mollusca]]):  Two Nobel Prize–winning bodies of study were facilitated by using ideas central to Krogh's principle to overcome technical limitations in [[nervous system]] physiology.  The [[ion channel|ionic basis]] of the [[action potential]] was elucidated in the [[squid giant axon]] in 1958 by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], developers of the original [[voltage clamp]] device and co-recipients of the 1963 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].  The voltage clamp is now a central piece of technology in modern [[neurophysiology]], but was only possible to develop using the wide diameter of the squid giant axon.  Another marine mollusc, the [[opisthobranch]] [[Aplysia]] possesses relatively small number of large [[nerve cell]]s that are easily identified and mapped from individual to individual.  Aplysia was selected for these reasons for the study of the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory which led to [[Eric Kandel]]'s receipt of the Nobel Prize in 2000.

[[Image:Tyto alba close up.jpg|thumb|''Tyto alba'', the Barn Owl]]
*'''Understanding more complex/subtle systems''' (e.g. [[Barn owls]] and [[sound localization]]):  Beyond overcoming technical limitations, Krogh's principle has particularly important implications in the light of [[convergent evolution]] and [[homology (biology)|homology]].  Either because of evolutionary history, or particular constraints on a given niche, there are not infinite solutions to all biological problems.  Instead, organisms utilize similar neural algorithms, behaviors, or even structures to accomplish similar tasks.  If one's goal is to understand how the nervous system might localize objects using sound, one may take the approach of using an [[auditory system|auditory]] 'specialist' such as the barn owl studied by [[Masakazu Konishi|Mark Konishi]], [[Eric Knudsen]] and their colleagues.  A [[nocturnal]] [[predator]] by nature, the barn owl relies heavily on using precise information on the time of arrival of sound in its ears.  The information gleaned from this approach has contributed heavily to our understanding of how the brain maps sensory space, and how nervous systems encode timing information.

'''Languaculture''' is a term meaning that a [[language]] includes not only elements such as grammar and vocabulary, but also past knowledge, local and cultural information, habits and behaviours. The term was created by the American anthropologist [[Michael Agar]].

==Meaning==
Agar used the term "languaculture" for the first time in his essay ''Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation''. Languaculture is an adjustment of the term "linguaculture", suggested by the American [[linguistic anthropologist]] Paul Friedrich. Agar explains the [[vowel change]] stating that language is a more commonly used word.

When Agar talks about languaculture, he defines it as the necessary tie between language and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Agar, Michael,|year=1995|title=''[[Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation]]''|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underlines that languages and cultures are always closely related and it is not possible to distinguish languages from cultures. Therefore, you cannot really know a language if you do not know also the culture expressed by that language.

The notion of culture and its understanding involve the link between two different languacultures that Agar define LC1 (source languaculture) and LC2 (target languaculture).

==Rich points==
{{Inappropriate person|section|date=August 2016}}The learning of target languaculture is driven by "rich points". We realize that a culture is different from ours when we face some behaviours which we do not understand. Rich points are those surprises, those departures from an outsider’s expectations that signal a difference between source languaculture and target languaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agar, Michael|title=Culture: Can You Take It Anywhere?|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|article=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the moments of incomprehension, when you suddenly do not know what is happening. In this situation different reactions are possible. You can ignore the rich point and hope that the next part makes sense. You can perceive it as evidence that the person who produced it has some lacks. Or you can wonder why you do not understand and if maybe some other languaculture comes into play. Therefore, rich points belong to daily life and not only to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Agar, Michael,|year=1995|title=Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation | location=New York|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agar highlights that the term ''rich'' has the positive connotations of thickness, wealth and abundance. The largest rich point is the total incomprehension due to huge differences between source languaculture and target languaculture. In this case we are facing a ‘culture shock’ that causes a deep bewilderment. The smallest rich point can occur among different groups of the same community.
The existence of rich points comes from the fact that every statement implicitly refers to various elements that are taken for granted in a certain culture and do not match the elements of another culture (cultural implicitness).

==Culture in languaculture==
According to Agar, culture is a construction, a translation between source languaculture and target languaculture. Like a [[translation]], it makes no sense to talk about the culture of X without saying the culture of X for Y, taking into account the standpoint from which it is observed. For this reason culture is relational.
Moreover, culture is always plural. No person or group can be described, explained or generalized completely with a single cultural label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agar, Michael|title=Culture: Can You Take It Anywhere?|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|article=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49233">'''Language revitalization''', also referred to as '''language revival''' or '''reversing language shift''', is an attempt to halt or reverse the decline of a language or to revive an extinct one.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 169. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved can include parties such as linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments. Some argue for a distinction between '''language revival''' (the resurrection of a [[dead language]] with no existing native speakers) and '''language revitalization''' (the rescue of a "dying" language). It has been pointed out that there has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival, [[Revival of the Hebrew language|that of the Hebrew language]], creating a new generation of native speakers without any pre-existing native speakers as a model.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Redish (2001), ‘Native Languages of the Americas: Endangered Language Revitalization and Revival’.  http://www.native-languages.org/revive.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}

Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is [[Endangered language|severely limited]]. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive [[extinct language]]s. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or [[language death]].

Reasons for revitalization vary. In recent times{{when|date=January 2015}} alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Languages |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/ |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409141047/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/ |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique "cultural treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Grenoble, Lenore A., and Lindsay J. Whaley. Saving Languages: An Introduction to Language Revitalization. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. p. 20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A community often sees language as a unique part of their culture, connecting them with their ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of their history and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of [[language documentation]]. In this field, linguists attempt to create full records of a language's grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.&lt;ref&gt;New Perspectives on Endangered Languages. Ed. José A.F. Farfán and Fernando F. Ramallo. Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2010. pp. 1-7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
==The four degrees of language endangerment==
;Healthy/strong
:all generations use language in variety of settings
;Weakening/sick
:spoken by older people; not fully used in younger generations
;Moribund/dying
:only a few speakers (non-children) remain; no longer used as [[first language|native language]] by children
;Dead
:no longer spoken as a native language
;Extinct
:no longer spoken or potentially spoken

==Theory==
One of the most important preliminary steps in language revitalization/recovering involves establishing the degree to which a particular language has been “dislocated”. This helps involved parties find the best way to assist or revive the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsunoda|first=Tasaku|title=Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization|year=2005|publisher=Mounton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps in reversing language shift===
There are many different theories or models that attempt to lay out a plan for language revitalization. One of these is provided by celebrated linguist [[Joshua Fishman]].
Fishman's model for reviving threatened (or sleeping) languages, or for making them sustainable,&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, J. A. (1991). ''Reversing language Shift: Theory and Practice of Assistance to Threatened Languages''. Clevedon : Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, J. A. (ed.) (2001). ''Can Threatened Languages Be Saved? Reversing Language Shift, Revisited: A 21st Century Perspective''. Clevedon : Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of an eight-stage process. Efforts should be concentrated on the earlier stages of restoration until they have been consolidated before proceeding to the later stages. The eight stages are:

#Acquisition of the language by adults, who in effect act as language apprentices (recommended where most of the remaining speakers of the language are elderly and socially isolated from other speakers of the language).
#Create a socially integrated population of active speakers (or users) of the language (at this stage it is usually best to concentrate mainly on the spoken language rather than the written language).
#In localities where there are a reasonable number of people habitually using the language, encourage the informal use of the language among people of all age groups and within families and bolster its daily use through the establishment of local neighbourhood institutions in which the language is encouraged, protected and (in certain contexts at least) used exclusively.
#In areas where oral competence in the language has been achieved in all age groups, encourage literacy in the language, but in a way that does not depend upon assistance from (or goodwill of) the state education system.
#Where the state permits it, and where numbers warrant, encourage the use of the language in compulsory state education.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in the workplace (lower worksphere).
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in local government services and mass media.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage use of the language in higher education, government, etc.

This model of language revival is intended to direct efforts to where they are most effective and to avoid wasting energy trying to achieve the later stages of recovery when the earlier stages have not been achieved. For instance, it is probably wasteful to campaign for the use of a language on television or in government services if hardly any families are in the habit of using the language.

Additionally, Tasaku Tsunoda describes a range of different techniques or methods that speakers can use to try to revitalize a language, including techniques to revive extinct languages and maintain weak ones. The techniques he lists are often limited to the current vitality of the language.

He claims that the [[Language immersion|immersion]] method cannot be used to revitalize an extinct or moribund language. In contrast, the master-apprentice method of one-on-one transmission on language proficiency can be used with moribund languages. Several other methods of revitalization, including those that rely on technology such as recordings or media, can be used for languages in any state of viability.&lt;ref name=illustrate&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 201. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors in successful language revitalization===
[[David Crystal]], in his book ''Language Death'', proposes that language revitalization is more likely to be successful if its speakers
*increase the language's prestige within the dominant community;
*increase their wealth and income;
*increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community;
*have a strong presence in the education system;
*can write down the language;
*can use electronic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2000). ''Language Death''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 130-141. {{ISBN|0-521-65321-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival linguistics===
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] proposes "Revival Linguistics" as a new linguistic discipline and paradigm.
{{quote|Zuckermann's term 'Revival Linguistics' is modelled upon 'Contact Linguistics'. Revival linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] and Walsh, Michael 2011.  [https://adelaide.academia.edu/Zuckermann/Papers/267186/Stop_Revive_Survive_Lessons_from_the_Hebrew_Revival_Applicable_to_the_Reclamation_Maintenance_and_Empowerment_of_Aboriginal_Languages_and_Cultures 'Stop, Revive, Survive: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures'], ''Australian Journal of Linguistics'' Vol. 31, No. 1, pp. 111-127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Zuckermann, "revival linguistics combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning. After all, language reclamation is the most extreme case of second-language learning. Revival linguistics complements the established area of [[language documentation|documentary linguistics]], which records endangered languages before they fall asleep."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Zuckermann proposes that "revival linguistics changes the field of historical linguistics by, for instance, weakening the family [[tree model]], which implies that a language has only one parent."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

There are disagreements in the field of language revitalization as to the degree that revival should concentrate on maintaining the traditional language, versus allowing simplification or widespread borrowing from the [[majority language]].
====Compromise====
Zuckermann acknowledges the presence of "local peculiarities and idiosyncrasies"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Ghil'ad Zuckermann, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian, Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but suggests that &lt;blockquote&gt;"there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would help revivalists and first nations' leaders to work more efficiently. For example, it is easier to resurrect basic vocabulary and verbal conjugations than sounds and word order. Revivalists should be realistic and abandon discouraging, counter-productive slogans such as "Give us authenticity or give us death!"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Nancy Dorian]] has pointed out that conservative attitudes toward loanwords and grammatical changes often hamper efforts to revitalize endangered languages (as with [[Tiwi language|Tiwi]] in Australia), and  that a division can exist between educated revitalizers, interested in historicity, and remaining speakers interested in locally authentic idiom (as has sometimes occurred with [[Irish language|Irish]]). Some have argued that structural compromise may, in fact, enhance the prospects of survival, as may have been the case with English in the post-Norman period.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy C. Dorian, ‘Purism v. compromise in language revitalisation and language revival’ in 
''Language in Society'' 23, pp. 479-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traditionalist====
Other linguists have argued that when language revitalization borrows heavily from the majority language, the result is a new language, perhaps a [[creole language|creole]] or [[pidgin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Mari C.|title=Language Obsolescence and Revitalization: Linguistic Change in Two Sociolinguistically Contrasting Welsh Communities|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198237112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9u_GG41b_8C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq=neo+breton+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jg86DeYXE&amp;sig=52c4ZvYBqk2yVOeMfd47AqIN9UU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis8Pr4mpDTAhUD4IMKHaJcChwQ6AEIVzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=neo%20breton%20language&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the existence of "Neo-Hawaiian" as a separate language from "Traditional Hawaiian" has been proposed, due to the heavy influence of English on every aspect of the revived Hawaiian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=R. Keao NeSmith|title=Tūtū’s Hawaiian and the Emergence of a Neo Hawaiian Language|journal=‘Ōiwi Journal3—A Native Hawaiian Journal|date=2005|url=http://hstrial-knesmith.homestead.com/Oiwi-Journal-_3-1-09_.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been proposed for Irish, with a sharp division between "Urban Irish" spoken by second-language speakers and traditional Irish as spoken as a first language in [[Gaeltacht]] areas.

==Specific examples==
Total revival of a [[dead language]] (in the sense of having no [[native speaker]]s) into a self-sustaining community of several million [[first language]] speakers has happened only once, in the case of the [[Hebrew language]], now the [[national language]] of [[Israel]].  In this case, there was a unique set of historical and cultural characteristics that facilitated the revival (''see [[Revival of the Hebrew language]]'').

In a related development, [[literary language]]s without [[native speaker]]s enjoyed great prestige and practical utility as [[lingua franca]]s, often counting millions of fluent speakers at a time.  In many such cases, a decline in the use of the literary language, sometimes precipitous, was later accompanied by a strong renewal.  This happened, for example, in the revival of [[Classical Latin]] in the [[Renaissance]], and the revival of [[Sanskrit]] in the early centuries A.D.  An analogous phenomenon in contemporary [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking areas is the expanded use of the literary language ([[Modern Standard Arabic]], a form of the [[Classical Arabic]] of the 6th century A.D.). This is taught to all educated speakers and is used in radio broadcasts, formal discussions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, Alan S. "Arabic." Morphologies of Asia and Africa. Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2007. 560-77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, literary languages have sometimes risen to the level of becoming [[first language]]s of very large language communities.  An example is standard [[Italian language|Italian]], which originated as a literary language derived from the language of 13th-century [[Florence]], especially as used by such important Florentine writers as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]].  This language existed for several centuries primarily as a literary vehicle, with few native speakers; even as late as 1861, on the eve of [[Italian unification]], the language only counted about 500,000 speakers, many non-native, out of a total population of c. 22,000,000.  The subsequent success of the language has been through conscious development, where speakers of any of the numerous [[Italian languages]] were taught standard Italian as a [[second language]] and subsequently imparted it to their children, who learned it as a first language.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Of course this came at the expense of local Italian languages, most of which are now [[Languages_of_Italy#Conservation_status|endangered]]. Success was enjoyed in similar circumstances by [[German language|High German]], [[Czech language|standard Czech]], [[Spanish language|Castilian Spanish]] and other languages.

===Asia===
The [[Ainu language]] of the indigenous [[Ainu people]] of northern Japan is currently moribund, but efforts are underway to revive it. A 2006 survey of the [[Hokkaido]] Ainu indicated that only 4.6% of Ainu surveyed were able to converse in or "speak a little" Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TpdTRuAm8R4C&amp;pg=PA219 Cultural Diversity, Heritage and Human Rights: Intersections in Theory and ... - William Logan, Máiréad Nic Craith - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2001, Ainu was not taught in any elementary or secondary schools in Japan, but was offered at numerous language centres and universities in Hokkaido, as well as at Tokyo's [[Chiba University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oScUXmAkRXIC&amp;pg=PA340 Can Threatened Languages Be Saved?: Reversing Language Shift, Revisited : A ... - Joshua A.

In China, the [[Manchu language]] is one of the most endangered languages, with speakers only in three small areas of Manchuria remaining.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 28. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some enthusiasts are trying to revive the language of [[Manchu people|their ancestors]] using available dictionaries and textbooks, and even occasional visits to [[Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County]] in [[Xinjiang]], where the related [[Xibe language]] is still spoken natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125452110732160485

In the Philippines, a variation of [[Philippine Spanish|Spanish]] that was primarily based on [[Mexican Spanish]] was the ''lingua franca'' of the country since Spanish colonization in 1565 and was an official language alongside [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (a standardized form of the [[Tagalog language]]) and [[Philippine English|English]] until 1987 following a ratification of a new Constitution where it was re-designated as a voluntary language. As a result of its loss as an official language and years of marginalization at the official level during and after American colonization, the use of the Spanish language amongst the overall populace decreased dramatically and became moribund with the remaining native speakers left being mostly elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rn4RHtiX?url=http://lgpolar.com/page/read/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/cultura/2016/04/12/actualidad/1460464651_728256.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19991009202835/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/june98/05_37_013.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is currently seeing a slow revival due to past government promotion under the administration of former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.congress.gov.ph%2Fdownload%2Fra_12%2FRA09187.pdf&amp;date=2010-07-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070902192237/http://www.ulap.gov.ph/reso2006-28.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, Resolution No. 2006-028 reinstated Spanish as a mandatory subject in secondary schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rE2xF3Ga?url=http://www.schoolsandcourses.com/noticias_ver.asp?idNoticia=238&lt;/ref&gt; Results were immediate as the job demand for Spanish speakers had increased since 2008. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fglobalnation.inquirer.net%2Fnews%2Fbreakingnews%2Fview%2F20081119-173154%2FDemand-for-Spanish-speakers-growing&amp;date=2010-07-14&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the [[Instituto Cervantes|''Instituto Cervantes de Manila'']] reported the number of Filipino Hispanophones with native or non-native knowledge at approximately 3 million (including those who speak the native Spanish-based Creole [[Chavacano Language|Chavacano]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcastellano.org/noticia.php?id=505&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to government efforts, Spanish has also seen a small revival of interest in media thanks to the importing of [[Telenovela|telenovelas]] and [[Music of Latin America|music from Latin America]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rE4Vg911?url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20071206-105314/Spanish_on_comeback_trail_in_Philippines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/spanish+language+culture/ari27-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hebrew]], once largely a liturgical language, was [[Hebrew revitalization|reestablished as a means of everyday communication]] by Jews migrating to what is now the State of Israel and the Palestinian territories, starting in the nineteenth century: it is the world's most famous and successful example of language revitalization.

In Thailand, there exists a [[Chong language]] revitalization project which is headed by Suwilai Premsrirat.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Australia and New Zealand===
The European colonization of Australia, and the consequent damage sustained by Aboriginal communities, had a catastrophic effect on indigenous languages in the southeast and south of the country, leaving them with no living traditional native speakers. A number of Aboriginal communities in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and elsewhere are now trying to revive these languages. The work is typically directed by a group of elders and other knowledgeable people, with community language workers doing most of the research and teaching. They analyze the data, develop spelling systems and vocabulary and prepare resources. Decisions are made in collaboration. Some communities employ linguists, and there are also linguists who work independently.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Christina Eira, community linguist with the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages (VACL), ‘Aboriginal Revival Languages,’ Lingua Franca, 27 June 2009, Radio National: http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/aboriginal-revival-languages/3066470. Retrieved  21 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best cases of relative success in language revitalization is the case of [[Māori language|Māori]] also known as ''te reo Māori''. It is the ancestral tongue of the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand and a vehicle for prose narrative, sung poetry, and genealogical recital.&lt;ref name=senft&gt;{{cite book|last=Senft|first=Gunter|title=Endangered Austronesian and Australian Aboriginal Languages|year=2010|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|location=Canberra|isbn=9780858836235|pages=185–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of the Māori people is taught in ''te reo Māori'' in sacred learning houses through oral transmission. Even after ''te reo Māori'' became a written language, the oral tradition was preserved.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt;

Once European colonization began, many laws were enacted in order to promote the use of English over ''te reo Māori'' among indigenous people.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; The Education Ordinance Act of 1847 mandated school instruction in English and established boarding schools to speed up assimilation of Māori youths into European culture. The Native School Act of 1858 forbade ''te reo Māori'' from being spoken in schools. The colonial masters also promoted the use of English in Māori homes, convincing many parents that their children would not get jobs unless they spoke English.

During the 1970s, a group of young Māori people, called the Nga Tamatoa, successfully campaigned for Māori to be taught in schools.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; Also, Kohanga Reo, Māori language preschools, called language nests, were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinton &amp; Hale|title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0-12-349353-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis was on teaching children the language at a young age, a very effective strategy for language learning. The Māori Language Commission was formed in 1987, leading to a number of national reforms aimed at revitalizing ''te reo Māori''.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; They include media programs broadcast in ''te reo Māori'', undergraduate college programs taught in ''te reo Māori'', and an annual Māori language week. Each iwi, or tribe, created a language planning program catering to its specific circumstances. These efforts have resulted in a steady increase in children being taught in ''te reo Māori'' in schools since 1996,&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; creating a significant number of fluent speakers and making Māori prominent and useful in the people's daily lives. The program has been so successful that similar programs have been based on it. See [[Māori language revival]].

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the use of both local and learned [[languages of Europe|languages]] declined as the central governments of the different states imposed their vernacular language as the standard throughout education and official use (this was the case in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and  [[Greece]], and to some extent, in [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the last few decades, local [[nationalism]] and [[human rights]] movements have made a more [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] policy standard in European states; sharp condemnation of the earlier practices of suppressing regional languages was expressed in the use of such terms as "[[language death|linguicide]]". Campaigns have raised the profiles of local languages to such an extent that in some European regions, the local languages have acquired the status of [[official language]]s, along with the national language. The [[Council of Europe]]'s action in this area (see [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]) is in contrast to the [[European Union]]'s granting of official status to a restricted number of official languages (see [[Languages of the European Union]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Presently, official attempts to revitalise languages under threat, such as the promotion of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in their respective native regions, have seen varying degrees of success.

====Irish====
{{main|Revival of the Irish language}}
One of the best known European attempts at language revitalization concerns the [[Irish language]]. While English is dominant through most of Ireland, Irish, a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], is still spoken in certain areas called ''[[Gaeltacht]]aí'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Carnie, Andrew. "Modern Irish: Modern Irish: A Case Study in Language Revival Failure." (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; but there it is in serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;This decline was noted in 2002. {{cite web|url=http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |title=Report of the Gaeltacht Commission |year=2002 |accessdate=20 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017090003/http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges faced by the language over the last few centuries have included exclusion from important domains, social denigration, the death or emigration of many Irish speakers during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 1840s, and continued emigration since. Efforts to revitalise Irish were being made, however, from the mid-1800s, and were associated with a desire for Irish political independence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Contemporary Irish language revitalization has chiefly involved teaching Irish as a compulsory language in mainstream English-speaking schools. But the failure to teach it in an effective and engaging way means (as linguist Andrew Carnie notes) that students do not acquire the fluency needed for the lasting viability of the language, and this leads to boredom and resentment. Carnie also noted a lack of media in Irish (2006),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; though this is no longer the case.

The decline of the Gaeltachtaí and the failure of state-directed revitalisation have been countered by an urban revival movement. This is largely based on an independent community-based school system, known generally as [[Gaelscoil]]eanna. These schools teach entirely through Irish and their number is growing, with over thirty such schools in Dublin alone.&lt;ref&gt;Gaelscoileanna Teo – Statistics: http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/en/about/statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; They are an important element in the creation of a network of urban Irish speakers (known as Gaeilgeoirí), who tend to be young, well-educated and middle-class. It is now likely that this group has acquired critical mass, a fact reflected in the expansion of Irish-language media.&lt;ref name="gaelport"&gt;http://www.gaelport.com/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=3726: ‘Schism fears for Gaeilgeoirí,’ Brian Ó Broin, 16 January 2010, ''The Irish Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish language television has enjoyed particular success.&lt;ref&gt;See the website of TG4: http://www.tg4.ie/.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that they tend to be better educated than monolingual English speakers and enjoy higher social status.&lt;ref&gt;‘Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market,’ The Economic and Social Review, Vol. 40, No. 4, Winter, 2009, pp. 435–460: https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html&lt;/ref&gt; They represent the transition of Irish to a modern urban world, with an accompanying rise in prestige.

====Scottish Gaelic====
There are also current attempts to revive the related language of [[Scottish Gaelic]], which was suppressed following the formation of the United Kingdom, and entered further decline due to the [[Highland clearances]]. Currently, Gaelic is only spoken widely on the Western Isles and some areas of the Highland and Islands.  The decline in fluent Gaelic speakers has slowed, however the population center has shifted to L2 speakers in urban areas, especially Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Census shows decline in Gaelic speakers 'slowed' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24281487 |accessdate=23 June 2014 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=ALISON CAMPSIE|title=Gaelic speakers map: Where in Scotland is Gaelic thriving?|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/gaelic-speakers-map-where-in-scotland-is-gaelic-thriving-1-3903467|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=www.scotsman.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manx====
{{main|Manx language revival}}
Another Celtic language, [[Manx language|Manx]], lost its last native speaker in 1974 and was declared extinct by [[UNESCO]] in 2009, but never completely fell from use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/isle_of_man/7901763.stm|title=UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct'|date=2009-02-20|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is now taught in primary and secondary schools including the [[Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]], used in some public events and spoken as a second language by approximately 1800 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/02/how-manx-language-came-back-from-dead-isle-of-man|title=How the Manx language came back from the dead|last=Whitehead|first=Sarah|date=2015-04-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revitalization efforts include radio shows in Manx Gaelic and social media and online resources.

====Cornish====
There have been a number of attempts to revive the [[Cornish language]], both privately and some under the [[Cornish Language Partnership]]. Some of the activities have included translation of the Christian scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evertype.com/books/testament-noweth-ucr.html Cornish New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt; a guild of bards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/welcome.htm guild of bards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706051224/http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/welcome.htm |date=2009-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of [[Cornish literature]] in modern Cornish, including novels and poetry.

===North America===

In addition, there are apps (including phrases, word lists and dictionaries) in many Native languages ranging from [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] and [[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]], to [[Lakota language|Lakota]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibway]] and [[Oneida language|Oneida]], [[Massachusett language#Revival|Massachusett]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Gwich'in language|Gwych'in]].

[[Massachusett language|Wampanoag]], a language spoken by the people of the same name in Massachusetts, underwent a revitalization project led by [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]]. The project has seen children speaking the language fluently for the first time in over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessielittledoe.com/jessie_CV.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810115929/http://www.jessielittledoe.com/jessie_CV.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/features/wampanoag-language&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are currently attempts at revitalizing the [[Chochenyo language]] of California, which had become extinct.

===South America===
[[Kichwa language|Kichwa]] is the variety of the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] language spoken in [[Ecuador]] and is one of the most widely spoken indigenous languages in South America. Despite this fact, Kichwa is a threatened language, mainly because of the expansion of Spanish in South America. One community of original Kichwa speakers, Lagunas, was one of the first indigenous communities to switch to the Spanish language.&lt;ref name=beginning&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|pages=71–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to King, this was because of the increase of trade and business with the large Spanish-speaking town nearby. The Lagunas people assert that it was not for cultural assimilation purposes, as they value their cultural identity highly.&lt;ref name=beginning /&gt; However, once this contact was made, language for the Lagunas people shifted through generations, to Kichwa and Spanish bilingualism and now is essentially Spanish monolingualism. The feelings of the Lagunas people present a dichotomy with language use, as most of the Lagunas members speak Spanish exclusively and only know a few words in Kichwa.

The prospects for Kichwa language revitalization are not promising, as parents depend on schooling for this purpose, which is not nearly as effective as continual language exposure in the home.&lt;ref name=end&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|pages=187–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schooling in the Lagunas community, although having a conscious focus on teaching Kichwa, consists of mainly passive interaction, reading, and writing in Kichwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to grassroots efforts, national language revitalization organizations, like [[CONAIE]], focus attention on non-Spanish speaking indigenous children, who represent a large minority in the country. Another national initiative, Bilingual Intercultural Education Project (PEBI), was ineffective in language revitalization because instruction was given in Kichwa and Spanish was taught as a second language to children who were almost exclusively Spanish monolinguals.
Although some techniques seem ineffective, Kendall A. King provides several suggestions:

# Exposure to and acquisition of the language at a young age.
# 
# Extreme immersion techniques.
# 
# Multiple and diverse efforts to reach adults.
# 
# Flexibility and coordination in planning and implementation
# 
# Directly addressing different varieties of the language.
# 
# Planners stressing that language revitalization is a long process
# 
# Involving as many people as possible
# 
# Parents using the language with their children
# 
# Planners and advocates approaching the problem from all directions.

Specific suggestions include imparting an elevated perception of the language in schools, focusing on grassroots efforts both in school and the home, and maintaining national and regional attention.&lt;ref name=end /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[John McWhorter]] has argued that programs to revive indigenous languages will almost never be very effective because of the practical difficulties involved. He also argues that the death of a language does not necessarily mean the death of a culture.  Indigenous expression is still possible even when the original language has disappeared, as with Native American groups and as evidenced by the vitality of black American culture in the United States, among people who speak not Yoruba but English. He argues that language death is, ironically, a sign of hitherto isolated peoples migrating and sharing space: “To maintain distinct languages across generations happens only amidst unusually tenacious self-isolation—such as that of the Amish—or brutal segregation”.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;John McWhorter, ‘The Cosmopolitan Tongue: The Universality of English’ in World Affairs Journal, Fall 2009: http://worldaffairsjournal.org/article/cosmopolitan-tongue-universality-english&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenan Malik]] has also argued that it is "irrational" to try to preserve all the world's languages, as language death is natural and in many cases inevitable, even with intervention. He proposes that language death improves communication by ensuring more people speak the same language. This may benefit the economy and reduce conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11304255 |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Are dying languages worth saving? |date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenanmalik.com/essays/die.html |title=Let Them Die |first=Kenan |last=Malik |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]] |date=November 20, 2000 &lt;!-- original publication: http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/letthemdie/ --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others{{who?|date=April 2018}} have pointed out that similarities in language and culture have not prevented brutal civil wars.

In [[informal logic]] and [[argument map]]ping, a '''lemma''' is simultaneously a [[main contention|contention]] for [[premise]]s below it and a premise for a contention above it. [[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]: If one has proof that ''B'' follows from ''A'' and proof that ''C'' follows from ''B'', then one has proof that ''C'' follows from ''A''.

{{Wiktionary|lever}}

The '''levee''' (from the French word ''lever'', meaning "getting up" or "rising")&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/levee "levee"]. Dictionary.com. ''Dictionary.com Unabridged''. Random House, Inc. Accessed January 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was traditionally a daily moment of intimacy and accessibility to a monarch or leader. It started out as a royal custom, but, in America, it later came to refer to a reception by the king’s representatives and, even later, by the president.

==History==

===France===
In [[Einhard]]'s ''Life of Charlemagne'', the author recounts the Emperor's practice, when he was dressing and putting on his shoes, to invite his friends to come in and, in case of a dispute brought to his attention, "he would order the disputants to be brought in there and then, hear the case as if he were sitting in tribunal and pronounce a judgement."&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', §24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the sixteenth century, it had become a formal event, requiring invitation.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, J.H. ''Europe Divided 1559-1998, Fontana History of Europe'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks 1968) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563 [[Catherine de' Medici]] wrote in advice to her son, the King of France, to do as his father ([[Henry II of France|Henry II]]) had done and uphold the practice of ''lever''. Catherine describes that Henry II allowed his subjects, from nobles to household servants, to come in while he dressed. She states this pleased his subjects and improved their opinion of him.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the King (8 September 1563?) LCM. Vol. II, p. 90, cited in Potter, David, ''The French Wars of Religion: Selected Documents'' (New York 1997) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice was raised to a ceremonial custom at the court of King [[Louis XIV]]. In the court [[etiquette]] that Louis formalised, the set of extremely elaborate conventions was divided into the ''grand lever'', attended by the full court in the gallery outside the king's bedchamber, and the ''petit lever'' that transpired in degrees in the king's chamber, where only a very select group might serve the king as he rose and dressed.  In fact, the king had often risen early and put in some hours hunting before returning to bed for the start of the ''lever''.  Louis's grandson, King [[Philip V of Spain]], and his queen typically spent all morning in bed, as reported by Saint-Simon, to avoid the pestering by ministers and courtiers that began with the lever.

The king's retiring ceremony proceeded in reverse order and was known as the ''coucher''.

The successors of Louis XIV were not as passionate about the Sun King's daily routine and, over time, the frequency of the ''lever'' and ''coucher'' decreased, much to the dismay of their courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chateauversailles.fr/history/versailles-during-the-centuries/living-at-the-court/a-day-in-the-life-of-louis-xiv Official website of the Palace of Versailles]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
[[File:St James's Palace, Queen's Levee Room, by Charles Wild, 1816 - royal coll 922164 313723 ORI 2.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Wild]] (1816) ''St James's Palace, Queen's Levee Room'']]
When the court of [[Charles II of England]] adopted the custom, first noted as an English usage in 1672,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "Levée".&lt;/ref&gt; it was called a ''levée''. In the 18th century, as the fashionable dinner hour was incrementally moved later into the afternoon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/dinner2.html Sherrie McMillan, "What Time is Dinner?" ''History Magazine'' on-line]).&lt;/ref&gt; the morning reception of the British monarch, attended only by gentlemen, was shifted forward towards noon.

The practice of holding court levées was continued by the British Monarchy until 1939. These took the form of a formal reception at [[St James's Palace]] at which officials, diplomats, and military officers of all three armed services, were presented individually to the sovereign. [[Full dress]] uniform or [[court dress]] was worn by all participants, who formed a queue in the Throne Room before stepping forward when their names and ranks were called. Each then bowed to the king who was seated on a dais with male members of his family, officials of the Royal Household and senior officers behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Niven|pages=118–120|title=The Moon's a Balloon|isbn=0-340-15817-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Levees in the British Empire and Commonwealth====
Levée ceremonies were held by regal representatives of the British Empire, such as the [[Governor-General of India |Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland| the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and the [[Governor-General of Australia| Governor-General]] or Governors of Australia.&lt;ref name="Governor's levee"&gt;{{cite web |title=Governor's Levee |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5425609 |website=Trove |publisher=The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA: 1889 - 1931) |accessdate=11 September 2018 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial event of the [[New Year's levee|Canadian Governor General's New Year's Day]] reception is still called his levée.

===United States===
By the 1760s, the custom was being copied by the colonial governors in [[British America]], but was abandoned in the [[United States]] following the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Beginning in 1789, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] and [[First Lady]] [[Martha Washington]] held weekly public gatherings and receptions at the presidential mansion that were called levees. Designed to give the public access to the president and to project a dignified public image of the presidency, they were continued by [[John Adams|John]] and [[Abigail Adams]], but were discarded in 1801 by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Levees (Receptions)| url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/levees-receptions/| work=Digital Encyclopedia| publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, George Washington's Mount Vernon| location=Mount Vernon, Virginia| accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louis XIV's ''lever''==
The ceremony at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonies were abbreviated when the king was at [[Château de Marly|Marly]] or one of his other occasional retreats, providing a sense of intimacy that was only comparative, but engendering struggles among courtiers to be invited on such occasions, precisely the kind of competition Louis fostered.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described in detail by [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]]. Louis XIV was a creature of habit and the inflexible routine that tired or irritated his heirs served him well. Wherever the king had actually slept, he was discovered sleeping in the close-curtained [[state bed]] standing in its alcove, which was separated from the rest of the ''[[chambre du roi]]'' by a gilded balustrade.&lt;ref&gt;The comparison with the communion rail that separated the [[sanctuary]] in a church was not unintentional. The ''chambre du roi'' marked the centre of the [[Palace of Versailles|château de Versailles]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was woken at eight o'clock by his head [[valet de chambre]] —[[Alexandre Bontemps]] held this post for most of the reign — who alone had slept in the bedchamber. The chief physician, the chief surgeon and Louis' childhood nurse, as long as she lived, all entered at the same time, and the nurse kissed him. The night [[chamberpot]] was removed.

===Grande entrée===
[[Image:William Hogarth 022.jpg|thumb|270px|The second scene of  [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' (1732-33) showing the wealthy Tom at his morning levée in London, attended by musicians and other hangers-on all dressed in expensive costumes. Surrounding Tom from left to right: a music master at a harpsichord, who was supposed to represent [[George Frideric Handel]]; a fencing master; a quarterstaff instructor; a dancing master with a violin; a landscape gardener [[Charles Bridgeman]]; an ex-soldier offering to be a bodyguard; a bugler of a [[fox hunt]] club. At lower right is a jockey with a silver trophy.]]

Then the curtains of the bed were drawn once again and, at a quarter past eight, the Grand Chamberlain was called, bringing with him the nobles who had the privilege of the ''grande entrée'', a privilege that could be purchased, subject to the king's approval, but which was restricted in Louis' time to the nobles. The King remained in bed, in his nightshirt and a short wig. The [[Grand Chamberlain of France]] or, in his absence, the Chief [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]] presented [[holy water]] to the king from a vase that stood at the head of the bed and the king's morning clothes were laid out. First, the Master of the Bedchamber and the First Servant, both high nobles, pulled the king's nightshirt over his head, one grasping each sleeve. The Grand Chamberlain presented the day shirt which, according to Saint-Simon, had been shaken out and sometimes changed, because the king perspired freely. This was a moment for any of those with the privilege of the ''grande entrée'' to have a swift private word with the king, which would have been carefully rehearsed beforehand to express a request as deferentially, but in as few words as possible. The King was given a [[missal]] and the gentlemen retired into the adjoining ''chambre du conseil'' (the "council chamber") while there was a brief private prayer for the King.

===Première entrée===
When the King had them recalled, now accompanied by those who had the lesser privilege of the ''première entrée'', his process of dressing began. Louis preferred to dress himself "for he did almost everything himself, with address and grace", Saint-Simon remarked. The King was handed a dressing-gown, and a mirror was held for him, for he had no [[Toilette|toilet table]] like ordinary gentlemen. Every other day the King shaved himself. Now, other privileged courtiers were admitted, a few at a time, at each stage, so that, as the King was putting on his shoes and stockings, "everyone" — in Saint-Simon's view — was there. This was the ''entrée de la chambre'', which included the king's readers and the director of the ''[[Menus Plaisirs du Roi|Menus Plaisirs]]'', that part of the royal establishment in charge of all preparations for ceremonies, events and festivities, to the last detail of design and order. At the ''entrée de la chambre'' were admitted the [[Grand Almoner of France|Grand Aumônier]] and the [[Marshal of France]] and the king's ministers and secretaries. A fifth entrée now admitted ladies for the first time, and a sixth entrée admitted, from a privileged position at a cramped backdoor, the king's children, legitimate and illegitimate indiscriminately — in scandalous fashion Saint-Simon thought — and their spouses.

The crowd in the ''chambre du Roi'' can be estimated from Saint-Simon's remark of the King's devotions, which followed: the King knelt at his bedside "where all the clergy present knelt, the cardinals without cushions, all the laity remaining standing".

The King then passed into the ''[[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]]'' where all those who possessed any court office attended him. He then announced what he expected to do that day and was left alone with those among his favourites of the royal children born illegitimately (whom he had publicly recognised and legitimated&lt;ref&gt;These eventually were five in all.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a few favourites, with the valets. These were less pressing moments to discuss projects with the King, who parcelled out his attention with strict regard for the current standing of those closest to him.
[[File:Le Lever.jpg|thumb|275px|''Le Lever'', engraving by Louis Romanet (1742–1810), after Sigmund Freudenberg (1745-1801)]]

===''Grand lever''===
With the entry of the King into the ''Grande Galerie'', where the rest of the court awaited him, the ''petit lever'' was finished, and with the ''grand lever'' the day was properly begun, as the king proceeded to daily Mass, sharing brief words as he progressed and even receiving some petitions. It was of these occasions that the King habitually remarked, in refusing a favour asked for some noble, "We never see him", meaning that he did not spend enough time at Versailles, where Louis wanted to keep the nobility penned up, to prevent them interesting themselves in politics.

==For the aristocracy==
Among the aristocracy, the levée could also become a crowded and social occasion, especially for women, who liked to put off the donning of their uncomfortable formal clothes, and whose hair and perhaps make-up needed prolonged attention.  There is a famous depiction of the levée of an 18th-century Viennese lady of the court in [[Richard Strauss]]'s later opera ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where she has her hair dressed while surrounded by a disorderly crowd of tradesmen touting for work or payment, and other petitioners, followed by a visit from a cousin.  The second scene of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' shows a male equivalent in 1730s London.

In the French engraving ''Le Lever'' after Freudenberg, of the 1780s (''illustration, right''), gentle social criticism is levelled at the lady of the court; that she slept without unlacing her stays, apparently, perhaps can be seen as artistic licence. Her maids dress her with deference, while the wallclock under the hangings of her ''lit à la polonaise'' appears to read noon.

==In popular culture==
In [[Sophia Coppola]]'s ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' the levée of the French queen, during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI is represented.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18999">[[Image:DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf|thumb|350px|right|Example of a Macroeconomics Model]]
A '''macroeconomic model''' is an analytical tool designed to describe the operation of the [[economy]] of a country or a region. These models are usually designed to examine the dynamics of [[aggregate data|aggregate quantities]] such as the total amount of [[good (economics)|good]]s and services produced, total income earned, the level of employment of productive resources, and the [[price level|level of prices]].

Macroeconomic models may be logical, mathematical, and/or computational; the different types of macroeconomic models serve different purposes and have different advantages and disadvantages..&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2017), '''The need for different classes of macroeconomic models''', blog post, Jan. 12, 2017, Peterson Institute for International Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Macroeconomic models may be used to clarify and illustrate basic theoretical principles; they may be used to test, compare, and quantify different macroeconomic theories; they may be used to produce "what if" scenarios (usually to predict the effects of changes in [[Monetary policy|monetary]], [[fiscal policy|fiscal]], or other macroeconomic policies); and they may be used to generate economic [[forecasting|forecasts]]. Thus, macroeconomic models are widely used in academia, teaching and research, and are also widely used by international organizations, national governments and larger corporations, as well as by economics consultants and [[think tank]]s.

==Types==

===Simple theoretical models===
Simple textbook descriptions of the macroeconomy involving a small number of equations or diagrams are often called ‘models’.  Examples include the [[IS-LM model]] and [[Mundell–Fleming model]] of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] macroeconomics, and the [[Neoclassical growth model|Solow model]] of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[Economic growth|growth theory]].  These models share several features.  They are based on a few equations involving a few variables, which can often be explained with simple diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2000), ''Macroeconomics'', 2nd ed., Chap. 3.3, p. 47. Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-013306-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these models are [[Comparative statics|static]], but some are [[Dynamical system|dynamic]], describing the economy over many time periods.  The variables that appear in these models often represent macroeconomic aggregates (such as [[GDP]] or total [[employment]]) rather than individual choice variables, and while the equations relating these variables are intended to describe economic decisions, they are not usually derived directly by aggregating models of individual choices.  They are simple enough to be used as illustrations of theoretical points in introductory explanations of macroeconomic ideas; but therefore quantitative application to forecasting, testing, or policy evaluation is usually impossible without substantially augmenting the structure of the model.

===Empirical forecasting models===
{{main|Large-scale macroeconometric model}}
In the 1940s and 1950s, as governments began accumulating [[National income and product accounts|national income and product accounting]] data, economists set out to construct quantitative models to describe the dynamics observed in the data.&lt;ref name="kleinontinbergen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Lawrence |year=2004 |title=The contribution of Jan Tinbergen to economic science |journal=De Economist |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=155–157 |doi=10.1023/B:ECOT.0000023251.14849.4f }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These models estimated the relations between different macroeconomic variables using (mostly linear) [[time series analysis]].  Like the simpler theoretical models, these empirical models described relations between aggregate quantities, but many addressed a much finer level of detail (for example, studying the relations between output, employment, investment, and other variables in many different industries). Thus, these models grew to include hundreds or thousands of equations describing the evolution of hundreds or thousands of prices and quantities over time, making [[Computational economics|computers]] essential for their solution.  While the choice of which variables to include in each equation was partly guided by economic theory (for example, including past income as a determinant of consumption, as suggested by the theory of [[adaptive expectations]]), variable inclusion was mostly determined on purely empirical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measurement Without Theory |first=Tjalling C. |last=Koopmans |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1947 |pages=161–172 |jstor=1928627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[economist]] [[Jan Tinbergen]] developed the first comprehensive national model, which he built for the [[Netherlands]] in 1936.  He later applied the same modeling structure to the economies of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="kleinontinbergen"/&gt;  The first global macroeconomic model, [[Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates]]' [[Project LINK|LINK]] project, was initiated by [[Lawrence Klein]]. The model was cited in 1980 when Klein, like Tinbergen before him, won the [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]].  Large-scale empirical models of this type, including the Wharton model, are still in use today, especially for forecasting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Lawrence R. |editor-last=Klein |year=1991 |title=Comparative Performance of US Econometric Models |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-505772-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckstein |first=Otto |year=1983 |title=The DRI Model of the US Economy |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-018972-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald |last=Bodkin |first2=Lawrence |last2=Klein |first3=Kanta |last3=Marwah |year=1991 |title=A History of Macroeconometric Model Building |location= |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Lucas critique of empirical forecasting models====
{{Main|Lucas critique}}

Econometric studies in the first part of the 20th century showed a negative correlation between inflation and unemployment called the [[Phillips curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Phillips |first=A. W. |year=1958 |title=The relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in the United Kingdom 1861-1957 |journal=[[Economica]] |volume=25 |issue=100 |pages=283–299 |doi=10.2307/2550759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical macroeconomic forecasting models, being based on roughly the same data, had similar implications: they suggested that unemployment could be permanently lowered by permanently increasing inflation.  However, in 1968, [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Friedman |first=Milton |year=1968 |title=The role of monetary policy |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |jstor=1831652 |issn= |publisher=American Economic Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Phelps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1086/259438 |last=Phelps |first=Edmund S. |year=1968 |title=Money wage dynamics and labor market equilibrium |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=678–711 |url= |issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this apparent tradeoff was illusory.  They claimed that the historical relation between inflation and unemployment was due to the fact that past inflationary episodes had been largely unexpected.  They argued that if monetary authorities permanently raised the inflation rate, workers and firms would eventually come to understand this, at which point the economy would return to its previous, higher level of unemployment, but now with higher inflation too.  The [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]] appeared to bear out their prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2000), op. cit., Ch. 28, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]], published an influential paper arguing that the failure of the Phillips curve in the 1970s was just one example of a general problem with empirical forecasting models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1016/S0167-2231(76)80003-6 |last=Lucas |first=Robert E., Jr. |year=1976 |title=Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique |journal=Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy |volume=1 |issue= |pages=19–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kevin D. |last=Hoover |chapter=Econometrics and the Analysis of Policy |pages=167–209 |title=The New Classical Macroeconomics |location=Oxford |publisher=Basil Blackwell |year=1988 |isbn=0-631-14605-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that such models are derived from observed relationships between various macroeconomic quantities over time, and that these relations differ depending on what macroeconomic policy regime is in place.  In the context of the Phillips curve, this means that the relation between inflation and unemployment observed in an economy where inflation has usually been low in the past would differ from the relation observed in an economy where inflation has been high.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier (2000), op. cit., Ch. 28, p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, this means one cannot predict the effects of a new policy regime using an empirical forecasting model based on data from previous periods when that policy regime was not in place.  Lucas argued that economists would remain unable to predict the effects of new policies unless they built models [[Microfoundations|based on economic fundamentals]] (like [[preferences]], [[production function|technology]], and [[budget constraint]]s) that should be unaffected by policy changes.

===Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models===
{{Main|Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium}}

Partly as a response to the [[Lucas critique]], economists of the 1980s and 1990s began to construct [[microfoundations|microfounded]]&lt;ref&gt;Edmund S. Phelps, ed., (1970), ''Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory.'' New York, Norton and Co. {{ISBN|0-393-09326-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  macroeconomic models based on rational choice, which have come to be called '''dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)''' models.  These models begin by specifying the set of [[Agent (economics)|agents]] active in the economy, such as households, firms, and governments in one or more countries, as well as the [[preferences]], [[production function|technology]], and [[budget constraint]] of each one.  Each agent is assumed to make an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal choice]], taking into account prices and the strategies of other agents, both in the current period and in the future.  Summing up the decisions of the different types of agents, it is possible to find the prices that equate supply with demand in every market.  Thus these models embody a type of [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] self-consistency: agents choose optimally given the prices, while prices must be consistent with agents’ supplies and demands.

DSGE models often assume that all agents of a given type are identical (i.e. there is a ‘[[Representative agent|representative]] household’ and a ‘[[Representative agent|representative]] firm’) and can perform perfect calculations that forecast the future correctly on average (which is called [[rational expectations]]).  However, these are only simplifying assumptions, and are not essential for the DSGE methodology; many DSGE studies aim for greater realism by considering heterogeneous agents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Per Krusell |first=Per |last=Krusell |authorlink2=Anthony A. Smith, Jr. |first2=Anthony A., Jr. |last2=Smith |year=1998 |title=Income and wealth heterogeneity in the macroeconomy |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=243–277 |doi= 10.1086/250034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or various types of [[adaptive expectations]].&lt;ref&gt;George W. Evans and Seppo Honkapohja (2001), ''Learning and Expectations in Macroeconomics''. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-04921-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared with empirical forecasting models, DSGE models typically have fewer variables and equations, mainly because DSGE models are harder to solve, even with the help of [[Computational economics|computers]].&lt;ref&gt;DeJong, D. N. with C. Dave (2007), ''Structural Macroeconometrics''. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-12648-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple theoretical DSGE models, involving only a few variables, have been used to analyze the forces that drive [[business cycles]]; this empirical work has given rise to two main competing frameworks called the [[Real business cycles|real business cycle model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kydland | first1 = Finn E. | authorlink = Finn E. Kydland | authorlink2 = Edward C. Prescott | last2 = Prescott | first2 = Edward C. | year = 1982 | title = Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations | url = | journal = Econometrica | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 1345–70 | doi=10.2307/1913386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas F. Cooley]] (1995), ''Frontiers of Business Cycle Research''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Abel and Ben Bernanke (1995), ''Macroeconomics'', 2nd ed., Ch. 11.1, pp. 355-362. Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-54392-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian DSGE model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rotemberg |first=Julio J. |first2=Michael |last2=Woodford |year=1997 |title=An optimization-based econometric framework for the evaluation of monetary policy |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=12 |issue= |pages=297–346 |jstor=3585236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodford |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01049-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More elaborate DSGE models are used to predict the effects of changes in economic policy and evaluate their impact on [[Social welfare function|social welfare]].  However, [[economic forecasting]] is still largely based on more traditional empirical models, which are still widely believed to achieve greater accuracy in predicting the impact of economic disturbances over time.

====DSGE versus CGE models====
{{Main|Computable general equilibrium}}
A closely related methodology that pre-dates DSGE modeling is '''computable general equilibrium (CGE)''' modeling. Like DSGE models, CGE models are often [[microfoundations|microfounded]] on assumptions about preferences, technology, and budget constraints. However, CGE models focus mostly on long-run relationships, making them most suited to studying the long-run impact of permanent policies like the tax system or the openness of the economy to international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoven |first=John B. |first2=John |last2=Whalley |year=1972 |title=A general equilibrium calculation of the effects of differential taxation of income from capital in the US |journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]] |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |pages=281–321 |doi=10.1016/0047-2727(72)90009-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kehoe |first=Patrick J. |first2=Timothy J. |last2=Kehoe |year=1994 |title=A primer on static applied general equilibrium models |journal=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=2–16 |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1821.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSGE models instead emphasize the dynamics of the economy over time (often at a quarterly frequency), making them suited for studying business cycles and the cyclical effects of monetary and fiscal policy.

===Agent-based computational macroeconomic models===
{{Main|Agent-based computational economics}}

Another modeling methodology which has developed at the same time as DSGE models is '''Agent-based computational economics (ACE)''', which is a variety of [[Agent based model|Agent-based]] modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |first=Leigh |last=Tesfatsion |year=2003 |url=http://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/acewp1.pdf |title=Agent-Based Computational Economics |work=Iowa State University Economics Working Paper #1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the DSGE methodology, ACE seeks to break down aggregate macroeconomic relationships into microeconomic decisions of individual [[Agent (economics)|agents]]. ACE models also begin by defining the set of agents that make up the economy, and specify the types of interactions individual agents can have with each other or with the market as a whole. Instead of defining the [[preferences]] of those agents, ACE models often jump directly to specifying their [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]]. Or sometimes, preferences are specified, together with an initial strategy and a learning rule whereby the strategy is adjusted according to its past success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William |last=Brock |first2=Cars |last2=Hommes |year=1997 |title=A rational route to randomness |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=1059–1095 |jstor=2171879 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these strategies, the interaction of large numbers of individual agents (who may be very heterogeneous) can be simulated on a computer, and then the aggregate, macroeconomic relationships that arise from those individual actions can be studied.

====Strengths and weaknesses of DSGE and ACE models====

DSGE and ACE models have different advantages and disadvantages due to their different underlying structures. DSGE models may exaggerate individual rationality and foresight, and understate the importance of heterogeneity, since the [[rational expectations]], [[representative agent]] case remains the simplest and thus the most common type of DSGE model to solve. Also, unlike ACE models, it may be difficult to study [[network effect|local interaction]]s between individual agents in DSGE models, which instead focus mostly on the way agents interact through aggregate prices.  On the other hand, ACE models may exaggerate errors in individual decision-making, since the strategies assumed in ACE models may be very far from optimal choices unless the modeler is very careful.  A related issue is that ACE models which start from [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] instead of [[preferences]] may remain vulnerable to the [[Lucas critique]]: a changed policy regime should generally give rise to changed strategies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4840">A '''Malthusian growth model''', sometimes called a '''simple exponential''' growth model, is essentially [[exponential growth]] based on the idea of the function being proportional to the speed to which the function grows. The model is named after [[ Thomas Robert Malthus]], who wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798), one of the earliest and most influential books on [[population]].&lt;ref name=malthus&gt;"Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population: Library of Economics"&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthusian models have the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; P(t) = P_0e^{rt} &lt;/math&gt;
where

* ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(0) is the initial population size,
* ''r'' = the population growth rate, sometimes called ''Malthusian parameter'',
* ''t'' = time.

The model can also been written in the form of a differential equation:

dP/dt = rP

with initial condition:
P(0)= P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

This model is often referred to as the ''exponential law''.&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Complex population dynamics: a theoretical/empirical synthesis" Princeton [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7436.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded in the field of [[population ecology]] as the [[first principle]] of [[population dynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Does Population Ecology Have General Laws?" Oikos 94:17–26. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Malthus]] as the founder. The exponential law is therefore also sometimes referred to as the ''Malthusian Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Haemig, "Laws of Population Ecology", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By now, it is a widely accepted view to analogize Malthusian growth in Ecology to [[Newton's First Law|Newton's First Law of uniform motion]] in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Lev R.|title=The theory of population dynamics: I. Back to first principles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5193(86)80180-1|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=122|issue=4|pages=385–399|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus wrote that all life forms, including humans, have a propensity to exponential population growth when resources are abundant but that actual growth is limited by available resources:
{{quote|Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand.... The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants, and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of reason, escape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. |Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter I.}}

A model of population growth bounded by resource limitations was developed by [[Pierre Francois Verhulst]] in 1838, after he had read Malthus' essay. Verhulst named the model a [[logistic function]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9890">'''Metatheatre''', and the closely related term '''metadrama''', describes the aspects of a [[Play (theatre)|play]] that draw attention to its nature as [[drama]] or [[theatre]], or to the circumstances of its performance.

These may include: the direct address of the audience (especially in [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[aside]]s, [[prologue]]s, and [[epilogue]]s); expression of an awareness of the presence of the audience (whether they are addressed directly or not); an acknowledgement of the fact that the people performing are [[actor]]s (and not actually the [[Character (arts)|character]]s they are playing); an element whose meaning depends on the difference between the [[Representation (arts)|represented]] time and place of the drama (the fictional world) and the time and place of its theatrical presentation (the reality of the theatre event); plays-within-plays (or masques, spectacles, or other forms of performance within the drama); [[Metareference|references]] to [[acting]], theatre, dramatic writing, [[Audience|spectatorship]], and the frequently employed [[metaphor]] according to which "[[all the world's a stage]]" (''Theatrum mundi''); scenes involving [[eavesdropping]] or other situations in which one or several characters observe another or others, such that the former relate to the behaviour of the latter as if it were a staged performance for their benefit.

The words "metatheatre" and "metadrama" combine [[theatre]] or [[drama]] with the Greek prefix "meta—", which implies "a level beyond" the subject that it qualifies.

Metatheatre has in modern times involved into the term "meta acting", usually in reference to movies, whereas the character gives an indication that he realizes he is in a movie, also called "breaking the fourth wall."

==In the history of drama==

===Greece and Rome===
Metatheatricality has been a dimension of drama ever since its invention in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre of]] [[classical Greece]] 2,500 years ago. One major purpose of this metatheatricality was to keep then spectators away from utter involvement or belief in the development of the plot presented.  [[Ancient Greek comedy]] in particular made frequent use of it (though examples can also be found in [[tragedy]]).

===Early modern theatre===
In [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern English theatre]], characters often adopt a downstage position in close contact with the audience and comment on the actions of others sarcastically or critically, while the other actors assume the convention that the first remains unheard and unseen while so doing. Following the work of Robert Weimann and others, [[theatre studies]] uses the terms ''locus'' and ''platea'' (relating to "location" and "place", borrowed from [[medieval theatre]]) to describe this performance effect—the ''locus'' is localised within the drama such that its characters are absorbed in its fiction and unaware of the presence of the audience; while the ''platea'' is a neutral space in close contact with the spectators that exists on the boundary between the fiction and the audience's reality.

When the defeated [[Cleopatra]], performed by a [[boy player]] in act five of Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', fears her humiliation in the theatres of Rome in plays staged to ridicule her, she says: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore". While the actor is not necessarily engaged at this point in the direct address of the audience, the reality of the male performer beneath the female character is openly, and comically, acknowledged (qualifying in important ways, supported further in the scene and the play as a whole, the tragic act of her imminent suicide). Metatheatricality of this kind is found in most plays of that period.

In ''Hamlet'', there occurs the following exchange between [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] and [[Polonius]]:
{{poemquote
|text=Hamlet: ... ''My lord, you played once i'th'university, you say.''
Polonius: ''That I did my lord, and was accounted a good actor.''
Hamlet: ''And what did you enact?''
Polonius: ''I did enact [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]. I was killed i'th'Capitol. [[Brutus]] killed me.''
Hamlet: ''It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.''
|title=''[[Hamlet]]'' (3.2.95–100).}}
If the only significance of this exchange lay in its reference to characters within another play, it might be called a [[metadrama]]tic (or "[[Intertextuality|intertextual]]") moment. Within its original performance context, however, there is a more specific, metatheatrical reference. Historians assume that Hamlet and Polonius were played by the same actors who had played the roles mentioned in Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' a year or two earlier on the same stage.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1985, 5).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the dramatic linking of the character of Hamlet with the murderer Brutus (foreshadowing Hamlet's murder of Polonius later in the play), the audience's awareness of the identities of the actors and their previous roles is comically referenced.

===Modern theatre===

====The fourth wall====
In the modern era, the rise of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] led to the development of a performance [[Dramatic convention|convention]] known as the "[[fourth wall]]". The metaphor suggests a relationship to the [[mise-en-scène]] behind a [[proscenium]] arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, the "fourth" of them would run along the line dividing the room from the auditorium (technically called the "proscenium"). The fourth wall is thus an invisible, imagined wall that separates the actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this "wall", the convention assumes, the actors act as if they cannot. In this sense, the "fourth wall" is a convention of [[acting]], rather than of [[set design]]. It can be created regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the [[Theater (building)|theatre building]] or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience.

"Breaking the fourth wall" is any instance in which this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is disregarded. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is metatheatrical.

A similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase "breaking the fourth wall" is used to describe such effects in those media.

====Modernism====
Instances of metatheatricality ''other'' than "breaking the fourth wall" occur in plays by many of the realist playwrights, including [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]], and [[Anton Chekhov]]. As with [[modernism]] more generally, metareference in the form of metatheatricality comes to play a far more central and significant role in the modernist theatre, particularly in the work of [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and many others.

In more recent times, ''[[With the People from the Bridge]]'' by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] employs metatheatrical techniques whereby a makeshift play centered on the vampire legend is viewed from the angle of a spectator who records in his diary the setting and preparations as well as the sequence of the actors' soliloquies interspersed with personal notes on the development of the performance.

==Origin of the term==
The term "metatheatre" was coined by [[Lionel Abel]] in 1963 and has since entered common critical usage. Abel described metatheatre as reflecting comedy and tragedy, at the same time, where the audience can laugh at the protagonist while feeling empathetic simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Abel 2003, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Abel relates it to the character of [[Alonso Quijano|Don Quixote]], whom he considers to be the prototypical, metatheatrical, self-referring character. Don Quixote looks for situations of which he wants to be a part, not waiting for life to oblige, but replacing reality with imagination when the world is lacking in his desires.&lt;ref&gt;Abel 2003, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The character is aware of his own theatricality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11943">The possibility that there might be '''more than one dimension of time''' has occasionally been discussed in [[physics]] and [[philosophy]].

== Physics ==

[[Special relativity]] describes [[spacetime]] as a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|manifold]] whose [[metric tensor]] has a negative [[eigenvalue]]. This corresponds to the existence of a "time-like" direction. A metric with multiple negative eigenvalues would correspondingly imply ''several'' timelike directions, i.e. multiple time dimensions, but there is no consensus regarding the relationship of these extra "times" to time as conventionally understood.

If the special theory of relativity can be generalized for the case of ''k''-dimensional time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''n''-dimensional space (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + ''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), then the (''k'' + ''n'')-dimensional interval, being invariant, is given by the expression

:(d''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''c''d''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + (''c''d''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (d''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − … − (d''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[metric signature]] will be

:&lt;math&gt;(\underbrace{+,\cdots,+}_{k},\underbrace{-,\cdots,-}_{n})&lt;/math&gt;  (timelike [[sign convention]])
or
:&lt;math&gt;(\underbrace{-,\cdots,-}_{k},\underbrace{+,\cdots,+}_{n})&lt;/math&gt; (spacelike sign convention).

The transformations between the two inertial frames of reference ''K'' and ''K''′, which are in a standard configuration (i.e., transformations without translations and/or rotations of the space axis in the [[hyperplane]] of [[space]] and/or rotations of the  time axis in the hyperplane of time), are given as follows:&lt;ref name="Milen2012"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t'_{\sigma} = \sum_{\theta=1}^k \left(\delta_{\sigma\theta} t_\theta + \frac{c^2}{v_\sigma v_{\theta}} \beta^2(\zeta-1) t_\theta\right) - \frac{1}{v_\sigma}\beta^2 \zeta x_{k+1},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x'_\lambda = x_\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1 = (v_1,\underbrace{0,\cdots,0}_{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_2 = (v_2,\underbrace{0,\cdots,0}_{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_{\mu=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v^2_\mu}}};&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \zeta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}};&lt;/math&gt;
''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''λ'' = ''k''+2, ''k''+3, ..., ''k''+''n''. Here ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''σθ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. These transformations are generalization of the [[Lorentz boost]] in a fixed space direction (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) in the field of the multidimensional [[time]] and multidimensional space.

Let us denote
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_\eta}{dt_\sigma} = V_{\sigma\eta}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx'_\eta}{dt'_\sigma} = V'_{\sigma\eta},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''η'' = ''k''+1, ''k''+2, ..., ''k''+''n''. The [[velocity-addition formula]] is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;V'_{\sigma(k+1)} = \frac{V_{\sigma(k+1)}\zeta\left(1 - \beta^2\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}}\right)}{1 + \frac  {V_{\sigma(k+1)}}{v_\sigma}\beta^2\left((\zeta-1)\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}} - \zeta\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V'_{\sigma \lambda} = \frac{V_{\sigma \lambda}}{1 + \frac{V_{\sigma(k+1)}}{v_\sigma}\beta^2\left((\zeta-1)\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}} - \zeta\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''λ'' = ''k''+2, ''k''+3, ..., ''k''+''n''.

For simplicity, let us consider only one spatial [[dimension]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the two time dimensions ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (E. g., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ct''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ct''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''.) Let us assume that in point ''O'', having coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, there has been an event ''E''. Let us further assume that a given interval of time &lt;math&gt;\Delta T = \sqrt{(\Delta t_1)^2 + (\Delta t_2)^2} \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; has passed since the event ''E''. The causal region connected to the event ''E'' includes the [[lateral surface]] of the [[right circular cone]] {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}, the lateral surface of the [[right circular cylinder]] {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} and the inner region bounded by these surfaces, i.e., the causal region includes all points (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), for which the conditions

:{(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and |''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;| ≤ ''c''Δ''T''} or

are fulfilled.&lt;ref name="Milen2012"/&gt;

Theories with more than one dimension of time have sometimes been advanced in physics, whether as a serious description of reality or just as a curious possibility. [[Itzhak Bars]]'s work on "two-time physics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.usc.edu/~bars/twoTph.htm |title=Two-Time Physics |last1=Bars |first1=Itzhak |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the SO(10,2) symmetry of the extended supersymmetry structure of [[M-theory]], is the most recent and systematic development of the concept (see also [[F-theory]]).  Walter Craig and Steven Weinstein proved the existence of a well-posed initial value problem for the [[ultrahyperbolic equation]] (a wave equation in more than one time dimension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/465/2110/3023 | title = On determinism and well-posedness in multiple time dimensions | publisher = Proc. R. Soc. A  vol. 465 no. 2110 3023-3046 (2008) | last1= Craig | first1 = Walter | last2 = Weinstein | first2 = Steven | accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed that initial data on a mixed (spacelike and timelike) hypersurface obeying a particular nonlocal constraint evolves deterministically in the remaining time dimension.

=== Connection to the Planck length and the speed of light ===

Let us regard the motion of a test particle with coordinate

&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu} = \begin{pmatrix} ct \\ r\cdot f\left(\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}\right) \\ \mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the canonical (1,3) spacetime vector &lt;math&gt; (ct, \mathbf{x})^{T} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; x \in \R^3 &lt;/math&gt; extended by an additional timelike coordinate &lt;math&gt; r \cdot f (\gamma\tau /\Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is the second time parameter, &lt;math&gt; r\in \R&lt;/math&gt; describes the size of the second time dimension and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic velocity, thus the equivalent of &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; describes the shape of the second time dimension and &lt;math&gt; \Lambda\in \R&lt;/math&gt; is a normalization parameter such that &lt;math&gt; \gamma\tau/\Lambda &lt;/math&gt; is dimensionless. Decomposing &lt;math&gt; x^{\mu}=x^{\mu}_t + x^{\mu}_{\tau} &lt;/math&gt; with 

&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu}_t = \begin {pmatrix} ct \\ 0 \\ \eta\mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix};\ x^{\mu}_{\tau} = \begin {pmatrix} 0 \\ r\cdot f\left(\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}\right) \\ (1-\eta)\mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix}, \eta\in(0,1) &lt;/math&gt;

and using the metric &lt;math&gt; (+,+,-,-,-) &lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lagrangian_mechanics | Lagrangian]] becomes

&lt;math&gt; L(x,\dot{x},x^{\prime},t,\tau)=\frac{r}{\Lambda}\sqrt{\dot{c}^2t^2+c^2-\eta^2\dot{\mathbf{x}}^2+2\dot{c}ct}\sqrt{(\gamma^{\prime 2}\tau^2+\gamma^2+2\gamma
\gamma^{\prime}\tau)\left(\left.\frac{df}{dz}\right|_{z=\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}}\right)^{2}-(1-\eta)^2\mathbf{x}^{\prime 2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the [[Euler-Lagrange Equations]]

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}+\frac{d}{d\tau}\frac{\partial L}{\partial x^{\prime\ }_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

the existence of the [[Planck length]] and the constancy of the [[speed of light]] can be derived.{{cn|date=November 2017|reason=source originally cited was not reliable}}

As a consequence of this model it has been suggested that the speed of light may not have been constant in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Time Varying Speed of Light as a Solution to Cosmological Puzzles | publisher = Phys. Rev. D vol. 59 043516 (1999) | last1= Albrecht | first1 = A. | last2=Magueijo | first2= J. |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Conceptual difficulties with multiple physical time dimensions have been raised in modern [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fqxi.org/community/essay/winners/2008.1#Weinstein | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Steven | title = Many Times | publisher=Foundational Questions Institute |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a solution to the problem of the subjective passage of time, [[J. W. Dunne]] proposed an infinite hierarchy of time dimensions, inhabited by a similar hierarchy of levels of consciousness. Dunne suggested that, in the context of a "block" spacetime as modelled by [[General Relativity]], a second dimension of time was needed in order to measure the speed of one's progress along one's own timeline. This in turn required a level of the conscious self existing at the second level of time. But the same arguments then applied to this new level, requiring a third level, and so on in an [[infinite regress]]. At the end of the regress was a "superlative general observer" who existed in [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~jmcd/book/revs3/aewt.html |title=John's Book Reviews: An Experiment with Time |last1=McDonald |first1=John Q. |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his theory in relation to [[precognition|precognitive]] dreams in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]'' and went on to explore its relevance to contemporary physics in ''The Serial Universe'' (1934). His infinite regress was criticised as logically flawed and unnecessary, although writers such as [[J. B. Priestley]] acknowledged the possibility of his second time dimension.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Gunn; ''The Problem of Time'', Unwin, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Priestley, ''Man and Time'', Aldus, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noema''' (plural: ''noemata'') derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word νόημα meaning "thought" or "what is thought about."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu (ed.s) ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Husserl]] used ''noema'' as a technical term in [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to stand for the object or content of a thought, judgement, or perception, but its precise meaning in his work has remained a matter of controversy.

==Husserl's noema==

In ''[[Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology]]'' (1913), Husserl introduced the terms "noema" and "[[noesis]]" to designate correlated elements of the structure of any intentional act — for example, an act of perceiving, or judging, or remembering:

"Corresponding to all points to the manifold data of the real (''reelle'') noetic content, there is a variety of data displayable in really pure (''wirklicher reiner'') intuition, and in a correlative 'noematic content,' or briefly 'noema' — terms which we shall henceforth be continually using."&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Every intentional act has noetic content (or a noesis — from the Greek [[nous]], "mind").  This noetic content, to which the noema corresponds, is that mental act-process (e.g., an act of liking, of judging, of meaning, etc.) which becomes directed towards the intentionally held object (e.g., the liked as liked, judged as judged, or meant as meant).&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology'' Polity, 2005, p133&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, every act has, as part of its formation, a noematic correlate, which is the object of the act — that which is intended by it.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p229&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, every intentional act has an "I-pole (the origin of the noesis)" and an "object-pole (or noema)."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Francois Lyotard, ''Phenomenology'', trans. Brian Beakley, SUNY Press, 1991, p55&lt;/ref&gt;  Husserl also refers to the noema as the ''Sinn'' or sense (meaning) of the act, and sometimes appears to use the terms interchangeably.  Nevertheless, the ''[[Sinn]]'' does not represent what Husserl calls the "full noema": ''Sinn'' belongs to the noema, but the full noema is the object of the act ''as meant'' in the act, the perceived object ''as'' perceived, the judged object ''as'' judged, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology'' Polity, 2005, p135; see also Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the noema seems to be whatever is intended by acts of perception or judgement in general, whether it be "a material object, a picture, a word, a mathematical entity, another person" precisely ''as'' being perceived, judged or otherwise thought about.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpreting Husserl==

In fact, commentators have been unable to achieve consensus on exactly what a noema is.  In a recent survey, David Woodruff Smith distinguished four different schools of thought.  On one view, to say that the noema is the intentional object of an act of consciousness is to mean that it quite literally is an object.  Husserl’s student [[Roman Ingarden]], for example, held that both ordinary objects, like chairs and trees, and intentional objects, like a chair precisely as it appears to me, or even a fictional tree, actually exist, but have different "modes" of existence.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 304-305&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view, developed primarily by Aron Gurwitsch, emphasizes the noema of perceptual experience.  Most ordinary objects can be perceived in different ways and from different perspectives (consider looking at a tree from several different positions).  For Gurwitsch, what is perceived in each such act is a noema, and the object itself – the tree, say – is to be understood as the collection or system of noemata associated with it.  This view has similarities with [[phenomenalism]].&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 305-306&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Sokolowski|Sokolowski]], alternatively, holds that a noema is just the actual object of perception or judgment itself, considered phenomenologically.  In other words, the noema of the judgment that “this chair is uncomfortable” is neither an entity (the chair considered as uncomfortable) which exists in addition to the chair itself (but with a different mode of existence) – the Ingarden view; nor is the noema of such a judgment identified with a particular tactile perception of the chair – which along with other perceptions constitutes the chair as such – the Gurwitsch view.  For Sokolowski, the noema is not a separate entity at all, but the chair itself ''as'' in this instance perceived or judged.  This seems consistent with Husserl’s emphasis on the noema as the "perceived as such…remembered as such…judged as such…"&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic philosopher [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], in an influential 1969 paper,&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Føllesdal, "Husserl’s Notion of Noema" ''Journal of Philosophy'' LXVI:20, 1969, pp. 680-687&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a Fregean interpretation of the noema, which has been developed extensively by Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, "Intentionality via Intensions" Journal of Philosophy LXVIII:18, 1971, pp541-561; Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith, "Theory of Intentionality" in J.N. Mohanty and William R. McKenna (eds) Husserl’s Phenomenology: a Textbook, Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology and University Press of America, 1989, pp. 147-179; see also David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, especially chapter six.&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought agrees that the noema is not a separate entity, but rather than identifying it with the actual object of the act (of perceiving, judging, etc.), phenomenologically understood, this view suggests that it is a mediating component of the act itself.  It is what gives the act the sense it has.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 306-307&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Føllesdal and his followers suggest that the noema is a generalized version of [[Frege]]’s account of linguistic meaning, and in particular of his concept of [[Sense and reference|sense]] (''Sinn'').  Just as Frege held that a linguistic expression picks out its reference by means of its sense, so Husserl believed that conscious acts generally – not merely acts of meaning but also acts of perception, judgment, etc. – are intentionally directed toward objects by means of their noemata.  On this view, the noema is not an object, but an abstract component of certain types of acts.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, "Intentionality via Intensions" ''Journal of Philosophy'' LXVIII:18, 1971, pp. 541-542&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokolowski has continued to reject this approach, arguing that "(t)o equate sense and noema would be to equate propositional and phenomenological reflection.  It would take philosophy simply as the critical reflection on our meanings or senses; it would equate philosophy with linguistic analysis." &lt;ref&gt;Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert C. Solomon attempted to reconcile the perception-based interpretation of the Gurwitsch school with the Fregean interpretation of noema as sense, suggesting that while "(i)t has now become virtually axiomatic among phenomenologists that the ''Sinne'' [senses] of experience stand independent of the ''Bedeutungen'' [meanings] of linguistic expressions.  It has become all but axiomatic among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] that there is no meaning apart from language.  It is the concept of the noema that provides the link between them.  The noema embodies both the changing phases of experience and the organizing sense of our experience.  But these two 'components' are not separable, for all experience requires meaning, not as an after-the-fact luxury in reflective judgements but in order for it to be experience ''of'' anything.”&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, "Husserl’s Concept of the Noema" in Frederick Elliston and Peter McCormick (eds) ''Husserl: Expositions and Appraisals'' University of Notre Dame Press, 1977, pp. 168-181; see p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
''Noema'' is in the ''[[OED]]'', which has shown its use for more than three centuries. It first was used in English in the field of [[rhetoric]] to denote "a figure of speech whereby something stated obscurely is nevertheless intended to be understood or worked out." In other words, a ''noema'' in rhetoric is obscure speech or speech that only yields meaning upon detailed reflection.

Peacham's 1577 ''Garden of Eloquence''&lt;ref&gt;Peacham's 1577 Garden of Eloquence – Publications from Stockholm University [http://www.diva-portal.org/su/abstract.xsql?dbid=6663]&lt;/ref&gt; used it this way, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Noema, when we doe signify some thing so privily that the hearers must be fayne to seeke out the meaning by long consideration." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5585">As in the [[Danish unit|case of the Danes]] the [[Norway|Norwegians']] earliest standards of measure can be derived from their [[ship burial]]s. The {{convert|60|ft|2|adj=mid|-long [[Kvalsund boat]]}} was built ca. 700 AD and differs from the [[Denmark|Danish]] boats less than it does from the [[Oseberg ship|Oseberg]], [[Gokstad ship|Gokstad]] and [[Tune ship|Tune]] ships which all date from ca. 800 AD. Thwarts are typically spaced about 3 feet apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.se/~m10354/publ/land&amp;sea.htm ...] rast&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1541, an ''alen'' in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] was defined by law to be the [[Sjælland]] ''alen''. Subsequently, the ''alen'' was defined by law as 2 Rhine feet from 1683. From 1824, the basic unit was defined as a ''fot'' being derived from [[astronomy]] as the length of a one-second pendulum times 12/38 at a [[latitude]] of 45°. The [[metric system]] was introduced in 1887.

== Length ==

* ''skrupel'' &amp;ndash; scruple, 1/12 ''linje'' or approx. 0.18&amp;nbsp;mm.
* ''linje'' &amp;ndash; line, 1/12 ''tomme'' or approx. 2.18&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''tomme'' &amp;ndash; thumb (inch), 1/12 ''fot'', approx. 26.1&amp;nbsp;mm. This unit was commonly used for measuring timber until the 1970s. Nowadays, the word refers invariably to the [[English units|English]] [[inch]], 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm.
* ''kvarter'' &amp;ndash; quarter, 1/4 ''alen''.
* ''fot'' &amp;ndash; foot, 1/2 ''alen''. From 1824, 313.74&amp;nbsp;mm.
* ''[[Alen (unit of length)|alen]]'' &amp;ndash; forearm or [[ell]], 627.48&amp;nbsp;mm from 1824, 627.5&amp;nbsp;mm from 1683, 632.6&amp;nbsp;mm from 1541. Before that, local variants.
* ''favn'' &amp;ndash; [[fathom]] (pl. ''favner''), 3 ''alen'', 1.882 [[metre|m]].
* ''stang'' &amp;ndash; rod, 5 ''alen'' or 3.1374 m
* ''lås'' &amp;ndash; 15 ''favner'', 28.2 m

* ''mil'' or ''landmil'' &amp;ndash; [[Scandinavian mile|Norwegian mile]], spelled ''miil'' prior to 1862, 18,000 ''alen'' (36,000 feet, 7.018 miles or 11.295&amp;nbsp;km). Before 1683, a ''mil'' was defined as 17600 ''alen'' or 11.13&amp;nbsp;km. Another old land-mile, 11.824&amp;nbsp;km. The unit survives to this day, but in a [[metric system|metric]] 10&amp;nbsp;km adaptation
* ''rast'' &amp;ndash;lit. "rest", the old name of the ''mil''. A suitable distance between rests when walking. Believed to be approx. 9&amp;nbsp;km before 1541.
* ''Kaffekok'', a similar term to ''rast'' used in the north by the indigenous [[Sami people]].
* ''steinkast'' &amp;ndash; stone's throw, perhaps 25 ''favner'', used to this day as a very approximate measure of a short distance.

=== Nautical ===
* ''favn'' &amp;ndash; fathom (pl. ''favner''), 3 ''alen'', 1.85 m
* ''kabellengde'' &amp;ndash; [[cable length]], 100 ''favner'', 185,2 m, or 1/10 international nautical mile, 185.2 m
* ''kvartmil'' &amp;ndash; quarter mile, 10 ''kabellengder'', 1852 m. Kvartmil was a quarter of a Sjømil.
* ''sjømil'' &amp;ndash; sea mile, now often (but wrongly) the international nautical mile, 1.852&amp;nbsp;km, but  also used for other nautical miles and the ''geografisk mil''. Sjømil was 3950 fathoms.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.tvu.nu/color/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=188&amp;Itemid=20 Skipsside - Sjømil]&lt;sup&gt;in Norwegian&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''geografisk mil'' &amp;ndash; 7421 m or 4.007 nautical miles,&lt;!--not 7,408 m, that is 4 international nautical miles--&gt; defined as 1/15 Equatorial degree or 4 minutes of arc.

== Area ==
* ''mål'' &amp;ndash; 100 ''kvadrat rode'', 984 m². The unit survives to this day, but in a 1000 m² adaptation, synonym for the metric [[decare]] (''dekar'' in Norwegian).
* ''kvadrat rode'' &amp;ndash; square ''stang'', 9.84 m²
* ''tønneland'' &amp;ndash; "barrel of land", 4 ''mål''

== Volume ==
* ''favn'' &amp;ndash; 1 ''alen'' by 1 ''favn'' by 1 ''favn'', 2.232 m³, used for measuring firewood to this day.
* ''skjeppe'' &amp;ndash; 1/8 ''tønne'', i.e. 17.4 [[l]].

In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[category theory]], a '''polygraph''' is a generalisation of a [[directed graph]].  It is also known as a '''computad'''.  They were introduced as "polygraphs" by [[Albert Burroni]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Burroni. ''Higher-dimensional word problems with applications to equational logic''.

In the same way that a [[Multigraph#Directed_multigraph_(edges_without_own_identity)|directed multigraph]] can [[Free object|freely]] generate a [[Category (mathematics)|category]], an ''n''-computad is the "most general" structure which can generate a free [[n-category]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=computad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''precautionary principle''' (or '''precautionary approach''') generally defines actions on issues considered to be uncertain, for instance applied in assessing [[risk management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2017/September-October%202017/precautionary-principle-full.html |title=The Precautionary Principle Under Fire |author=Rupert Read and Tim O'Riordan |date= |website=EnvironmentMagazine.org |publisher=[[Environment (magazine)|Environment]] |issue=September–October 2017 |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision (e.g. taking a particular course of action) when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. The principle implies that there is a [[social responsibility]] to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk. These protections can be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result.

In some legal systems, as in [[law of the European Union]], the application of the precautionary principle has been made a [[statutory]] requirement in some areas of law.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 191 (2) TFEU, Explanations Relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2007/C 303/02, OJ EU C303/35 14.12.2007 explanation on article 52 (5) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, T-13/99 Pfizer vs Council p.114-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding international conduct, the first endorsement of the principle was in 1982 when the [[World Charter for Nature]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], while its first international implementation was in 1987 through the [[Montreal Protocol]]. Soon after, the principle integrated with many other legally binding international treaties such as the [[Rio Declaration]] and [[Kyoto Protocol]].

==Origins and theory==
The concept "precautionary principle" is generally considered to have arisen in English from a translation of the German term ''[[:de:Vorsorgeprinzip|Vorsorgeprinzip]]'' in the 1980s. In 1988, Konrad von Moltke described the German concept for a British audience, which he translated into English as the precautionary principle.&lt;ref name=Christiansen&gt;Sonja Boehmer Christiansen. The Precautionary Principle in Germany: Enabling Government.  Chapter 2 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=e4vjoqgeaIMC&amp;pg Interpreting the Precautionary Principle], eds Tim O'Riordan and James Cameron Earthscan Publications Ltd, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}

The concepts underpinning the precautionary principle pre-date the term's inception. For example, the essence of the principle is captured in a number of cautionary [[aphorism]]s such as "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure", "better safe than sorry", and "look before you leap". The precautionary principle may also be interpreted as the evolution of the "ancient-medical principle" of "[[Primum non nocere|first, do no harm]]" to apply to institutions and institutional decision-making processes rather than individuals.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2013}}

In economics, the Precautionary Principle has been analysed in terms of "the effect on rational decision-making", of "the interaction of [[irreversibility]]" and "[[uncertainty]]". Authors such as Epstein (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2526180 |author=Epstein, L.S. |title=Decision-making and the temporal resolution of uncertainty |jstor=2526180 |journal=International Economic Review |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=269–283 |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrow and Fischer (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1883074 |author1=Arrow, K.J.  |author2=Fischer, A.C. |title=Environmental preservation, uncertainty and irreversibility |jstor=1883074 |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=312–9 |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show that "irreversibility of possible future consequences" creates a "quasi-[[Option (finance)|option]] effect" which should induce a "[[risk]]-neutral" society to favour current decisions that allow for more flexibility in the future. Gollier et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00052-3 |author=Gollier, Christian, Bruno Jullien &amp; Nicolas Treich |title=Scientific Progress and Irreversibility: An Economic Interpretation of the 'Precautionary Principle' |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=229–253 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that "more scientific uncertainty as to the distribution of a future risk – that is, a larger variability of beliefs – should induce society to take stronger prevention measures today" p245.

==Formulations==

Many definitions of the precautionary principle exist: Precaution may be defined as "caution in advance", "caution practised in the context of uncertainty", or informed [[prudence]]. Two ideas lie at the core of the principle:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jordan &amp; Timothy O'Riordan. Chapter 3, The precautionary principle: a legal and policy history, in [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/91173/E83079.pdf The precautionary principle: protecting public health, the environment  and the future of our children]. Edited by: Marco Martuzzi and Joel A. Tickner. World Health Organization 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

#an expression of a need by decision-makers to anticipate harm before it occurs. Within this element lies an implicit reversal of the onus of proof: under the precautionary principle it is the responsibility of an activity-proponent to establish that the proposed activity will not (or is very unlikely to) result in significant harm.
#the concept of proportionality of the risk and the cost and feasibility of a proposed action

One of the primary foundations of the precautionary principle, and globally accepted definitions, results from the work of the [[Rio Conference]], or "[[Earth Summit]]" in 1992. The principle 15 of the [[Rio Declaration]] notes: "In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163|title=Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|author=UNEP|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 [[Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle|Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle]] summarises the principle this way: "When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically."&lt;ref name="SEHN-Wingspread"&gt;Staff, Science and Environmental Health Network. 26 January 1998 [http://www.sehn.org/wing.html Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; The Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle was convened by the Science and Environmental Health Network.&lt;ref name="SEHN-Wingspread"/&gt;

In February 2000, the [[Commission of the European Communities]] noted in a ''Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle'' that, "The precautionary principle is not defined in the [[Treaties of the European Union]], which prescribes it [the Precautionary Principle] only once – to protect the environment. But in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary-objective-scientific-evaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or [and] plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection [for what] chosen for the Community."&lt;ref name=EU-Comm-PP&gt;Commission of the European Communities.  2 February 2000 [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-96_en.htm Communication From The Commission on the Precautionary Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

The January 2000 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] says, in regard to controversies over [[GMO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s: "Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information ... shall not prevent the Party of [I]mport, in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects, from taking a decision, as appropriate, with regard to the import of the living modified organism in question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/2000/01/20000129%2008-44%20PM/Ch_XXVII_08_ap.pdf |title=Official text of the Cartagena Protocol |format=PDF |publisher=United Nations |date=29 January 2000 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Application==
The application of the precautionary principle is hampered by both lack of political will,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} as well as the wide range of interpretations placed on it. One study identified 14 different formulations of the principle in treaties and nontreaty declarations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Vecchia|first2=Paolo|last3=Repacholi|first3=Michael H.|date=12 May 2000|title=Science and the Precautionary Principle|journal=Science|volume=288|issue=5468|pages=979–981|doi=10.1126/science.288.5468.979|issn=0036-8075|pmid=10841718|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

# Scientific uncertainty should not automatically preclude regulation of activities that pose a potential risk of significant harm (Non-Preclusion PP).
# Regulatory controls should incorporate a margin of safety; activities should be limited below the level at which no adverse effect has been observed or predicted (Margin of Safety PP).
# Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be subject to best technology available requirements to minimise the risk of harm unless the proponent of the activity shows that they present no appreciable risk of harm (BAT PP).
# Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be prohibited unless the proponent of the activity shows that it presents no appreciable risk of harm (Prohibitory PP).

In deciding how to apply the principle, one may use a [[cost-benefit analysis]] that factors in both the [[opportunity cost]] of not acting, and the [[option value]] of waiting for further information before acting.{{cn|date=February 2018}} One of the difficulties of the application of the principle in modern{{vague|date=February 2018}} policy-making is that there is often an irreducible{{according to whom|date=February 2018}} conflict between different interests, so that the debate necessarily involves politics.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

=== Strong vs. weak ===
''Strong precaution'' holds that regulation is required whenever there is a possible risk to health, safety, or the environment, even if the supporting evidence is speculative and even if the economic costs of regulation are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sachs | first = Noah M. |  title = Rescuing the Strong Precautionary Principle from its Critics | journal = University of Illinois Law Review | volume = 2011 | issue = 4 | pages = 1285–1338 | date =  | origyear = | year = 2011 | month = | url = http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Sachs.pdf | jstor =  | doi =  | id =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1295–96}}  In 1982, the United Nations [[World Charter for Nature]] gave the first international recognition to the strong version of the principle, suggesting that when "potential adverse effects are not fully understood, the activities should not proceed". The widely publicised Wingspread Declaration, from a meeting of environmentalists in 1998, is another example of the strong version.&lt;ref name="goliath.ecnext.com"&gt;"The paralyzing principle: Does the precautionary principle point us in any helpful direction?"

''Weak precaution'' holds that lack of scientific evidence does not preclude action if damage would otherwise be serious and irreversible.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mandel | first = Gregory N. | author-link =  | last2 = Gathii | first2 = James Thuo | author2-link =  | title = Cost Benefit Analysis Versus the Precautionary Principle: Beyond Cass Sunstein's Laws of Fear | journal = University of Illinois Law Review | volume = 2006 | issue = 5 | pages = 1037–1079 | date = | origyear = | year = 2006 | month = | url = http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2006/5/Mandel.pdf | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to a publication by the [[New Zealand Treasury]] Department,

&lt;blockquote&gt; The weak version [of the Precautionary Principle] is the least restrictive and allows preventive measures to be taken in the face of uncertainty, but does not require them (eg, Rio Declaration 1992; United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change 1992). To satisfy the threshold of harm, there must be some evidence relating to both the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of consequences. Some, but not all, require consideration of the costs of precautionary measures. Weak formulations do not preclude weighing benefits against the costs. Factors other than scientific uncertainty, including economic considerations, may provide legitimate grounds for postponing action. Under weak formulations, the requirement to justify the need for action (the burden of proof) generally falls on those advocating precautionary action. No mention is made of assignment of liability for environmental harm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Strong versions justify or require precautionary measures and some also establish liability for environmental harm, which is effectively a strong form of "polluter pays". For example, the [[Earth Charter]] states: "When knowledge is limited apply a precautionary approach ... Place the burden of proof on those who argue that a proposed activity will not cause significant harm, and make the responsible parties liable for environmental harm." Reversal of proof requires those proposing an activity to prove that the product, process or technology is sufficiently "safe" before approval is granted. Requiring proof of "no environmental harm" before any action proceeds implies the public is not prepared to accept any environmental risk, no matter what economic or social benefits may arise (Peterson, 2006). At the extreme, such a requirement could involve bans and prohibitions on entire classes of potentially threatening activities or substances (Cooney, 2005). Over time, there has been a gradual transformation of the precautionary principle from what appears in the Rio Declaration to a stronger form that arguably [by whom] acts as restraint on development in the absence of firm evidence that it will do no harm.&lt;ref&gt;"Precautionary Principle: Origins, definitions, and interpretations." Treasury Publication, Government of New Zealand. 2006. http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/research-policy/ppp/2006/06-06/05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== International agreements and declarations ===
The World Charter for Nature, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982, was the first international endorsement of the precautionary principle. The principle was implemented in an international treaty as early as the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], and among other international treaties and declarations is reflected in the 1992 [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] (signed at the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]).

===="Principle" vs. "approach"====
&lt;blockquote&gt;No introduction to the precautionary principle would be complete without brief reference to the difference between the precautionary '''principle''' and the precautionary '''approach'''. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration 1992 states that: "in order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall be not used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." As Garcia (1995) pointed out, "the wording, largely similar to that of the principle, is subtly different in that: (1) it recognizes that there may be differences in local capabilities to apply the approach, and (2) it calls for cost-effectiveness in applying the approach, e.g., taking economic and social costs into account." The 'approach' is generally considered a softening of the 'principle'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As Recuerda has noted, the distinction between the 'precautionary principle' and a 'precautionary approach' is diffuse and, in some contexts, controversial. In the negotiations of international declarations, the United States has opposed the use of the term 'principle' because this term has special connotations in legal language, due to the fact that a 'principle of law` is a source of law. This means that it is compulsory, so a court can quash or confirm a decision through the application of the precautionary principle. In this sense, the precautionary principle is not a simple idea or a desideratum but a source of law. This is the legal status of the precautionary principle in the European Union. On the other hand, an 'approach' usually does not have the same meaning, although in some particular cases an approach could be binding. A precautionary approach is a particular 'lens' used to identify risk that every prudent person possesses (Recuerda, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Recuerda, M. A. |title=Dangerous interpretations of the precautionary principle and the foundational values of the European Union Food Law: Risk versus Risk |journal=Journal of Food Law &amp; Policy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====European Union====
On 2 February 2000, the [[European Commission]] issued a Communication on the precautionary principle,&lt;ref name=EU-Comm-PP/&gt; in which it adopted a procedure for the application of this concept, but without giving a detailed definition of it. Paragraph 2 of article 191 of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C:2016:202:FULL&amp;from=EN Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union] article 191, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the adoption of the European Commission's Communication on the precautionary principle, the principle has come to inform much EU policy, including areas beyond [[environmental policy]]. As of 2006 it had been integrated into EU laws "in matters such as general product safety, the use of additives for use in animal nutrition, the incineration of waste, and the regulation of genetically modified organisms".&lt;ref name=Recuerda&gt;{{cite journal |author=Recuerda, Miguel A. |title=Risk and Reason in the European Union Law |journal=European Food and Feed Law Review |volume=5 |issue= |pages= |year=2006 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|282–83}}   Through its application in [[case law]], it has become a "general principle of EU law".&lt;ref name=Recuerda/&gt;{{rp|283}}

==== France ====

In France, the [[Charter for the Environment]] contains a formulation of the precautionary principle (article 5):
{{Block quote|When the occurrence of any damage, albeit unpredictable in the current state of scientific knowledge, may seriously and irreversibly harm the environment, public authorities shall, with due respect for the principle of precaution and the areas within their jurisdiction, ensure the implementation of procedures for risk assessment and the adoption of temporary measures commensurate with the risk involved in order to preclude the occurrence of such damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====United States====
On 18 July 2005, the City of San Francisco passed a Precautionary Principle Purchasing ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14134&amp;sid=5 Municode] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205100244/http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14134&amp;sid=5 |date=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires the city to weigh the environmental and health costs of its $600&amp;nbsp;million in annual purchases – for everything from cleaning supplies to computers. Members of the Bay Area Working Group on the Precautionary Principle including the [[Breast Cancer Fund]], helped bring this to fruition.

====Japan====
In 1997, Japan tried to use the consideration of the precautionary principle in a WTO SPS [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] case, as Japan's requirement to test each variety of agricultural products (apples, cherries, peaches, walnuts, apricots, pears, plums and quinces) for the efficacy of treatment against codling moths was challenged.

This moth is a pest that does not occur in Japan, and whose introduction has the potential to cause serious damage. The United States claimed that it was not necessary to test each variety of a fruit for the efficacy of the treatment, and that this varietal testing requirement was unnecessarily burdensome.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Australia====
The most important Australian court case so far, due to its exceptionally detailed consideration of the precautionary principle, is Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council.&lt;ref&gt;[2006] NSWLEC 133 (24 March 2006) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLEC/2006/133.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principle was summarised by reference to the [[New South Wales|NSW]] ''Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991'', which itself provides a good definition of the principle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html|title=PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT ADMINISTRATION ACT 1991 - SECT 6 Objectives of the Authority|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reasoning for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. In the application of the principle… decisions should be guided by:
(i) careful evaluation to avoid, wherever practicable, serious or irreversible damage to the environment; and
(ii) an assessment of risk-weighted consequence of various options".

The most significant points of Justice Preston's decision are the following findings:&lt;ref&gt;Hon. Justice Brian J Preston, (2006), 'Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 133', ''Land and Environment Court of New South Wales''. Paragraphs 125-183. https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/549f8a6b3004262463ad5606&lt;/ref&gt;
# The principle and accompanying need to take precautionary measures is "triggered" when two prior conditions exist: a threat of serious or irreversible damage, and scientific uncertainty as to the extent of possible damage.
# Once both are satisfied, "a proportionate precautionary measure may be taken to avert the anticipated threat of environmental damage, but it should be proportionate."
# The threat of serious or irreversible damage should invoke consideration of five factors: the scale of threat (local, regional etc.); the perceived value of the threatened environment; whether the possible impacts are manageable; the level of public concern, and whether there is a rational or scientific basis for the concern.
# The consideration of the level of scientific uncertainty should involve factors which may include: what would constitute sufficient evidence; the level and kind of uncertainty; and the potential to reduce uncertainty.
# The principle shifts the burden of proof. If the principle applies, the burden shifts: "a decision maker must assume the threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage is… a reality [and] the burden of showing this threat… is negligible reverts to the proponent…"
# The precautionary principle invokes preventative action: "the principle permits the taking of preventative measures without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of the threat become fully known".
# "The precautionary principle should not be used to try to avoid all risks."
# The precautionary measures appropriate will depend on the combined effect of "the degree of seriousness and irreversibility of the threat and the degree of uncertainty… the more significant and uncertain the threat, the greater…the precaution required". "…measures should be adopted… proportionate to the potential threats".

The [[Body Shop|Body Shop International]], a UK-based cosmetics company, included the precautionary principle in their 2006 Chemicals Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebodyshopinternational.com/NR/rdonlyres/D7F2A9D1-416A-47B8-8BC3-1E858A37F81C/0/BSI_Chemicals_Strategy.pdf |title=Chemicals Strategy |publisher=The Body Shop |date=August 2006 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment and health ===
Fields typically concerned by the precautionary principle are the possibility of:
* [[Global warming]] or [[abrupt climate change]] in general
* [[Extinction]] of species
* Introduction of new and potentially harmful products into the environment, threatening [[biodiversity]] (e.g., [[genetically modified organisms]])
* Threats to [[public health]], due to new diseases and techniques (e.g., HIV transmitted through blood transfusion)
* Long-term effects of new technologies (e.g. [[Mobile phone radiation and health|health concerns regarding radiation from cell phones]] and other electronics communications devices)
* Persistent or acute pollution (e.g., [[asbestos]], [[endocrine disruptors]])
* Food safety (e.g., [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]])
* Other new [[biosafety]] issues (e.g., [[artificial life]], new [[molecule]]s)

The precautionary principle is often applied to [[biology|biological]] fields because changes cannot be easily [[containment|contained]] and have the potential of being global. The principle has less relevance to contained fields such as [[aeronautics]], where the few people undergoing [[risk]] have given [[informed consent]] (e.g., a [[test pilot]]). In the case of technological innovation, containment of impact tends to be more difficult if that technology can self-replicate. [[Bill Joy]] emphasised the dangers of replicating genetic technology, nanotechnology, and robotic technology in his article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", though he does not specifically cite the precautionary principle. The application of the principle can be seen in the public policy of requiring [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] to carry out [[clinical trial]]s to show that new [[medications]] are safe.

Oxford based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea of a future powerful [[superintelligence]], and the risks that we/it face should it attempt to gain atomic level control of matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Bostrom]] 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence – section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Application of the principle modifies the status of innovation and [[risk assessment]]: it is not the risk that must be avoided or amended, but a potential risk that must be prevented. Thus, in the case of regulation of scientific research, there is a third party beyond the scientist and the regulator: the consumer.

In an analysis concerning application of the precautionary principle to [[nanotechnology]], Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder posit that there are ''two forms'' of the principle, which they call the "strict form" and the "active form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/precautionary.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Precautionary Principle Analyzed |publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology |date=January 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former "requires inaction when action might pose a risk", while the latter means "choosing less risky alternatives when they are available, and [...] taking responsibility for potential risks." [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued for stronger application of the precautionary principle by chemical and health technology regulators particularly in relation to Ti0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnO nanoparticles in [[sunscreens]], biocidal nanosilver in waterways and products whose manufacture, handling or recycling exposes humans to the risk of inhaling multi-walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Faunce TA, etal |title=Sunscreen Safety: The Precautionary Principle, The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Nanoparticles in Sunscreens |journal=Nanoethics |volume=2 |issue= 3|pages=231–240 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s11569-008-0041-z |url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228183131/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource management ===

In classifying [[endangered species]], the precautionary principle means that if there is doubt about an animal's or plant's exact [[Wikipedia:Conservation status|conservation status]], the one that would cause the strongest protective measures to be realised should be chosen. Thus, a species like the [[silvery pigeon]] that might exist in considerable numbers and simply be under-recorded or might just as probably be long extinct is not classified as "data deficient" or "extinct" (which both do not require any protective action to be taken), but as "critically endangered" (the conservation status that confers the need for the strongest protection), whereas the increasingly rare, but probably not yet endangered [[emerald starling]] is classified as "data deficient", because there is urgent need for research to clarify its status rather than for conservation action to save it from extinction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

If, for example, a large ground-water body that people use for drinking water is contaminated by bacteria (e-coli 0157 H7, campylobacter or leptospirosis) and the source of contamination is strongly suspected to be dairy cows but the exact science is not yet able to provide absolute proof, the cows should be removed from the environment until they are proved, by the dairy industry, not to be the source or until that industry ensures that such contamination will not recur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Criticisms==
Critics of the principle use arguments similar to those against other formulations of technological conservatism.

===Internal inconsistency: applying strong PP risks causing harm===
Strong formulations of the precautionary principle, without regard to its most basic provisions that it is to be applied only where risks are potentially high AND not easily calculable, applied to the principle itself as a policy decision, may rule out its own use.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"/&gt;{{rp|26ff}}  The reason suggested is that preventing innovation from coming to market means that only current technology may be used, and current technology itself may cause harm or leave needs unmet; there is a risk of causing harm by blocking innovation.&lt;ref name = Guardian&gt;Brown, Tracey (9 July 2013)[https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/09/precautionary-principle-blunt-instrument The precautionary principle is a blunt instrument] ''[[The Guardian]]'', Retrieved 9 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Seethaler.

===Blocking innovation and progress generally===

===Vagueness and plausibility===
The precautionary principle calls for action in the face of scientific uncertainty, but some formulations do not specify the minimal threshold of plausibility of risk that acts as a "triggering" condition, so that any indication that a proposed product or activity might harm health or the environment is sufficient to invoke the principle.&lt;ref name="vandenBelt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.103.023531 |author=van den Belt H |title=Debating the Precautionary Principle: "Guilty until Proven Innocent" or "Innocent until Proven Guilty"? |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=1122–6 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12857792 |pmc=526264 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12857792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ronald.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4856">In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[formal system]]s, a '''primitive notion''' is an undefined concept. In particular, a primitive notion is not defined in terms of previously defined concepts, but is only motivated informally, usually by an appeal to [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and everyday experience. In an [[axiomatic theory]] or other [[formal system]], the role of a primitive notion is analogous to that of [[axiom]]. In axiomatic theories, the primitive notions are sometimes said to be "defined" by one or more axioms, but this can be misleading. Formal theories cannot dispense with primitive notions, under pain of [[infinite regress]].

==Details==
[[Alfred Tarski]] explained the role of primitive notions as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski]] (1946) ''Introduction to Logic and the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences'', p. 118, [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
:When we set out to construct a given discipline, we distinguish, first of all, a certain small group of expressions of this discipline that seem to us to be immediately understandable; the expressions in this group we call PRIMITIVE TERMS or UNDEFINED TERMS, and we employ them without explaining their meanings. At the same time we adopt the principle: not to employ any of the other expressions of the discipline under consideration, unless its meaning has first been determined with the help of primitive terms and of such expressions of the discipline whose meanings have been explained previously. The sentence which determines the meaning of a term in this way is called a DEFINITION,...

An inevitable regress to primitive notions in the [[theory of knowledge]] was explained by [[Gilbert de B. Robinson]]:
:To a non-mathematician it often comes as a surprise that it is impossible to define explicitly all the terms which are used. This is not a superficial problem but lies at the root of all knowledge; it is necessary to begin somewhere, and to make progress one must clearly state those elements and relations which are undefined and those properties which are taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert de B. Robinson]] (1959) ''Foundations of Geometry'', 4th ed., p. 8, [[University of Toronto Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The necessity for primitive notions is illustrated in several axiomatic foundations in mathematics:
* [[Set theory]]: The concept of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is an example of a primitive notion. As [[Mary Tiles]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Tiles]] (2004) ''The Philosophy of Set Theory'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; [The] 'definition' of 'set' is less a definition than an attempt at explication of something which is being given the status of a primitive, undefined, term. As evidence, she quotes [[Felix Hausdorff]]: "A set is formed by the grouping together of single objects into a whole. A set is a plurality thought of as a unit."
* [[Naive set theory]]: The [[empty set]] is a primitive notion. To assert that it exists would be an implicit [[axiom]].
* [[Peano arithmetic]]: The [[successor function]] and the number [[zero]] are primitive notions. Since Peano arithmetic is useful in regards to properties of the numbers, the objects that the primitive notions represent may not strictly matter.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}
* [[Axiomatic system]]s: The primitive notions will depend upon the set of axioms chosen for the system.  [[Alessandro Padoa]] discussed this selection at the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Paris in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandro Padoa]] (1900) "Logical introduction to any deductive theory" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]] (1967) ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879–1931'', [[Harvard University Press]] 118–23&lt;/ref&gt; The notions themselves may not necessarily need to be stated; Susan Haack (1978) writes, "A set of axioms is sometimes said to give an implicit definition of its primitive terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Susan|last=Haack|year=1978|title=Philosophy of Logics|page=245|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521293297}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Euclidean geometry]]: Under [[Hilbert's axiom system]] the primitive notions are ''point, line, plane, congruence, betweeness'', and ''incidence''.
* [[Euclidean geometry]]: Under [[Foundations of geometry#Pasch and Peano|Peano's axiom system]] the primitive notions are ''point, segment'', and ''motion''.
* [[Philosophy of mathematics]]: [[Bertrand Russell]] considered the "indefinables of mathematics" to build the case for [[logicism]] in his book ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7111">In computer [[programming language]]s, a '''recursive data type''' (also known as a '''recursively-defined''', '''inductively-defined''' or '''inductive data type''') is a [[data type]] for values that may contain other values of the same type. Data of recursive types are usually viewed as [[directed graph]]s.

An important application of recursion in computer science is in defining dynamic data structures such as Lists and Trees.  Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to an arbitrarily large size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, a static array's size requirements must be set at compile time.

Sometimes the term "inductive data type" is used for [[algebraic data type]]s which are not necessarily recursive.

==Example==
{{also|Recursion (computer science)#Recursive data structures (structural recursion)}}
An example is the [[List (computing)|list]] type, in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;

This indicates that a list of a's is either an empty list or a '''cons cell''' containing an 'a' (the "head" of the list) and another list (the "tail").

Another example is a similar singly linked type in Java:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
class List&lt;E&gt; {
    E value;
    List&lt;E&gt; next;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This indicates that non-empty list of type E contains a data member of type E, and a reference to another List object for the rest of the list (or a null reference to indicate that this is the end of the list).

===Mutually recursive data types===
{{see|Mutual recursion#Data types}}
Data types can also be defined by [[mutual recursion]]. The most important basic example of this is a [[tree (data structure)|tree]], which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically:
 f: &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 t: v f
A forest ''f'' consists of a list of trees, while a tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a forest ''f'' (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types.

This mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest:
 t: v &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
A tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list another, which require disentangling to prove results about.

In [[Standard ML]], the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees:{{sfn|Harper|2000|loc="[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/introsml/core/datatypes.htm Data Types]"}}
&lt;source lang=sml&gt;
datatype 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a forest
and      'a forest = Nil | Cons of 'a tree * 'a forest
&lt;/source&gt;

==Theory==
In [[type theory]], a recursive type has the general form μα.T where the [[type variable]] α may appear in the type T and stands for the entire type itself.

For example, the natural numbers (see [[Peano arithmetic]]) may be defined by the Haskell datatype:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
&lt;/source&gt;

In type theory, we would say: &lt;math&gt;nat = \mu \alpha. 1 + \alpha&lt;/math&gt; where the two arms of the [[sum type]] represent the Zero and Succ data constructors. Zero takes no arguments (thus represented by the [[unit type]]) and Succ takes another Nat (thus another element of &lt;math&gt;\mu \alpha. 1 + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

There are two forms of recursive types: the so-called isorecursive types, and equirecursive types.  The two forms differ in how terms of a recursive type are introduced and eliminated.

===Isorecursive types===
With isorecursive types, the recursive type &lt;math&gt;\mu \alpha . T&lt;/math&gt; and its expansion (or ''unrolling'') &lt;math&gt;T[\mu \alpha.T / \alpha]&lt;/math&gt; (Where the notation&lt;math&gt;X[Y/Z]&lt;/math&gt; indicates that all instances of Z are replaced with Y in X) are distinct (and disjoint) types with special term constructs, usually called ''roll'' and ''unroll'', that form an [[isomorphism]] between them.  To be precise: &lt;math&gt;roll : T[\mu\alpha.T/\alpha] \to \mu\alpha.T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;unroll : \mu\alpha.T \to T[\mu\alpha.T/\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;, and these two are [[inverse function]]s.

===Equirecursive types===
Under equirecursive rules, a recursive type &lt;math&gt;\mu \alpha . T&lt;/math&gt; and its unrolling &lt;math&gt;T[\mu\alpha.T/\alpha]&lt;/math&gt; are ''equal'' -- that is, those two type expressions are understood to denote the same type.  In fact, most theories of equirecursive types go further and essentially stipulate that any two type expressions with the same "infinite expansion" are equivalent.  As a result of these rules, equirecursive types contribute significantly more complexity to a type system than isorecursive types do.  Algorithmic problems such as type checking and [[type inference]] are more difficult for equirecursive types as well.  Since direct comparison does not make sense on an equirecursive type, they can be converted into a canonical form in O(n log n) time, which can easily be compared.&lt;ref name="canonicalize"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.4.2276|title=Numbering Matters: First-Order Canonical Forms for Second-Order Recursive Types}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Equirecursive types capture the form of self-referential (or mutually referential) type definitions seen in procedural and [[object-oriented]] programming languages, and also arise in type-theoretic semantics of objects and [[Class (computer science)|class]]es.
In functional programming languages, isorecursive types (in the guise of datatypes) are far more common.

====In type synonyms====
Recursion is not allowed in [[type synonym]]s in [[Miranda programming language|Miranda]], [[OCaml]] (unless -rectypes flag is used or it's a record or variant), and Haskell; so for example the following Haskell types are illegal:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Bad = (Int, Bad)
type Evil = Bool -&gt; Evil
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead, you must wrap it inside an algebraic data type (even if it only has one constructor):

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Good = Pair Int Good
data Fine = Fun (Bool-&gt;Fine)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is because type synonyms, like [[typedef]]s in C, are replaced with their definition at compile time. (Type synonyms are not "real" types; they are just "aliases" for convenience of the programmer.) But if you try to do this with a recursive type, it will loop infinitely because no matter how many times you substitute it, it still refers to itself, e.g. "Bad" will grow indefinitely: (Int, (Int, (Int, ... .

Another way to see it is that a level of indirection (the algebraic data type) is required to allow the isorecursive type system to figure out when to ''roll'' and ''unroll''.

==Details==
The idea for Refill came from Natalie Fee, who set up the [[community interest company]] City to Sea in order to launch Refill in Bristol in 2015.&lt;ref name="guardian-taylor"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Matthew|last1=Taylor|accessdate=2018-09-07|title=The Bristol refill-reuse bottle campaign that is spreading across Europe|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/the-bristol-refill-reuse-bottle-campaign-that-is-spreading-across-europe|date=29 June 2017|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; City to Sea continues to organise it&lt;ref name="guardian-smithers-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; along with sponsor [[United Kingdom water companies|Water UK]].&lt;ref name="guardian-smithers-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-09-07|title=Free water in England to cut plastic waste|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-42808302|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 January 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Santa Claus machine''', named after the folkloric [[Santa Claus]], is a hypothetical machine that is capable of creating any required object or structure out of any given material. It is most often referenced by [[Futures studies|futurist]]s and [[science fiction]] writers when discussing hypothetical projects of enormous scale, such as a [[Dyson sphere]]. These types of future constructions would be too large for many civilizations to build directly, so they would need a series of machines to intelligently build the machine with little or no direct control.

==Origin==
The term was coined by [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]] in 1978:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's possible to imagine a machine that could scoop up material – rocks from the Moon or rocks from asteroids – process them inside and produce just about any product: washing machines or teacups or automobiles or starships. Once such a machine exists it could gather sunlight and materials that it's sitting on, and produce on call whatever product anybody wants to name, as long as somebody knows how to make it and those instructions can be given to the machine. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discussion==
A mature Santa Claus machine requires significant advances in technology to be possible, including the ability to take any collection of matter and reconfigure it into any other type of matter.

Scientifically, it requires two parts: a disassembler and an assembler.

One form of disassembler would consist of an ionizing chamber, which heats the input matter to 43,000&amp;nbsp;°F (24,000&amp;nbsp;°C).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Once all the molecular bonds are broken and the electrons ripped off, each atomic nucleus would be moved through a magnetic field, where its path would curve in proportion to its charge/mass ratio, as per [[mass spectrometry]]. The separated ions would be captured by a linear array of cold traps to provide reservoirs of each element.

The assembler would use these reservoirs as input to some kind of [[3D printing|additive layer manufacturing]] device (also known as 3D printers and rapid prototype machines).  Many of these printers are commercially available today—though currently few can print with more than one highly prepared material (much less an alphabet consisting of all the raw elements).

An autonomous Santa Claus machine would presumably require a high level of [[artificial intelligence]], though for small projects, autonomous behavior is probably not necessary.  However, the "matter compiler" (that figures out which atom goes where) must be programmed appropriately—not a trivial task. A gigantic project such as a [[Dyson sphere]] would undoubtedly require not only autonomy, but also self-replication.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} These capabilities would enable a single Santa Claus machine, given sufficient matter and energy, to construct a project of any size.

Many theorists{{Who|date=August 2012}} have seen the obvious nightmare scenarios that accompany such a device, including machines running out of control and destroying an entire planet, or a [[clanking replicator]] disaster, ''à la'' the brooms in ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''. At the other extreme, others{{Who|date=August 2012}} suppose the resultant [[post scarcity]] [[economy]] could lead to a near-[[utopia]]—''[[Star Trek]]'' being the most culturally prominent example of this possibility.

The human society seen as a whole can be thought of as a limited Santa Claus machine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28211">'''Self-concealment''' ('''SC''') is a psychological construct defined as "a predisposition to actively conceal from others personal information that one perceives as distressing or negative".&lt;ref name = Larson&gt;Larson and Chastain (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Self-concealment can be understood as an instance of boundary regulation in the maintenance of privacy. Self-concealed personal information has three characteristics: it is a subset of private information, can be consciously accessed, and is actively concealed from others. The concealed personal information (thoughts, feelings, actions, or events) is highly intimate and negative in valence (p.&amp;nbsp;440). Self-concealment has been shown to be both conceptually and empirically distinct from self-disclosure.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Uysal&gt;Uysal, Lin, and Knee (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

Secrets and secret keeping have been a longstanding interest of psychologists and psychotherapists.&lt;ref name = Larson2&gt;Larson (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidney Jourard|Jourard's]]&lt;ref name=Jourard1&gt;Jourard (1971a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jourard2&gt;Jourard (1971b).&lt;/ref&gt; work on self-disclosure and Pennebaker's research on the health benefits of disclosing traumatic events and secrets set the stage for the conceptualization and measurement of self-concealment. Jourard's research pointed to the conclusion that stress and illness result not only from low self-disclosure, but more so from the intentional avoidance of being known by another person. In a later line of research, [[James Pennebaker|Pennebaker]]&lt;ref name=Pennebaker1&gt;Pennebaker and Chew (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennebaker2&gt;Pennebaker, Zech and Rime (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues examined the confiding-illness relation or the inhibition-disease link and found that not expressing thoughts and feelings about traumatic events is associated with long-term health effects. Pennebaker attributed the unwillingness to disclose distressing personal information to either circumstances or individual differences. The self-concealment construct, and the scale for its measurement, the Self-Concealment Scale, were introduced to permit assessment and conceptualization of individual differences on this personality dimension.

== Self-Concealment Scale ==

The 10-item Self-Concealment Scale (SCS)&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt; measures the degree to which a person tends to conceal personal information perceived as negative or distressing. The SCS has proven to have excellent [[psychometric]] properties (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) and unidimensionality.&lt;ref name=Larson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cramer1&gt;Cramer and Barry (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Representative items include: "I have an important secret that I haven't shared with anyone", "There are lots of things about me that I keep to myself", "Some of my secrets have really tormented me", "When something bad happens to me, I tend to keep it to myself", and "My secrets are too embarrassing to share with others".

== Relevant psychological research ==

The initial study of self-concealment&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt; by Larson and Chastain found that self-concealment uniquely and significantly contributed to the prediction of anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms even after controlling for trauma incidence, trauma distress, trauma disclosure, social support and social network strength, and self-disclosure. Subsequent research has examined the effects of self-concealment on subjective well-being and coping, finding that high self-concealment is associated with psychological distress and self-reported physical symptoms,&lt;ref name=Cepida-Benito1&gt;Cepeda-Benito and Short (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; anxiety and depression&lt;ref name=Kahn1&gt;Kahn &amp; Hessling (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly &amp; Achter, 1995"&gt;Kelly &amp; Achter (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; anxiety, depression, shyness, and negative self-esteem,&lt;ref name=Ichiyama1&gt;Ichiyama et al. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; loneliness,&lt;ref name=CramerLake&gt;Cramer &amp; Lake (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; rumination,&lt;ref name=KingEmmonsWoodley&gt;King, Emmons, &amp; Woodley (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; anxiety,&lt;ref name=PennebakerColderSharp&gt;Pennebaker, Colder, &amp; Sharp (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; trait social anxiety,&lt;ref name=EndlerFlettMacrodimitrisCoraceKocovski&gt;Endler, Flett, Macrodimitris, Corace, &amp; Kocovski (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; social anxiety,&lt;ref name=PotoczniakAldeaDeBlaere&gt;Potoczniak, Aldea, &amp; DeBlaere (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; depression, and self-silencing,&lt;ref name=CramerGallantLanglois&gt;Cramer, Gallant, &amp; Langlois (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; ambivalence over emotional expressiveness,&lt;ref name=BarrKahnSchneider&gt;Barr, Kahn, &amp; Schneider (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; maladaptive mood regulation,&lt;ref name=Wismeijer1&gt;Wismeijer, Van Assen, Sijtsma, &amp; Vingerhoets (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and acute and chronic pain.&lt;ref name=UysalLu&gt;Uysal &amp; Lu (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical models offered to explain the consistent finding of negative health effects for self-concealment include:

* An [[Social inhibition|inhibition]] model developed by Pennebaker,&lt;ref name=Pennebaker1985&gt;Pennebaker (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PennebakerBeall1986&gt;Pennebaker &amp; Beall (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; which would attribute these effects to the physiological work that is a consequence of the behavioral inhibition accompanying the self-concealment process.
* A preoccupation model based on the work of [[Daniel Wegner|Wegner]]&lt;ref name="Wegner, Lane, &amp; Dimitri 1994"&gt;Wegner, Lane, &amp; Dimitri (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wegner, Lane, &amp; Pennebaker, 1995"&gt;Wegner, Lane, &amp; Pennebaker (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; that sees the thought suppression associated with self-concealment as ironically leading to intrusive thoughts and even greater preoccupation with distressing personal information, which in turn leads to poor well-being.
* [[Self-perception theory]],&lt;ref name=Bem1967&gt;Bem (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; which argues that behavior influences attitudes—the self-concealing person observes his or her own concealing behavior and concludes that there must be a good reason for the behavior, leading to negative characterological self-attributions that fit with this conclusion (e.g. "I must be bad because I am concealing this aspect of myself").
* [[Self-determination theory]], which explains the negative health effects of self-concealment as the consequence of the frustration of the individual's basic needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence.&lt;ref name=Uysal/&gt;
Kelly offers a comprehensive review of several explanatory models and the evidence supporting each of them, concluding that a genetic component shared by high self-concealers might make them both more prone to self-conceal and more vulnerable to physical and psychological problems.&lt;ref name="Kelly2002, p217"&gt;Kelly (2002), p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research studies have focused on the relation of self-concealment to [[Attachment theory|attachment]] orientations,&lt;ref name="Lopez, 2001"&gt;Lopez (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez, Mitchell, &amp; Gormley, 2002"&gt;Lopez, Mitchell, &amp; Gormley (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yukawa, Tokuda, &amp; Sato, 2007"&gt;Yukawa, Tokuda, &amp; Sato (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; help seeking and attitudes toward counseling,&lt;ref name=Cepida-Benito1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly &amp; Achter, 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cramer1999&gt;Cramer (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fedde, 2010"&gt;Fedde (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hao &amp; Liang, 2007"&gt;Hao &amp; Liang (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimura &amp; Mizuno, 2004"&gt;Kimura &amp; Mizuno (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leech, 2007"&gt;Leech (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masuda, Anderson, Twohig, 2009"&gt;Masuda, Anderson, Twohig, et al.

A recent review of 137 studies using the Self-Concealment Scale presented a working model for the antecedents of self-concealment and the mechanisms of action for its health effects. The authors conceptualize self-concealment as a "complex trait-like motivational construct where high levels of SC motivation energize a range of goal-directed behaviors (e.g., keeping secrets, behavioral avoidance, lying) and dysfunctional strategies for the regulation of emotions (e.g., expressive suppression) which serve to conceal negative or distressing personal information."&lt;ref name="Larson, Chastain, Hoyt, &amp; Ayzenberg, 2015, 708"&gt;Larson, Chastain, Hoyt, &amp; Ayzenberg (2015), p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are seen as then affecting health through direct and indirect pathways, and as being "energized by a conflict between urges to conceal, and reveal—a dual-motive conflict which eventually leads to adverse physiological effects and a breakdown of self-regulatory resources".&lt;ref name="Larson, Chastain, Hoyt, &amp; Ayzenberg, 2015, 709"&gt;Larson, Chastain, Hoyt, &amp; Ayzenberg (2015), p. 709.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minority Sexual Orientations and Paraphilias ==
Sexual minorities employ self concealment strategies to manage the risk of shame and [[Social stigma|stigma]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johsnon; Mithcell; Richeson; Shelton|first=|date=2010|title=Gender Moderates the Self Regulatory Consequences of Suppressing Emotional Reactions to Sexism|url=|journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations|volume=13|pages=215–226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] (LGB) people are stigmatized for the same-sex attraction inherent to their [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Coming out]] is a stigmatizing process for LGB populations because they have to manage risk of humiliation, rejection, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Tony|date=Spring 2010|title=Paradoxes of Sexuality, Gay Identity, and the Closet|url=|journal=Symbolic Interaction|volume=33|pages=234–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; For gay people, coming out and staying in the closet are contentious decisions that can have social consequences. If a person does not disclose that they are gay, they risk the censure of some political progressives, including some of those in their own community, for being cowardly, politically irresponsible, or 'self-hating' if their identity is discovered at a later time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Arab and Middle Eastern people have been documented employing the following identity negotiation strategies:

* Humorous Accounting: A stigmatized minority will employ humor as a way to establish common ground. 
* Educational Accounting: A stigmatized minority will make an effort to educate the person questioning their stigmatized identity. This method is a common method used by Muslim women who wear hijabs in the study. 
* Defiant Accounting: A stigmatized minority will challenge the person questioning their identity by confronting the right to interrogate a stigmatized identity. 
* Cowering: A stigmatized minority will meet the demands of the person questioning their stigmatized identity due to real, or perceived fears of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marvasti|first=Amir|date=Fall 2005|title=Being Middle Eastern American: Identity Negotiation in the Context of the War on Terror|url=|journal=Symbolic Interaction|volume=28|pages=525–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-concealment strategies can also present in those with sexual [[paraphilias]]. Research in the experiences of [[Furry fandom|furries]], a stigmatized group, found that they are more likely to self disclose if there are little difference in power between the furry and the individual with whom they are disclosing their identity to.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plante et al.|first=|date=|title=Interaction of Socio-structural Characteristics Predicts Identity Concealment and Self-Esteem in Stigmatized Minority Group|url=|journal=Current Psychology|volume=33|pages=3–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">The right to a '''speedy trial''' is a [[human right]] under which it is asserted that a government prosecutor may not delay the trial of a criminal suspect arbitrarily and indefinitely. Otherwise, the power to impose such delays would effectively allow prosecutors to send anyone to jail for an arbitrary length of time without trial.

Although it is important for the protection of speedy trial rights that there be a court in which a defendant may complain about the unreasonable delay of the trial, it is also important that nations implement structures that avoid the delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Equa durata del processo: il risarcimento non risolve il problema |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89306900}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of speedy trial rights==
In jurisdictions with strong [[rule of law]], the requirement of a "speedy trial" forces prosecutors to diligently build cases within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the complexity and heinousness of the crimes of which suspects are accused. The right is based on the notion that long-term incarceration should normally be restricted to situations in which a judge or jury have determined a suspect has committed a crime.

The right to a speedy trial is codified in fundamental legal documents in several jurisdictions, and may be further defined by statutory law.

===Canada===
Speedy trial rights are recognized within [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

===Europe===

Within Europe, speedy trial rights are recognized by [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].

In English law, this right was developed by the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166 (a judge would be summoned if one was not immediately available) and [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 ("To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shestokas|first1=David J.|title=Sixth Amendment’s Speedy Trial Right: Ancient, Worthy and Elusive|url=http://www.shestokas.com/constitution-educational-series/sixth-amendments-speedy-trial-right-ancient-worthy-and-elusive/|website=David Shestokas|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states, "All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]], or administrative bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Philippines, Article III|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Philippines_(1987)#Article_III:_Bill_of_Rights|website=Wikisource|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, basic speedy trial rights are protected by the [[Speedy Trial Clause]] of the United States Constitution. States may also offer additional speedy trial protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are Speedy Trial Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-speedy-trial-rights|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1776, a "speedy trial" provision was explicitly included in the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] by [[George Mason]], its principal author.

The consequences of a speedy trial violation may require that the case be dismissed, although depending upon the circumstances it may be possible for the state to again initiate a criminal charge against a defendant despite a speedy trial violation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8880">'''Syneisaktism''' is the practice of "spiritual marriage", which is where a man and a woman who have both taken [[vows of chastity]] live together in a chaste and non-legalized partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Patricia Cox, ed. Women in Early Christianity : Translations from Greek Texts. Washington, DC, USA: Catholic University of America Press, 2012. Pg. 117. ProQuest ebrary.&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, the woman would move into the house of the man, and they would live as brother and sister, both committed to the continuation of their vows of chastity. The women who entered into a spiritual marriage were known as ''subintroductae'' ("those brought in covertly"), ''agapetae'' ("beloved ones"), and ''syneisaktoi'' ("those brought into the house together").&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; This practice emerged around the 2nd century CE, and survived into the Middle Ages, despite being condemned by numerous church leaders, writers, and councils.

==Emergence==
The practice of asceticism grew in the early years of [[Christianity]] due to the teachings of both [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Jesus Christ]], who suggested that a celibate life was the best way to prepare for life in the Kingdom of God.&lt;ref&gt;Castelli, Elizabeth. "Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity." Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 2, no. 1 (Spring, 1986): 65. Accessed March 6, 2015. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25002030.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have also emerged as an alternative to [[martyrdom]], so that the faithful could reach the Kingdom of Heaven and receive their rewards in the afterlife without giving their lives. It became more and more popular as Christianity became accepted and legalized in the [[Roman Empire]] and martyrdoms became less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Castelli. "Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity." 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginity became a favoured alternative to earthly marriage, promoted by writers such as [[Eusebius of Emesa]] and [[Jerome]], all of whom saw marriage as promoting evil, quarrels, and the road to sin and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Castelli. "Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity." 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginity emerged as a popular practice for women around the 2nd century CE, although it became more fully developed during the next couple of centuries, and it became "constructed as a form of liberation not only from the strictures of marriage and childbearing, but also from physical passion and materiality",&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 78&lt;/ref&gt; which were considered sinful and dangerous to the soul.

One issue that many ascetic virgins, especially women, came across was how they were to live once they denounced marriage and earthly pleasures. Some independently wealthy women were able to seclude themselves on their estates, others were supported by family, but many had no means with which to support themselves. Monasteries for women were a later development; in the 2nd century CE there would have been very few in existence. Thus, spiritual marriage may have emerged as a solution to this problem. An ascetic woman would have gone to live with an ascetic man in his house, living as brother and sister in a sort of unofficial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual marriages would have also offered a rare opportunity for a man and a woman to engage in an emotionally and spiritually intimate friendship, something that was next to unheard of in the ancient world, in which it was believed that men and women could never be friends, as friendship implied parity, and the sexes were not considered equal.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elizabeth A. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae"" Church History 46, no. 2 (1977): 183. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3165004.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, spiritual marriages would have been a desirable option for both ascetic men and women.

==Condemnation==
Despite the appeal of spiritual marriages, subintroductae and the practice itself were continuously condemned by various councils, writers, and theologians. John 20:17 was one New Testament verse that was used as evidence that spiritual marriage was not endorsed by Christ, as Jesus pushes away [[Mary Magdelene]] with the command "touch me not".&lt;ref&gt;Clark. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae""172.&lt;/ref&gt; Various other authorities and texts were used, with writers building upon earlier arguments in response to the flourishing practice.

===Councils===
The earliest council to condemn the virgines subintroductae and the practice of spiritual marriage was the [[Council of Antioch (268)]], and this stance was reiterated at the [[Synod of Elvira]] in 300 (Canon 27: "a bishop or any other clergy may have living with him only a sister or a virgin daughter dedicated to God; by no means shall he keep any woman unrelated to him".&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, Karl Joseph von, Joseph Hergenröther, Alois Knöpfler, and Henri Leclercq. 1907. Histoire des conciles d'après les documents originaux. 236. Paris: Letouzey et Ané. http://www.llmcdigital.org/default.aspx?redir=87181.&lt;/ref&gt;), at Ancyra in 317, and at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nicaea denounces spiritual marriage in its third canon, which forbids any clergy member from living with a woman unless she is a relative.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgens, W.A. "First Council of Nicaea." In The Faith of the Early Fathers: Pre-Nicene and Nicene Eras, 283. Liturgical Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decrees against spiritual marriage and the subintroductae continued to be issued by various authorities all over Europe until the Middle Ages &lt;ref&gt;Clark. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae"". 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writers===
Church writers and theologians also spoke out against the practice of spiritual marriage, more often than not condemning it. Those who wrote about this subject include [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[Jerome]], [[Eusebius of Emesa]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and [[John Chrysostom]], among others.

===Athanasius of Alexandria===
[[Athanasius of Alexandria]] was a fourth century writer who wrote two letters on the subject of virginity. The second letter is addressed to a group of virgins newly returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He gives advice on how to continue their ascetic lives properly, including a section on spiritual marriage. Here, he condemns the practice of spiritual marriage and of the subintroductae, suggesting that it is a betrayal of the Bridegroom Christ to whom all virgins devote their life to when they take their vows of chastity. He mentions those virgins who "dare[d] even to live and mix with men, not considering such a great danger or how easy it is to fall in this life" &lt;ref&gt;Miller, Patricia Cox. "Athanasius of Alexandria: Second Letter to Virgins (selections)." In Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts, 118-123. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to call on women to abandon their practice of spiritual marriage, "lest you break your covenant with the heavenly bridegroom".&lt;ref&gt;"Athanasius of Alexandria: Second Letter to Virgins (selections)." in Women in Early Christianity. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Chrysostom===
John Chrysostom, another fourth-century writer, wrote two treatises on the subject of spiritual marriage, both condemning the practice. He suggests that living together chastely will only intensify lust for one another, as it is never satisfied by sexual intercourse ("sexual desire...serves to still passion and often leads the man to satiation... But with a virgin, nothing of this sort happens...the men who live with them are stirred by a double desire"&lt;ref&gt;"John Chrysostom: Instruction and Refutation Against Those Men Living With Virgins." Translated by Patricia Cox Miller. Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts, 124-125. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;), and that it was not spiritual love but lust that drew these couples together; &lt;ref&gt;"John Chrysostom: Instruction and Refutation Against Those Men Living With Virgins" Women in Early Christianity. 129&lt;/ref&gt; like Athanasius, he sees spiritual marriage as a betrayal of Christ the Bridegroom as well.&lt;ref&gt;"John Chrysostom: On the Necessity of Guarding Virginity." Translated by Patricia Cox Miller. Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts,149. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His protests also show the prevailing views of men and women that existed during this time, as his writing suggests that spiritual marriage goes against traditional views of men and women occupying separate spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Clark. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae""183.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''terrorist training camp''' is a facility established to train individuals in the ways of [[terrorism]], often without the consent of the trainees.{{fact|date=July 2018}} By teaching them the methods and tactics of [[terrorism]], those conducting such facilities aim to create an "army" of individuals who will do their bidding. They are often located in, but not confined to, regions where it is intended that acts of terrorism will be carried out, or in traditional areas of extremism, such as [[Pakistan]], [[Afghan training camp|Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="AFGHANISTAN"&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200207/12/eng20020712_99617.shtml 4000 Britons trained at terror camps in Afghanistan]: Paper The People's Daily, July 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4841170.stm Is Somalia next for 'war on terror'?] BBC News. 7 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wide-open spaces such as parks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1768396,001302420000.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195944/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1768396,001302420000.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; and wilderness areas&lt;ref&gt;CBS News May 26, 2004: [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/27/terror/main620045.shtml U.S.: Cleric Eyed Ore. Terror Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; are common sites for these camps.

== Locations ==
Most camps are located in the Middle East, with the most infamous in [[Syria]] and the Arabian peninsula.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Many camps are located in regions of conflict. The call to [[jihad]] has seen many Muslims enter such camps, followed by US drone strikes.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Purpose==
These encampments provide recruits with weapons training, protocol training, interaction with skilled veterans, and a secure geographic location for operations. Recruits are regularly indoctrinated in the goals and beliefs of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/terrorist-indoctrination-turning-people-killers-norman |author1=Lihou Dr. Norman T. Lihou |date=25 January 2015 |title=Terrorist Indoctrination Turning People into Killers |website=LinkedIn|accessdate=20 June 2017}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational leaders attempt to isolate recruits from their outside social connections and force them to establish a new identity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This allows the organization to become the “family” of the recruit and generate loyalty to the organization’s goals.

== Psychological traits ==
Depending on the type of organization, the religion and “strength of faith” of the recruit is often an indicator of their status within the organization. Those who are not willing to comply, even after completion of training, are often punished and undergo training to strengthen their observance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Terrorist recruits are tested on knowledge of their religion and of rival groups. Recruiters do this to verify that each recruit has the necessary beliefs, which ensures organizational unification. Religious verification ensures that each member is working towards mutual goals.&lt;ref name="Understanding terrorism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/terrorism.aspx |title=Understanding Terrorism |last=DeAngelis |first=Tori |date=November 2009|website=American Psychological Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109122812/http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/terrorism.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-09|deadurl=yes |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruiters use techniques that exploit or create mental trauma in order to produce a dissociated mindset in recruits — a condition in which the identity and awareness of the recruit is reset.&lt;ref name="Understanding terrorism"/&gt; Typical recruits look to join terrorist organizations because they are angry, alienated and/or disenfranchised.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Common thought processes include: believing that their current political involvement does not give them the power to effect change; identifying with perceived victims of the perceived social injustice they are fighting; feeling the need to take action; believing that violence is not immoral; having friends or family sympathetic to the cause; and craving social and psychological rewards such as adventure, camaraderie, and a heightened sense of identity.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Internet and cyber-skills are sought after as technically knowledgeable recruits can help the organization.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

== Examples of physical demands ==
Many terrorist organizations train recruits in [[guerrilla warfare]]. Recruits must be in shape in order to learn these tactics. An [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] workout video shows that cardiovascular fitness is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://domesticity.gawker.com/a-fitness-critique-of-the-isis-terrorist-workout-video-1593208538|title=A Fitness Critique of the ISIS Terrorist Workout Video|last=Nolan|first=Hamilton|date=19 June 2014|website=Domesticity|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruits often train in full uniform, with weapons in hand. Recruits need to be able to survive in their environment with little nourishment. Recruits learn that if success is not attained, they will not be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terrorist Training Centers Around the World|last=Forest|first=James|publisher=Praeger Security International|year=2006|isbn=|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=296–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- NOTE: Please don't correct the spelling of "Wells" or "Welles" unless you are certain you are correcting the right one. H.G. Wells is the author of the original novel, and Orson Welles is the producer of the radio show. Thanks. --&gt;

G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898). It was performed and broadcast live as a Halloween episode at 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 30, 1938 over the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] radio network. The episode became famous for causing panic among its listening audience, but the scale of that panic is disputed, as the program had relatively few listeners.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pooley|first1=Jefferson|last2=Socolow|first2=Michael|title=The Myth of the ''War of the Worlds'' Panic|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/history/2013/10/orson_welles_war_of_the_worlds_panic_myth_the_infamous_radio_broadcast_did.single.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-hour program began with the theme music for the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' and an announcement that the evening's show was an adaption of ''The War of the Worlds''. This was followed by a prologue read by Orson Welles which was closely based on the opening of H.G. Wells' novel. The next half hour of the broadcast was presented as typical evening of radio programming which was interrupted by a series of news bulletins. The first few bulletins interrupt a program of dance music and describe a series of odd explosions observed on Mars. This is followed by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. Another brief musical interlude is interrupted by a live report from Grover's Mill, where police officials and a crowd of curious onlookers have surrounded the strange cylindrical object. The situation quickly escalates when Martians emerge from the cylinder and attack using a heat-ray, abruptly cutting off the panicked reporter at the scene. This is followed by a rapid series of increasingly alarming news updates detailing a devastating alien invasion taking place around the world. This portion of the show climaxes with another live report describing giant Martian war machines releasing clouds of poisonous smoke in New York City, after which the program took its first break. During the second half of the show, the program shifts to a more conventional radio drama format and follows a survivor dealing with the aftermath of the invasion and Martian occupation of Earth. As in the original novel, the story ends with the discovery that the Martians have been defeated by microbes rather than by humans.

The illusion of realism was furthered because the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes after the introduction. Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience may have been listening to [[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]] with [[Edgar Bergen]] and tuned in to "The War of the Worlds" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction that the show was a drama; however, contemporary research suggests that this happened only in rare instances.&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=A.

In the days after the adaptation, widespread outrage was expressed in the media.

==Production==
"The War of the Worlds" was the 17th episode of the CBS Radio series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]],'' which was broadcast at 8&amp;nbsp;pm ET on Sunday, October 30, 1938.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houseman |first=John |authorlink=John Houseman |title=Run-Through: A Memoir |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |date=1972 |isbn=0-671-21034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|390, 394}} [[The War of the Worlds|H. G. Wells' original novel]] tells the story of a Martian invasion of Earth. The novel was adapted for radio by [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]], who changed the primary setting from 19th-century England to the contemporary United States, with the landing point of the first Martian spacecraft changed to rural [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey|Grover's Mill]], an unincorporated village in [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]].

The program's format was a simulated live newscast of developing events.  The first two-thirds of the hour-long play is a contemporary retelling of events of the novel, presented as news bulletins interrupting programs of dance music. "I had conceived the idea of doing a radio broadcast in such a manner that a crisis would actually seem to be happening," Welles later said, "and would be broadcast in such a dramatized form as to appear to be a real event taking place at that time, rather than a mere radio play."&lt;ref name="Schwartz Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=A.

Tuesday night, 36 hours before rehearsals were to begin, Koch telephoned Houseman in what the producer characterized as "deep distress". Koch said he could not make ''The War of the Worlds'' interesting or credible as a radio play, a conviction echoed by his secretary [[Anne Froelick]], a typist and aspiring writer whom Houseman had hired to assist him. With only his own abandoned script for ''[[Lorna Doone]]'' to fall back on, Houseman told Koch to continue adapting the Wells fantasy. He joined Koch and Froelick and they worked on the script throughout the night. On Wednesday night, the first draft was finished on schedule.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT" /&gt;{{Rp|392–393}}

On Thursday, associate producer Paul Stewart held a cast reading of the script, with Koch and Houseman making necessary changes. That afternoon, Stewart made an acetate recording, with no music or sound effects. Welles, immersed in rehearsing the Mercury stage production of ''[[Danton's Death]]'' scheduled to open the following week, played the record at an editorial meeting that night in his suite at [[the St. Regis Hotel]]. After hearing "Air Raid" on the ''Columbia Workshop'' earlier that same evening, Welles viewed the script as dull. He stressed the importance of inserting news flashes and eyewitness accounts into the script to create a sense of urgency and excitement.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|166}}

Houseman, Koch, and Stewart reworked the script that night,&lt;ref name="Houseman RT" /&gt;{{Rp|393}} increasing the number of news bulletins and using the names of real places and people whenever possible. Friday afternoon, the script was sent to Davidson Taylor, executive producer for CBS, and the network legal department.

As using the names of actual institutions could be [[actionable]], CBS insisted upon some 28 changes in phrasing.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|167}}

===Plot summary===
"The War of the Worlds" begins with a paraphrase of [[s:The War of the Worlds/Book 1/Chapter 1|the beginning of the novel]], updated to contemporary times. The announcer introduces Orson Welles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the 39th year of the 20th century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October. Business was better. The [[timeline of events preceding World War II|war scare]] was over. More men were back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular evening, October 30th, the [[Crossley ratings|Crossley service]] estimated that 32 million people were listening in on radios…&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|394–395}}&lt;ref name=WellesNet/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The radio program begins as a simulation of a normal evening radio broadcast featuring a weather report and music by "Ramon Raquello and His Orchestra" live from a local hotel ballroom. After a few minutes, the music begins to be interrupted by several [[news flash]]es about strange gas explosions on [[Mars]]. An interview is arranged with reporter Carl Phillips and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-based Professor of [[Astronomy]] Richard Pierson, who dismisses speculation about life on Mars. The musical program returns temporarily but is interrupted again by news of a strange meteorite landing in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. Phillips and Pierson are dispatched to the site, where a large crowd has gathered. Philips describes the chaotic atmosphere around the strange cylindrical object, and Pierson admits that he does not know exactly what it is, but that it seems to be made of an extraterrestrial metal. The cylinder unscrews, and Phillips describes the tentacled, horrific "monster" that emerges from inside. Police officers approach the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] waving a [[flag of truce]], but the invaders respond by firing a [[Heat-Ray|heat ray]], which incinerates the delegation and ignites the nearby woods and cars as the crowd screams. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off mid-sentence, and after a moment of [[dead air]], an announcer explains that the remote broadcast was interrupted due to "some difficulty with our field transmission."

After a brief "piano interlude", regular programming breaks down as the studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates. A shaken Pierson speculates about Martian technology. The New Jersey [[National Guard of the United States|state militia]] declares [[martial law]] and attacks the cylinder; a captain from their field headquarters lectures about the overwhelming force of properly-equipped infantry and the helplessness of the Martians, until a [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]] rises from the pit. The tripod obliterates the militia, and the studio returns, now describing the Martians as an invading army. Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports as thousands of refugees clog the highways. Three Martian tripods from the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads, reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|Great Swamp]] near [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], as gas explosions continue. The [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] addresses the nation.

A live connection is established to a [[field artillery]] battery in the [[Watchung Mountains]]. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a release of poisonous [[black smoke]], before fading into the sound of coughing. The lead plane of a wing of bombers from [[Langley Field|Langham Field]] broadcasts its approach and remains on the air as their engines are burned by the heat ray and the plane dives on the invaders. Radio operators go active and fall silent. Although the bombers manage to destroy one machine, the remaining five are spreading black smoke across the [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Jersey Marshes]] into [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].

Eventually, a news reporter, broadcasting from atop the [[CBS Building|Broadcasting Building]], describes the Martian invasion of New York City – "five great machines" wading the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] "like [men] wading through a brook", black smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the [[East River]] "like rats", others in [[Times Square]] "falling like flies". He reads a final bulletin stating that Martian cylinders have fallen all over the country, then describes the smoke approaching down the street until he has a coughing fit and falls silent, leaving only the sounds of the city under attack in the background. Finally, a [[ham radio]] operator is heard calling, "2X2L calling CQ, New York. Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone?"

After a period of silence comes the voice of announcer Dan Seymour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are listening to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the ''Mercury Theatre of the Air'', in an original dramatization of ''The War of the Worlds'' by H. G. Wells. The performance will continue after a brief intermission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last third of the program is a monologue and dialogue. Professor Pierson, having survived the attack on Grover's Mill, attempts to make contact with other humans. In Newark, he encounters an opportunistic militiaman who holds fascist ideals in regards to man's relationship with the Martians, and intends to use Martian weaponry to take control of both species. Declaring that he wants no part of "his world", Pierson leaves the stranger with his delusions. His journey takes him to the ruins of New York, where he discovers that the Martians have died – as with the novel, they fell victim to earthly [[pathogenic]] [[Microorganism|germs]], to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Life eventually returns to normal, and Pierson finishes writing his recollections of the invasion and its aftermath.

After the conclusion of the play, Welles reassumed his role as host and told listeners that the broadcast was a Halloween concoction: the equivalent, he says, "of dressing up in a sheet, jumping out of a bush and saying, 'Boo!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Howard | year=1970 | title=The Panic Broadcast: Portrait of an Event| location= Boston | publisher=Little, Brown and Company | isbn=0-316-50060-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular mythology holds the disclaimer was hastily added to the broadcast at the insistence of CBS executives, as they became aware of panic inspired by the program. In fact, at the station break, network executive Davidson Taylor had attempted to prevent Welles, who had added the speech at the last minute, from reading it on air for fear of allowing the network to legal liability, but Welles delivered it anyway.&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH" /&gt;{{Rp|95–96}}

===Announcements===

Radio programming charts in Sunday newspapers listed the CBS drama, "The War of the Worlds". ''The New York Times'' for October 30, 1938, also included the show in its "Leading Events of the Week" ("Tonight – Play: H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'") and published a photograph of Welles with some of the Mercury players, captioned, "Tonight's show is H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'".&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|169}}

Announcements that "The War of the Worlds" is a dramatization of a work of fiction were made on the full CBS network at four points during the broadcast October 30, 1938: at the beginning, before the middle break, after the middle break, and at the end.&lt;ref name="Cantril"/&gt;{{Rp|43}} The middle break was delayed 10 minutes to accommodate the dramatic content.&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"/&gt;{{Rp|94}}

Another announcement was repeated on the full CBS network that same evening at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm, 11:30&amp;nbsp;pm, and midnight: "For those listeners who tuned in to Orson Welles's ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' broadcast from 8 to 9 pm Eastern Standard Time tonight and did not realize that the program was merely a modernized adaptation of H. G. Wells' famous novel ''War of the Worlds'', we are repeating the fact which was made clear four times on the program, that, while the names of some American cities were used, as in all novels and dramatizations, the entire story and all of its incidents were fictitious."&lt;ref name="Cantril"&gt;[[Hadley Cantril|Cantril, Hadley]], Hazel Gaudet, and [[Herta Herzog]], ''The Invasion from Mars: A Study in the Psychology of Panic: with the Complete Script of the Famous Orson Welles Broadcast''.

Producer John Houseman noticed that at about 8:32&amp;nbsp;pm. ET, CBS supervisor Davidson Taylor received a telephone call in the control room. Creasing his lips, Taylor left the studio and returned four minutes later, "pale as death", as he had been ordered to interrupt "The War of the Worlds" broadcast immediately with an announcement of the program's fictional content. However, by the time the order was given, the program was already less than a minute away from its first scheduled break, and the fictional news reporter played by actor [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] was choking on poison gas as the Martians overwhelmed New York.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|404}}

Actor [[Stefan Schnabel]] recalled sitting in the anteroom after finishing his on-air performance. "A few policemen trickled in, then a few more.

During the signoff theme, the phone began ringing. Houseman picked it up and the furious caller announced he was mayor of a Midwestern town, where mobs were in the streets. Houseman hung up quickly: "For we were off the air now and the studio door had burst open."&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|404}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The following hours were a nightmare. The building was suddenly full of people and dark-blue uniforms. Hustled out of the studio, we were locked into a small back office on another floor.

Because of the crowd of newspaper reporters, photographers, and police, the cast left the CBS building by the rear entrance. Aware of the sensation the broadcast had made, but not its extent, Welles went to the Mercury Theatre where an all-night rehearsal of ''Danton's Death'' was in progress. Shortly after midnight, one of the cast, a late arrival, told Welles that news about "The War of the Worlds" was being flashed in [[Times Square]].

Welles continued with the rehearsal of ''Danton's Death'' (scheduled to open November 2), leaving shortly after dawn October 31. He was operating on three hours of sleep when CBS called him to a press conference. He read a statement that was later printed in newspapers nationwide and took questions from reporters:&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|173, 176}}

:Question: Were you aware of the terror such a broadcast would stir up?&lt;br&gt;Welles: Definitely not. The technique I used was not original with me. It was not even new. I anticipated nothing unusual.

:Question: Why was the story changed to put in names of American cities and government officers?&lt;br&gt;Welles: H. G. Wells used real cities in Europe, and to make the play more acceptable to American listeners we used real cities in America.

In its editions of October 31, 1938, the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'' reported that three Arizona affiliates of CBS ([[KFYI|KOY]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[KTUC]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and KSUN in [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]]) had originally scheduled a delayed broadcast of "The War of the Worlds" that night; CBS had shifted ''The Mercury Theater on the Air'' from Monday nights to Sunday nights on September 11, but the three affiliates preferred to keep the series in its original Monday slot so that it would not compete with NBC's top-rated ''[[Chase and Sanborn Hour]]''. However, late on that Sunday night, CBS contacted KOY and KTUC owner Burridge Butler and instructed him not to air the program the following night.&lt;ref&gt;''Tucson Citizen'', edition of October 31, 1938, accessed on microfilm at the Tucson Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
[[File:WOTW-Cartoon-Callan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Radio Digest'' reprinted the script of "The War of the Worlds" "as a commentary on the nervous state of our nation after the [[Munich Agreement|Pact of Munich]]" – prefaced by an editorial cartoon by Les Callan of ''The Toronto Star'' (February 1939)]]

Later studies indicate that many missed the repeated notices about the broadcast being fictional, partly because ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', an unsponsored CBS cultural program with a relatively small audience, ran at the same time as the NBC [[Red Network]]'s popular ''[[Chase and Sanborn Hour]]'' featuring ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]]. At the time, many Americans assumed that a significant number of ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners changed stations when the first comic sketch ended and a musical number by [[Nelson Eddy]] began and then tuned in "The War of the Worlds" after the opening announcements, but historian A. Brad Schwartz, after studying hundreds of letters from people who heard "The War of the Worlds", as well as contemporary audience surveys, concluded that very few people frightened by Welles's broadcast had tuned out Bergen's program. "All the hard evidence suggests that ''The Chase &amp; Sanborn Hour'' was only a minor contributing factor to the Martian hysteria," he wrote. "...in truth, there was no mass exodus from [[Charlie McCarthy]] to Orson Welles that night."&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH" /&gt;{{Rp|67–69}} Because the broadcast was unsponsored, Welles and company could schedule breaks at will, rather than arranging them around advertisements. As a result, the only notices that the broadcast was fictional came at the start of the broadcast and about 40 and 55 minutes into it.

A study by the [[Radio Project]] discovered that fewer than one third of frightened listeners understood the invaders to be aliens; most thought that they were listening to reports of a German invasion or of a natural catastrophe.&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH" /&gt;{{Rp|180, 191}}&lt;ref name="GIW"/&gt; "People were on edge", wrote Welles biographer [[Frank Brady (writer)|Frank Brady]]. "For the entire month prior to 'The War of the Worlds', radio had kept the American public alert to the ominous happenings throughout the world. The [[Munich Agreement|Munich crisis]] was at its height.... For the first time in history, the public could tune into their radios every night and hear, boot by boot, accusation by accusation, threat by threat, the rumblings that seemed inevitably leading to a world war."&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;[[Frank Brady (writer)|Brady, Frank]], ''Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1989  {{ISBN|0-385-26759-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|164–165}}

CBS News chief Paul White wrote that he was convinced that the panic induced by the broadcast was a result of the public suspense generated before the Munich Pact. "Radio listeners had had their emotions played upon for days.... Thus they believed the Welles production even though it was specifically stated that the whole thing was fiction".&lt;ref name="News on the Air"/&gt;{{Rp|47|date=May 2014}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast. ... Radio had siphoned off advertising revenue from print during the Depression, badly damaging the newspaper industry. So the papers seized the opportunity presented by Welles’ program to discredit radio as a source of news. The newspaper industry sensationalized the panic to prove to advertisers, and regulators, that radio management was irresponsible and not to be trusted."&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Extent===
Historical research suggests the panic was far less widespread than newspapers had indicated at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Conover]]'s [[Adam Ruins Everything]] episode [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6719452/?ref_=fn_ep_tt_1 Adam Ruins Halloween]&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he panic and mass hysteria so readily associated with 'The War of the Worlds' did not occur on anything approaching a nationwide dimension", [[American University]] media historian W. Joseph Campbell wrote in 2003. He quotes Robert E. Bartholomew, an authority on mass panic outbreaks, as having said that "there is a growing consensus among sociologists that the extent of the panic... was greatly exaggerated".&lt;ref name=GIW /&gt;

That position is supported by contemporary accounts. "In the first place, most people didn't hear [the show]," said [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], later president of CBS.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt; Of the nearly 2,000 letters mailed to Welles and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after "The War of the Worlds," currently held by the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], roughly 27% came from frightened listeners or people who witnessed any panic. After analyzing those letters, A. Brad Schwartz concluded that although the broadcast briefly misled a significant portion of its audience, very few of those listeners fled their homes or otherwise panicked. The total number of protest letters sent to Welles and the FCC is also low in comparison with other controversial radio broadcasts of the period, further suggesting the audience was small and the fright severely limited.&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH"/&gt;{{Rp|82–93}}&lt;ref name="Schwartz VF"/&gt;

Five thousand households were telephoned that night in a survey conducted by the [[C. E. Hooper]] company, the main radio ratings service at the time. Only 2% of the respondents said they were listening to the radio play, and no one stated they were listening to a news broadcast. About 98% of respondents said they were listening to other radio programming (''The Chase and Sanborn Hour'' was by far the most popular program in that timeslot) or not listening to the radio at all. Further shrinking the potential audience, some CBS network affiliates, including some in large markets such as [[Boston metropolitan area|Boston]]'s [[WEZE|WEEI]], had pre-empted ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', in favor of local commercial programming.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt;

Ben Gross, radio editor for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', wrote in his 1954 memoir that the streets were nearly deserted as he made his way to the studio for the end of the program.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt; Producer John Houseman reported that the Mercury Theatre staff was surprised when they were finally released from the CBS studios to find life going on as usual in the streets of New York.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|404}} The writer of a letter that ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published later likewise recalled no panicked mobs in the capital's downtown streets at the time. "The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast", media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow wrote in ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' on its 75th anniversary in 2013; "Almost nobody was fooled".&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt;

According to Campbell, the most common response said to indicate a panic was calling the local newspaper or police to confirm the story or seek additional information. That, he writes, is an indicator that people were ''not'' generally panicking or hysterical. "The call volume perhaps is best understood as an altogether ''rational'' response..."&lt;ref name=GIW /&gt; Some New Jersey media and law enforcement agencies received up to 40% more telephone calls than normal during the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartholomew|first=Robert E.|title=The Martian Panic Sixty Years Later: What Have We Learned?|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_martian_panic_sixty_years_later_what_have_we_learned/|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=Skeptical Inquirer|date=November–December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it was late on a Sunday night in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]], where the broadcast originated, few reporters and other staff were present in newsrooms. Most newspaper coverage thus took the form of [[Associated Press]] stories, which were largely anecdotal aggregates of reporting from its various bureaus, giving the impression that panic had indeed been widespread. Many newspapers led with the Associated Press's story the next day.&lt;ref name=GIW /&gt;

The ''[[Winston-Salem Journal|Twin City Sentinel]]'' of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] pointed out that the situation could have been even worse if most people had not been listening to Edgar Bergen's show: "Charlie McCarthy last night saved the United States from a sudden and panicky death by hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/relishnow/riverrun/winston-salem-citizens-among-those-fooled-by-radio-broadcast/article_e214b44a-f071-571e-ba7f-e5cf29e957ab.html|title=Winston-Salem citizens among those fooled by radio broadcast|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=April 5, 2017|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 1938, the Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterized the incident as "mass hysteria" and stated that "never in the history of the United States had such a wave of terror and panic swept the continent". Unnamed observers quoted by ''The Age'' commented that "the panic could have only happened in America."&lt;ref name="The Age2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bJ1VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JJcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2609%2C186374 |title=Mass Hysteria in U.S.A.

Editorialists chastised the radio industry for allowing that to happen. The response may have reflected newspaper publishers' fears that radio, to which they had lost some of the advertising revenue that was scarce enough during the [[Great Depression]], would render them obsolete. In "The War of the Worlds," they saw an opportunity to cast aspersions on the newer medium: "The nation as a whole continues to face the danger of incomplete, misunderstood news over a medium which has yet to prove that it is competent to perform the news job," wrote ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', the newspaper industry's trade journal.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment, and Future, by Stanley J. Baran, Dennis K. Davis&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Randolph Hearst]]'s papers called on broadcasters to police themselves, lest the government step in, as Iowa Senator [[Clyde L. Herring]] proposed a bill that would have required all programming to be reviewed by the FCC prior to broadcast (he never actually introduced it). Others blamed the radio audience for its credulity. Noting that any intelligent listener would have realized the broadcast was fictional, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' opined, "it would be more tactful to say that some members of the radio audience are a trifle retarded mentally, and that many a program is prepared for their consumption." Other newspapers took pains to note that anxious listeners had called ''their'' offices to learn whether Martians were really attacking.&lt;ref name=GIW /&gt;

Few contemporary accounts exist outside newspaper coverage of the mass panic and hysteria supposedly induced by the broadcast. Justin Levine, a producer at [[KFI]]-AM in Los Angeles, wrote in a 2000 history of the FCC's response to hoax broadcasts that "the anecdotal nature of such reporting makes it difficult to objectively assess the true extent and intensity of the panic.&lt;ref name="Justin Levine"&gt;Levine, Justin; [http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&amp;context=fclj&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DA%2BHistory%2Band%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2Bthe%2BFederal%2BCommunications%2BCommission%2527s%2BResponse%2Bto%2BRadio%2BBroadcast%2BHoaxes%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C33#search=%22History%20Analysis%20Federal%20Communications%20Commissions%20Response%20Radio%20Broadcast%20Hoaxes%22 "A History and Analysis of the Federal Communication Commission's Response to Radio Broadcast Hoaxes"]; 52 Fed Comm L J 2, 273–320, 278n28; March 1, 2000; retrieved November 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholomew sees this as yet more evidence that the panic was predominantly a creation of the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name="Little Green Men"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Martians Have Landed!: A History of Media-driven Panics and Hoaxes|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina|Jefferson, NC]]|isbn=9780786464982|pages=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyik93izNqEC&amp;pg=PA20|author=Bartholomew, Robert|author2=Radford, Benjamin |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
In a study published in book form as ''The Invasion from Mars'' (1940), Princeton professor [[Hadley Cantril]] calculated that some six million people heard "The War of the Worlds" broadcast.&lt;ref name="Cantril"/&gt;{{Rp|56}} He estimated that 1.7&amp;nbsp;million listeners believed the broadcast was an actual news bulletin and, of those, 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people were frightened or disturbed.&lt;ref name="Cantril"/&gt;{{Rp|58}} Media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow have since concluded, however, that Cantril's study has serious flaws. Its estimate of the program's audience is more than twice as high as any other at the time. Cantril himself conceded that but argued that unlike [[C. E. Hooper|Hooper]], his estimate had attempted to capture the significant portion of the audience that did not have home telephones at that time. Since those respondents were contacted only after the media frenzy, Cantril allowed that their recollections could have been influenced by what they read in the newspapers. Claims that ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners who missed the disclaimer at the beginning when they turned to CBS during a commercial break or musical performance on that show and thus mistook "The War of the Worlds" for a real broadcast inflated the show's audience and the ensuing alleged panic are impossible to substantiate.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

Apart from his admittedly-imperfect methods of estimating the audience and assessing the authenticity of their response, Pooley and Socolow found, Cantril made another error in typing audience reaction. Respondents had indicated a variety of reactions to the program, among them "excited", "disturbed", and "frightened". However, he included all of them with "panicked", failing to account for the possibility that despite their reaction, they were still aware the broadcast was staged. "[T]hose who did hear it, looked at it as a prank and accepted it that way," recalled researcher Frank Stanton.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

Bartholomew grants that hundreds of thousands were frightened, but calls evidence of people taking action based on their fear "scant" and "anecdotal".&lt;ref name=Barth&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Robert E. |title=Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion |year=2001 |publisher=Macfarland &amp; Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0997-5 |pages=217ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, contemporary news articles indicate that police were swamped with hundreds of calls in numerous locations, but stories of people doing anything more than calling authorities involved mostly only small groups. Such stories were often reported by people who were panicking themselves.&lt;ref name="GIW" /&gt;

Later investigations found much of the alleged panicked responses to have been exaggerated or mistaken. Cantril's researchers found that contrary to what had been claimed,  no admissions for shock were made at a Newark hospital during the broadcast; hospitals in New York City similarly reported no spike in admissions that night. A few suicide attempts seem to have been prevented when friends or family intervened, but no record of a successful one exists. A ''Washington Post'' claim that a man died of a heart attack brought on by listening to the program could not be verified.

===Meeting of Welles and Wells===

[[H. G. Wells]] and Orson Welles met for the first and only time in late October 1940, shortly before the second anniversary of the ''Mercury Theatre'' broadcast, when they both happened to be lecturing in [[San Antonio]], Texas. On October 28, 1940, the two men visited the studios of [[KTSA]] radio for an interview by Charles C. Shaw,&lt;ref name="TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|361}} who introduced them by characterizing the panic generated by "The War of the Worlds": "The country at large was frightened almost out of its wits".&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUdghSMTXsU |title=Orson Welles and H.G. Wells  |date=October 28, 1940 |publisher=YouTube  |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.G. Wells expressed good-natured skepticism about the actual extent of the panic caused by "this sensational Halloween spree," saying: "Are you sure there was such a panic in America or wasn't it your Halloween fun?"&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; Orson Welles appreciated the comment: "I think that's the nicest thing that a man from England could say about the men from Mars. Mr. Hitler made a good deal of sport of it, you know.... It's supposed to show the corrupt condition and decadent state of affairs in democracy, that 'The War of the Worlds' went over as well as it did. I think it's very nice of Mr. Wells to say that not only I didn't mean it, but the American people didn't mean it."&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

When Shaw interjected that there was "some excitement" that he did not wish to belittle, Welles asked him, "What ''kind'' of excitement? Mr. H. G. Wells wants to know if the excitement wasn't the same kind of excitement that we extract from a practical joke in which somebody puts a sheet over his head and says 'Boo!' I don't think anybody believes that that individual is a ghost, but we do scream and yell and rush down the hall. And that's just about what happened."&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

"That's a very excellent description," Shaw said.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

"You aren't quite serious in America, yet," said Wells. "You haven't got the war right under your chins. And the consequence is you can still play with ideas of terror and conflict.... It's a natural thing to do until you're right up against it."&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

"Until it ceases to be a game," Welles said, a phrase that Wells repeated.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wells Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosslawhead.com/blog/2012/09/when-orson-welles-met-h-g-wells/ |title=When Orson Welles Met H G Wells |publisher=Transcript.

==Authorship==

As the [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury]]'s second theatre season began in 1938, Orson Welles and John Houseman were unable to write the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' broadcasts on their own. They hired [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]], whose experience in having a play performed by the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in Chicago led him to leave his law practice and move to New York to become a writer. Koch was put to work at $50 a week, raised to $60 after he proved himself.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|390}} ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was a sustaining show, so in lieu of a more substantial salary, Houseman gave Koch the rights to any script he worked on.&lt;ref name="France Theatre of OW"&gt;[[Richard France (writer)|France, Richard]], ''The Theatre of Orson Welles''. Lewisburg, Pennsylvania: Bucknell University Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-8387-1972-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|175–176}}

A condensed version of the script for "The War of the Worlds" appeared in the debut issue of ''Radio Digest'' magazine (February 1939), in an article on the broadcast that credited "Orson Welles and his Mercury Theatre players".&lt;ref&gt;"Help—Men From Mars". ''Radio Digest''. February 1939, pp. 113–127.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete script appeared in ''The Invasion from Mars: A Study in the Psychology of Panic'' (1940), the book publication of a [[Princeton University]] study directed by psychologist [[Hadley Cantril]]. Welles strongly protested Koch being listed as sole author since many others contributed to the script, but by the time the book was published, he had decided to end the dispute.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|176–179}}

Welles did seek legal redress after the CBS TV series ''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'' presented its top-rated broadcast, "[[The Night America Trembled]]", on September 9, 1957. Hosted by [[Edward R. Murrow]], the live presentation of [[Nelson S. Bond]]'s documentary play recreated the 1938 performance of "The War of the Worlds" in the CBS studio, using the script as a framework for a series of factual narratives about a cross-section of radio listeners. No member of the ''Mercury Theatre'' is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/sentence-of-death-the-night-america-trembled/oclc/879500255 |title=Sentence of death, The night America trembled (DVD, 2002) |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jeW30vLwds |title=The Night America Trembled  |publisher=''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'', September 8, 1957, at YouTube |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts ruled against Welles, who was found to have abandoned any rights to the script after it was published in Cantril's book. Koch had granted CBS the right to use the script in its program.&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/ca9/briefs/govuscourtsca9briefs3264/gov.uscourts.ca9.017518.b.01.pdf |title=Orson Welles, Appellant, v.

"As it developed over the years, Koch took some cash and some credit," wrote biographer Frank Brady. "He wrote the story of how he created the adaptation, with a copy of his script being made into a paperback book enjoying large printings and an album of the broadcast selling over 500,000 copies, part of the income also going to him as copyright owner."&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|179}}

The book, ''The Panic Broadcast'', was first published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Howard, ''The Panic Broadcast: Portrait of an Event''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1970. The radio play ''Invasion from Mars'' was now copyrighted in Koch's name (''Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third Series; Books and Pamphlets, Title Index, January–June 1971'', page 1866). Hadley Cantril's ''The Invasion from Mars'', including the radio play (titled ''The Broadcast''), was copyrighted in 1940 by Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The best-selling album was a sound recording of the broadcast titled ''Orson Welles' War of the Worlds'', "released by arrangement with Manheim Fox Enterprises, Inc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/war-of-the-worlds/oclc/7046922?referer=di&amp;ht=edition  |title=War of the Worlds |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/master/view/213631  |title=Orson Welles – War of the Worlds|publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 28, 2014}} The jacket front of the 1968 [[Longines Symphonette]] Society LP reads, "The Actual Broadcast by The Mercury Theatre on the Air as heard over the Columbia Broadcasting System, Oct. 30, 1938.

Initially apologetic about the supposed panic his broadcast had caused (and privately fuming that newspaper reports of lawsuits were either greatly exaggerated or totally fabricated&lt;ref name="Justin Levine" /&gt;), Welles later embraced the story as part of his personal myth. "Houses were emptying, churches were filling up; from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to [[Minneapolis]] there was wailing in the streets and the rending of garments," he told [[Peter Bogdanovich]] years later.&lt;ref name="TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|18}}

CBS, too, found reports ultimately useful in promoting the strength of its influence. It presented a fictionalized account of the panic in "[[The Night America Trembled]]", a 1957 episode of the television series ''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'', and included it prominently in its 2003 celebrations of CBS's 75th anniversary as a television broadcaster. "The legend of the panic," according to Jefferson and Socolow, "grew exponentially over the following years ... [It] persists because it so perfectly captures our unease with the media's power over our lives."&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

In 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired the television movie ''[[The Night That Panicked America]]'', depicting the effect the radio drama had on the public using fictional, but typical American families of the time.
 
The New Jersey [[West Windsor Township|Township of West Windsor]], where [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey|Grover's Mill]] is located, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the broadcast in 1988 with four days of festivities including art and planetarium shows, a panel discussion, a parade, burial of a time capsule, a dinner dance, film festivals devoted to H. G. Wells and Orson Welles, and the dedication of a bronze monument to the fictional Martian landings. Howard Koch, an author of the original radio script, attended the 49th anniversary celebration as an honored guest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westwindsornj.org/war-of-worlds-news.html War of the Worlds – News Stories], Township of West Windsor, Mercer County, New Jersey; Delany, Don, [http://www.westwindsornj.org/GROVERS_MILL/ww-50th-anniversary.pdf "West Windsor Celebrates 'The War of the Worlds'"] (PDF), ''Mercer Business'', October 1988, pp. 14–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable examples include:

*A [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] version produced in February 1949 by Leonardo Paez and Eduardo Alcaraz for Radio Quito in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], reportedly set off panic in the city. Police and fire brigades rushed out of town to engage the supposed alien invasion force. After it was revealed that the broadcast was fiction, the panic transformed into a riot. Hundreds attacked Radio Quito and ''El Comercio'', a local newspaper that had participated in the hoax by publishing false reports of unidentified objects in the skies above Ecuador in the days preceding the broadcast. The riot resulted in at least seven deaths, including those of Paez's girlfriend and nephew.

==Career==
Carlson began his [[journalism]] career as a fact-checker for ''[[Policy Review]]'',&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; a national [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] journal then published by [[The Heritage Foundation]] and since acquired by the [[Hoover Institution]]. He later worked as a reporter at the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'' newspaper in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], before joining ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

As a magazine and newspaper journalist, Carlson has reported from around the world. He has been a columnist for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]''. He has also written for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

===CNN (2000–2005)===
In 2000, Carlson co-hosted the short-lived show ''The Spin Room''.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

In 2001, Carlson was appointed co-host of ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]].'' On the show, Carlson and [[Robert Novak]] represented the political [[right-wing politics|right]] (alternating on different nights), while [[James Carville]] and [[Paul Begala]], also alternating as hosts, represented the left.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; During the same period, he also hosted a weekly public affairs program on [[PBS]], ''Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered''.

One of Carlson's most memorable appearances on ''Crossfire'' was his heated October 2004 exchange with [[Jon Stewart]], host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watch Jon Stewart Call Tucker Carlson a "Dick" in Epic 2004 'Crossfire' Takedown |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jon-stewart-takes-down-tucker-carlson-crossfire-video-961127 |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Stewart argued that Carlson and the nature of his show were harmful to political discourse in the United States.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Carlson later recalled that Stewart had stayed at CNN for hours after the show to discuss the issues he had raised on the air. "It was heartfelt," Carlson said, "He [Stewart] needed to do this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cave |first=Damien |url=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/nytimes/2004-10-24_nytimes_damien_cave.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Week in Review: If You Interview Kissinger, Are You Still a Comedian? |work=The New York Times |date=October 24, 2004 |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |via=Msl1.mit.edu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405064722/http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/nytimes/2004-10-24_nytimes_damien_cave.pdf |archive-date=April 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Tucker (2005 TV program)}}

Carlson's early evening show, ''Tucker'' (originally titled ''The Situation With Tucker Carlson'') premiered on June 13, 2005, on [[MSNBC]].

Carlson also hosted a late afternoon weekday wrap-up for MSNBC during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], during which he attempted to learn how to play various Olympic sports. In July 2006, he reported live for ''Tucker'' from [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], during the [[2006 Lebanon War]] between Israel and [[Hezbollah]] in southern Lebanon. While in the [[Middle East]], he also hosted ''MSNBC Special Report: Mideast Crisis''.  He appeared regularly on ''[[Verdict with Dan Abrams]]'' as a panelist in political discussions.

''Tucker'' lasted fewer than three full seasons. The network announced its cancellation due to low ratings on March 10, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Gregory Replaces Tucker Carlson on MSNBC Evening Shift |date=March 10, 2008 |agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,336470,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final episode aired on March 14, 2008. Brian Stelter of ''The New York Times'' wrote that "during Mr. Carlson's tenure, MSNBC's evening programming moved gradually to the left. His former time slots, 6 and 9 p.m., were then occupied by two liberals, [[Ed Schultz]] and [[Rachel Maddow]]." Carlson stated that the network had changed a lot and "they didn't have a role for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=Tucker Carlson turns 40, moves to Fox News|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/tucker-carlson-turns-40-moves-to-fox-news/|accessdate=March 4, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fox News Channel (2009–present)===
In May 2009, Fox News announced that Carlson was being hired as a Fox News contributor. He was a frequent guest panelist on Fox's late-night satire show ''[[Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld]],'' made frequent appearances on the All-Star Panel segment of ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', was a substitute host of ''[[Hannity]]'' in Sean Hannity's absence, and produced a Fox News special entitled ''Fighting for Our Children's Minds''.

In March 2013, it was announced that Carlson would co-host the weekend editions of ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]];'' he had been a contributor and frequent guest host on the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byers|first=Dylan|title=Tucker Carlson to Fox &amp; Friends Weekends|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/03/tucker-carlson-to-cohost-fox-friends-weekends-160334.html|publisher=Politico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced [[Dave Briggs (journalist)|Dave Briggs]], who left the news channel to join the [[NBC Sports Network]] in January 2013. Beginning in April, Carlson officially joined co-hosts Alisyn Camerota and Clayton Morris on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

==== ''Tucker Carlson Tonight'' (2016–present) ====
{{main|Tucker Carlson Tonight}}
On November 14, 2016, Carlson started hosting ''Tucker Carlson Tonight'' on Fox News. ''Tucker Carlson Tonight'' was created to replace the show ''[[On the Record (Fox News TV series)|On the Record]]''.&lt;ref name="NewsHoundEllen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crooksandliars.com/2016/09/greta-van-susteren-abruptly-leaves-fox|title=Greta Van Susteren Abruptly Leaves Fox News|author=News Hound Ellen|date=September 7, 2016|work=[[Crooks and Liars]]|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted as "the network's most watched telecast of the year in the time slot".&lt;ref name="DarcyBusinessInsider"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Oliver Darcy|title=Tucker Carlson's Fox News show debuts to phenomenal ratings, beats both CNN and MSNBC combined|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tucker-carlson-fox-news-show-ratings-2016-11|website=Business Insider|accessdate=December 22, 2016|date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's premiere episode, viewed by 3.7 million,&lt;ref name="DarcyBusinessInsider" /&gt;  was rated higher than previous editions of ''On the Record''.

''Tucker Carlson Tonight'' aired at 7 p.m. ET each weeknight until January 9, 2017, when Carlson's show replaced [[Megyn Kelly]] at the 9 p.m. ET time slot after she left Fox News. In January 2017, ''Forbes'' reported that the show had "scored consistently high ratings, averaging 2.8 million viewers per night and ranking as the number two cable news program behind The O'Reilly Factor in December [2016].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2017/01/05/tucker-carlson-to-replace-megyn-kelly-at-fox-news-keeping-the-network-conservative/#7c745789672e|title='Right' Move For Fox News As Tucker Carlson To Replace Megyn Kelly In Prime Time|last=Berg|first=Madeline|date=January 5, 2017|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, ''Tucker Carlson Tonight'' was the most watched cable program in the 9 p.m. time slot.

According to [[CNN]], [[Business Insider]], [[Vox (website)|Vox]] and [[GQ]], Carlson's show has promoted and echoed white supremacist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/09/media/fox-news-laura-ingraham-tucker-carlson-white-nationalism/index.html|title=White anxiety finds a home at Fox News|last=Stelter|first=Tom Kludt and Brian|work=CNNMoney|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-promotes-white-supremacist-narrative-about-south-africa-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=White supremacists celebrate Trump's promotion of false narrative of white persecution in South Africa|work=Business Insider|access-date=September 29, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/tucker-carlson-white-nationalist-diversity-terrible|title=Tucker Carlson Proves He's Not a White Nationalist by Doubling Down on How Terrible Diversity Is|last=Darby|first=Luke|date=September 10, 2018|work=GQ|access-date=September 29, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/3/21/17146866/tucker-carlson-demographics-immigration-fox-news|title=Watch: Tucker Carlson rails against America's demographic changes|work=Vox|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neoconservative]] pundit [[Bill Kristol]] described the views Carlson expressed on his show as "ethno-nationalism of some kind";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/bill-kristol-takes-on-fox-news-tucker-carlson.html|title=Bill Kristol hits Fox News, Tucker Carlson for 'dumbing down' coverage, pushing 'ethno-nationalism'|last=Harwood|first=John|date=January 25, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson responded that Kristol had "discredited himself years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/tucker-fires-back-at-bill-kristol-former-intellectual-who-now-exists-primarily-on-twitter/|title=Tucker Fires Back at Bill Kristol: 'Former Intellectual Who Now Exists Primarily on Twitter'|website=www.mediaite.com|language=en|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson has denied being a racist and has said that he hates racism.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

=== ''The Daily Caller'' (2010–present) ===
{{Main|The Daily Caller}}
On January 11, 2010, Carlson and former vice president [[Dick Cheney]] aide [[Neil Patel (political advisor)|Neil Patel]] launched a political news website titled ''[[The Daily Caller]]''. Carlson served as editor-in-chief, and occasionally wrote opinion pieces with Patel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/author/carlsonandpatel/|title=Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel Author Page|work=The Daily Caller|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was funded by the conservative activist [[Foster Friess|Foster Freiss]].&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; By February ''The Daily Caller'' was part of the White House rotating press pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0210/Daily_Caller_joins_WH_pool.html|title=Daily Caller joins W.H. pool|last=Calderone|first=Michael|date=February 1, 2010|work=Politico|accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Politico]]'', Carlson said that ''The Daily Caller'' would not be tied to ideology but rather will be "breaking stories of importance". In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, Carlson added, "We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone." Columnist [[Mickey Kaus]] quit after Carlson refused to run a column critical of [[Fox News]]'s coverage of the immigration policy debate due to his contractual obligations to Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/mickey-kaus-quits-daily-caller-after-tucker-carlson-204135.html|title=Mickey Kaus quits Daily Caller after Tucker Carlson pulls critical Fox News column|last1=Byers|first1=Dylan|date=March 17, 2015|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/03/18/daily-callers-tucker-carlson-takes-a-stand-for-censorship/|title=Daily Caller's Tucker Carlson takes a stand for censorship|last1=Wemple|first1=Erik|date=March 18, 2015|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

=== ''Dancing with the Stars'' ===
Carlson was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 3)|season 3]] of the [[reality show]] ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', which aired in 2006; he was paired with professional dancer [[Elena Grinenko]]. Carlson took four-hour-a-day [[ballroom dance]] classes in preparation for the competition. In an interview a month before the show began, he lamented that he would miss classes during a two-week-long MSNBC assignment in Lebanon, noting that "It's hard for me to remember the moves."&lt;ref name="AR2006081401091.html"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081401091.html|title=Names &amp; Faces|date=August 15, 2006|accessdate=August 5, 2009|publisher=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson said he accepted ABC's invitation to perform because "I don't do things that I'm not good at very often. I'm psyched to get to do that."&lt;ref name="AR2006081401091.html" /&gt; Carlson was the first contestant eliminated, on September 13, 2006.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

==Political views==
===Capitalism===
Although in favor of conservative economic policies, Carlson is critical of pure libertarian [[free market]] ideals, saying that economic and technological change that occurs too quickly can cause widespread social and political upheaval. He has stated that one model to follow is that of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], whose interventionist role in the economy in the early 1900s may have, in Carlson's view, prevented a [[Communist]] revolution in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh8vqof9hAk&amp;t=1966s|title=Sunday Special Ep 26: Tucker Carlson|publisher=thedailywire.com|date=November 4, 2018|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism===
Carlson is considered a conservative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/cnn-will-cancel-crossfire-and-cut-ties-to-commentator.html|title=CNN Will Cancel 'Crossfire' and Cut Ties to Commentator|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=January 6, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 22, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/media/life-after-bill-oreilly-for-fox-news-to-include-tucker-carlson.html|title=For Fox News, Life After Bill O'Reilly Will Feature Tucker Carlson|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=April 19, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 22, 2017|last2=Koblin|first2=John|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; , though he has been associated with [[Libertarianism|Libertarian politics]] in the past.

Carlson criticized 2008 presidential candidate [[John McCain]] for being insufficiently ideological. Speaking to [[Salon.com]], Carlson stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I liked McCain. And I would have voted for McCain for president happily, not because I agree with his politics; I never took McCain's politics seriously enough even to have strong feelings about them. I don't think McCain has very strong politics. He's interested in ideas almost as little as [[George W. Bush]] is. McCain isn't intellectual, and doesn't have a strong ideology at all. He's wound up sort of as a liberal Republican because he's mad at other Republicans, not because he's a liberal.&lt;ref name="salon 20030913"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lauerman |first=Kerry |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2003/09/13/carlson/index.html |title="You burn out fast when you demagogue" – Salon.com |publisher=Dir.salon.com |date=September 13, 2003 |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512193301/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2003/09/13/carlson/index.html |archivedate=May 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carlson has stated that former U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] is not a true conservative. In an August 27, 2004, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' interview, Carlson expressed his "displeasure with Bush".&lt;ref name="A39712-2004Aug27.html"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39712-2004Aug27.html |title=Republican Convention: Tucker Carlson (washingtonpost.com) |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=August 30, 2004 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson did not vote in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], citing his disgust with the [[Iraq War]] and his disillusionment with the once [[small government|small-government]] Republican Party. He would go on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't know what you consider conservative, but I'm not much of a liberal, at least as the word is currently defined. For instance, I'm utterly opposed to [[abortion]], which I think is horrible and cruel. I think [[affirmative action]] is wrong. I'd like to slow immigration pretty dramatically. I hate all nanny state regulations, such as seat belt laws and smoking bans. I'm not for [[big government]]. I think the U.S. ought to hesitate before intervening abroad. I think these are conservative impulses. So by my criteria, Bush isn't much of a conservative.&lt;ref name="A39712-2004Aug27.html"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Carlson said in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that he thinks "that the U.S. ought to hesitate before intervening abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/25081-change-from-kelly-to-carlson-may-give-fox-viewers-a-new-perspective|title=Change from Kelly to Carlson May Give Fox Viewers a New Perspective|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson is skeptical of foreign intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/tucker-carlson-goes-war-against-the-neocons-21545?page=show|title=Tucker Carlson Goes to War Against the Neocons|first=Curt|last=Mills|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq====
Carlson initially supported the U.S. war with Iraq during its first year. After a year, however, he began criticizing the war, telling the ''[[New York Observer]], "''I think it's a total nightmare and disaster, and I'm ashamed that I went against my own instincts in supporting it. It's something I'll never do again. Never. I got convinced by a friend of mine who's smarter than I am, and I shouldn't have done that. No. I want things to work out, but I'm enraged by it, actually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=49632&amp;Disp=14&amp;Trace=on |title=LP: Newly Dovish, Tucker Carlson Goes Public (Tucker Carlson turns against the war) |publisher=Libertypost.org |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
In a July 2018 interview about Russian involvement in U.S. elections, Carlson said that [[Mexico]] has interfered in U.S. elections "more successfully" than Russia by "packing our electorate" through mass immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/397329-tucker-carlson-mexico-has-interfered-in-us-elections-more-successfully-than|title=Tucker Carlson: Mexico has interfered in US elections 'more successfully' than Russia|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=July 16, 2018|work=TheHill|access-date=October 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion was disputed by journalist Philip Bump, who wrote that the number of Mexicans in the U.S. had decreased since 2009 and asked rhetorically, "What good has it done Mexico to have a number of its citizens move to the United States and gain the right to vote?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/17/tucker-carlson-identifies-the-actual-threat-to-american-democracy-hispanic-voters/|title=Analysis {{!}} Tucker Carlson identifies the actual threat to American democracy: Hispanic voters|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
Carlson has said he does not consider Russia a serious threat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/tucker-carlson-is-doing-something-extraordinary/533586/|title=Tucker Carlson Is Doing Something Extraordinary|last=Beinart|first=Peter|work=The Atlantic|access-date=July 22, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson has called for the United States to work with Russia in the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/07/12/why-two-talking-heads-on-fox-news-just-rehashed-the-debates-of-1938/|title=Why two talking heads on Fox News just rehashed the debates of 1938|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob|date=July 12, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=July 22, 2017|last2=Heilbrunn|first2=Jacob|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes overthrowing [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Peter Beinart]] of ''[[the Atlantic]]'' said that Carlson has been an "apologist for Donald Trump on the Russia scandal".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Carlson described the controversy in the wake of revelations that [[Donald Trump Jr.]] was [[Trump campaign–Russian meetings|willing to accept anti-Clinton information from a Russian government official]] as a "new level of hysteria" and said that Trump Jr. had only been "gossiping with foreigners."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Syria ====
In April 2018, Carlson questioned whether Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was responsible for a chemical attack that occurred the same month and killed dozens.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/fox-news-host-u-s-bombing-syria-could-lead-to-genocide-of-christian-1.5990560|title=Fox News Host: We Tolerate Saudi Atrocities in Yemen, So Why Not Assad's in Syria?|last=Haaretz|date=April 11, 2018|work=Haaretz|access-date=April 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson suggested, alluding to various [[conspiracy theories]], that a similar attack that occurred the year before (the [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]]), which was widely attributed to Assad's forces, was a [[False flag|false flag attack]] perpetrated to falsely implicate the Assad government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Immigration, race and diversity===
Carlson has been accused by Erik Wemple of ''The Washington Post'' and by writers for Vox.com of demonizing immigrants, both those who immigrated to the U.S. legally and illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/7/21/16008190/strikethrough-white-supremacists-love-tucker-carlson|title=Why white supremacists love Tucker Carlson|work=Vox|access-date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/07/20/in-his-quest-to-demonize-immigrants-fox-newss-tucker-carlson-misses-a-good-story/|title=In his quest to demonize immigrants, Fox News's Tucker Carlson misses a good story|last=Wemple|first=Erik|date=July 20, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=July 22, 2017|last2=Wemple|first2=Erik|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/05/08/fox-newss-tucker-carlson-demagogued-a-rape-case-involving-immigrants-then-they-were-cleared/|title=Fox News's Tucker Carlson demagogued a rape case involving immigrants.

When Mitt Romney condemned then-candidate Donald Trump for his refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan, saying it was a "disqualifying and disgusting response... His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America," Carlson criticized Romney. Carlson said, "Obama could have written" that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11084.html|title=Identity Crisis|last=|first=|date=|website=Princeton University Press|page=88|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Carlson said that [[Sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh|sexual assault allegations]] against Supreme Court justice nominee [[Brett Kavanaugh]] demonstrated "the left's war on old white men", and suggested that there could be a race war in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-tucker-carlson-race-war-brett-kavanaugh-1145172|title=Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggests a race war in America could be coming after Brett Kavanaugh hearing|date=September 29, 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=October 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Carlson ran a segment where he alleged that the South African government was targeting white farmers due to anti-white racism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/now-trump-is-having-a-twitter-spat-with-south-africa-over-land-reforms.html|title=Trump hypes fringe talking point about South African government 'seizing land from white farmers'|last=Ellyatt|first=Holly|date=August 23, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/world/africa/trump-south-africa-white-farmers.html|title=Trump Cites False Claims of Widespread Attacks on White Farmers in South Africa|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45282088|title=SA rejects Trump tweet on farmer killings|date=August 23, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the segment, Carlson criticized "elites" who were purportedly concerned about racism "paying no attention" to the "racist government of South Africa."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Carlson said that "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa had 'changed the country's constitution to make it possible to steal land from people because they are the wrong skin color.'

Mr. Ramaphosa has said that speeding up [land reform] will bolster economic growth and agricultural production. More fundamentally, the government has argued, returning land to black South Africans would make the country [more] just."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Following the Carlson segment, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to "closely study the South Africa land and farm seizure and large scale killing of farmers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Trump's tweet was denounced as "'misinformed'" by the South African government, which stated that it would address the matter through diplomatic channels.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are no reliable figures that suggest that farmers are at greater risk of being killed than the average South African.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; Some South African blacks have sought to retake land to which they have made claims, but South African police have stopped such ''ad hoc'' attempts at appropriating land.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The South African right-wing group AfriForum took credit for Carlson and Trump's statements, saying it believed that its campaign to influence American politics had succeeded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

On August 23, 2018, Carlson corrected certain statements about South Africa that he had made the previous evening, but did not admit having made errors. He said that the proposed constitutional amendment was still being debated in South Africa and added that no farms had yet been expropriated.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; Carlson later stated in an interview that he "doesn't  believe anyone should be rewarded or punished based upon characteristics they can't control" and added that his South Africa segment made "'an argument against tribalism'".&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

===Libertarianism===
[[Image:TuckerRonPaul.jpg|thumb|Tucker Carlson at a 2007 [[Ron Paul]] presidential event]]
Carlson voted for [[Ron Paul]] in 1988 when he was running as the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allronpaul.blogspot.com/2007/05/msnbc-tucker-carlson-interviews-ron.html |title=All Ron Paul: Transcript: Tucker Carlson interviews Ron Paul on MSNBC before the May 3 debate |publisher=Allronpaul.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, 2007, it was reported that Carlson lobbied Nevada brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] to support Paul's candidacy. Carlson said, "Dennis Hof is a good friend of mine, so when we got to Nevada, I decided to call him up and see if he wanted to come check this guy out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIRrv90LfBH2XZpNPhCTNFjQMQGwD8T5E71O0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128131712/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIRrv90LfBH2XZpNPhCTNFjQMQGwD8T5E71O0 |archivedate=November 28, 2007 |title=Paul Endorsed by Nevada Brothel Owner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2009, Carlson joined the libertarian think tank the [[Cato Institute]] as a senior fellow; he is no longer affiliated with the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/02/23/tucker-carlson-joins-the-cato-institute/ |title=Tucker Carlson Joins the Cato Institute &amp;#124; Cato @ Liberty |publisher=Cato-at-liberty.org |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cato.org/people/tucker-carlson|title=Tucker Carlson|work=Cato Institute|access-date=July 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tucker Carlson (5222916).jpg|thumb|Carlson wearing a bow tie in early 2004]]
Carlson was known for wearing [[bow tie]]s both on- and off-air until 2006.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joketribe.com/video/Jon.Stewart.On.Crossfire.php |title=Jon Stewart Exposes The Fallacy Of The News Media on CNN's Crossfire |publisher=JokeTribe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 on the season-five episode of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', "[[List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes#Season 5 (2005)|The Bowtie]]", a character refers to [[Larry David]] as "Tucker Carlson" for wearing one. On April 11, 2006, Carlson announced on his MSNBC show that he would no longer be wearing either a bow tie or a regular tie, adding, "I just decided I wanted to give my neck a break. A little change is good once in a while, and I feel better already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title="The Situation with Tucker Carlson" for April 11 |format=transcript |date=April 11, 2006 |work=[[MSNBC]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12285620/ |quote=Well, if you watched this show before you may have noticed that I look different tonight. I'm not wearing a bow tie. This is odd for me. I have worn a bow tie on television every night for the past six years and for 15 years off air before that, since I was in 10th grade. I like bow ties, and I certainly spent a lot of time defending them. But from now on I'm going without: no ties at all. I didn't lose a bet. It is not a political statement. I didn't ditch the bow tie in protest or in solidarity with any oppressed group. It's not a ratings ploy but decided. I just decided I wanted to give my neck a break. A little change is good once {{sic|in a|while|expected=in a while}}, and I feel better already. So to all three of you who watch this show for the bow tie, I'm sorry.

===Sexism allegation===
Carlson endorsed controversial comments made by his brother, Buckley, about a spokeswoman for [[New York City Mayor]] [[Bill de Blasio]]. The spokesperson had asked for corrections to a story, and Buckley called her a "whiny little self-righteous bitch" and made sexually derogatory remarks. Tucker wrote that Buckley "meant it in the nicest way." Former speaker of the New York City Council [[Christine Quinn]] called on both Carlsons to apologize for the "offensive" and "sexist" comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/city-hall-aide-rips-daily-caller-boss-insulting-email-article-1.2162433|title=Bill de Blasio aide slams 'Daily Caller' founder Tucker Carlson and his brother for subjecting her to disparaging comments – NY Daily News|first=Jennifer|last=Fermino|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/tucker-carlson-brother-sent-profanity-laced-email-in-nicest-way-204536|title=Tucker Carlson: Brother sent profanity-laced email in 'nicest way'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/26/tucker-carlson-bro-caught-in-email-snafu-against-de-blasio-aide/|title=Tucker Carlson &amp; bro caught in email snafu against de Blasio aide|date=March 26, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encounters with protesters ===
On the night of November 8, 2018, a group of [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]] activists gathered in the street outside Carlson's home in [[Washington, D.C.]] for about ten minutes, chanting, "we know where you sleep at night!" Carlson's driveway was also vandalized with a spray-painted anarchist symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/antifa-group-chants-outside-vandalizes-fox-commentator-tucker-carlson-s-n934131|title=Antifa group chants outside, vandalizes Fox commentator Tucker Carlson's home|last1=Fieldstadt|first1=Elisha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson, who was not home at the time, asserted that "someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/08/heres-the-vandalism-that-protesters-left-at-tucker-carlsons-house/&lt;/ref&gt; although a police report did not note any visible damage to the door; his wife, who was home, called 911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/media/tucker-carlson-cracked-door/index.html|title=Police say there was no visible 'crack' on Tucker Carlson's front door after Antifa protest|last=Business|first=Brian Stelter, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police opened an investigation into the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/08/they-were-threatening-me-my-family-tucker-carlsons-home-targeted-by-protesters/|title=‘They were threatening me and my family’: Tucker Carlson’s home targeted by protesters|last1=Chiu|first1=Allyson|date=November 8, 2018|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anti-fascist-protesters-target-tucker-carlsons-home/2018/11/08/6c91ad78-e36d-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html|title=Anti-fascist protesters target Tucker Carlson’s home|last1=Chiu|first1=Allyson|date=November 8, 2018|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 8, 2018|last2=Stein|first2=Perry|language=en|last3=Brown|first3=Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/media/tucker-carlson-cracked-door/index.html|title=Police say there was no visible 'crack' on Tucker Carlson's front door after Antifa protest|last=Business|first=Brian Stelter, CNN|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Carlson is married to Susan Carlson (née Andrews).&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Together, they have three daughters and one son.&lt;ref name="peoplemag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/travel/tmagazine/15T-FISH.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=&amp;_r=|title=Off the Hook|last=Carlson|first=Tucker|date=May 15, 2005|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson is an [[Episcopal Church USA|Episcopalian]] and "loves the liturgy, though he abhors the liberals who run the denomination".&lt;ref name="Fighting-Words"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kelefa |last=Sanneh |title=Tucker Carlson's Fighting Words |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/tucker-carlsons-fighting-words |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=April 10, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson quit drinking alcohol in 2002, "having decided that neither the pleasant nights nor the unpleasant mornings were improving his life".&lt;ref name="Fighting-Words" /&gt; Years earlier, he had quit smoking and replaced cigarettes with nicotine gum, which he buys in bulk from New Zealand and "chews constantly".&lt;ref name="Fighting-Words" /&gt;

==Books==

In 2003, Carlson authored the memoir ''Politicians, Partisans and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News'', about his television news experiences; the publisher was [[Warner Books]].&lt;ref name=adventures&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/bookreviews/currentaffairs/politicians-partisans-and-parasites-my-adventures-in-cable-news.php|title=Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News|work=Washingtonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the book's revelations was Carlson's description of being falsely accused of [[rape]] by a woman he did not know who suffered from severe [[mental illness]] and displayed [[stalking|stalker]]-like behavior. Carlson wrote in the book that the incident was emotionally [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News|last=Carlson|first=Tucker|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JoFL9epFbcC&amp;pg=PT103&amp;dq=Tucker+Carlson+rape&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2M47U_maMYjSsAT6uIGADg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tucker%20Carlson%20rape&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Carlson, represented by the literary and creative agency [[Javelin (company)|Javelin]], signed an eight-figure, two-book deal with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'s [[Threshold Editions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 2, 2017 |title=Tucker Carlson Gets Two-Book, Eight-Figure Deal |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bookmark/tucker-carlson-gets-two-book-eight-figure-deal-999704 |agency=AP }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first book in the series, ''[[Ship of Fools (book)|Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution]]'', was released in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fox News' Tucker Carlson exposes 'elites' in his book 'Ship of Fools' |url=https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-now/fox-news-tucker-carlson-exposes-elites-in-his-book-ship-of-fools/465-3c0e29a4-8d8d-45ba-a438-51540c220ea5 |first=Dave |last=Osborn |date=October 2, 2018 |publisher=''Naples Daily News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted at #1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tucker Carlson's new book topples Woodward from #1 on New York Times best-seller list |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/410912-tucker-carlsons-new-book-topples-woodward-from-1-on-new-york-times-bestseller |first=Joe |last=Concha |date=October 11, 2018 |publisher=''The Hill''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="92404">In the [[foundations of mathematics]], '''von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory''' ('''NBG''') is an [[axiomatic set theory]] that is a [[conservative extension]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC). NBG introduces the [[Primitive notion|notion]] of [[Class (set theory)|class]], which is a collection of [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s defined by a [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] whose [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s range only over sets. NBG can define classes that are larger than sets, such as the class of all sets and the class of all [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s. [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] (MK) allows classes to be defined by formulas whose quantifiers range over classes. NBG is finitely axiomatizable, while ZFC and MK are not.

A key theorem of NBG is the class existence theorem, which states that for every formula whose quantifiers range only over sets, there is a class consisting of the sets satisfying the formula. This class is built by mirroring the step-by-step construction of the formula with classes. Since all set-theoretic formulas are constructed from two kinds of [[atomic formula]]s ([[Membership (set theory)|membership]] and [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]) and finitely many [[logical symbols]], only finitely many [[axiom]]s are needed to build the classes satisfying them. This is why NBG is finitely axiomatizable. Classes are also used for other constructions, for handling the [[Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes|set-theoretic paradoxes]], and for stating the [[axiom of global choice]], which is stronger than ZFC's [[axiom of choice]].

[[John von Neumann]] introduced classes into set theory in 1925. The [[primitive notion]]s of his theory were [[Function (set theory)|function]] and [[Argument of a function|argument]]. Using these notions, he defined class and set.&lt;ref name=VN1925def&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|pp=221&amp;ndash;224, 226, 229}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|pp=396&amp;ndash;398, 400, 403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bernays]] reformulated von Neumann's theory by taking class and set as primitive notions.&lt;ref name=Bernays1937def&gt;{{harvnb|Bernays|1937}}, pp. 66&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]] simplified Bernays' theory for his [[relative consistency]] proof of the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=Godel1940&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classes in set theory ==
=== The uses of classes ===
Classes have several uses in NBG:
* They produce a finite axiomatization of set theory.
* They are used to state a "very strong form of the [[axiom of choice]]"&lt;ref name=Godelp6&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—namely, the [[axiom of global choice]]: There exists a global choice function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; defined on the class of all nonempty sets such that &lt;math&gt;G(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for every nonempty set &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; This is stronger than ZFC's axiom of choice: For every set &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty sets, there exists a [[choice function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in s.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Axiom of global choice]] explains why it is provably stronger.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes|set-theoretic paradoxes]] are handled by recognizing that some classes cannot be sets. For example, assume that the class &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Ordinal number|ordinal]]s is a set. Then &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Transitive (set theory)|transitive]] set [[well-order]]ed by &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. So, by definition, &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinal. Hence, &lt;math&gt;Ord \in Ord&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; being a well-ordering of &lt;math&gt;Ord.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is not a set. Because a class that is not a set is called a [[proper class]], &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class.
* Proper classes are useful in constructions. In his proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of global choice and the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]], Gödel used proper classes to build the [[constructible universe]]. He constructed a function on the class of all ordinals that, for each ordinal, builds a constructible set by applying a set-building operation to previously constructed sets. The constructible universe is the [[Image (set theory)|image]] of this function.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=35&amp;ndash;38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Axiom schema versus class existence theorem ===
Once classes are added to the language, it is simple to axiomatize a set theory with classes that is similar to ZFC. First, the [[axiom schema]] of class comprehension is added. This axiom schema states: For every formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-[[tuple]]s}} satisfying the formula—that is, &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \ldots , x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)].&lt;/math&gt; Then the [[axiom schema of replacement]] is replaced by a [[#NBG's axiom of replacement|single axiom]] that uses a class. Finally, ZFC's [[axiom of extensionality]] is modified to handle classes: If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical. The other axioms of ZFC are not modified.

This theory is not finitely axiomatized. ZFC's replacement schema has been replaced by a single axiom, but the axiom schema of class comprehension has been introduced. 

To produce a theory with finitely many axioms, the axiom schema of class comprehension must be replaced with a class existence theorem that makes the same statement: For every formula that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} satisfying it. The proof of this theorem, which is [[#CET|given below]], requires only finitely many class existence axioms to translate the construction of a formula into a construction of the class satisfying the formula.

== Axiomatization of NBG ==
=== Classes and sets ===
NBG has two types of objects: classes and sets. Intuitively, every set is also a class. There are two ways to axiomatize this. Bernays used [[First-order_logic#Many-sorted_logic|many-sorted logic]] with two sorts: classes and sets. Gödel avoided sorts by introducing primitive predicates: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Cls}(A)&lt;/math&gt; for "&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a class" and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}(A)&lt;/math&gt; for "&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set" (in German, "set" is ''Menge''). He also introduced axioms stating that every set is a class and that if class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a member of a class, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set.&lt;ref name=Godel1940p3&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Using predicates is the standard way to eliminate sorts. [[Elliott Mendelson]] modified Gödel's approach by having everything be a class and defining the set predicate &lt;math&gt;M(A)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\exists C(A \in C).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mendelson|1997|pp=225&amp;ndash;226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This modification eliminates Gödel's class predicate and his two axioms.

Bernays' two-sorted approach may appear more natural at first, but it creates a more complex theory.{{efn|The historical development suggests that the two-sorted approach does appear more natural at first. In introducing his theory, Bernays stated: "According to the leading idea of von Neumann set theory we have to deal with two kinds of individuals, which we may distinguish as ''sets'' and ''classes''." {{harv|Bernays|1937|p=66.}}}} In Bernays' theory, every set has two representations: one as a set and the other as a class. Also, there are two [[membership relation]]s: the first, denoted by "∈", is between two sets; the second, denoted by "η", is between a set and a class. This redundancy is required by many-sorted logic because variables of different sorts range over disjoint subdomains of the [[domain of discourse]].

The differences between these two approaches does not affect what can be proved, but it does affect how statements are written. In Gödel's approach, &lt;math&gt;A \in C&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are classes is a valid statement. In Bernays' approach this statement has no meaning. However, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set, there is an equivalent statement: Define "set &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;" if they have the same sets as members—that is, &lt;math&gt;\forall x(x \in a \iff x \;\eta \;A).&lt;/math&gt; The statement &lt;math&gt;a \;\eta \;C&lt;/math&gt; where set &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to Gödel's &lt;math&gt;A \in C.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernays1937def /&gt;

The approach adopted in this article is that of Gödel with Mendelson's modification. This means that NBG is a [[axiomatic system]] in [[first-order predicate logic]] with [[Equality in set theory|equality]], and its only [[primitive notion]]s are class and the membership relation.

=== Definitions and axioms of extensionality and pairing ===
A set is a class that belongs to at least one class: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set if and only if &lt;math&gt;\exist C(A \in C)&lt;/math&gt;.
A class that is not a set is called a proper class: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall C(A \notin C)&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, every class is either a set or a proper class, and no class is both (if the theory is [[consistent]]).

Gödel introduced the convention that uppercase variables range over classes, while lowercase variables range over sets.&lt;ref name=Godel1940p3 /&gt; Gödel also used names that begin with an uppercase letter to denote particular classes, including functions and [[relation (math)|relation]]s defined on the class of all sets. Gödel's convention is used in this article. It allows us to write:
{{plainlist|indent=1}}
* &lt;math&gt;\exist x\, \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\exist x \bigl(\exist C (x \in C) \land \phi(x)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x\, \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\forall x \bigl(\exist C (x \in C) \implies \phi(x)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
{{endplainlist}}

The following axioms and definitions are needed for the proof of the class existence theorem.

'''Axiom of extensionality.{{space|thin}}''' If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\forall B \,[\forall x(x \in A \iff x \in B) \implies A = B]&lt;/math&gt;

This axiom generalizes ZFC's [[axiom of extensionality]] to classes. 

'''[[Axiom of pairing]].{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are sets, then there exists a set &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; whose only members are &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \,\forall y \,\exists p \,\forall z \,[z \in p \iff (z = x \,\lor\, z = y)]&lt;/math&gt;

As in ZFC, the axiom of extensionality implies the uniqueness of the set &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, which allows us to introduce the notation &lt;math&gt;\{x, y\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Ordered pair]]s are defined by: 
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) = \{\{x\}, \{x, y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;
Tuples are defined [[Inductive definition|inductive]]ly using ordered pairs:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1) = x_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{For } n &gt; 1\!: (x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n) = ((x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}), x_n)&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|Gödel defined &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = (x_1, (x_2, \ldots, x_n)).&lt;/math&gt; This affects the statements of some of his definitions, axioms, and theorems. This article uses Mendelson's definition. ({{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Mendelson|1997|p=230}}.)}}

=== Class existence axioms and axiom of regularity ===
The class existence axioms will be used to prove the class existence theorem: For every formula in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; [[free variable|free set variable]]s that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} that satisfy it. The following example starts with two classes that are [[Function (set theory)|function]]s and builds a [[composite function]]. This example illustrates the techniques used to prove the class existence theorem, and hence the types of class existence axioms that are needed.

{{Anchor|Ex1}}
:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; style="background: white" 
|'''Example 1:{{space|thin}}''' If the classes &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are functions, then the composite function &lt;math&gt;G \circ F&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula: &lt;math&gt;\exists t[(x, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, y) \in G].&lt;/math&gt; Since this formula has two free set variables, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y,&lt;/math&gt; the class existence theorem constructs the class of ordered pairs: &lt;math&gt;G \circ F\,=\,\{(x, y): \exists t[(x, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, y) \in G]\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

Because this formula is built from simpler formulas using [[Conjunction (logic)|conjunction]] &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and [[existential quantification]] &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, class [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]]s are needed that take classes representing the simpler formulas and produce classes representing the formulas with &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;. To produce a class representing a formula with &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;, [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] used since &lt;math&gt;x \in A \cap B \iff x \in A \land x \in B.&lt;/math&gt; To produce a class representing a formula with &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Domain of a relation|domain]] is used since &lt;math&gt;x \in Dom(A) \iff \exists t[(x,t) \in A].&lt;/math&gt;

Before taking the intersection, the tuples in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; need an extra component so they have the same variables. The component &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is added to the tuples of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is added to the tuples of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;: 
:&lt;math&gt;F' = \{(x, t, y): (x, t) \in F\}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,G' = \{(t, y, x): (t, y) \in G\}&lt;/math&gt; 
In the definition of &lt;math&gt;F',&lt;/math&gt; the variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not restricted by the statement &lt;math&gt;(x, t) \in F,&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; ranges over the class &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of all sets. Similarly, in the definition of &lt;math&gt;G',&lt;/math&gt; the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ranges over &lt;math&gt;V.&lt;/math&gt; So an axiom is needed that adds an extra component (whose values range over &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) to the tuples of a given class.

Next, the variables are put in the same order to prepare for the intersection: 
:&lt;math&gt;F'' = \{(x, y, t): (x, t) \in F\}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,G'' = \{(x, y, t): (t, y) \in G\}&lt;/math&gt;
To go from &lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;F''&lt;/math&gt; and from &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G''&lt;/math&gt; requires two different [[permutation]]s, so axioms that support permutations of tuple components are needed.

The intersection of &lt;math&gt;F''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G''&lt;/math&gt; handles &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;F'' \cap G'' = \{(x, y, t): (x, t) \in F \,\land\, (y, t) \in G\}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;(x, y, t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;((x, y), t)&lt;/math&gt;, taking the domain of &lt;math&gt;F'' \cap G''&lt;/math&gt; handles &lt;math&gt;\exists t&lt;/math&gt; and produces the composite function:
:&lt;math&gt;G \circ F = Dom(F'' \cap G'') = \{(x, y): \exists t ((x, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, y) \in G)\}&lt;/math&gt;
So axioms of intersection and domain are needed.

The class existence axioms are divided into two groups: axioms handling language primitives and axioms handling tuples. There are four axioms in the first group and three axioms in the second group.{{efn|Bernays' class existence axioms specify unique classes. Gödel weakened all but three of Bernays' axioms (intersection, complement, domain) by replacing [[biconditional]]s with [[Material conditional|implication]]s, which means they specify only the ordered pairs or the 3-tuples of the class. The axioms in this section are Gödel's except for Bernays' stronger [[#Product by V axiom|product by V axiom]], which specifies a unique class of ordered pairs. Bernays' axiom simplifies the proof of the [[#CET|class existence theorem]]. Gödel's axiom B6 appears as the fourth statement of the [[#Tuple lemma|tuple lemma]]. Bernays later realized that one of his axioms is redundant, which implies that one of Gödel's axioms is redundant. Using the other axioms, axiom B6 can be proved from axiom B8, and B8 can be proved from B6, so either axiom can be considered the redundant axiom. ({{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=56}}; {{harvnb|Bernays|1937|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=5, 9}}; {{harvnb|Mendelson|1997|p=231}}.) The names for the tuple-handling axioms are from the French Wikipédia article: [[:fr:Théorie des ensembles de von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel#Compréhension pour les classes|Théorie des ensembles de von Neumann]].}}

'''Axioms for handling language primitives:'''

'''Membership.{{space|thin}}''' There exists a class &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; containing all the ordered pairs whose first component is a member of the second component.
:&lt;math&gt;\exists E \,\forall x \,\forall y \,[(x,y) \in E \iff x \in y]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Intersection (conjunction).{{space|thin}}''' For any two classes &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the sets that belong to both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\forall B \,\exists C \,\forall x \,[x \in C \iff (x \in A \,\land\, x \in B)]&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Complement (set theory)|Complement]] (negation).{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the sets not belonging to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,[x \in B \iff \neg(x \in A)]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Domain (existential quantifier).{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the first components of the ordered pairs of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,[x \in B \iff \exists y((x,y) \in A)]&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

By the axiom of extensionality, class &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in the intersection axiom and class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in the complement and domain axioms are unique. They will be denoted by: &lt;math&gt;A \cap B,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\complement A,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Dom(A),&lt;/math&gt; respectively.{{efn|name=Bourbaki|This article uses [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]'s complement notation &lt;math&gt;\complement A&lt;/math&gt; and relative complement notation &lt;math&gt;\complement_X A = \complement_A \cap X&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Bourbaki|2004|p=71}}. This prefix relative complement notation is used by the class existence theorem to [[#Mirror|mirror]] the prefix logical not (&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;).}} On the other hand, extensionality is not applicable to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in the membership axiom since it specifies only those sets in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; that are ordered pairs.   

{{Anchor|Empty class}}The first three axioms imply the existence of the empty class and the class of all sets: The membership axiom implies the existence of a class &lt;math&gt;E.&lt;/math&gt; The intersection and complement axioms imply the existence of &lt;math&gt;E \cap \complement E&lt;/math&gt;, which is empty. By the axiom of extensionality, this class is unique; it is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\empty.&lt;/math&gt; The complement of &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; is the class &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;of all sets, which is also unique by extensionality. The set predicate &lt;math&gt;M(A)&lt;/math&gt;, which was defined as &lt;math&gt;\exists C(A \in C)&lt;/math&gt;, is now redefined as &lt;math&gt;A \in V&lt;/math&gt; to avoid quantifying over classes.

'''Axioms for handling tuples:'''

{{Anchor|Product by V axiom}}'''[[Cartesian product|Product]] by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; consisting precisely of the ordered pairs whose first component belongs to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall u \,[u \in B \iff \exists x \, \exists y \,(u = (x, y) \land x \in A)]&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Circular permutation]].{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; whose 3{{nbhyph}}tuples are obtained by applying the circular permutation &lt;math&gt;(y,z,x) \mapsto (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; to the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,\forall y \,\forall z \,[(x,y,z) \in B \iff (y,z,x) \in A]&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Transposition (mathematics)|Transposition]].{{space|thin}}''' For any class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, there is a class &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; whose 3{{nbhyph}}tuples are obtained by transposing the last two components of the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A \,\exists B \,\forall x \,\forall y \,\forall z \,[(x,y,z) \in B \iff (x,z,y) \in A]&lt;/math&gt;

By extensionality, the product by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; axiom implies the existence of a unique class, which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;A \times V.&lt;/math&gt; This axiom is used to define the class &lt;math&gt;V^n&lt;/math&gt; of all {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}}: &lt;math&gt;V^1 = V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V^{n+1} = V^n \times V.\,&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a class, extensionality implies that &lt;math&gt;A \cap V^n&lt;/math&gt; is the unique class consisting of the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} of &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt; For example, the membership axiom produces a class &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; that may contain elements that are not ordered pairs, while the intersection &lt;math&gt;E \cap V^2&lt;/math&gt; contains only the ordered pairs of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

The circular permutation and transposition axioms do not imply the existence of unique classes because they specify only the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples of class &lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt; By specifying the 3{{nbhyph}}tuples, these axioms also specify the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} for &lt;math&gt;n \ge 4&lt;/math&gt; since: &lt;math&gt;(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-2}, x_{n-1}, x_n) = ((x_1, \ldots, x_{n-2}), x_{n-1}, x_n).&lt;/math&gt; The axioms for handling tuples and the domain axiom imply the following lemma, which is used in the proof of the class existence theorem.

{{Anchor|Tuple lemma}}'''Tuple lemma.'''

One more axiom is needed to prove the class existence theorem: the [[axiom of regularity]]. Since the existence of the empty class has been proved, the usual statement of this axiom is given.{{efn|Since Gödel states this axiom before he proves the existence of the empty class, he states it without using the empty class {{harv|Gödel|1940|p=6}}.}}

{{Anchor|Axiom of regularity}}'''Axiom of regularity.{{space|thin}}''' Every nonempty set has at least one element with which it has no element in common.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a\,[a \neq \empty \implies \exists u(u \in a \land u \cap a = \empty)].&lt;/math&gt;

This axiom implies that a set cannot belong to itself: Assume that &lt;math&gt;x \in x&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;a = \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x \cap a \ne \empty&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;x \in x \cap a.&lt;/math&gt; This contradicts the axiom of regularity because &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the only element in &lt;math&gt;a.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x \notin x.&lt;/math&gt; The axiom of regularity also prohibits infinite descending membership sequences: &lt;math&gt;\;\;\cdots \in x_{n+1} \in x_n \in \cdots \in x_1 \in x_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Gödel stated regularity for classes rather than for sets in his 1940 monograph, which was based on lectures given in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Kanamori|2012|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he proved that regularity for sets implies regularity for classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|2003|p=121}}. Both references contain Gödel's proof but Kanamori is easier to follow since he uses modern terminology.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Class existence theorem ===
{{Anchor|CET}}'''Class existence theorem.{{space|thin}}''' Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)&lt;/math&gt; be a formula that quantifies only over sets and contains no [[free variable]]s other than &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily all of these). Then for all &lt;math&gt;Y_1, \dots, Y_m&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} such that: &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \dots , x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)].&lt;/math&gt; The class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{(x_1, \dots , x_n): \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)\}.&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|The proofs in this and the next section come from Gödel's proofs, which he gave at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] where he "could count upon an audience well versed in [[mathematical logic]]" {{harv|Dawson|1997|p=134}}. To make Gödel's proofs more accessible to Wikipedia readers, a few modifications have been made. The goal in this and the next section is to prove Gödel's M4, his fourth class existence theorem. The proof in this section mostly follows the M1 proof {{harv|Gödel|1940|pp=8&amp;ndash;11}}, but it also uses techniques from the M3 and M4 proofs. The theorem is stated with class variables rather than M1's symbols for special classes (universal quantification over the class variables is equivalent to being true for any instantiation of the class variables). The major differences from the M1 proof are: unique classes of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} are generated at the end of the basis and inductive steps (which require Bernays' stronger product by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; axiom), and [[bound variable]]s are replaced by subscripted variables that continue the numbering of the free set variables. Since bound variables are free for part of the induction, this guarantees that, when they are free, they are treated the same as the original free variables. One of the benefits of this proof is the [[#Mirror|example output]] of the function Class, which shows that a class's construction mirrors its defining formula's construction.}}

The theorem's proof will be done in two steps:
# Transformation rules are used to transform the given formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; into a [[logically equivalent|equivalent]] formula that simplifies the [[Mathematical induction|inductive]] part of the proof. For example, the only logical symbols in the transformed formula are &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, so the induction handles logical symbols with just three cases.  
# The class existence theorem is proved inductively for transformed formulas. Guided by the structure of the transformed formula, the class existence axioms are used to produce the unique class of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} satisfying the formula.

'''Transformation rules.{{space|thin}}''' In rules 1 and 2, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denote set or class variables. These two rules eliminate all occurrences of class variables before an &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; and all occurrences of equality. Each time rule 1 or 2 is applied to a subformula, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; differs from the other variables in the current formula. The three rules are repeated until there are no subformulas to which they can be applied. This produces a formula that is built only with &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, set variables, and class variables &lt;math&gt;Y_k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Y_k&lt;/math&gt; does not appear before an &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;.

# &lt;math&gt;\,Y_k \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is transformed into &lt;math&gt;\exists z_i(z_i = Y_k \,\land\, z_i \in \Gamma).&lt;/math&gt;
# Extensionality is used to transform &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\forall z_i(z_i \in \Delta \iff z_i \in \Gamma).&lt;/math&gt; 
# Logical identities are used to transform subformulas containing &lt;math&gt;\lor, \implies, \iff,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; to subformulas that only use &lt;math&gt;\neg, \land,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Transformation rules: [[bound variables]].{{space|thin}}''' Consider the composite function formula of [[#Ex1|example 1]] with its free set variables replaced by &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\exists t[(x_1, t) \in F \,\land\, (t, x_2) \in G].&lt;/math&gt; The inductive proof will remove &lt;math&gt;\exists t&lt;/math&gt;, which produces the formula &lt;math&gt;(x_1, t) \in F \land (t, x_2) \in G.&lt;/math&gt; However, since the class existence theorem is stated for subscripted variables, this formula does not have the form expected by the [[induction hypothesis]]. This problem is solved by replacing the variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_3.&lt;/math&gt; Bound variables within nested quantifiers are handled by increasing the subscript by one for each successive quantifier. This leads to rule 4, which must be applied after the other rules since rules 1 and 2 produce quantified variables.

# &lt;li value="4"&gt;If a formula contains no free set variables other than &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n,&lt;/math&gt; then bound variables that are nested within &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; quantifiers are replaced with {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;x_{n+q}&lt;/math&gt;.}} These variables have ''(quantifier) nesting depth'' &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

|'''Example 2:''' {{space|thin}}Rule 4 is applied to the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1)&lt;/math&gt; that defines the class consisting of all sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{\empty, \{\empty, \dots\}, \dots\}.&lt;/math&gt; That is, sets that contain at least &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; and a set containing &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; — for example, &lt;math&gt;\{\empty, \{\empty, a, b, c\}, d, e\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a, b, c, d,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; are sets.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(x_1) \,&amp;=\, \exists u\;\,[\,u \in x_1 \,\land\, \neg\exists v\;\,(\;v\, \in \,u\,)] \,\land\, \,\exists w\;\bigl(w \in x_1 \,\land\, \exists y\;\,[(\;y\, \in w \;\land\; \neg\exists z\;\,(\;z\, \in \,y\,)]\bigr) \\
\phi_r(x_1) \,&amp;=\, \exists x_2[x_2 \!\in\! x_1 \,\land\, \neg\exists x_3(x_3 \!\in\! x_2)] \,\land\, \,\exists x_2\bigl(x_2 \!\in\! x_1 \,\land\, \exists x_3[(x_3 \!\in\! x_2 \,\land\, \neg\exists x_4(x_4 \!\in\! x_3)]\bigr)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is the only free variable, &lt;math&gt;n = 1.&lt;/math&gt; The quantified variable &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; appears twice in &lt;math&gt;x_3 \in x_2&lt;/math&gt; at nesting depth 2. Its subscript is 3 because &lt;math&gt;n+q=1+2=3.&lt;/math&gt; If two quantifier scopes are at the same nesting depth, they are either identical or disjoint. The two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; are in disjoint quantifier scopes, so they do not interact with each other.

'''Proof of the class existence theorem.{{space|thin}}''' The proof starts by applying the transformation rules to the given formula to produce a transformed formula. Since this formula is equivalent to the given formula, the proof is completed by proving the class existence theorem for transformed formulas.

Gödel pointed out that the class existence theorem "is a [[metatheorem]], that is, a theorem about the system [NBG], not in the system …"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theorem about NBG because it is proved in the [[metatheory]] by induction on NBG formulas. Also, its proof—instead of invoking finitely many NBG axioms—inductively describes how to use NBG axioms to construct a class satisfying a given formula. For every formula, this description can be turned into a constructive existence proof that is in NBG. Therefore, this metatheorem can generate infinitely many NBG proofs.

A [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] [[computer program]] succinctly captures the construction of a class from a given formula. The definition of this program does not depend on the proof of the class existence theorem.

=== Extending the class existence theorem ===
Gödel extended the class existence theorem to formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; containing [[Finitary relation|relation]]s over classes (such as &lt;math&gt;Y_1 \subseteq Y_2&lt;/math&gt; and the [[unary relation]] &lt;math&gt;M(Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;), special classes (such as &lt;math&gt;Ord&lt;/math&gt;{{space|hair|2}}), and [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s (such as &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1 \cap Y_1&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=11&amp;ndash;13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To extend the class existence theorem, the formulas defining relations, special classes, and operations must quantify only over sets. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be transformed into an equivalent formula satisfying the [[#CET|hypothesis of the class existence theorem]].

The following definitions specify how formulas define relations, special classes, and operations:
# A relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is defined by: &lt;math&gt;R(Z_1, \dots, Z_k) \iff \psi_R(Z_1, \dots, Z_k).&lt;/math&gt;
# A special class &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is defined by: &lt;math&gt;u \in  C \iff \psi_C(u).&lt;/math&gt;
# An operation &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined by: &lt;math&gt;u \in P(Z_1, \dots, Z_k) \iff \psi_P(u, Z_1, \dots, Z_k).&lt;/math&gt;

A {{em|[[Term (logic)|term]]}} is defined by:
# Variables and special classes are terms.
# If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is an operation with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; arguments and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; are terms, then &lt;math&gt;P(\Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_k)&lt;/math&gt; is a term. 

The following transformation rules eliminate relations, special classes, and operations. Each time rule 2b, 3b, or 4 is applied to a subformula, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; differs from the other variables in the current formula. The rules are repeated until there are no subformulas to which they can be applied. &lt;math&gt;\, \Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_k, \Gamma,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denote terms.

'''Class existence theorem (extended version).{{space|thin}}''' Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)&lt;/math&gt; be a formula that quantifies only over sets, contains no free variables other than &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n,  Y_1, \dots, Y_m&lt;/math&gt;, and may contain relations, special classes, and operations defined by formulas that quantify only over sets. Then for all &lt;math&gt;Y_1, \dots, Y_m,&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} such that &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \dots , x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)].&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|This theorem is Gödel's theorem M4.

Theorem M2 extends this theorem to formulas containing relations, special classes, and operations. Theorem M3 is obtained from M2 by replacing the symbols for special classes with free variables. Gödel used M3 to define &lt;math&gt;A \times B = \{x: \exists y \exists z[x = (y, z) \land y \in A \land z \in B]\},&lt;/math&gt; which is unique by extensionality.

Gödel's approach, especially his use of M3 to define &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;, eliminates the need for Bernays' stronger form of the product by &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; axiom. {{harv|Gödel|1940|pp=8&amp;ndash;15.}}}}

'''Proof:{{space|thin}}''' Apply the transformation rules to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to produce an equivalent formula containing no relations, special classes, or operations. This formula satisfies the hypothesis of the class existence theorem. Therefore, for all &lt;math&gt;Y_1, \dots, Y_m,&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples}} satisfying &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \cdots \,\forall x_n [(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in A \iff \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_m)].&lt;/math&gt;

=== Set axioms ===
The axioms of pairing and regularity, which were needed for the proof of the class existence theorem, have been given above. NBG contains four other set axioms. Three of these axioms deal with class operations being applied to sets.

'''Definition.{{space|thin}}''' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Function (set theory)|function]] if &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq V^2 \land \forall x\, \forall y\, \forall z\, [(x,y) \in F \,\land\, (x,z) \in F \implies y = z].&lt;/math&gt;

In set theory, the definition of a function does not require specifying the domain or codomain of the function (see [[Function (set theory)]]). NBG's definition of function generalizes ZFC's definition from a set of ordered pairs to a class of ordered pairs. 

ZFC's definitions of the set operations: [[Image (set theory)|image]], [[Union (set theory)|union]], and [[power set]] are also generalized to class operations. The image of class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; under the function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;F[A] = \{y: \exists x(x \in A \,\land\, (x, y) \in F)\}.&lt;/math&gt; This definition does not require that &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(F).&lt;/math&gt; The union of class &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\cup A = \{x: \exists y(x \in y\, \,\land\, y \in A)\}.&lt;/math&gt; The power class of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(A) = \{x: x \subseteq A\}.&lt;/math&gt; The extended version of the class existence theorem implies the existence of these classes. The axioms of replacement, [[Axiom of union|union]], and [[Axiom of power set|power set]] imply that when these operations are applied to sets, they produce sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=16&amp;ndash;18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|NBG's axiom of replacement}}'''Axiom of replacement.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a function and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then &lt;math&gt;F[a]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Image (set theory)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, is a set.

Not having the requirement &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(F)&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of &lt;math&gt;F[A]&lt;/math&gt; produces a stronger axiom of replacement, which is used in the following proof.
 
{{Anchor|NBG's axiom of separation}}'''Theorem (NBG's [[axiom of separation]]).{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a subclass of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a set. &lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:{{space|thin}}''' The class existence theorem constructs the [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of the [[identity function]] to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;I{\restriction_B} = \{(x_1, x_2): x_1 \in B \land x_2 = x_1\}.&lt;/math&gt; Since the image of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;I{\restriction_B}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the axiom of replacement implies that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a set. This proof depends on the definition of image not having the requirement &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(F)&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;Dom(I{\restriction_B}) = B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Dom(I{\restriction_B}).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Axiom of union.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then there is a set containing &lt;math&gt;\cup a.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a\, \exists b\, \forall x\,[\,\exists y(x \in y\, \,\land\, y \in a) \implies x \in b\,].&lt;/math&gt;

'''Axiom of power set.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then there is a set containing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a).&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a\, \exists b\, \forall x\, (x \subseteq a \implies x \in b).&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|Gödel weakened Bernays' axioms of union and power set, which state the existence of these sets, to the above axioms that state there is a set containing the union and a set containing the power set ({{harvnb|Bernays|1941|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|1940|p=5}}). Bernays published his axioms after Gödel, but had sent them to Gödel in 1931 ({{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|2003|p=104&amp;ndash;115}}).}}

'''Theorem.{{space|thin}}''' If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then &lt;math&gt;\cup a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a)&lt;/math&gt; are sets.&lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:{{space|thin}}''' The axiom of union states that &lt;math&gt;\cup a&lt;/math&gt; is a subclass of a set &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, so the axiom of separation implies &lt;math&gt;\cup a&lt;/math&gt; is a set. Likewise, the axiom of power set states that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a)&lt;/math&gt; is a subclass of a set &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, so the axiom of separation implies that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(a)&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

'''Axiom of infinity.{{space|thin}}''' There exists a nonempty set &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\exists a\, [\exists u(u \in a) \,\land\, \forall x(x \in a \implies \exists y(y \in a \,\land\, x \subset y))].&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms of infinity and replacement prove the existence of the [[empty set]]. In the [[#Empty class|discussion of the class existence axioms]], the existence of the empty class &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; was proved. We now prove that &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; is a set. Let function &lt;math&gt;F = \empty&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be the set given by the axiom of infinity. By replacement, the image of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, which equals &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, is a set.

NBG's axiom of infinity is implied by ZFC's [[axiom of infinity]]: &lt;math&gt;\,\exists a\, [\empty \in a \,\land\, \forall x(x \in a \implies x \cup \{x\} \in a)].\,&lt;/math&gt; The first [[Conjunct (logic)|conjunct]] of ZFC's axiom, &lt;math&gt;\empty \in a&lt;/math&gt;, implies the first conjunct of NBG's axiom. The second conjunct of ZFC's axiom, &lt;math&gt;\forall x(x \in a \implies x \cup \{x\} \in a)&lt;/math&gt;, implies the second conjunct of NBG's axiom since &lt;math&gt;x \subset x \cup \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt; To prove ZFC's axiom of infinity from NBG's axiom of infinity requires some of the other NBG axioms (see [[Weak axiom of infinity]]).{{efn|Since ZFC's axiom requires the existence of the empty set, an advantage of NBG's axiom is that the axiom of the empty set is not needed. Mendelson's axiom system uses the ZFC's axiom of infinity and also has the axiom of the empty set {{harv|Mendelson|1997|pp=228, 239}}.}}

=== Axiom of global choice ===
The class concept allows NBG to have a stronger axiom of choice than ZFC. A [[choice function]] is a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, defined on a set &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty sets, such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in s.&lt;/math&gt; ZFC's axiom of choice states that for every set of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function. A global choice function is a function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; defined on the class of all nonempty sets such that &lt;math&gt;G(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for every nonempty set &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; The axiom of global choice states that there exists a global choice function. This axiom implies ZFC's axiom of choice since for every set &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty sets, &lt;math&gt;G\vert_s&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;) is a choice function for &lt;math&gt;s.&lt;/math&gt; In 1964, [[William Bigelow Easton|William B. Easton]] proved that global choice is stronger than the axiom of choice by using [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] to construct a [[Model (mathematical logic)|model]] that satisfies the axiom of choice and all the axioms of NBG except the axiom of global choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Easton|1964|pp=56a&amp;ndash;64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The axiom of global choice is equivalent to every class having a well-ordering, while ZFC's axiom of choice is equivalent to every set having a well-ordering.{{efn|For &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; having a well-ordering implying global choice, see [[Implications of the axiom of limitation of size]]. For global choice implying the well-ordering of any class, see {{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=53}}.}}

==History==
[[File:NBG Evolution svg.svg|thumb|400px|History of approaches that led to NBG set theory]]
=== Von Neumann's 1925 axiom system ===
Von Neumann published an introductory article on his axiom system in 1925. In 1928, he provided a detailed treatment of his system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925}}, {{harvnb|von Neumann|1928}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann based his axiom system on two domains of [[Primitive notion|primitive]] objects: functions and arguments. These domains overlap—objects that are in both domains are called argument-functions. Functions correspond to classes in NBG, and argument-functions correspond to sets. Von Neumann's primitive operation is [[function application]], denoted by [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''x''] rather than ''a''(''x'') where ''a'' is a function and ''x'' is an argument. This operation produces an argument. Von Neumann defined classes and sets using functions and argument-functions that take only two values, ''A'' and ''B''. He defined ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''a'' if [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''x'']&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''A''.&lt;ref name=VN1925def /&gt;

Von Neumann's work in set theory was influenced by [[Georg Cantor]]'s articles, [[Zermelo set theory|Ernst Zermelo's 1908 axioms for set theory]], and the 1922 critiques of [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]]'s set theory that were given independently by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]]. Both Fraenkel and Skolem pointed out that Zermelo's axioms cannot prove the existence of the set {''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...} where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[power set]] of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. They then introduced the axiom of replacement, which would guarantee the existence of such sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=369}}. In 1917, [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] published a form of replacement based on cardinal equivalence {{harv|Mirimanoff|1917|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were reluctant to adopt this axiom: Fraenkel stated "that Replacement was too strong an axiom for 'general set theory'", while "Skolem only wrote that 'we could introduce' Replacement".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2012|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann worked on the problems of [[Zermelo set theory]] and provided solutions for some of them:
* '''A theory of ordinals''' 
** Problem: Cantor's theory of [[ordinal number]]s cannot be developed in Zermelo set theory because it lacks the axiom of replacement.{{efn|name=ordinaltheorem|In 1928, von Neumann stated: "A treatment of ordinal number closely related to mine was known to Zermelo in 1916, as I learned subsequently from a personal communication. Nevertheless, the fundamental theorem, according to which to each well-ordered set there is a similar ordinal, could not be rigorously proved because the replacement axiom was unknown." {{harv|Hallett|1984|p=280.}}}} 
** Solution: Von Neumann recovered Cantor's theory by defining the ordinals using sets that are [[well-ordered]] by the ∈-relation,{{efn|{{harvnb|von Neumann|1923}}. Von Neumann's definition also used the theory of well-ordered sets. Later, his definition was simplified to the current one: An ordinal is a [[transitive set]] that is well-ordered by ∈ {{harv|Kunen|1980|p=16}}.}} and by using the axiom of replacement to prove key theorems about the ordinals, such as every well-ordered set is [[order-isomorphic]] with an ordinal.{{efn|name=ordinaltheorem}} In contrast to Fraenkel and Skolem, von Neumann emphasized how important the replacement axiom is for set theory: "In fact, I believe that no theory of ordinals is possible at all without this axiom."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|p=223}} (footnote); English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|p=398 (footnote)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A criterion identifying classes that are too large to be sets''' 
** Problem: Zermelo did not provide such a criterion. His set theory avoids the large classes that lead to the [[Georg Cantor#Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes|paradoxes]], but it leaves out many sets, such as the one mentioned by Fraenkel and Skolem.{{efn|After introducing the [[cumulative hierarchy]], von Neumann could show that Zermelo's axioms do not prove the existence of ordinals α&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω, which include uncountably many [[hereditarily countable set]]s. This follows from Skolem's result that V&lt;sub&gt;ω+ω&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies Zermelo's axioms {{harv|Kanamori|2012|p=61}} and from α&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; implying α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β {{harv|Kunen|1980|pp=95&amp;ndash;96}}. Kunen uses the notation R(β) instead of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;.}} 
** Solution: Von Neumann introduced the criterion: A class is too large to be a set if and only if it can be mapped [[onto]] the class ''V'' of all sets. Von Neumann realized that the set-theoretic paradoxes could be avoided by not allowing such large classes to be members of any class. Combining this restriction with his criterion, he obtained his [[axiom of limitation of size]]: A class ''C'' is not a member of any class if and only if ''C'' can be mapped onto ''V''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallett|1984|pp=288&amp;ndash;290}}. Von Neumann stated his axiom in an equivalent functional form ({{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|p=225}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|p=400}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Finite axiomatization''' 
** Problem: Zermelo had used the imprecise concept of "definite [[propositional function]]" in [[Zermelo set theory#The axioms of Zermelo set theory|his axiom of separation]].
** Solutions: Skolem introduced the [[axiom schema of separation]] that was later used in ZFC, and Fraenkel introduced an equivalent solution. However, Zermelo rejected both approaches "particularly because they implicitly involve the concept of natural number which, in Zermelo's view, should be based upon set theory."{{efn|Fraenkel, ''Historical Introduction'' in {{harvnb|Bernays|1991|p=13}}. Skolem's approach implicitly involves natural numbers because the formulas of an axiom schema are built using [[structural recursion]], which is a generalization of [[mathematical recursion]] over the natural numbers.}} Von Neumann avoided [[axiom schema]]s by formalizing the concept of "definite propositional function" with his functions, whose construction requires only finitely many axioms. This led to his set theory having finitely many axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|pp=224&amp;ndash;226}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|pp=399&amp;ndash;401}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Richard Montague]] proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Montague|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The axiom of regularity''' 
** Problem: Zermelo set theory starts with the empty set and an infinite set, and iterates the axioms of pairing, union, power set, separation, and choice to generate new sets. However, it does not restrict sets to these. For example, it allows sets that are not [[well-founded set|well-founded]], such as a set ''x'' satisfying ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''x''.&lt;ref&gt;Mirimanoff defined well-founded sets in 1917 {{harv|Mirimanoff|1917|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Solutions: Fraenkel introduced an axiom to exclude these sets. Von Neumann analyzed Fraenkel's axiom and stated that it was not "precisely formulated", but it would approximately say: "Besides the sets ... whose existence is absolutely required by the axioms, there are no further sets."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1925|pp=230&amp;ndash;232}}; English translation: {{Harvnb|van&amp;nbsp;Heijenoort|2002b|pp=404&amp;ndash;405}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann proposed the axiom of regularity as a way to exclude non-well-founded sets, but did not include it in his axiom system. In 1930, Zermelo became the first to publish an axiom system that included regularity.{{efn|[[Akihiro Kanamori]] points out that Bernays lectured on his axiom system in 1929-1930 and states that "… he and Zermelo must have arrived at the idea of incorporating Foundation [regularity] almost at the same time." {{harv|Kanamori|2009|pp=53&amp;ndash;54}}. However, Bernays did not publish the part of his axiom system containing regularity until 1941 {{harv|Bernays|1941|p=6}}.}}

=== Von Neumann's 1929 axiom system ===
[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|upright=0.8|John von Neumann]]

In 1929, von Neumann published an article containing the axioms that would lead to NBG. This article was motivated by his concern about the consistency of the axiom of limitation of size. He stated that this axiom "does a lot, actually too much." Besides implying the axioms of separation and replacement, and the [[well-ordering theorem]], it also implies that any class whose [[cardinality]] is less than that of ''V'' is a set. Von Neumann thought that this last implication went beyond Cantorian set theory and concluded: "We must therefore discuss whether its [the axiom's] consistency is not even more problematic than an axiomatization of set theory that does not go beyond the necessary Cantorian framework."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Neumann|1929|p=229}}; {{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=379&amp;ndash;380}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann started his consistency investigation by introducing his 1929 axiom system, which contains all the axioms of his 1925 axiom system except the axiom of limitation of size. He replaced this axiom with two of its consequences, the axiom of replacement and a choice axiom. Von Neumann's choice axiom states: "Every relation ''R'' has a subclass that is a function with the same domain as ''R''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=49, 53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''S'' be von Neumann's 1929 axiom system. Von Neumann introduced the axiom system ''S'' + Regularity (which consists of ''S'' and the axiom of regularity) to demonstrate that his 1925 system is [[relative consistency|consistent relative]] to ''S''. He proved:
# If ''S'' is consistent, then ''S'' + Regularity is consistent.
# ''S'' + Regularity implies the axiom of limitation of size. Since this is the only axiom of his 1925 axiom system that ''S'' + Regularity does not have, ''S'' + Regularity implies all the axioms of his 1925 system. 
These results imply: If ''S'' is consistent, then von Neumann's 1925 axiom system is consistent. Proof: If ''S'' is consistent, then ''S'' + Regularity is consistent (result  1). Using [[proof by contradiction]], assume that the 1925 axiom system is inconsistent, or equivalently: the 1925 axiom system implies a contradiction. Since ''S'' + Regularity implies the axioms of the 1925 system (result 2), ''S'' + Regularity also implies a contradiction. However, this contradicts the consistency of ''S'' + Regularity. Therefore, if ''S'' is consistent, then von Neumann's 1925 axiom system is consistent.

Since ''S'' is his 1929 axiom system, von Neumann's 1925 axiom system is consistent relative to his 1929 axiom system, which is closer to Cantorian set theory. The major differences between Cantorian set theory and the 1929 axiom system are classes and von Neumann's choice axiom. The axiom system ''S'' + Regularity was modified by Bernays and Gödel to produce the equivalent NBG axiom system.

=== Bernays' axiom system ===
[[File:PaulBernays 1949 MFO.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Paul Bernays]]
In 1929, [[Paul Bernays]] started modifying von Neumann's new axiom system by taking classes and sets as primitives. He published his work in a series of articles appearing from 1937 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=48, 58}}. Bernays' articles are reprinted in {{harvnb|Müller|1976|pp=1&amp;ndash;117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernays stated that:

{{quote|The purpose of modifying the von Neumann system is to remain nearer to the structure of the original Zermelo system and to utilize at the same time some of the set-theoretic concepts of the [[Ernst Schröder#Work|Schröder logic]] and of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' which have become familiar to logicians. As will be seen, a considerable simplification results from this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernays|1937|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bernays handled sets and classes in a [[Many-sorted first-order logic|two-sorted logic]] and introduced two membership primitives: one for membership in sets and one for membership in classes. With these primitives, he rewrote and simplified von Neumann's 1929 axioms. Bernays also included the axiom of regularity in his axiom system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=48&amp;ndash;54}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gödel's axiom system (NBG) ===
[[File:Kurt gödel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Kurt Gödel]]
In 1931, Bernays sent a letter containing his set theory to [[Kurt Gödel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|2003|pp=104&amp;ndash;115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel simplified Bernays' theory by making every set a class, which allowed him to use just one sort and one membership primitive. He also weakened some of Bernays' axioms and replaced von Neumann's choice axiom with the equivalent axiom of global choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Proof that von Neumann's axiom implies global choice: Let &lt;math&gt;R = \{(x, y): x \ne \empty \land y \in x\}.&lt;/math&gt; Von Neumann's axiom implies there is a function &lt;math&gt;G \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Dom(G) = Dom(R).&lt;/math&gt; The function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a global choice function since for all nonempty sets &lt;math&gt;x,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;G(x) \in x.&lt;/math&gt; Proof that global choice implies von Neumann's axiom: Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a global choice function, and let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a relation. For &lt;math&gt;x \in Dom(R),&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x) = \text{least}\,\{\alpha: \exists y[(x, y) \in R \cap V_\alpha]\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all sets having [[Rank (set theory)|rank]] less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;z_x = \{y: (x, y) \in R \cap V_{\alpha(x)}\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;F = \{(x, G(z_x)): x \in Dom(R)\}&lt;/math&gt; is a function that satisfies von Neumann's axiom since &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Dom(F) = Dom(R).&lt;/math&gt;}} Gödel used his axioms in his 1940 monograph on the relative consistency of global choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|pp=56&amp;ndash;58}}; {{harvnb|Gödel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reasons have been given for Gödel choosing NBG for his monograph:{{efn|Gödel used von Neumann's 1929 axioms in his 1938 announcement of his relative consistency theorem and stated "A corresponding theorem holds if ''T'' denotes the system of ''Principia mathematica''" {{harv|Gödel|1990|p=26}}. His 1939 sketch of his proof is for Zermelo set theory and ZF {{harv|Gödel|1990|pp=28&amp;ndash;32}}. Proving a theorem in multiple [[formal systems]] was not unusual for Gödel. For example, he proved his [[incompleteness theorem]] for the system of ''Principia mathematica'', but pointed out that it "holds for a wide class of formal systems ..." {{harv|Gödel|1986|p=145}}.}}
* Gödel gave a mathematical reason—NBG's global choice produces a stronger consistency theorem: "This stronger form of the axiom [of choice], if consistent with the other axioms, implies, of course, that a weaker form is also consistent."&lt;ref name=Godelp6 /&gt;
* [[Robert Solovay]] conjectured: "My guess is that he [Gödel] wished to avoid a discussion of the technicalities involved in developing the rudiments of [[model theory]] within axiomatic set theory."{{efn|{{harvnb|Gödel|1990|p=13}}. Gödel's consistency proof builds the [[constructible universe]]. To build this in ZF requires some model theory. Gödel built it in NBG without model theory. For Gödel's construction, see {{harvnb|Gödel|1940|pp=35&amp;ndash;46}} or {{harvnb|Cohen|1966|pp=99&amp;ndash;103}}.}}
* [[Kenneth Kunen]] gave a reason for Gödel avoiding this discussion: "There is also a much more combinatorial approach to '''L''' [the [[constructible universe]]], developed by ... [Gödel in his 1940 monograph] in an attempt to explain his work to non-logicians. ... This approach has the merit of removing all vestiges of logic from the treatment of '''L'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunen|1980|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Parsons (philosopher)|Charles Parsons]] provided a philosophical reason for Gödel's choice: "This view [that 'property of set' is a primitive of set theory] may be reflected in Gödel's choice of a theory with class variables as the framework for ... [his monograph]."{{efn|{{harvnb|Gödel|1990|p=108}}, footnote i. The paragraph containing this footnote discusses why Gödel considered "property of set" a primitive of set theory and how it fit into his [[ontology]]. "Property of set" corresponds to the "class" primitive in NBG.}}

Gödel's achievement together with the details of his presentation led to the prominence that NBG would enjoy for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] proved his [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] proofs for ZF with the help of some tools that Gödel had developed for his relative consistency proofs for NBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ZFC became more popular than NBG.  This was caused by several factors, including the extra work required to handle [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] in NBG,{{efn|{{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=65}}: "Forcing itself went a considerable distance in downgrading any formal theory of classes because of the added encumbrance of having to specify the classes of generic extensions."}} Cohen's 1966 presentation of forcing, which used ZF,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1966|pp=107&amp;ndash;147}}. Cohen also gave a detailed proof of Gödel's relative consistency theorems using ZF {{harv|Cohen|1966|pp=85&amp;ndash;99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the proof that NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC.{{efn|In the 1960s, this conservative extension theorem was proved independently by Paul Cohen, [[Saul Kripke]], and Robert Solovay. In his 1966 book, Cohen mentioned this theorem and stated that its proof requires forcing. It was also proved independently by [[Ronald Jensen]] and Ulrich Felgner, who published his proof in 1971. ({{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=381&amp;ndash;382}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|1966|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Felgner|1971}}.)}}

==NBG, ZFC, and MK==
NBG is not logically equivalent to ZFC because its language is more expressive: it can make statements about classes, which cannot be made in ZFC. However, NBG and ZFC imply the same statements about sets. Therefore, NBG is a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC. NBG implies theorems that ZFC does not imply, but since NBG is a conservative extension, these theorems must involve proper classes. For example, NBG implies that the class ''V'' of all sets can be well-ordered and that every proper class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with ''V''.{{efn|Both theorems follow from the theorem that every proper class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all ordinals. A proof of this theorem is outlined in {{harvnb|Kanamori|2009|p=53}}.}}

One consequence of conservative extension is that ZFC and NBG are [[equiconsistent]]. Proving this uses the [[principle of explosion]]: from a [[contradiction]], everything is provable. Assume that either ZFC or NBG is inconsistent. Then the inconsistent theory implies the contradictory statements ∅&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∅ and ∅&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;∅, which are statements about sets. By the conservative extension property, the other theory also implies these statements. Therefore, it is also inconsistent. So although NBG is more expressive, it is equiconsistent with ZFC. This result together with von Neumann's 1929 relative consistency proof implies that his 1925 axiom system with the axiom of limitation of size is equiconsistent with ZFC. This completely resolves von Neumann's concern about the relative consistency of this powerful axiom since ZFC is within the Cantorian framework.

Even though NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC, a theorem may have a shorter and more elegant proof in NBG than in ZFC (or vice versa). For a survey of known results of this nature, see {{harvnb|Pudlák|1998}}. 

[[Morse–Kelley set theory]] has an axiom schema of class comprehension that includes formulas whose quantifiers range over classes. MK is a stronger theory than NBG because MK proves the consistency of NBG,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mostowski|1950|p=113}}, footnote 11. Footnote references [[Hao Wang (academic)|Wang]]'s NQ set theory, which later evolved into MK.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] implies that NBG cannot prove the consistency of NBG. 

For a discussion of some [[ontology|ontological]] and other philosophical issues posed by NBG, especially when contrasted with ZFC and MK, see Appendix C of {{harvnb|Potter|2004}}.

===Models=== 
ZFC, NBG, and MK have [[ Model (mathematical logic)|model]]s describable in terms of [[the cumulative hierarchy]] ''V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''{{space|hair}} and the [[constructible hierarchy]] ''L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''{{space|hair}}. Let  ''V'' include an [[inaccessible cardinal]] κ and let Def(''X'') denote the Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; definable subsets of ''X'' (see [[constructible universe]]). Then:
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; are models of [[ZFC]].
* Def(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;) is a model of Mendelson's version of NBG, which replaces global choice by ordinary choice. Def(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;) is not necessarily a model of NBG since global choice might fail.
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, where κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[successor cardinal]] of κ, is a model of NBG.
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ+1&lt;/sub&gt; is a model of MK, which implies that it is also a model of NBG.

==Category theory==
The ontology of NBG provides scaffolding for speaking about "large objects" without risking paradox. For instance, in some developments of [[category theory]], a "[[large category]]" is defined as one whose [[object (category theory)|object]]s and [[morphism]]s make up a proper class. On the other hand, a "small category" is one whose objects and morphisms are members of a set. Thus, we can speak of the "[[category of all sets]]" or "[[category of all small categories]]" without risking paradox since NBG supports large categories. 

However, NBG does not support a "category of all categories" since large categories would be members of it and NBG does not allow proper classes to be members of anything. An ontological extension that enables us to talk formally about such a "category" is the [[Conglomerate (set theory)|conglomerate]], which is a collection of classes. Then the "category of all categories" is defined by its objects: the conglomerate of all categories; and its morphisms: the conglomerate of all morphisms from ''A'' to ''B'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adámek|Herrlich|Strecker|2004|pp=15&amp;ndash;16, 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On whether an ontology including classes as well as sets is adequate for category theory, see {{harvnb|Muller|2001}}.

The '''World Conference on Human Rights''' was held by the United Nations in Vienna, Austria, on 14 to 25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"&gt;{{cite book | last=Norchi | first=Charles | chapter=Human Rights: A Global Common Interest | editor=Krasno, Jean E. | title=The United Nations: Confronting the Challenges of a Global Society | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=2004 | isbn=1-58826-280-4 | page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first human rights conference held since the end of the [[Cold War]].  The main result of the conference was the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]].

==Background==
Although the United Nations had long been active in the field of human rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/humanrightsun/2008/12/20081278493266190.html | title=Timeline: Human Rights Conventions | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vienna conference was only the second global conference to focus exclusively on human rights, with the first having been the [[International Conference on Human Rights]] held in [[Teheran]], [[Iran]], during April–May 1968 to mark the twentieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/l2ptichr.htm | title=Proclamation of Tehran, Final Act of the International Conference on Human Rights, Teheran, 22 April to 13 May 1968 | publisher=U.N. Doc. A/CONF. 32/41 at 3 (1968) via [[University of Minnesota]] Human Rights Library | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna conference came at a time when world conferences were popular, with the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] having been held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, in June 1992, and the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], soon following in September 1994.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt; More conferences would follow after that, including the [[Commission for Social Development|World Summit for Social Development]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995 and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, China, in September 1995.  Such conferences were seen as a way to promote global participation, consultation, and policy formation, and were seen as a likely significant new way to influence the direction of international society.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;

The notion of having a world conference on human rights was first proposed in 1989.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt; The end of the [[Cold War]] brought about the hope that the long stalemate and distortion of United Nations behaviors due to the bipolar superpower confrontation would cease.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;  

In the run-up to the 1993 conference, much of the optimism of the 1989 era was lost.&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; Preparatory conferences were held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, beginning in 1991, as were a number of regional and satellite meetings.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; These struggled to produce new ideas that countries could agree upon,&lt;ref name="nyt042593"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/world/a-bleak-assessment-as-rights-meeting-nears.html | title=A Bleak Assessment as Rights Meeting Nears | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=25 April 1993 | pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted differences surrounding the role of state sovereignty, [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), and whether new or strengthened human rights instruments for the UN were feasible and impartial.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; The [[United Nations General Assembly]] was eventually forced to decide upon the conference's agenda in 1992.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; [[Pierre Sané]], the Secretary General of [[Amnesty International]], was concerned that conference might represent a backwards step for human rights.&lt;ref name="nyt042593"/&gt; He added, "It's not surprising that governments are not overenthusiastic. After all, they are the ones violating human rights."&lt;ref name="nyt042593"/&gt;

==Conference==
The World Conference on Human Rights was attended by representatives of 171 nations and 800 NGOs, with some 7,000 participants overall.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt; This made it the largest gathering ever on human rights.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"&gt;{{cite book | last=Boyle | first=Kevin | authorlink=Kevin Boyle (lawyer)| chapter=Stock-Taking on Human Rights: The World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna 1993 | editor=Beetham, David | title=Politics and Human Rights | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-631-19666-8 | page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organised by Human Rights expert John Pace.

There was much discussion ahead of the conference on what could and could not be said during it.  The rules adopted stated that no specific countries or places could be mentioned where human rights abuses were taking place, including those involved in current conflicts such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Angola]], and [[Liberia]], and those subject to ongoing human rights criticism, such as China and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="nyt061493"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/world/a-rights-meeting-but-don-t-mention-the-wronged.html | title=A Rights Meeting, but Don't Mention the Wronged | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=14 June 1993 | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-81"&gt;Boyle, "Stock-Taking on Human Rights", p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, human rights abuses were to be discussed in the abstract only; this led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to state that the conference was taking place "In an atmosphere strangely removed from reality."&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt; In particular, that the ongoing [[Bosnian War]] was taking place only an hour's flight from Vienna testified dramatically that no new era of international cooperation had come into place.&lt;ref name="boyle-80"&gt;Boyle, "Stock-Taking on Human Rights", p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the rules, organizations and demonstrators at the conference's physical site were happy to mention specific ongoing abuses all around the world, with many displaying atrocity photographs in an attempt to out-do each other.&lt;ref name="nyt061693"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/world/women-seize-focus-at-rights-forum.html | title=Women Seize Focus at Rights Forum | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=16 June 1993 | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person concerned about the [[Polisario Front]] and [[Western Sahara]] situation said, "It's hard to be noticed."&lt;ref name="nyt061693"/&gt;

The conference did have an expansive view of human rights, with efforts made to highlight [[women's rights]], [[indigenous peoples]]' rights, [[minority rights]], and more in the context of universal political and economic rights.&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt; Women's rights in particular gained a strong and effective presence at the conference.&lt;ref name="nyt061693"/&gt;

One fault line at the conference was Western nations who proclaimed a [[moral universalism|universal meaning]] to human rights versus nations who said that human rights needed to be interpreted differently in non-Western cultures and that attempts to impose a universal definition amounted to interference in their internal affairs.&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt061593"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/world/us-rejects-notion-that-human-rights-vary-with-culture.html | title=U.S. Rejects Notion That Human Rights Vary With Culture | author=Sciolino, Elaine | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=15 June 1993 | page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter group was led by China, [[Syria]] and [[Iran]], and also included a number of Asian nations such as Singapore, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="nyt061593"/&gt; On the opening day of the conference, U.S. Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]] spoke out strongly against this notion, saying "We cannot let [[cultural relativism]] become the last refuge of [[oppression|repression]]."&lt;ref name="nyt061593"/&gt;

Former [[U.S. House of Representatives]] member and vice presidential candidate [[Geraldine Ferraro]] attended the conference as the alternate U.S. delegate,&lt;ref name="fox-bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34759,00.html | title=Geraldine Ferraro – Bio | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=5 September 2003 | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the attendees heavily interested in women's rights aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/opinion/human-rights-for-women.html | title=Human Rights for Women | author=[[Geraldine Ferraro|Ferraro, Geraldine]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=10 June 1993 | page=A27 op-ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of pressures from the People's Republic of China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/f9e14159ae1b90f8c125690a005ab864?Opendocument Lettre datée du 24 juin 1993, adressée au Président de la Conférence mondiale sur les droits de l'homme par le Chef adjoint de la délégation chinoise]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[14th Dalai Lama]] was able to give a talk at the conference on [[human responsibilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Antoine Donnet]], ''Tibet mort ou vif'', Édition Gallimard, 1990 ; Nouv. éd. augmentée 1993, {{ISBN|2-07-032802-3}} (''Tibet: Survival in Question'', traduction Tica Broch, Oxford/Zed Books, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-563573-6}}, {{ISBN|1-85649-130-7}}, {{ISBN|1-85649-129-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetibet.org/about/dalai5 A speech given by His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna, Austria, June 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
{{Main|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action}}
The key result of the World Conference on Human Rights was the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], which was formulated late in the meeting&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt; and was adopted by consensus of 171 states on 25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; While one possible interpretation sees this document as a "well crafted but empty exhortation", it did come to represent as much of a consensus as could be found on human rights in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt; And it did in fact set new marks in human rights work in several areas.  It established the interdependence of democracy, economic development, and human rights.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; Specifically, it replaced the Cold War division of Civil and Political Rights (CPR) apart from Economic Social and Cultural rights (ESCR) with the concept of rights being indivisible (you cannot take one type of rights without the other), interdependent (one set of rights needs the other to be realised), and inter-related (that all human rights relate to each other).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part I, para 5&lt;/ref&gt; It called for the creation of instruments to publicize and protect the rights of women, children, and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; It requested more funding for the [[United Nations Center for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="norchi-88"&gt;Norchi, "Human Rights: A Global Common Interest", p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most significantly, it called for a new office, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] subsequently endorsed the declaration as part of Resolution 48/121.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; It also created the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 20 December 1993.

By the early 2000s, all of the explicit establishments recommended by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had been met in full or in part.&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt; The conference also highlighted the importance that NGOs would continue to play in the human rights infrastructure.&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt;

'''Ātman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|m|ən}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means inner [[self]] or [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/atman Atman], Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press (2012), '''Quote''': "1. real self of the individual; 2. a person's soul";&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' John Bowker (2000), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192800947}}, See entry for Atman;&lt;br&gt;'''[c]''' WJ Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198610250}}, See entry for Atman (self).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenatman&gt;David Lorenzen (2004), The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415215277}}, pages 208-209, '''Quote''': "Advaita and nirguni movements, on the other hand, stress an interior mysticism in which the devotee seeks to discover the identity of individual soul (atman) with the universal ground of being (brahman) or to find god within himself".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, page 63; '''Quote''': "Even though Buddhism explicitly rejected the Hindu ideas of Atman (“soul”) and Brahman, Hinduism treats Sakyamuni Buddha as one of the ten avatars of Vishnu."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]], especially in the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hinduism]], Ātman is the [[first principle]],&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A. S. The Philosophy of the Upanishads. Cosimo Classics (June 1, 2010). P. 86. {{ISBN|1616402407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''true'' self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. In order to attain [[Moksha|liberation (moksha)]], a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma [[jnana]]), which is to realize that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenatman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard King (1995), Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425138}}, page 64, '''Quote:''' "Atman as the innermost essence or soul of man, and Brahman as the innermost essence and support of the universe. (...) Thus we can see in the Upanishads, a tendency towards a convergence of microcosm and macrocosm, culminating in the equating of atman with Brahman".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu philosophy|six orthodox schools of Hinduism]] believe that there is Ātman (soul, self) in every being.  This is a major point of difference with the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] doctrine of [[Anatta]] which holds that there is no unchanging soul or self.&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref name=4sources&gt;KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence."; Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'', pages 2-4; Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist ‘No-Self’ Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], Philosophy Now&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne (2011), ''The ātman and its negation'', Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 33, Number 1–2, pp. 103–105, '''Quote''': "The denial that a human being possesses a "self" or "soul" is probably the most famous Buddhist teaching. It is certainly its most distinct, as has been pointed out by G. P. Malalasekera: "In its denial of any real permanent Soul or Self, Buddhism stands alone." A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by Walpola Rahula: "Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self or Ātman." The "no Self" or "no soul" doctrine (Sanskrit: anātman; Pāli: anattan) is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance. It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism (the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins), and has persisted without change into the modern era. [...] both views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of Mahasi Sayadaw that "there is no person or soul" and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that "[t]he Buddha taught that … our belief in an independent self is the root cause of all suffering"."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ātman" (Atma, आत्मा, आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word which means "essence, breath, soul."&lt;ref name=dougharper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Dalal (2011), The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143415176}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *etmen (a root meaning "breath"; cognates:  Dutch ''adem'', Old High German ''atum'' "breath," Modern German ''atmen'' "to breathe" and ''Atem'' "respiration, breath", Old English ''eþian'').&lt;ref name=dougharper&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=atman Atman] Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the concept==

===Vedas===
The earliest use of word "Ātman" in [[Indian literature|Indian texts]] is found in the [[Rig Veda]] (RV X.97.11).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.९७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.९७], Wikisource; Quote: "यदिमा वाजयन्नहमोषधीर्हस्त आदधे । '''आत्मा''' यक्ष्मस्य नश्यति पुरा जीवगृभो यथा ॥११॥&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yāska]], the ancient Indian grammarian, commenting on this Rigvedic verse, accepts the following meanings of Ātman: the pervading principle, the organism in which other elements are united and the ultimate sentient principle.&lt;ref&gt;Baumer, Bettina and Vatsyayan, Kapila. Kalatattvakosa Vol. 1: Pervasive Terms Vyapti (Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts). Motilal Banarsidass; Revised edition (March 1, 2001).

Other hymns of Rig Veda where the word Ātman appears include I.115.1, VII.87.2, VII.101.6, VIII.3.24, IX.2.10, IX.6.8, and X.168.4.&lt;ref&gt;Source 1: [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/index.htm Rig veda] Sanskrit;&lt;br&gt;Source 2: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेदः/संहिता ऋग्वेदः/संहिता] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upanishads===
Ātman is a central idea in all of the [[Upanishads]], and "know your Ātman" is their thematic focus.&lt;ref name=ptraju&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; These texts state that the core of every person's self is not the body, nor the mind, nor the ego, but "Ātman", which means "soul" or "self".&lt;ref&gt;"Soul" is synonymous with "self" in translations of ancient texts of Hindu philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Atman is the spiritual essence in all creatures, their real innermost essential being.&lt;ref name=alicebailey&gt;Alice Bailey (1973), The Soul and Its Mechanism, {{ISBN|978-0853301158}}, pages 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran (2007), The Upanishads, Nilgiri Press, {{ISBN|978-1586380212}}, pages 38-39, 318-320&lt;/ref&gt; It is eternal, it is the essence, it is ageless. Atman is that which one is at the deepest level of one's existence.

====''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad''====
The ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' describes Atman as that in which everything exists, which is of the highest value, which permeates everything, which is the essence of all, bliss and beyond description.&lt;ref&gt;Raju, Poolla Tirupati. Structural Depths of Indian Thought. SUNY Series in Philosophy. P. 26. {{ISBN|0-88706-139-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In hymn 4.4.5, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes Atman as Brahman (universal absolute; supreme soul), and associates it with everything one is, everything one can be, one's free will, one's desire, what one does, what one doesn't do, the good in oneself, the bad in oneself.
{{quote|That ''Atman'' (self, soul) is indeed Brahman. It [Ātman] is also identified with the intellect, the Manas (mind), and the vital breath, with the eyes and ears, with earth, water, air, and ākāśa (sky), with fire and with what is other than fire, with desire and the absence of desire, with anger and the absence of anger, with righteousness and unrighteousness, with everything — it is identified, as is well known, with this (what is perceived) and with that (what is inferred).

As it [Ātman, self, soul] does and acts, so it becomes: by doing good it becomes good, and by doing evil it becomes evil. It becomes virtuous through good acts, and vicious through evil acts. Others, however, say, "The self is identified with desire alone. What it desires, so it resolves; what it resolves, so is its deed; and what deed it does, so it reaps.|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5, 9th century BCE&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Original: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/brinew-proofed.html?lang=sa बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद्] मन्त्र ५ [IV.iv.5], Sanskrit Documents;&lt;br /&gt;'''Translation 1''': [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n739/mode/2up Brihadāranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5]  Madhavananda (Translator), page 712;&lt;br /&gt;'''Translation 2''': [https://archive.org/stream/The_Brihad_aranyaka_upanishad_Sankarabhashya_English/The_brihad_aranyaka_upanishad-SankarabhashyaEnglishforChapter1Only-1849#page/n243/mode/2up Brihadāranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5]  Eduard Roer (Translator), page 235&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This theme of Ātman, that is soul and self of oneself, every person, every being is the same as Brahman, is extensively repeated in Brihadāranyaka Upanishad. The Upanishad asserts that this knowledge of "I am Brahman", and that there is no difference between "I" and "you", or "I" and "him" is a source of liberation, and not even gods can prevail over such a liberated man. For example, in hymn 1.4.10,&lt;ref name=bu1410/&gt;

{{quote|
Brahman was this before; therefore it knew even the Ātma (soul, himself). I am Brahman, therefore it became all. And whoever among the gods had this enlightenment, also became That. It is the same with the sages, the same with men. Whoever knows the self as “I am Brahman,” becomes all this universe. Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their Ātma. Now, if a man worships another god, thinking: “He is one and I am another,” he does not know. He is like an animal to the gods. As many animals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes anguish; how much more so when many are taken away? Therefore it is not pleasing to the gods that men should know this.

====''Katha Upanishad''====
Along with the ''Brihadāranyaka'', all the earliest and middle Upanishads discuss Ātman as they build their theories to answer how man can achieve liberation, freedom and bliss. The ''[[Katha Upanishad]]'', for example, explains Atman as immanent and transcendent innermost essence of each human being and living creature, that this is one, even though the external forms of living creatures manifest in different forms, for example, in hymns 2.2.9 and others, its states

{{quote|As the one fire, after it has entered the world, though one, takes different forms according to whatever it burns,&lt;br /&gt;
so does the internal Ātman of all living beings, though one, takes a form according to whatever He enters and is outside all forms.

Katha Upanishad, in Book 1, hymns 3.3 to 3.4, describes the widely cited analogy of chariot for the relation of "Soul, Self" to body, mind and senses.&lt;ref name=kathaup2&gt;Sanskrit Original: आत्मानँ रथितं विद्धि शरीरँ रथमेव तु । बुद्धिं तु सारथिं विद्धि मनः प्रग्रहमेव च ॥ ३ ॥ इन्द्रियाणि हयानाहुर्विषयाँ स्तेषु गोचरान् । आत्मेन्द्रियमनोयुक्तं भोक्तेत्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ ४ ॥, [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कठोपनिषद् Katha Upanishad] Wikisource;&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: Max Müller, [https://archive.org/stream/SacredBooksEastVariousOrientalScholarsWithIndex.50VolsMaxMuller/15.SacredBooksEast.VarOrSch.v15.Muller.Hindu.Mull.Upanishads.p2.KathMundTait..Mait.Oxf.1884.#page/n71/mode/2up Katha Upanishad] Third Valli, Verse 3 &amp; 4 and through 15, pages 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Kaplan&lt;ref name=stevekaplan&gt;Stephen Kaplan (2011), The Routledge Companion to Religion and Science, (Editors: James W. Haag, Gregory R. Peterson, Michael L. Speziopage), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415492447}}, page 323&lt;/ref&gt; translates these hymns as, "Know the Self as the rider in a chariot, and the body as simply the chariot. Know the intellect as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. The senses, they say are the horses, and sense objects are the paths around them". The Katha Upanishad then declares that "when the Self [Ātman] understands this and is unified, integrated with body, senses and mind, is virtuous, mindful and pure, he reaches bliss, freedom and liberation".&lt;ref name=kathaup2/&gt;

====''Chandogya Upanishad''====
The ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' explains Ātman as that which appears to be separate between two living beings but isn't, that essence and innermost, true, radiant self of all individuals which connects and unifies all. In hymn 4.10.1 through 4.10.3, for example, it explains it with example of rivers, some of which flow to the east and some to the west, but ultimately all merge into the ocean and become one. In the same way, the individual souls are pure being, states the ''Chandogya Upanishad''; an individual soul is pure truth, and an individual soul is a manifestation of the ocean of one universal soul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], Upanishads, Wordsworth, {{ISBN|978-1840221022}}, pages XXIII-XXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Upanishads====
Ātman is a key topic of the Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some teach that Brahman (highest reality; universal principle; being-consciousness-bliss) is identical with Ātman, while others teach that Ātman is part of Brahman but not identical to it.&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|B0QzAQAAMAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads}}, Dover Publications, pages 86-111, 182-212&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient debate flowered into various dual and non-dual theories in Hinduism. The [[Brahmasutra]] by Badarayana (~100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects, particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different (advaita).&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt; This synthesis overcame the dualistic tradition of Samkhya-Yoga schools and realism-driven traditions of Nyaya-Vaiseshika schools, enabling it to become the foundation of Vedanta as Hinduism's enduring spiritual tradition.&lt;ref name=johnkoller&gt;John Koller (2012), Shankara, in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
All major orthodox schools of Hinduism –Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta– accept the foundational premise of the Vedas and Upanishads that "Ātman exists". [[Ātman (Jainism)|Jainism]] too accepts this premise, though it has its own idea of what that means. In contrast, both Buddhism and the [[Charvaka]]s deny that there is anything called "Ātman/soul/self".&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt;

Knowing Ātman, also referred to as self-knowledge, is one of the defining themes of all major orthodox schools of Hinduism, but they diverge on how. In Hinduism, self-knowledge is the knowledge and understanding of Atman, what it is, and what it is not. Hinduism considers Atman as distinct from the ever-evolving individual personality characterized with ''Ahamkara'' (ego, non-spiritual psychological I-ness Me-ness), habits, prejudices, desires, impulses, delusions, fads, behaviors, pleasures, sufferings and fears. Human personality and ''Ahamkara'' shift, evolve or change with time, state the schools of Hinduism; while, Atman doesn't.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt; Atman, state these schools, is the unchanging, eternal, innermost radiant self that is unaffected by personality, unaffected by ego of oneself, unaffected by ego of others; Atman is that which is ever-free, never-bound, one that seeks, realizes and is the realized purpose, meaning, liberation in life.&lt;ref&gt;James Hart (2009), Who One Is: Book 2: Existenz and Transcendental Phenomenology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1402091773}}, pages 2-3, 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (2012), The Heart of Wisdom: A Philosophy of Spiritual Life, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1442221161}}, pages 125-131&lt;/ref&gt; Puchalski states, "the ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to transcend individually, to realize one's own true nature", the inner essence of oneself, which is divine and pure.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Puchalski (2006), A Time for Listening and Caring, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195146820}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedanta school===
Philosophical schools such as [[Advaita]] (non-dualism) see the "spirit/soul/self" within each living entity as being fully identical with [[Brahman]]– the universal soul.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt; The Advaita school believes that there is one soul that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, and there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (Atman), no separate god soul (Brahman).&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86&lt;/ref&gt; The oneness unifies all beings, there is divine in every being, and that all existence is a single reality, state the Advaita Vedanta Hindus. In contrast, devotional sub-schools of Vedanta such as [[Dvaita]] (dualism) differentiate between the individual Atma in living beings, and the supreme Atma ([[Paramatma]]) as being separate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavata Purana]] [http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en 3.28.41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/19-20/en1 Bhagavata Purana 7.7.19–20] ""Atma" also refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities. Both of them are spiritual."&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual.&lt;ref name=aramb&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 47, 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; To Advaitins, the Atman is the Brahman, the Brahman is the Atman, each self is non-different from the infinite.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta, Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803107}}, pages 510-512&lt;/ref&gt; Atman is the universal principle, one eternal undifferentiated self-luminous consciousness, the truth asserts Advaita Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;S Timalsina (2014), Consciousness in Indian Philosophy: The Advaita Doctrine of ‘Awareness Only’, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415762236}}, pages 3-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, pages 48-53&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings, in a state of unawareness of this universal self, see their "I-ness" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 114-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adi Sankara, A Bouquet of Nondual Texts: Advaita Prakarana Manjari, Translators: Ramamoorthy &amp; Nome, {{ISBN|978-0970366726}}, pages 173-214&lt;/ref&gt; To Advaitins, Atman-knowledge is the state of full awareness, liberation, and freedom that overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others, and in all living beings; the non-dual oneness, that God is in everything, and everything is God.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref name=aramb/&gt; This identification of individual living beings/souls, or jiva-atmas, with the 'one Atman' is the non-dualistic [[Advaita Vedanta]] position.

The [[monism|monist]], non-dual conception of existence in Advaita Vedanta is not accepted by the dualistic/theistic [[Dvaita Vedanta]]. Dvaita Vedanta calls the Atman of a supreme being as ''"[[Paramatman]]"'', and holds it to be different from individual Atman. Dvaita scholars assert that God is the ultimate, complete, perfect, but distinct soul, one that is separate from incomplete, imperfect ''jivas'' (individual souls).&lt;ref&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt; The Advaita sub-school believes that self-knowledge leads to liberation in this life, while the Dvaita sub-school believes that liberation is only possible in after-life as communion with God, and only through the grace of God (if not, then one's Atman is reborn).&lt;ref&gt;James Lewis and William Travis (1999), Religious Traditions of the World, {{ISBN|978-1579102302}}, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt; God created individual souls, state Dvaita Vedantins, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.&lt;ref name=tompad&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt; The Dvaita school, therefore, in contrast to monistic position of Advaita, advocates a version of monotheism wherein [[Brahman]] is made synonymous with [[Vishnu]] (or Narayana), distinct from numerous individual Atmans. Dvaita school, states Graham Oppy, is not strict monotheism, as it does not deny existence of other gods and their respective Atman.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2014), Describing Gods, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107087040}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedanta sub-schools of [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] and [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] combine ideas about Ātman from dual and non-dual schools.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Ātman, in the ritualism-based [[Mīmāṃsā]] school of Hinduism, is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active essence that is identified as I-consciousness.&lt;ref name=ptraju2&gt;PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chrisbartley&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other schools of Hinduism, Mimamsaka scholars considered ego and Atman as the same. Within Mimamsa school, there was divergence of beliefs. Kumārila, for example, believed that Atman is the object of I-consciousness, whereas Prabhakara believed that Atman is the subject of I-consciousness.&lt;ref name=ptraju2/&gt; Mimamsaka Hindus believed that what matters is virtuous actions and rituals completed with perfection, and it is this that creates merit and imprints knowledge on Atman, whether one is aware or not aware of Atman. Their foremost emphasis was formulation and understanding of laws/duties/virtuous life ([[dharma]]) and consequent perfect execution of ''kriyas'' (actions). The Upanishadic discussion of Atman, to them, was of secondary importance.&lt;ref name=chrisbartley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt; While other schools disagreed and discarded the Atma theory of Mimamsa, they incorporated Mimamsa theories on ethics, self-discipline, action, and dharma as necessary in one's journey toward knowing one's Atman.&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 54-63; Michael C. Brannigan (2009), Striking a Balance: A Primer in Traditional Asian Values, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0739138465}}, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaiśeṣika school===
The [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism, using its non-theistic theories of atomistic [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], posits that Ātman is one of the four eternal non-physical&lt;ref&gt;The school posits that there are five physical substances: earth, water, air, water and ''akasa'' (ether/sky/space beyond air)&lt;/ref&gt; substances without attributes, the other three being ''kala'' (time), ''dik'' (space) and ''manas'' (mind).&lt;ref name=sarachmo&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore (Eds., 1973), A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1973, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 386-423&lt;/ref&gt; Time and space, stated Vaiśeṣika scholars, are ''eka'' (one), ''nitya'' (eternal) and ''vibhu'' (all pervading). Time and space are indivisible reality, but human mind prefers to divide them to comprehend past, present, future, relative place of other substances and beings, direction and its own coordinates in the universe. In contrast to these characteristics of time and space, Vaiśeṣika scholars considered Ātman to be many, eternal, independent and spiritual substances that cannot be reduced or inferred from other three non-physical and five physical ''dravya'' (substances).&lt;ref name=sarachmo/&gt; Mind and sensory organs are instruments, while consciousness is the domain of "atman, soul, self".&lt;ref name=sarachmo/&gt;

The knowledge of Ātman, to Vaiśeṣika Hindus, is another knowledge without any "bliss" or "consciousness" moksha state that Vedanta and Yoga school describe.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt;

===Nyaya school===
Early atheistic [[Nyaya]] scholars, and later theistic Nyaya scholars, both made substantial contributions to the systematic study of Ātman.&lt;ref name=johnplott2/&gt; They posited that even though "self/soul" is intimately related to the knower, it can still be the subject of knowledge. John Plott&lt;ref name=johnplott2&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Nyaya scholars developed a theory of negation that far exceeds [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s theory of [[negation]], while their epistemological theories refined to "know the knower" at least equals Aristotle's sophistication. Nyaya methodology influenced all major schools of Hinduism.

The Nyaya scholars defined Ātman as an imperceptible substance that is the substrate of human consciousness, manifesting itself with or without qualities such as desires, feelings, perception, knowledge, understanding, errors, insights, sufferings, bliss, and others.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KK Chakrabarti (1999), Classical Indian Philosophy of Mind: The Nyaya Dualist Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791441718}}, pages 2, 187-188, 220&lt;/ref&gt; Nyaya school not only developed its theory of Atman, it contributed to Hindu philosophy in a number of ways. To the Hindu theory of Ātman, the contributions of Nyaya scholars were twofold. One, they went beyond holding it as "self evident" and offered rational proofs, consistent with their epistemology, in their debates with Buddhists, that "Atman exists".&lt;ref name=nyayaexamples/&gt; Second, they developed theories on what "Atman is and is not".&lt;ref name=royperrett&gt;Roy W. Perrett (Editor, 2000), Indian Philosophy: Metaphysics, Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|978-0815336082}}, page xvii; also see Chakrabarti pages 279-292&lt;/ref&gt; As proofs for the proposition "self/soul exists", for example, Nyaya scholars argued that personal recollections and memories of the form "I did this so many years ago" implicitly presume that there is a self that is substantial, continuing, unchanged, and existent.&lt;ref name=nyayaexamples&gt;See example discussed in this section; For additional examples of Nyaya reasoning to prove that "soul exists", using propositions and its theories of negation, see: [https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n39/mode/2up Nyayasutra] verses 1.2.1 on pages 14-15, 1.2.59 on page 20, 3.1.1-3.1.27 on pages 63-69, and later chapters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royperrett/&gt;

[[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyayasutra]], a 2nd-century CE foundational text of Nyaya school of Hinduism, states that the soul is a proper object of human knowledge. It also states that soul is a real substance that can be inferred from certain signs, objectively perceivable attributes. For example, in book 1, chapter 1, verses 9 and 10, Nyayasutra states&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;

{{Quote|
''Ātman'', body, senses, objects of senses, intellect, mind, activity, error, ''pretyabhava'' (after life), fruit, suffering and bliss are the objects of right knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
Desire, aversion, effort, happiness, suffering and cognition are the ''Linga'' (लिङ्ग, mark, sign) of the ''Ātman''.
|Nyaya Sutra|I.1.9-10&lt;ref name=elisa&gt;Original Sanskrit: [https://archive.org/details/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series Nyayasutra] Anand Ashram Sanskrit Granthvali, pages 26-28;&lt;br&gt;English translation 1: [https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n29/mode/2up Nyayasutra] see verses 1.1.9 and 1.1.10 on pages 4-5;&lt;br&gt;English translation 2: Elisa Freschi (2014), Puspika: Tracing Ancient India Through Texts and Traditions, (Editors: Giovanni Ciotti, Alastair Gornall, Paolo Visigalli), Oxbow, {{ISBN|978-1782974154}}, pages 56-73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In book 2, chapter 1, verses 1 to 23, Nyayasutras text posits that the sensory act of looking is different than perception and cognition, that perception and knowledge arise from the seekings and actions of Ātman (soul).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n47/mode/2up Nyayasutra] see pages 22-29&lt;/ref&gt; Naiyayikas emphasize that Ātman has qualities, but is different than its qualities. For example, desire is one of many quality of Ātman in Nyaya school, but they state that Ātman need not always have desire, and in the state of liberation, for instance, Atman is without desire.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt; Atman is the object, and the conventional "I, me" is one of its subjects, to Nyaya school.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;

===Samkhya school===
The concept of Ātman in [[Samkhya]], the oldest school of Hinduism, is quite similar to one in Advaita Vedanta school. Both Samkhya and Advaita consider the ego (asmita, [[ahamkara]]) rather than the Ātman to be the cause of pleasure and pain.&lt;ref&gt;Paranjpe, A. C. Self and Identity in Modern Psychology and Indian Thought. Springer; 1 edition (September 30, 1998). P. 263-264. {{ISBN|978-0-306-45844-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They both consider Ātman as self, soul that is innermost essence of any individual being. Further, they both consider self-knowledge as the means of liberation, freedom and bliss. The difference between Samkhya and Advaita is that Samkhya holds there are as many ''Atmans'' as there are beings, each distinct reality unto itself, and self-knowledge a state of Ipseity. In contrast, the monism theme of Advaita holds that there is one soul, and that the self of all beings are connected and unified with Brahman.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt; The essence and spirit of everything is related to each self, asserts Advaita Vedanta, and each Atman is related to the essence and spirit of everything; all is one; self is Brahman and Brahman is self. Samkhya asserts that each being's Atman is unique and different.&lt;ref name=johnplott&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga school===
The Yogasutra of Patanjali, the foundational text of [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, mentions ''Atma'' in multiple verses, and particularly in its last book, where Samadhi is described as the path to self-knowledge and [[moksha|kaivalya]]. Some earlier mentions of Atman in Yogasutra include verse 2.5, where evidence of ignorance includes "confusing what is not Atman as Atman".

{{quote|
अनित्याशुचिदुःखा'''नात्म'''सु नित्यशुचिसु'''खात्म'''ख्यातिरविद्या

Avidya (अविद्या, ignorance) is regarding the transient as eternal, the impure as pure, the pain-giving as joy-giving, and the non-Atman as Atman.
|Yogasutra 2.5&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;

* '''Translation 3''': [https://archive.org/stream/yogasutrasofpata00pata#page/n5/mode/2up The Yogasutras of Patanjali] Charles Johnston (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In verses 2.19-2.20, Yogasutra declares that pure ideas are the domain of the soul, the perceivable universe exists to enlighten the soul, but while the soul is pure, it may be deceived by complexities of perception or its intellect. These verses also set the purpose of all experience as a means to self-knowledge.

{{quote|
द्रष्टा दृशिमात्रः शुद्धोऽपि प्रत्ययानुपश्यः&lt;br&gt;
तदर्थ एव दृश्यस्यात्मा

The seer (soul) is the absolute knower. Though pure, modifications are witnessed by him by coloring of intellect.&lt;br&gt;
The spectacle exists only to serve the purpose of the Atman.
|Yogasutra 2.19 - 2.20&lt;ref name=pyogas3t/&gt;}}

In Book 4, Yogasutra states spiritual liberation as the stage where the yogin achieves distinguishing self-knowledge, he no longer confuses his mind as his soul, the mind is no longer affected by afflictions or worries of any kind, ignorance vanishes, and "pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature".&lt;ref name=pyogas3t/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verses 4.24-4.34, Patanjali's Yogasutras; Quote: "विशेषदर्शिन '''आत्म'''भावभावनाविनिवृत्तिः"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoga school is similar to the Samkhya school in its conceptual foundations of Ātman. It is the self that is discovered and realized in the Kaivalya state, in both schools. Like Samkhya, this is not a single universal Ātman. It is one of the many individual selves where each "pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature", as a unique distinct soul/self.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Phillips, ''Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "new Logic".'' Open Court Publishing, 1995, pages 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yoga school's methodology was widely influential on other schools of Hindu philosophy. Vedanta monism, for example, adopted Yoga as a means to reach ''Jivanmukti'' – self-realization in this life – as conceptualized in Advaita Vedanta.

==Influence of Atman theory on Hindu Ethics==
[[File:Non violence sculpture by carl fredrik reutersward malmo sweden.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Ahimsa]], non-violence, is considered the highest ethical value and virtue in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0123739858}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701-849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; The virtue of Ahimsa follows from the Atman theories of Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NF Gier (1995), Ahimsa, the Self, and Postmodernism, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 35, Issue 1, pages 71-86, {{doi|10.5840/ipq199535160}};&lt;br&gt;Jean Varenne (1977), Yoga and the Hindu Tradition, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226851167}}, page 200-202&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Atman theory in Upanishads had a profound impact on ancient ethical theories and dharma traditions now known as Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ludwig&gt;Ludwig Alsdorf (2010), The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415548243}}, pages 111-114&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Dharmaśāstra#The meaning and sources of Dharma|Dharmasutras]] of Hindus recite Atman theory from the Vedic texts and Upanishads,&lt;ref&gt;These ancient texts of India refer to Upanishads and Vedic era texts some of which have been traced to preserved documents, but some are lost or yet to be found.&lt;/ref&gt; and on its foundation build precepts of dharma, laws and ethics. Atman theory, particularly the Advaita Vedanta and Yoga versions, influenced the emergence of the theory of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence against all creatures), culture of vegetarianism, and other theories of ethical, dharmic life.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144858}}, pages 122-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (1994), The institutionalization of the ethics of “non-injury” toward all “beings” in Ancient India, Environmental Ethics, Volume 16, Issue 3, pages 287-301, {{doi|10.5840/enviroethics199416318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma-sutras===
The Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras integrate the teachings of Atman theory. Apastamba Dharmasutra, the oldest known Indian text on dharma, for example, titles Chapters 1.8.22 and 1.8.23 as "Knowledge of the Atman" and then recites,&lt;ref name=apastamba1&gt;Sanskrit Original: [http://www.hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/kalpa/dharma/apastamba_dharma_sutra.pdf Apastamba Dharma Sutra] page 14;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 1''': [https://archive.org/stream/sacredlawsofarya00buhliala#page/n139/mode/2up Knowledge of the Atman] Apastamba Dharmasutra, The Sacred Laws of the Aryas, [[Georg Bühler]] (Translator), pages 75-79;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 2''': Ludwig Alsdorf (2010), The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415548243}}, pages 111-112;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 3''': [[Patrick Olivelle]] (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192838827}}, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahimsa===
The ethical prohibition against harming any human beings or other living creatures (Ahimsa, अहिंसा), in Hindu traditions, can be traced to the Atman theory.&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt; This precept against injuring any living being appears together with Atman theory in hymn 8.15.1 of Chandogya Upanishad (ca. 8th century BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit original: तधैतद्ब्रह्मा प्रजापतये उवाच प्रजापतिर्मनवे मनुः प्रजाभ्यः आचार्यकुलाद्वेदमधीत्य यथाविधानं गुरोः कर्मातिशेषेणाभिसमावृत्य कुटुम्बे शुचौ देशे स्वाध्यायमधीयानो धर्मिकान्विदधदात्मनि सर्वैन्द्रियाणि संप्रतिष्ठा'''प्याहिँस'''न्सर्व भूतान्यन्यत्र तीर्थेभ्यः स खल्वेवं वर्तयन्यावदायुषं ब्रह्मलोकमभिसंपद्यते न च पुनरावर्तते न च पुनरावर्तते ॥१॥; [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/छान्दोग्योपनिषद्_४ छान्दोग्योपनिषद् ४] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation: Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 205&lt;/ref&gt; then becomes central in the texts of Hindu philosophy, entering the dharma codes of ancient ''Dharmasutras'' and later era ''Manu-Smriti''. Ahimsa theory is a natural corollary and consequence of "Atman is universal oneness, present in all living beings. Atman connects and prevades in everyone. Hurting or injuring another being is hurting the Atman, and thus one's self that exists in another body". This conceptual connection between one's Atman, the universal, and Ahimsa starts in [[Isha Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt; develops in the theories of the ancient scholar Yajnavalkya, and one which inspired [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] as he led non-violent movement against colonialism in early 20th century.&lt;ref name=maxmullerisha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deen K.

==Atman – the difference between Hinduism and Buddhism==
{{See also|Anatta|Buddha-nature| Shentong |Sunyata|Precanonical Buddhism}}

All orthodox schools of Hinduism hold the premise, "Atman exists, as self evident truth". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist (or, An-atman) as self evident".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhists do not believe that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is any "eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman".&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt; Buddhists reject the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (''maya''), asserting instead the theory of "no-self" and "no-soul".&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen J Baroni (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823922406}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the "self, soul" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39726-1 |page=82}}; '''Quote:''' "It is at this point that the differences [between Upanishads and Abhidharma] start to become marked. There is no central self which animates the impersonal elements. The concept of nirvana (Pali ''nibbana''), although similarly the criterion according to which ethical judgements are made and religious life assessed, is not the liberated state of a self. Like all other things and concepts (''dhamma'') it is ''anatta'', not-self [in Buddhism].";&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C.

Literally meaning no (an-) self or soul (-atman), this Buddhist term applies to the denial of a metaphysically changeless, eternal and autonomous soul or self. (...) The early canonical Buddhist view of nirvana sometimes suggests a kind of extinction-like (kataleptic) state that automatically encourages a metaphysical no-soul (self)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus believe in Atman. They hold that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is "eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman."&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt; Within the diverse [[Hindu philosophy|schools of Hinduism]], there are differences of opinion on whether souls are distinct, whether a supreme soul or god exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, how to reach [[moksha]]– the knowledge of self that liberates one to blissful content state of existence, and whether moksha is achievable in this life (Advaita Vedanta, Yoga) or is achievable only in after-life (Dvaita Vedanta, Nyaya). However, despite these diversity of ideas and paths in different schools of Hinduism, unlike Buddhism, the foundation premise of Hinduism is that "soul/self exists", and there is bliss in seeking self, knowing self, and self-realization.&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengaku Mayeda (2000), Sankara and Buddhism, in New Perspectives on Advaita Vedānta (Editors: Richard V.

{{Quote|
While the ''[[Upanishad]]s'' recognized many things as being not-Self, they felt that a real, true Self could be found. They held that when it was found, and known to be identical to Brahman, the basis of everything, this would bring liberation. In the Buddhist ''[[Buddhist texts|Suttas]]'', though, literally everything is seen is non-Self, even [[Nirvana]]. When this is known, then liberation – ''Nirvana'' – is attained by total non-attachment. Thus both the ''Upanishads'' and the Buddhist ''Suttas'' see many things as not-Self, but the Suttas apply it, indeed non-Self, to ''everything''.

Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's ''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras'' suggest self-like concepts, variously called ''Tathagatagarbha'' or ''[[Buddha nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|location=|pages=104, 125–127|via=|author=Paul Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

In Theravada tradition, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of ''anatta'' (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} Similar interpretations have been put forth by the then [[Sangharaja of Thailand|Thai Sangharaja]] in 1939. According to Williams, the Sangharaja's interpretation echoes the ''[[tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}} The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is [[Atman (Buddhism)|atta (atman)]] in 1999, has been criticized as heretical in Buddhism by [[Prayudh Payutto|Ven. Payutto]], a well-known scholar monk, who added that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self". This dispute on the nature of teachings about 'self' and 'non-self' in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=51–52}}

According to Johannes Bronkhorst, a professor of Indology specializing in early Buddhism and Hinduism, while there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC|year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0 |pages=99 with footnote 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atman jnana and know thyself==
The Atman concept and its discussions in Hindu philosophy, parallel with ''[[de anima|psuchê]]'' (soul) and its discussion in ancient Greek philosophy.&lt;ref name=meliadegreind&gt;Marcea Eliade (1985), History of Religious Ideas, Volume 2, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226204031}}, pages 493-494&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade notes that there is a capital difference, with schools of Hinduism asserting that liberation of Atman implies "self-knowledge" and "bliss".&lt;ref name=meliadegreind/&gt; Similarly, self-knowledge conceptual theme of Hinduism (''Atman jnana'')&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called ''Atmanam Viddhi'', Frédérique Apffel-Marglin and Stephen A. Marglin (1996), Decolonizing Knowledge : From Development to Dialogue, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198288848}}, page 372&lt;/ref&gt; parallels the "know thyself" conceptual theme of Greek philosophy.&lt;ref name=ptraju/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fort (1998), Jivanmukti in Transformation: Embodied Liberation in Advaita and Neo-Vedanta, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791439036}}, pages 31-46&lt;/ref&gt; Max Müller summarized it thus,

{{quote|
There is not what could be called a philosophical system in these Upanishads. They are, in the true sense of the word, guesses at truth, frequently contradicting each other, yet all tending in one direction. The key-note of the old Upanishads is "know thyself," but with a much deeper meaning than that of the ''γνῶθι σεαυτόν'' of the [[Know thyself|Delphic Oracle]]. The "know thyself" of the Upanishads means, know thy true self, that which underlines thine Ego, and find it and know it in the highest, the eternal Self, the One without a second, which underlies the whole world.
