'''Andrew James Breitbart''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|t|b|ɑr|t}}; February 1, 1969 – March 1, 2012) was an American [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] publisher,&lt;ref name="c-span"/&gt; writer and commentator.

==Early life==
Breitbart was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], on February 1, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/us/andrew-breitbart-conservative-blogger-dies-at-43.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Andrew Breitbart, Conservative Blogger, Dies at 43|last1=Peters |first1=Jeremy W.|date=March 1, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the adopted son of Gerald and Arlene Breitbart, a restaurant owner and banker respectively, and grew up in the affluent neighborhood of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="WAPO20120301" /&gt; He was adopted at three weeks old and raised [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/940/000203331/#FN1|title=Andrew Breitbart|publisher=NNDB|page=1|language=English|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His biological parents had been [[Irish American]].&lt;ref name="WAPO20120301"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/andrew-breitbart-built-internet-empire-by-combining-new-media-old-fashioned-pranks/2012/03/01/gIQA7vc9kR_story.html|title=Andrew Breitbart built Internet empire by combining new media, partisan slant|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=The Washington Post|language=English|accessdate=August 16, 2017|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that his birth certificate indicated his biological father was a folk singer. His adoptive mother had [[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to Judaism when marrying his adoptive father.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/what_is_andrew_breitbart_thinking.single.html |title=Big Breitbart: Andrew Breitbart is messing with you | author= Christopher Beam |journal =Slate Magazine |publisher= |accessdate=March 17, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191051/http://www.slate.com/id/2247593| archivedate= March 22, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704471504574451703003340362?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_opinion |title=The Weekend Interview With Andrew Breitbart: Taking On the 'Democrat-Media Complex' |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=October 18, 2009 | first=James | last=Taranto | date=October 16, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091020224720/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704471504574451703003340362.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_opinion| archivedate= October 20, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitbart studied at [[Hebrew school]] and had a [[Bar Mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Breitbart, Republican Jewish media mogul, is dead at 43|first=Jonah|last=Lowenfeld|date=March 1, 2012|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/thenon-prophet/item/andrew_breitbart_republican_jewish_media_mogul_is_dead_at_43_20120301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically he was an agnostic.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

Breitbart attended [[Brentwood School (Los Angeles)|Brentwood School]], one of the country's top private schools, but did not distinguish himself, saying: "My sense of humor saved me".&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; However, he discovered that he loved writing, publishing his first comedic piece in the school newspaper, the ''Brentwood Eagle'', analyzing the inequality in his high school's senior and junior parking lots: "One had Mercedes and BMWs, the other Sciroccos and GTIs.""&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; Breitbart remembers his upbringing as [[apolitical]], except in one instance: when the family's rabbi tried to defend [[Jesse Jackson]] against charges of antisemitism after his "[[Hymietown]]" comment, his parents left the synagogue in protest.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

Breitbart would remain "proudly and playfully Jewish" throughout his life, although not always religiously observant. He would sing Hebrew songs at work while also teasing his Orthodox Jewish colleagues for keeping a kosher diet.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Comment-Andrew-Breitbart-Israel-and-Judaism "Comment: Andrew Breitbart, Israel and Judaism"] By Benjamin Weinthal, ''Jerusalem Post'', April 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel Pollak]] wrote: "He carried his faith as he carried all his convictions: with a lighthearted touch but a deep commitment."&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt; Breitbart later said of his profession: "I'm glad I've become a journalist because I'd like to fight on behalf of the Israeli people... And the Israeli people, I adore and I love."&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/politics/article/andrew_breitbart_the_unabashedly_biased_journalist_20110613/ "Andrew Breitbart, the unabashedly 'biased journalist'”] by Jonah Lowenfeld, June 13, 2011, ''Jewish Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

While in high school, Breitbart worked as a [[pizza delivery]] driver; he sometimes delivered to celebrities such as [[Judge Reinhold]].&lt;ref&gt;''Righteous Indignation'', page 17&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[American studies]] from [[Tulane University]] in 1991, graduating with "no sense of [his] future whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/may/29/20070529-111812-9136r/print/|title='News addict' gets his fix|last=McCain|first=Robert Stacy|date=May 29, 2007|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=July 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early jobs included a stint at [[cable television|cable]] channel [[E! Entertainment Television]], working for the company's [[blog|online magazine]], and some time in film production.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;

Previously left-leaning in his politics, Breitbart changed his political views after experiencing "an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]" while watching the late 1991 [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|confirmation hearings]] for Supreme Court justice [[Clarence Thomas]], due to what he considered unfounded attacks on the part of liberals based on former employee [[Anita Hill]]'s sexual harassment accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aim.org/podcast/take-aim-andrew-breitbart/|title= Take AIM: Andrew Breitbart }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitbart later described himself as "a [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] conservative" with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] sympathies.&lt;ref name="c-span"/&gt;

Listening to radio hosts such as [[Rush Limbaugh]] helped Breitbart refine his political and philosophical positions, igniting an interest in learning that he had suppressed as a result of his distaste for the "nihilistic musings of dead [[critical theory|critical theorists]]"&lt;ref name="Righteous Indignation, p. 36"&gt;Righteous Indignation, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; that had dominated his studies at Tulane. In this era, Breitbart also read [[Camille Paglia]]'s book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990), a massive survey of Western art, literature and culture from ancient Egypt to the 20th century, which, he wrote, "made me realize how little I really had learned in college."&lt;ref name="Righteous Indignation, p. 36"/&gt;

==Public life==

===Authorship, research, and reporting===
Breitbart has been lauded for his role in the "evolution of pioneering websites" including ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and ''[[Drudge Report|The Drudge Report]]'', and more recently his "Big" sites. Journalists such as Nick Gillespie and Conor Friedersdorf have credited Breitbart with bringing new voices to debates about politics and culture. Breitbart told ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' in 2004 that after feeling ignored by existing outlets, "We decided to go out and create our media." Described as "a series of do-it-yourself demonstration projects" and "conversation pits", the Breitbart websites have been both criticized and praised for their role in various political issues.&lt;ref name=Atlantic1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillespie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/01/opinion/gillespie-breitbart/index.html|title=How Andrew Breitbart changed the news|date=March 2, 2012|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 4, 2015|author=Gillespie, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitbart has been recognized for adopting an inclusive stance with regard to LGBT participation in the conservative movement. He has also been credited with helping to derail [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about Barack Obama's citizenship]].&lt;ref name=Atlantic1 /&gt;

In 1995, Breitbart saw ''The Drudge Report'' and was so impressed that he e-mailed [[Matt Drudge]]. Breitbart said, "I thought what he was doing was by far the coolest thing on the Internet. And I still do."&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt; Breitbart described himself as "Matt Drudge's [[bitch (insult)#In reference to men|bitch]]"&lt;ref name="biyatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/122048.html|title=Lists: What's Your Source for That?

Later, Drudge introduced him to a still-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Arianna Huffington]]&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; and Breitbart subsequently assisted in the creation of ''The Huffington Post''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Andrew Breitbart Helped Launch Huffington Post|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedpolitics/how-andrew-breitbart-helped-launch-huffington-post|publisher=Buzzfeed|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breitbart wrote a weekly column for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', which also appeared at [[Real Clear Politics]]. Breitbart also co-wrote the book ''[[Hollywood, Interrupted|Hollywood, Interrupted: Insanity Chic in Babylon]]'' with [[Mark Ebner]], a book that is highly critical of U.S. [[celebrity culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471450510.html |title=Wiley: Hollywood, Interrupted: Insanity Chic in Babylon – The Case Against Celebrity – Andrew Breitbart, Mark Ebner |work=wiley.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705051111/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471450510.html |archivedate=July 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 19, 2011, the [[LGBT conservatism|conservative gay rights]] group [[GOProud]] announced Breitbart had joined its Advisory Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goproud.org/conservative-media-mogul-andrew-breitbart-to-join-goproud%E2%80%99s-advisory-council/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803200215/http://www.goproud.org/conservative-media-mogul-andrew-breitbart-to-join-goproud%e2%80%99s-advisory-council/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 3, 2011 |title=Conservative Media Mogul Andrew Breitbart to Join GOProud's Advisory Council |publisher=Goproud.org |date=January 21, 2011 |accessdate=September 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Grand Central Publishing released Breitbart's book ''Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World'', in which he discussed his own political evolution and the part he took in the rise of [[new media]], most notably at the Drudge Report and ''The Huffington Post''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In June 2011, Breitbart's websites broke the story that congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] was [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal|sending women revealing photographs of himself]].&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Corbett D.

Breitbart launched his first website as a news site; it is often linked to by the ''[[Drudge Report]]'' and other websites. It has wire stories from the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], [[Agence France-Presse]], [[Fox News]], [[PR Newswire]], and [[U.S. Newswire]], as well as direct links to a number of major international newspapers. Its political viewpoint as well as its audience runs to the [[right-wing|right]] within the U.S. political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/breitbart/|title=Where Breitbart's Audience Fits on the Political Spectrum |date=October 21, 2014|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2007, Breitbart launched a video blog, Breitbart.tv.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rob Owen (journalist)|Owen, Rob]].

In 2011, Breitbart and one of his editors [[Larry O'Connor (radio host)|Larry O'Connor]] were sued for [[defamation]] by [[Shirley Sherrod]], who had been [[Firing of Shirley Sherrod|fired]] after Breitbart posted a video of a speech given by Sherrod. The video had been selectively edited to suggest that she had purposely discriminated against a white farmer, while in reality the unedited video told the story of how she had helped that farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Zeleny| first = Jeff|author2=  Wheaton, Sarah| title = At Gathering, Ron Paul Is No. 1 for 2012| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = A21 | date = February 13, 2011| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/us/politics/13cpac.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1 | accessdate =February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstein" /&gt; In July 2015, it was reported that Sherrod and Breitbart's estate had reached a tentative settlement.&lt;ref name="Gerstein"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerstein|first1=Josh|title=Breitbart, Sherrod near libel settlement|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/07/breitbart-sherrod-near-libel-settlement-209824.html|accessdate=August 18, 2015|publisher=Politico|date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported October 1, 2016, that the lawsuit was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/sherrod-breitbart-lawsuit-settle |title= Ex-USDA Official Settles Her Lawsuit Over Breitbart Video That Got Her Fired |work= [[Talking Points Memo]] |author= Tierney Sneed |date= October 1, 2015 |accessdate= October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentaries===
In 2009, Breitbart appeared as a commentator on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' and ''[[Dennis Miller]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BREITBART: ‘My Real Time With Bill Maher’|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/mar/16/my-real-time-with-bill-maher/?page=all|accessdate=January 6, 2016|publisher=Washington Times|date=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he was a guest commentator on [[Fox News Channel|Fox News Channel's]] morning show and frequently appeared as a guest panelist on [[Fox News]]'s late night program, ''[[Red Eye (TV series)|Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld]]''. Breitbart also appeared as a commentator in the 2004 documentary ''[[Michael Moore Hates America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/212271/michael-wilson-loves-america/andrew-leigh |title=National Review Online|publisher=nationalreview.com |accessdate=November 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2009, Breitbart appeared on the [[C-SPAN]] program ''[[Washington Journal]]''. He gave his opinions on the mainstream media, Hollywood, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] and his personal political views, having heated debates with several callers.&lt;ref name="c-span"&gt;[http://www.c-spanarchives.org/program/289587-8 Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart.com Publisher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002155759/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/program/289587-8 |date=October 2, 2012 }} [[C-SPAN]], October 22, 2009. Breitbart referred to the "Democrat-media complex" several times...&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hours immediately following Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]'s death, Breitbart called Kennedy a "villain", a "duplicitous bastard", a "prick"&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26475.html|title=Not all Kennedy critics hold fire|accessdate=August 26, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090827091650/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26475.html| archivedate= August 27, 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a special pile of human excrement," adding, "Sorry, he destroyed lives.

In February 2010, Breitbart received the [[Reed Irvine]] [[Accuracy in Media]] Award during the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in Washington, D.C. During his acceptance speech, he responded directly to accusations by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter Kate Zernike that [[Jason Mattera]], a young conservative activist, had been using "racial tones" in his [[allusions]] to President [[Barack Obama]], and had spoken in a "[[Chris Rock]] voice". From the podium, Breitbart called Zernike "a despicable human being" for having made such allegations about what, according to him, was just Mattera's Brooklyn accent.&lt;ref&gt;Beam, Christopher, [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/what_is_andrew_breitbart_thinking.html "'Media Is Everything.

Neither O'Keefe nor Breitbart endorsed Taylor's views.

In 2011, Breitbart said that "of course" [[Donald Trump]] was not a conservative, adding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But this is a message to those candidates who are languishing at 2 percent and 3 percent within the Republican Party who are brand names in Washington, but the rest of the country don't know ... celebrity is everything in this country. And if these guys don't learn how to play the media the way that Barack Obama played the media last election cycle and the way that Donald Trump is playing the election cycle, we're going to probably get a celebrity candidate.&lt;ref name="WP.Aug.7.16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weigel|first1=David|title=Five things to know about Breitbart, the new force in the Trump campaign|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/17/five-things-to-know-about-breitbart-the-new-force-in-the-trump-campaign/|accessdate=March 18, 2017|work=Washington Post|date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Breitbart often appeared as a speaker at [[Tea Party movement]] events across the U.S. For example, Breitbart was a speaker at the first National Tea Party Convention at Gaylord Opryland Hotel in Nashville on February 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

Breitbart offered to donate $100,000 to the [[United Negro College Fund]] "for any audio/video footage of the [[nigger|N-word]] being hurled," claiming that the several Congressmen made it up. Breitbart insisted Congressman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] and several other witnesses were forced to lie, concluding that "Nancy Pelosi did a great disservice to a great civil rights icon by thrusting him out there to perform this mischievous task. His reputation is now on the line as a result of her desperation to take down the Tea Party movement."&lt;ref name="AB-100402"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigjournalism.com/abreitbart/2010/04/02/barack-obamas-helter-skelter-insane-clown-posse-alinsky-planes-to-deconstruct-america/ |title=Barack Obama's Helter-Skelter, Insane Clown Posse, Alinsky Plans to 'Deconstruct' America |first=Andrew |last=Breitbart |publisher=Big Journalism |date=April 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302143429/http://bigjournalism.com/abreitbart/2010/04/02/barack-obamas-helter-skelter-insane-clown-posse-alinsky-planes-to-deconstruct-america/ |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WPost Omb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/09/AR2010040903716.html|title=Allegations of spitting and slurs at Capitol protest merit more reporting|date=April 11, 2010|work=Washington Post|accessdate=April 14, 2010| first=Andrew |last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, a YouTube video showed Breitbart yelling at Occupy D.C. protesters outside a Washington, D.C. hotel hosting a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). The video showed security escorting Breitbart back to the hotel while he told the protesters to "behave yourself", and alluding to reported assaults of women at Occupy encampments, he repeatedly yelled, "Stop raping people", and called the protestors "filthy, filthy, raping, murdering freaks!" David Carr said with the incident Breitbart had caused his last "viral storm on the Web."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/business/media/the-life-and-death-of-andrew-breitbart.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |first=David |last=Carr |title=The Life and Death of Andrew Breitbart |date=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPAC&gt;Sources that describe the confrontation with Occupy protesters at CPAC 2012:

Breitbart appeared posthumously in ''[[Occupy Unmasked]]'', a documentary film by Steve Bannon that contends that the [[Occupy movement|Occupy Wall Street movement]] of "largely naïve students and legitimately concerned citizens looking for answers" is actually orchestrated by sinister, violent, and organized leaders with the purpose of not just changing, but destroying the American government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupyunmasked.com|url=http://www.occupyunmasked.com/about.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apraxia of speech''' ('''AOS''') is an acquired [[Motor speech disorders|oral motor speech disorder]] affecting an individual's ability to translate conscious speech plans into motor plans, which results in limited and difficult speech ability. By the definition of [[apraxia]], AOS affects [[Volition (psychology)|volitional]] (willful or purposeful) movement patterns, however AOS usually also affects [[automatic speech]].&lt;ref name="West Hesketh 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Carolyn |last2=Hesketh|first2=Anne| last3=Vail|first3=Andy| last4=Bowen|first4=Audrey|last5=West|first5=Carolyn|title=Interventions for apraxia of speech following stroke| year=2005| doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004298.pub2| pmid=16235357| issue=4| journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev| pages=CD004298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with AOS have difficulty connecting speech messages from the brain to the mouth.&lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apraxia of Speech|url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/apraxia.aspx|work=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AOS is a loss of prior speech ability resulting from a brain injury such as a stroke or progressive illness.

==Presentation==
Apraxia of speech (AOS) is a neurogenic [[communication disorder]] affecting the motor programming system for speech production.&lt;ref name="Ogar 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogar J, Slama H, Dronkers N, Amici S, Gorno-Tempini ML |title=Apraxia of speech: an overview |journal=Neurocase |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=427–32 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16393756 |doi=10.1080/13554790500263529 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knollman-Porter, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knollman-Porter K |title=Acquired apraxia of speech: a review |journal=Top Stroke Rehabil |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=484–93 |year=2008 |pmid=19008207 |doi=10.1310/tsr1505-484 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with AOS demonstrate difficulty in speech production, specifically with sequencing and forming sounds. The Levelt model describes the speech production process in the following three consecutive stages: conceptualization, formulation, and articulation. According to the Levelt model, apraxia of speech would fall into the articulation region. The individual does not suffer from a language deficiency, but has difficulty in the production of language in an audible manner. Notably, this difficulty is limited to vocal speech, and does not affect sign-language production. The individual knows exactly what they want to say, but there is a disruption in the part of the brain that sends the signal to the muscle for the specific movement.&lt;ref name="Knollman-Porter, 2008"/&gt;  Individuals with acquired AOS demonstrate hallmark characteristics of [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (rhythm, stress or intonation) errors.&lt;ref name="Ogar 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knollman-Porter, 2008"/&gt; Coexisting characteristics may include groping and effortful speech production with self-correction, difficulty initiating speech, abnormal stress, intonation and rhythm errors, and inconsistency with articulation.&lt;ref name= Wertz/&gt;

Wertz et al., (1984) describe the following five speech characteristics that an individual with apraxia of speech may exhibit:&lt;ref name= Wertz&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rosenbek, John C. |author2=Wertz, Robert T. |author3=LaPointe, Leonard L. |title=Apraxia of speech in adults: the disorder and its management |publisher=Grune &amp; Stratton |location=New York |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=0-8089-1612-2 |oclc=13284954 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Groping is when the mouth searches for the position needed to create a sound. When this trial and error process occurs, sounds may be held out longer, repeated or silently voiced. In some cases, an AOS sufferer may be able to produce certain sounds on their own, easily and unconsciously, but when prompted by another to produce the same sound the patient may grope with their lips, using volitional control (conscious awareness of the attempted speech movements), while struggling to produce the sound.&lt;ref name="Knollman-Porter, 2008"/&gt;
;Self correction of errors
:Patients are aware of their speech errors and can attempt to correct themselves. This can involve distorted consonants, vowels, and sound substitutions. People with AOS often have a much greater understanding of speech than they are able to express. This receptive ability allows them to attempt self correction.&lt;ref name="van der Merwe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Merwe|first=Anita|title=Self-Correction in Apraxia of Speech: The Effect of Treatment|journal=Aphasiology|date=June–August 2007|volume=21|issue=6-8|pages=658–669|doi=10.1080/02687030701192174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Abnormal rhythm, stress and intonation
:Sufferers of AOS present with prosodic errors which include irregular pitch, rate, and rhythm. This impaired prosody causes their speech to be: too slow or too fast and highly segmented (many pauses). An AOS speaker also stresses syllables incorrectly and in a monotone. As a result, the speech is often described as 'robotic'. When words  are produced in a monotone with equal syllabic stress, a word such as 'tectonic' may sound like 'tec-ton-ic' as opposed to 'tec-TON-ic'. These patterns occur even though the speakers are aware of the prosodic patterns that should be used.&lt;ref name=prosody&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boutsen|first=F. R.|author2=Christman, S. S.|title=Prosody in apraxia of speech|journal=Seminars in Speech and Language|date=November 2002|volume=23|issue=4|pages=245–56|pmid=12461724|doi=10.1055/s-2002-35799}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Inconsistent articulation errors on repeated speech productions of the same utterance
:When producing the same utterance in different instances, a person with AOS may have difficulty using and maintaining the same articulation that was previously used for that utterance. On some days, people with AOS may have more errors, or seem to "lose" the ability to produce certain sounds for an amount of time. Articulation also becomes more difficult when a word or phrase requires an articulation adjustment, in which the lips and tongue must move in order to shift between sounds. For example, the word "baby" needs less mouth adjustment than the word "dog" requires, since producing "dog" requires two tongue/lips movements to articulate.&lt;ref name="Ogar 2005"/&gt;
;Difficulty initiating utterances
:Producing utterances becomes a difficult task in patients with AOS, which result in various speech errors. The errors in completing a speech movement gesture may increase as the length of the utterance increases. Since multisyllabic words are difficult, those with AOS use simple syllables and a limited range of consonants and vowels.&lt;ref name="Ogar 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knollman-Porter, 2008"/&gt;

==Causes==
Apraxia of speech can be caused by impairment to parts of the brain that control muscle movement and speech.&lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASHA 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=Apraxia of speech |publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association |year=2013| url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/ApraxiaAdults/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identifying a particular region of the brain in which AOS always occurs has been controversial.  Various patients with damage to left subcortical structures, regions of the insula, and Broca’s area have been diagnosed with AOS.  Most commonly it is triggered by vascular lesions, but AOS can also arise due to tumors and trauma.&lt;ref name="Ogar 2005"/&gt;

===Acute apraxia of speech===
Stroke-associated AOS is the most common form of acquired AOS, making up about 60% of all reported acquired AOS cases. This is one of the several possible disorders that can result from a stroke, but only about 11% of stroke cases involve this disorder. Brain damage to the neural connections, and especially the neural synapses, during the stroke can lead to acquired AOS. Most cases of stroke-associated AOS are minor, but in the most severe cases, all linguistic motor function can be lost and must be relearned. Since most with this form of AOS are at least fifty years old, few fully recover to their previous level of ability to produce speech.

Other disorders and injuries of the brain that can lead to AOS include (traumatic) dementia, progressive neurological disorders, and traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref name="ASHA 2013"/&gt;

===Progressive  apraxia of speech===
Recent research has established the existence of primary progressive apraxia of speech caused by [[Neuroanatomy|neuroanatomic]] motor [[atrophy]].&lt;ref name="Josephs 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Josephs KA, Duffy JR |title=Apraxia of speech and nonfluent aphasia: a new clinical marker for corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=688–92 |date=December 2008 |pmid=18989114 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e3283168ddd |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Josephs 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Josephs KA, Duffy JR, Strand EA |title=Characterizing a neurodegenerative syndrome: primary progressive apraxia of speech |journal=Brain |volume=135 |issue=Pt 5 |pages=1522–36 |date=May 2012 |pmid=22382356 |pmc=3338923 |doi=10.1093/brain/aws032 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, this disorder was not distinguished from other [[motor speech disorders]] such as dysarthria and in particular [[primary progressive aphasia]]. Many studies have been done trying to identify areas in the brain in which this particular disorder occurs or at least to show that it occurs in different areas of the brain than other disorders.&lt;ref name="Ricci 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ricci M, Magarelli M, Todino V, Bianchini A, Calandriello E, Tramutoli R |title=Progressive apraxia of speech presenting as isolated disorder of speech articulation and prosody: a case report |journal=Neurocase |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=162–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18569741 |doi=10.1080/13554790802060839 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study observed 37 patients with [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] speech disorders to determine whether or not it is distinguishable from other disorders, and if so where in the brain it can be found. Using [[Speech-language pathology|speech and language]], [[Neurology|neurological]], [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] and [[neuroimaging]] testing, the researchers came to the conclusion that PAS does exist and that it correlates to superior lateral [[premotor cortex|premotor]] and supplementary motor atrophy.&lt;ref name="Josephs 2012"/&gt; However, because PAS is such a rare and recently discovered disorder, many studies do not have enough subjects to observe to make data entirely conclusive.

==Diagnosis==
Apraxia of speech can be diagnosed by a [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech language pathologist]] (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech. The oral mechanisms exam involves tasks such as pursing lips, blowing, licking lips, elevating the tongue, and also involves an examination of the mouth. A complete exam also involves observation of the patient eating and talking. SLPs do not agree on a specific set of characteristics that make up the apraxia of speech diagnosis,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} so any of the characteristics from the section above could be used to form a diagnosis.&lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health 2010"/&gt; Patients may be asked to perform other daily tasks such as reading, writing, and conversing with others. In situations involving brain damage, an MRI brain scan also helps identify damaged areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health 2010"/&gt;

A [[differential diagnosis]] must be used in order to rule out other similar or alternative disorders. Although disorders such as expressive aphasia, conduction aphasia, and dysarthria involve similar symptoms as apraxia of speech, the disorders must be distinguished in order to correctly treat the patients.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} While AOS involves the motor planning or processing stage of speech, aphasic disorders can involve other language processes.&lt;ref name="Croote 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Croot|first=K.|title=Diagnosis of AOS: definition and criteria|journal=Seminars in Speech and Language|date=November 2002|volume=23|issue=4|pages=267–80|pmid=12461726 |doi=10.1055/s-2002-35800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ziegler et al., this difficulty in diagnosis derives from the unknown causes and function of the disorder, making it hard to set definite parameters for AOS identification.  Specifically, he explains that oral-facial apraxia, dysarthria, and aphasic phonological impairment are the three distinctly different disorders that cause individuals to display symptoms that are often similar to those of someone with AOS, and that these close relatives must be correctly ruled out by a Speech Language Pathologist before AOS can be given as a diagnosis.  In this way, AOS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and is generally recognized when all other similar speech sound production disorders are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, W., Aichert, I, &amp; Staiger, A. (2012). American Speech-Language-Hearing Association supplement: Apraxia of speech: Concepts and controversies. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 55, 1485-1501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible co-morbid aphasias===
AOS and [[expressive aphasia]] (also known as Broca's aphasia) are commonly mistaken as the same disorder mainly because they often occur together in patients. Although both disorders present with symptoms such as a difficulty producing sounds due to damage in the language parts of the brain, they are not the same. The main difference between these disorders lies in the ability to comprehend spoken language; patients with apraxia are able to fully comprehend speech, while patients with aphasia are not always fully able to comprehend others' speech.&lt;ref name="Choy 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Janet Choy J, Thompson CK |title=Binding in agrammatic aphasia: Processing to comprehension |journal=Aphasiology |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=551–579 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20535243 |pmc=2882310 |doi=10.1080/02687030802634025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conduction aphasia]] is another speech disorder that is similar to, but not the same as, apraxia of speech. Although patients who suffer from conduction aphasia have full comprehension of speech, as do AOS sufferers, there are differences between the two disorders.&lt;ref name="Robin 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robin DA, Jacks A, Hageman C, Clark HM, Woodworth G |title=Visuomotor tracking abilities of speakers with apraxia of speech or conduction aphasia |journal=Brain Lang |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=98–106 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18558428 |pmc=2579757 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2008.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with conduction aphasia are typically able to speak fluently, but they do not have the ability to repeat what they hear.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: the Science of Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Canada|isbn=0205702864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[dysarthria]], another motor speech disorder, is characterized by difficulty articulating sounds. The difficulty in articulation does not occur due in planning the motor movement, as happens with AOS. Instead, [[dysarthria]] is caused by inability in or weakness of the muscles in the mouth, face, and respiratory system.&lt;ref name=Dysarthria&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysarthria|url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/dysarthria.htm|publisher=The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
In cases of acute AOS (stroke), spontaneous recovery may occur, in which previous speech abilities reappear on their own. All other cases of acquired AOS require a form of therapy; however the therapy varies with the individual needs of the patient. Typically, treatment involves one-on-one therapy with a speech language pathologist (SLP).&lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health 2010"/&gt; For severe forms of AOS, therapy may involve multiple sessions per week, which is reduced with speech improvement. Another main theme in AOS treatment is the use of repetition in order to achieve a large amount of target utterances, or desired speech usages.

There are various treatment techniques for AOS. One technique, called the Linguistic Approach, utilizes the rules for sounds and sequences. This approach focuses on the placement of the mouth in forming speech sounds. Another type of treatment is the Motor-Programming Approach, in which the motor movements necessary for speech are practiced. This technique utilizes a great amount of repetition in order to practice the sequences and transitions that are necessary in between production of sounds.

Research about the treatment of apraxia has revealed four main categories: articulatory-kinematic, rate/rhythm control, intersystemic facilitation/reorganization treatments, and alternative/augmentative communication.&lt;ref name="Mauszycki 2011"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Mauszycki |first1=Shannon C. |last2=Wambaugh |first2=Julie |title=Acquired Apraxia of Speech: A Treatment Overview |url=http://www.asha.org/Publications/leader/2011/110426/Acquired-Apraxia-of-Speech--A-Treatment-Overview/ |publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130813183759/http://www.asha.org/Publications/leader/2011/110426/Acquired-Apraxia-of-Speech--A-Treatment-Overview/ |archivedate=13 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Articulatory-kinematic treatments almost always require verbal production in order to bring about improvement of speech. One common technique for this is modeling or repetition in order to establish the desired speech behavior. Articulatory-kinematic treatments are based on the importance of patients to improve spatial and temporal aspects of speech production.
*Rate and rhythm control treatments exist to improve errors in patients’ timing of speech, a common characteristic of Apraxia. These techniques often include an external source of control like metronomic pacing, for example, in repeated speech productions.
*Intersystemic reorganization/facilitation techniques often involve physical body or limb gestural approaches to improve speech. Gestures are usually combined with verbalization. It is thought that limb gestures may improve the organization of speech production.
*Finally, alternative and augmentative communication approaches to treatment of apraxia are highly individualized for each patient. However, they often involve a "comprehensive communication system" that may include "speech, a communication book aid, a spelling system, a drawing system, a gestural system, technologies, and informed speech partners".

One specific treatment method is referred to as PROMPT. This acronym stands for Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://promptinstitute.com/index.php?page%3Dwhat-is-prompt3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222003537/http://promptinstitute.com/index.php?page=what-is-prompt3 |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and takes a hands on multidimensional approach at treating speech production disorders. PROMPT therapists integrate physical-sensory, cognitive-linguistic, and social-emotional aspects of motor performance. The main focus is developing language interaction through this tactile-kinetic approach by using touch cues to facilitate the articulatory movements associated with individual phonemes, and eventually words.

One study describes the use of electropalatography (EPG) to treat a patient with severe acquired apraxia of speech.  EPG is a computer-based tool for assessment and treatment of speech motor issues.  The program allows patients to see the placement of articulators during speech production thus aiding them in attempting to correct errors. Originally after two years of speech therapy, the patient exhibited speech motor and production problems including problems with phonation, articulation, and resonance.   This study showed that EPG therapy gave the patient valuable visual feedback to clarify speech movements that had been difficult for the patient to complete when given only auditory feedback.&lt;ref name="Howard Varley 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard| first1=Sara|last2=Varley| first2=Rosemary|title=III: EPG in Therapy Using electropalatography to treat severe acquired apraxia of speech|journal=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders| volume=30|issue=2 |year=1995|pages=246–255|doi=10.3109/13682829509082535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many studies are still exploring the various treatment methods, a few suggestions from ASHA for treating apraxia patients include the integration of objective treatment evidence, theoretical rationale, clinical knowledge and experience, and the needs and goals of the patient

==History and terminology==
The term apraxia was first defined by [[Hugo Karl Liepmann]] in 1908 as the "inability to perform voluntary acts despite preserved muscle strength."  In 1969, Frederic L. Darley coined the term "apraxia of speech", replacing Liepmann's original term "apraxia of the glosso-labio-pharyngeal structures."  [[Paul Broca]] had also identified this speech disorder in 1861, which he referred to as "aphemia": a disorder involving difficulty of articulation despite having intact language skills and muscular function.&lt;ref name="Ogar 2005"/&gt;

The disorder is currently referred to as "apraxia of speech", but was also formerly termed "verbal dyspraxia". The term apraxia comes from the Greek root "praxis," meaning the performance of action or skilled movement.&lt;ref name= Wertz/&gt;  Adding the prefix "a", meaning absence, or "dys", meaning abnormal or difficult, to the root "praxis", both function to imply speech difficulties related to movement.

==Research==
Many researchers are investigating the characteristics of apraxia of speech and the most effective treatment methods. Below are a couple of the recent findings:

'''Sound Production Treatment:''' 
Articulatory-kinematic treatments have the strongest evidence of their use in treating Acquired Apraxia of Speech. These treatments use the facilitation of movement, positioning, timing, and articulators to improve speech production. Sound Production Treatment (SPT) is an articulatory-kinematic treatment that has received more research than many other methods. It combines modeling, repetition, minimal pair contrast, integral stimulation, articulatory placement cueing, and verbal feedback. It was developed to improve the articulation of targeted sounds in the mid-1990s. SPT shows consistent improvement of trained sounds in trained and untrained words. The best results occur with eight to ten exemplars of the targeted sound to promote generalization to untrained exemplars of trained sounds. In addition, maintenance effects are the strongest with 1–2 months post-treatment with sounds that reached high accuracy during treatment. Therefore, the termination of treatment should not be determined by performance criteria, and not by the number of sessions the client completes, in order to have the greatest long-term effects. While there are many parts of SPT that should receive further investigation, it can be expected that it will improve the production of targeted sounds for speakers with apraxia of Speech.&lt;ref name="Wambaugh2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wambaugh |first1=J. |title=Sound Production Treatment for Acquired Apraxia of Speech |journal=Perspectives on Neurophysiology and Neurogenic Speech and Language Disorders |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=67–72 |doi=10.1044/nnsld20.3.67 |url=http://www.ancds.org/documents/MembersOnly/SPT_Perspectives_Article.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015843/http://www.ancds.org/documents/MembersOnly/SPT_Perspectives_Article.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repeated Practice &amp; Rate/Rhythm Control Treatments:''' 
Julie Wambaugh’s research focuses on clinically applicable treatments for acquired apraxia of speech. She recently published an article examining the effects of repeated practice and rate/rhythm control on sound production accuracy. Wambaugh and colleagues studied the effects of such treatment for 10 individuals with acquired apraxia of speech. The results indicate that repeated practice treatment results in significant improvements in articulation for most clients. In addition, rate/rhythm control helped some clients, but not others. Thus, incorporating repeated practice treatment into therapy would likely help individuals with AOS.&lt;ref name="Wambaugh 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wambaugh JL, Nessler C, Cameron R, Mauszycki SC |title=Acquired apraxia of speech: the effects of repeated practice and rate/rhythm control treatments on sound production accuracy |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=S5–27 |date=May 2012 |pmid=22230177 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2011/11-0102) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3146">'''Backbiting''', '''backstabbing''', or '''tale-bearing''' is [[slander]]ing someone in their absence &amp;mdash; to bite them behind their back.  Originally, backbiting referred to an unsporting attack from the rear in the blood sport of [[bearbaiting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a8SGwf0H7UwC&amp;pg=PA166 |title=Why You Say It |author=Webb B. Garrison |chapter=To Backbite}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Islam|Islamic]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[religious law|doctrine]], backbiting is considered a [[sin]].  The Bahá’í leaders condemned it as the worst of sins as it destroyed the 'life of the soul' and provoked [[divine wrath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z7zdDFTzNr0C&amp;pg=PA156 |title=An introduction to the Baha'i faith |author=Peter Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Aquinas]] classified it as a [[mortal sin]], but did not consider it to be the gravest sin that one could commit against one's neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0gOm51etij0C&amp;pg=PA158 |title=Summa Theologica |volume=2 |author=Thomas Aquinas; see "I answer that" in Article 3, http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3073.htm#article4}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Islam, backbiting is known as Ghibat (غيبة) and Islam considers it to be a major sin and the [[Qur'an]] compares it to the abhorrent act of eating the flesh of one's dead brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;pg=PA106 |author=Rafik Berjak |title=The Qur'an: an encyclopedia|chapter=Backbiting|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Judaism, backbiting is known as [[Lashon hara|''hotzaat shem ra'']] (spreading a bad name) and is considered a very severe sin. 

In [[Buddhism]], backbiting goes against the ideal of [[right speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel294.html|title=Right Livelihood: The Noble Eightfold Path in the Working Life|last=Jootla|first=Susan|year=1982|work=The Wheel|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society /  Access to Insight|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Backbiting may occur as a form of release after a confrontation.  By [[insulting]] the opposing person, the backbiter diminishes them and, by doing so, restores their own [[self-esteem]].  A bond may also be established with the confidant if they are receptive to the hostile comment.  Such [[gossip]] is common in human society as people seek to divert [[blame]] and establish their place in the [[dominance hierarchy]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8649800.stm |title=Brown's 'bigot' remark: It's that sinking feeling |date= 29 April 2010 |publisher=BBC |author=Geoff Beattie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But the backbiting may be perceived as a form of delinquent behaviour due to an [[inferiority complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=The Educational review |year=1964 |title=Psychology of Backbiting |volume=70-71 |page=195 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xu4UAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boodikka first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' Vol. 3 #20 and was created by Gerald Jones, Pat Broderick, Romeo Tanghal, Albert De Guzman, and Anthony Tollin.

==Fictional character biography==
At three centuries of age, the warrior Boodikka of the planet Bellatrix was originally recruited by the sphere-like [[Chaselon]] of Barrio III to join the then-reconstituted [[Green Lantern Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #20 (January 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Boodikka had belonged to something called the "Bellatrix Bombers", a group of women mercenaries for hire by planets to clear the spaceways of hostile forces. The "Bellatrix Bombers" had broken up at some point, the majority of the team apparently having been killed along the way.

Initially [[Hal Jordan]] was dismayed and otherwise put off by Boodikka's inherently aggressive attitude. Despite this, [[Kilowog]], a renowned trainer in the Corps and the trainer of Jordan himself&lt;ref&gt;As shown in ''Green Lantern: [[Emerald Dawn]]''&lt;/ref&gt;, was only too eager to train someone so challenging and gave her his recommendation as a candidate. Things moved quickly at this point, and Boodikka soon found herself thrust into battle with [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]. She and the rest of the Corps joined in the fight against Hal's one-time love, the mercenary Flicker, and an entire Teban convoy.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #23-24 (April–May 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, new recruits of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] were shown the Book of Oa, a book kept by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] which told tales of Green Lanterns past, present, and future. They learned stories which would help them be better Green Lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps Quarterly'' #1-3 (Summer-Winter 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The new members had this training disrupted when they went to Earth to help free Hal Jordan from the influence of the villain [[Eclipso]]. They were no match for the eclipsed Jordan and [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]. Eclipso managed to escape the Corps and soon they returned to Oa. [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] was awarded a ring by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] to act as temporary Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Annual'' (vol. 3) #1 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

She would quickly prove to be a skilled power ring wielder, a worthwhile addition to the Green Lantern Corps. Nevertheless, her problem with authority and authority figures posed a continuing problem. She was often at odds with [[Kreon]] of Tebis, another new recruit to the Corps. As the former Chieftain of the Teban battle fleet, he was used to discipline and military precision. Their infighting had even jeopardized [[Oa]] and the Guardians during a Qwardian invasion. Guy Gardner had returned to Oa to take the yellow power ring of [[Sinestro]]. Without Kilowog to guide them, the Green Lanterns were in chaos. 

[[Kreon]] and Boodikka came to blows when the rival Green Lantern criticized her for being an undisciplined fighter. Running out of options, Kilowog brought the two squabbling Green Lanterns to [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] as a "guest lecturer" in cooperation and tolerance. Stewart performed a mind scan on the two recruits and somehow exchanged their consciousnesses. The two Green Lanterns were faced with their ultimate fears: Kreon's was represented by "Mama Denata" and his fear of the uncontrollable, while Boodikka's fear was "the Chain Men" which represented the suffocation she felt by authoritative restraints. The two had no choice but to learn to work together or be defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Mosaic'' #6 (November 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boodikka never lost her love of battle. She eagerly fought against the incarnation of Entropy, even though the encounter then-seemed to mean certain death. Boodikka proved to have come a long way as a Green Lantern, then working as a team with the other members of the Corps to defeat Entropy.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #34-35 (December 1992-January 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a space sector far removed from our own galaxy, Boodikka was assigned to investigate the deaths of multiple alien races that had suddenly destroyed themselves in an apparent mass-suicide, environmental destruction, or otherwise massive wars. Upon arriving on a world in the midst of tearing itself apart, Boodikka encountered Guy Gardner. He and his colleagues, the "Gardners of the Universe," had been dispatched to solve the same problem as Boodikka.  Guy sought to prove to his leadership abilities to his team of super-powered aliens from across known space. It was not long until Gardner got into an altercation with the Green Lantern. It was during this fight that Guy realized his yellow ring was powered by the energy of the Green Lanterns' power rings.&lt;ref name=gg9&gt;''Guy Gardner'' #9 (June 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Fully charged, Gardner's yellow power ring enabled him to recognize the true threat. Created in the anti-matter universe of [[Qward]], his power ring negated the mental block of the real attackers. Gardner used his ring to free the others from their trance. 

Boodikka's respite would not last long. An alien race called the Ophidians had come to cleanse known space. On two occasions in their sordid past they had been nearly annihilated by alien invaders &amp;ndash; then since confining themselves to eradicating all other life in the universe to insure their pseudo-religious quest would never again be in harm's way. The Ophidians would entrance their victims before causing them to fight amongst themselves all the way to extinction. As the Ophidian ship managed to elude them, Boodikka and Gardner had to join their minds together to achieve the speed needed to overtake them. When they reached the ship, it exploded. Whether this was a result of feedback from the two fighting off the mind control or self-destruction, is unknown. The pair now had no way to find the Ophidian's homeworld. After the battle, Boodikka called upon the [[Guardians of the Universe]] to consult in the matter of recovering Gardner's Qwardian power ring. The Guardians, however, had determined Gardner was working toward the same ends they were. Although they would be watching Gardner, they decided not to act on Gardner for the time being.&lt;ref name=gg9 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Guy Gardner'' #10 (July 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

A fierce warrior, Boodikka was well-versed in many combative arts including the use of short-swords, handguns, and explosives. Often she would visit her own mother for combat. On Bellatrix, this was considered a good time. Boodikka's own grandmother had been killed by her own daughter. [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]], a former Green Lantern of Graxos IV and onetime love of Hal Jordan, told this story to [[Justice League]]rs [[Power Girl]], [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]], and Maya when they inquired about women in the Green Lantern Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps Quarterly'' #6 (Fall 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point the Green Lantern Corps were called upon to help Hal Jordan on the planet Maltus. He had been fighting the Maltusian gods known as the Triarch and was also under attack by the [[Darkstars]] and the [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] Boodikka was as smitten by the fighting prowess of [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], bounty hunter and L.E.G.I.O.N. operative. The two stopped in mid-fight and went "somewhere" at Lobo's suggestion for a formidable love-making session that caused the two of them to miss the entire fight.&lt;ref&gt;''Darkstars'' #11 (August 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' #58 (September 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #45 (September 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''DC Universe: Trinity'' #2 (September 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boodikka eventually became a kind of recruiter for the Corps. In her search she encountered Barin, a young soldier of a kindred warrior species who she believed would prove to be an asset to her brethren. As events would turn out, Barin was not quite at a point where he was ready to fight solo. Upon his first outing alone he was quickly besieged by a kind of space mongrels and went into shock. The would-be Lantern was brought to Oa where he was connected to life support systems. Since the destruction of Oa by both the [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]-ridden Hal Jordan and its resurrection by [[Kyle Rayner]], Barin's ultimate fate remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps Quarterly'' #7 (Winter 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #0 (October 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerald Twilight and beyond===
Her next mission was to stop Hal Jordan from reaching Oa during ''[[Emerald Twilight]]'' by the direct order of the [[Guardians of the Universe]]. Although she fought well, she was no match for Jordan's willpower. Because she was unwilling to give up her ring freely, Jordan severed Boodikka's hand to take her ring from it. Jordan left her floating in space and continued on towards Oa where he would soon become [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #49 (February 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan later mentioned that he had left Boodikka, along with the other Green Lanterns he had confronted on the way to Oa, with "enough power to survive" even after taking their rings.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #50 (March 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later it was revealed that Boodikka had survived, joining "The Brotherhood of the Cold Flame" on the planet Xudar with other former Green Lanterns to find the means to atone for the crimes of Hal Jordan. The Brotherhood of the Cold flame, using the spirit of the deceased [[Kilowog]], created the "Dark Lantern," an instrument of their vengeance against Boodikka's wishes.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Legacy - The Last Will &amp; Testament of Hal Jordan'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boodikka was later discovered by Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner on the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunter]] homeworld of Biot, in a state of suspended animation with other "Lost Lanterns" Jordan had left for dead during ''Emerald Twilight.'' At some point in time the Manhunters, in concert with [[Hank Henshaw]], had gathered up these former Green Lanterns, put them into suspended animation, and used their energies as a battery to create more advanced Manhunters. Upon being freed from her slumber Boodikka seemed shocked that she no longer had her hand, and following commentary implied her last conscious memory was of fighting the Parallax-possessed Hal Jordan despite having lived some time after her maiming on Xudar as part of the "Brotherhood of the Cold Flame".&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #3 (August 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #11 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #12 (July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; How or why Boodikka was captured while on Xudar (assuming she still remained there) remains unknown. During the confrontation with the Manhunters, Kreon dies and his ring chooses Boodikka.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #13 (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; She resumes her duties in the Green Lantern Corps, replacing her lost hand with an emerald one fueled by her Power Ring energies.

Boodikka and her fellow Lost Lanterns keep their distance from Hal Jordan until Parallax (in the form of [[Kyle Rayner]]) brings him to [[Qward]].  They followed, knowing that "The Corps doesn't abandon its own".&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #21 (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; When Parallax killed Chance, she attempted to vaporise him, which her ring recognised as an illegal action, consequently shutting down, leaving her helpless. Boodikka then went with Ke'Haan and Laira to find [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]], deep beneath Qward.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #22 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they run into the [[Anti-Monitor]]. Ke'Haan was killed, but the others managed to rescue Ion, and return to Oa. At the same time, the Guardians had rewritten the Book of Oa, allowing Lanterns to use lethal force, returning control of the ring to Boodikka.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #23 (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Sinestro Corps War===
[[File:Green Lantern Corps no. 22 "The Curse of the Alpha-Lantern", part two.jpg|alt=|180px|thumb|Boodikka as an Alpha Lantern]]
Boodikka became a member of the Alpha Lanterns, an internal policing force within the Corps itself, soon after the Sinestro War and the enactment of the Second Law of the Book of Oa. The Alpha Lanterns make sure that no Corps member performs an illegal action using a power ring. Each Alpha Lantern receives a second power ring and receives direct connections to the Book of Oa's Laws and the Central Power Battery. The process involves surgical alteration into a hybrid of the individual recruit's biological form and updated Manhunter technology. In other words, Alpha Lanterns are cyborgs.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #26 (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #27 (January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #28 (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boodikka and the Alpha Lanterns are seen in ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Fellow Alpha Lantern Kraken is revealed to be taken over by [[Granny Goodness]] during Hal Jordan's trial after the Alphas had arrested Hal for the murder of [[Orion (comics)|Orion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis'' #1-5 (July–December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brightest Day===
Alpha Lantern Boodikka is shown to have been controlled by [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #49 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; As she attacks Kyle Rayner, [[Soranik Natu]], and John Stewart, Green Lantern member Hannu ambushes her and manages to damage her severely. This temporarily frees her from Cyborg Superman's control and she instructs the other Lanterns to recharge the battery with the energy she has absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #51 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Her fellow Lanterns are able to repair her enough for her to fight, and she joins in the attack on the Cyborg Superman's base. During the battle, the Cyborg's body is destroyed, and his consciousness attempts to take control of Boodikka's body. Boodikka's consciousness fights back, defeating him. On her return to Oa, Boodikka is made a member of the Lantern Honor Guard, her emotions restored due to the way she was freed from the Cyborg's control. However, Ganthet noted immediately that there was something different about her. Boodikka asserts this is because Ganthet's newly discovered emotions allowed her to be who she is (Boodikka's true self, now in control of her body again), not what she is (an Alpha Lantern).&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #52 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reign of Doomsday===
Boodikka later appears at the remains of the destroyed planet [[New Krypton]], where she encounters [[Batman (Dick Grayson)|Batman]] and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] of the [[Justice League]]. Boodikka explains that the Guardians had sent her on a mission to survey the ruins as a follow-up to the initial Green Lantern Corps inspection of the planet that took place during the ''[[World of New Krypton]]'' storyline. Suddenly, the heroes are attacked by [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who strikes Boodikka across the back before she has a chance to react. Due to her injuries, Boodikka is unable to effectively wield her ring, and is nearly captured by the creature before being rescued by Supergirl. With [[Starman (comics)#Mikaal Tomas|Starman]] and [[Saint Walker]] of the [[Blue Lantern Corps]] serving as a distraction, Batman and Supergirl are able to get the injured Boodikka to the [[JLA Watchtower]]. Doomsday follows them aboard, and just as he is about to attack them, Cyborg Superman emerges from Boodikka's body and states that Doomsday attacked Boodikka and the JLA members in order to get to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #55&lt;/ref&gt;

After Doomsday captures Supergirl and Cyborg Superman and then flees the Watchtower, Starman mentions that Boodikka is healing herself in the JLA medical facility, and that she should soon have enough energy to return to Oa.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #56&lt;/ref&gt;



Following the ''[[War of the Green Lanterns]]'' storyline, Boodikka and the Alpha Lanterns are killed by Alpha Lantern Varix that believe that the Alpha Lanterns are being corrupted into judgement against John Stewart during his trial; Varix then killed himself. Afterwards, the bodies of Alpha Lanterns were interned on Oa.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 3) #12 (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===

* Boodikka appears briefly in the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' episode "[[List of Green Lanterns#Daffy Duck/Duck Dodgers|The Green Loontern]]" as one of the Lanterns defending Oa from [[Sinestro]], voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. She is later rescued by Dodgers and the rest of the Corps.
* Boodikka makes a cameo in [[Justice League Action]] in Season 1, Espisode 47 "Watchtower Tours".

===Film===

* Boodikka appears in ''[[Green Lantern: First Flight]]'' voiced by [[Tricia Helfer]]. This version of Boodikka is radically different from her comic version, in that she is a co-conspirator with [[Sinestro]]. In a fight with Hal Jordan and [[Kilowog]], she is killed when impaled after an explosion with her shooting [[Kanjar Ro]]'s energy staff.
* Boodikka has a cameo appearance in ''[[Green Lantern: Emerald Knights]]'', reprised by [[Grey DeLisle]] who was uncredited for the role.
* Boodikka also appears in the live-action ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' film in a cameo in a few scenes in the film. Although she is very similar to humans in appearance in the comics, no actress was cast for the role and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was used instead, to portray her.

[[File:FHBradley.gif|thumb|Bradley, the most famous British idealist]]
A species of [[absolute idealism]], '''British idealism''' was a philosophical movement that was influential in Britain from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. The leading figures in the movement were [[Thomas Hill Green|T. H. Green]] (1836–1882), [[F. H. Bradley]] (1846–1924), and [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] (1848–1923). They were succeeded by the second generation of [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] (1866–1925), [[Harold Joachim|H. H. Joachim]] (1868–1938), [[John Henry Muirhead|J. H. Muirhead]] (1855–1940), and [[R. G. Collingwood]] (1889-1943). The last major figure in the tradition was [[Geoffrey Reginald Gilchrist Mure|G. R. G. Mure]] (1893–1979). Doctrines of early British idealism so provoked the young Cambridge philosophers [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] that they began a new philosophical tradition, [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Nicholas|title="Russell and Moore’s Revolt against British Idealism", in The Oxford handbook of the history of analytic philosophy, edited by Michael Beaney|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199238842|pages=383-406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Though much more variegated than some commentaries would seem to suggest, British idealism was generally marked by several broad tendencies: a belief in an [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] (a single all-encompassing reality that in some sense formed a coherent and all-inclusive system); the assignment of a high place to [[reason]] as both the faculty by which the Absolute's structure is grasped and as that structure itself; and a fundamental unwillingness to accept a dichotomy between thought and object, reality consisting of thought-and-object together in a strongly coherent unity.

British idealism largely developed from the [[German idealism|German idealist]] movement&amp;mdash;particularly such philosophers as [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], who were characterised by Green, among others, as the salvation of British philosophy after the alleged demise of [[empiricism]]. The movement was certainly a reaction against the thinking of [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], and other empiricists and [[utilitarianism|utilitarians]]. Some of those involved would have denied any specific influence, particularly with respect to Hegel. Nevertheless, [[James Hutchison Stirling]]'s book ''[[The Secret of Hegel]]'' is believed to have won significant converts in Britain.

British idealism was influenced by Hegel at least in broad outline, and undeniably adopted some of Hegel's terminology and doctrines. Examples include not only the aforementioned Absolute, but also a [[doctrine of internal relations]], a [[coherentism|coherence theory of truth]], and a concept of a [[concrete universal]]. Some commentators have also pointed to a sort of dialectical structure in e.g. some of the writings of Bradley. But few of the British idealists adopted Hegel's philosophy wholesale, and his most significant writings on [[logic]] seem to have found no purchase whatsoever in their thought. On the other hand, [[Geoffrey Reginald Gilchrist Mure|Mure]] was “a deep student of Hegel”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

who “was committed to Hegel’s ‘central ontological thesis’ all his life.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

On its political side, the British idealists were largely concerned to refute what they regarded as a brittle and "atomistic" form of [[individualism]], as espoused by e.g. [[Herbert Spencer]]. In their view, humans are fundamentally social beings in a manner and to a degree not adequately recognized by Spencer and his followers. The British Idealists did not, however, reify the State in the manner that Hegel apparently did; Green in particular spoke of the individual as the sole locus of value and contended that the State's existence was justified only insofar as it contributed to the realization of value in the lives of individual persons.

The hold of British idealism in the United Kingdom weakened when Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore, who were educated in the British idealist tradition, turned against it. Moore in particular delivered what quickly came to be accepted as conclusive arguments against Idealism. In the late 1950s G. R. G. Mure, in his ''Retreat From Truth'' (Oxford 1958), criticized Russell, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and aspects of analytic philosophy from an idealist point of view.

British idealism's influence in the [[United States]] was somewhat limited. The early thought of [[Josiah Royce]] had something of a neo-Hegelian cast, as did that of a handful of his less famous contemporaries. The American rationalist [[Brand Blanshard]] was so strongly influenced by Bradley, Bosanquet, and Green (and other British philosophers) that he could almost be classified as a British philosopher himself. Even this limited influence, though, petered out through the latter half of the twentieth century. However, from the 1990s on, there has been a significant revival in interest in these ideas, as evidenced by, for instance, by the founding of the Michael Oakeshott Association, and renewed attention to the work of Collingwood, Green, and Bosanquet.

[[File:Maskowanie.JPEG|thumb|upright=1.5|A soldier applying camouflage face paint; both helmet and jacket are [[disruptive coloration|disruptively patterned]].|alt=photo of a soldier putting on camouflage face paint]]

'''Camouflage''' is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see ([[crypsis]]), or by disguising them as something else ([[mimicry|mimesis]]). Examples include the [[leopard]]'s spotted coat, the [[battledress]] of a modern [[soldier]], and the [[leaf-mimic katydid]]'s wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast [[disruptive coloration]], eliminating shadow, and [[countershading]]. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the [[bioluminescence|ability to produce light]] is among other things used for [[counter-illumination]] on the undersides of [[cephalopod]]s such as [[squid]]. Some animals, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[octopus]]es, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. It is possible that some plants use camouflage to evade being eaten by [[herbivore]]s.

[[Military camouflage]] was spurred by the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate [[musket]] with the [[rifle]] made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the [[First World War]]. On land, artists such as [[André Mare]] designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees. [[Ship camouflage|At sea]], merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in [[dazzle camouflage|dazzle]] patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the [[Second World War]], a variety of camouflage schemes were used for [[aircraft camouflage|aircraft]] and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.

Non-military use of camouflage includes making [[cell site|cell telephone towers]] less obtrusive and helping hunters to approach wary game animals. Patterns derived from military camouflage are frequently used in fashion clothing, exploiting their strong designs and sometimes their symbolism. Camouflage themes recur in modern art, and both figuratively and literally in science fiction and works of literature.

In ancient Greece, [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) commented on the colour-changing abilities, both for camouflage and for [[Signalling theory|signalling]], of [[cephalopod]]s including the octopus, in his ''[[Historia animalium]]'':&lt;ref name=Aristotle&gt;Aristotle (c. 350 BC).

Camouflage has been a topic of interest and research in [[zoology]] for well over a century. According to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[natural selection]],{{sfn|Darwin|1859}} features such as camouflage [[evolution|evolved]] by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage, enabling them to leave more offspring, on average, than other members of the same [[species]]. In his ''[[Origin of Species]]'', Darwin wrote:{{sfn|Darwin|1859|page=84}}

{{quote|When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the [[red grouse|red-grouse]] the colour of [[Calluna vulgaris|heather]], and the [[black grouse|black-grouse]] that of [[peat]]y earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from [[birds of prey]]; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey, so much so, that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant.{{sfn|Darwin|1859|page=84}}}}

The English zoologist [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] studied [[animal coloration]], especially camouflage. In his 1890 book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', he classified different types such as "special protective resemblance" (where an animal looks like another object), or "general aggressive resemblance" (where a predator blends in with the background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallowtailed moth [[pupae]] were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as [[larvae]].{{sfn|Poulton|1890|page=111}}{{efn|A letter from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to Darwin of March 8, 1868 mentioned such colour change: "Would you like to see the specimens of pupæ of butterflies whose colours have changed in accordance with the colour of the surrounding objects?

Wood]], who bred them, would, I am sure, be delighted to bring them to show you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;itemID=F1592.1&amp;viewtype=text |title=Alfred Russel Wallace Letters and Reminiscences By James Marchant |publisher=Darwin Online |date=8 March 1868 |access-date=29 March 2013 |author=Alfred Russel Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Poulton's "general protective resemblance"{{sfn|Poulton|1890|page=Fold-out after p. 339}} was at that time considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when [[Frank Evers Beddard]] wrote in 1892 that "tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of [[parrot]]s, [[iguana]]s, [[tree frog|tree-frogs]], and the [[Morelia viridis|green tree-snake]] are examples".{{sfn|Beddard|1892|page=83}} Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the "alluring coloration" of the [[Hymenopus bicornis|flower mantis]] and the possibility of a different mechanism in the [[Anthocharis cardamines|orange tip butterfly]]. He wrote that "the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant [an [[umbellifer]]], so close is their mutual resemblance."{{sfn|Beddard|1892|page=87}}{{efn|Cott explains Beddard's observation as a coincident disruptive pattern.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=74–75}}}} He also explained the coloration of sea fish such as the [[mackerel]]: "Among [[pelagic]] fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below."{{sfn|Beddard|1892|page=122}}

[[File:PeacockInTheWoods.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abbott Thayer]]'s 1907 painting ''Peacock in the Woods'' depicted a [[peacock]] as if it were camouflaged.]]

The artist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] formulated what is sometimes called Thayer's Law, the principle of [[countershading]].{{sfn|Thayer|1909}} However, he overstated the case in the 1909 book ''[[Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom]]'', arguing that "All patterns and colors whatsoever of all animals that ever preyed or are preyed on are under certain normal circumstances obliterative" (that is, cryptic camouflage), and that "Not one '[[mimicry]]' mark, not one '[[aposematism|warning color]]'...&amp;nbsp;nor any '[[sexual selection|sexually selected]]' color, exists anywhere in the world where there is not every reason to believe it the very best conceivable device for the concealment of its wearer",{{sfn|Forbes|2009|page=77}}{{sfn|Thayer|1909|pages=5, 16}} and using paintings such as ''Peacock in the Woods'' (1907) to reinforce his argument.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=132–133}} Thayer was roundly mocked for these views by critics including [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Patrick |title=Cubist Slugs.

The English zoologist [[Cott, H. B.|Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' corrected Thayer's errors, sometimes sharply: "Thus we find Thayer straining the theory to a fantastic extreme in an endeavour to make it cover almost every type of coloration in the animal kingdom."{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=172–173}} Cott built on Thayer's discoveries, developing a comprehensive view of camouflage based on "maximum disruptive contrast", countershading and hundreds of examples. The book explained how disruptive camouflage worked, using streaks of boldly contrasting colour, paradoxically making objects less visible by breaking up their outlines.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=47–67}} While Cott was more systematic and balanced in his view than Thayer, and did include some experimental evidence on the effectiveness of camouflage,{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=174–186}} his 500-page textbook was, like Thayer's, mainly a [[natural history]] narrative which illustrated theories with examples.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=153–155}}

Camouflage is a soft-tissue feature that is rarely preserved in the [[fossil]] record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the [[Cretaceous]] period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin, reveal that both [[leatherback turtle]]s and [[mosasaur]]s had dark backs and light bellies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Skin pigmentation provides evidence of convergent melanism in extinct marine reptiles |authors=Lindgren, Johan; Sjövall, Peter; Carney, Ryan M.; Udval, Per; Gren, Johan A.; Dyke, Gareth; Schultz, Bo Pagh; Shawkey, Matthew D.; Barnes, Kenneth R.; Polcyn, Michael J. |journal=Nature |date=February 2014 |volume=506 |pages=484–488 |doi=10.1038/nature12899 |pmid=24402224 |issue=7489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental evidence that camouflage helps prey avoid being detected by [[predator]]s was first provided in 2016, when ground-nesting birds ([[plovers]] and [[coursers]]) were shown to survive according to how well their egg contrast matched the local environment.&lt;ref name="TrosciankoWilson-AggarwalStevensSpottiswoode2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Troscianko | first=Jolyon | last2=Wilson-Aggarwal | first2=Jared | last3=Stevens | first3=Martin | author3link=Martin Stevens (biologist) | last4=Spottiswoode | first4=Claire N. | title=Camouflage predicts survival in ground-nesting birds | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=6 | issue=1 | date=29 January 2016| doi=10.1038/srep19966 | pmid=26822039 | pmc=4731810 | page=19966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
[[File:2005-Draco-dussumieri.jpg|''[[Draco dussumieri]]'' uses several methods of camouflage, including disruptive coloration, lying flat, and concealment of shadow. |thumb|upright=0.7|alt=photo of a Draco dussumieri on a tree trunk, very hard to see]]
{{further|List of camouflage methods}}

Camouflage can be achieved by different methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on their own or in combination.

===Crypsis===
{{see also|Crypsis}}

[[Crypsis]] means making the animal or military equipment hard to see (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent). Visual crypsis can be achieved in many different ways, such as by living underground or by being active only at night, as well as by a variety of methods of camouflage.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=50–51 and passim}}

====Resemblance to surroundings====
Some animals' colours and patterns resemble a particular natural background. This is an important component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling [[parakeet]]s are mainly green; [[woodcock]]s of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed [[bittern]]s are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=5–19}}{{sfn|Forbes|2009|page=51}} Similarly, [[Xerocole|desert animals]] are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the [[gerbil]] or [[fennec fox]], birds such as the [[desert lark]] or [[sandgrouse]], or reptiles like the [[skink]] or [[Cerastes (genus)|horned viper]].{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=5–6}}Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example [[khaki]] uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.{{sfn|Newark|2007|pages=45–46}}Many{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=17}} moths show [[industrial melanism]], including the [[Biston betularia|peppered moth]] which has coloration that blends in with tree bark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins Wild Guide: Butterflies and Moths |publisher=HarperCollins |author=Still, J. |year=1996 |page=158 |isbn=978-0-00-220010-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coloration of these insects [[Peppered moth evolution|evolved between 1860 and 1940]] to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=17}}{{efn|Before 1860, unpolluted tree trunks were often covered in pale [[lichen]]s; polluted trunks were bare, and often nearly black.}} This is taken by zoologists as [[Coloration evidence for natural selection|evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection]], as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=17}}

====Disruptive coloration====

{{main|disruptive coloration}}
[[File:Disruptive Coloration by Hugh Cott 1940.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the principle of "maximum disruptive contrast" by [[Hugh Cott]], 1940]]

Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{cite book |title=Transportation and Cargo Security: Threats and Solutions |publisher=Prentice Hall |author=Sweet, K.

The presence of bold skin markings does not in itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour.&lt;ref name=Roosevelt&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/470 |title=Revealing and concealing coloration in birds and mammals |author=Roosevelt, Theodore |authorlink=Theodore Roosevelt |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |year=1911 |volume=30 |issue=Article 8 |pages=119–231}} Roosevelt attacks Thayer on page 191, arguing that neither zebra nor giraffe are "'adequately obliterated' by countershading or coloration pattern or anything else."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although [[giraffe]]s have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are very conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres distance.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mitchell, G. |author2=Skinner, J. D. |year=2003 |title=On the origin, evolution and phylogeny of giraffes ''Giraffa camelopardalis'' |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa |volume=58 |issue= 1 |pages=51–73 |doi=10.1080/00359190309519935 |url=http://www.bringyou.to/GiraffeEvolution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2003"/&gt; A different explanation is implied by young giraffes being far more vulnerable to predation than adults: more than half of all giraffe calves die within a year,&lt;ref name="Mitchell2003"/&gt; and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the presence of a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be very well camouflaged; this is supported by coat markings being strongly inherited.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2003"/&gt;

The possibility of camouflage in plants has been little studied until the late 20th century. Leaf [[variegation]] with white spots may serve as camouflage in forest [[understory]] plants, where there is a dappled background; leaf mottling is correlated with closed habitats. Disruptive camouflage would have a clear evolutionary advantage in plants: they would tend to escape from being eaten by [[herbivore]]s. Another possibility is that some plants have leaves differently coloured on upper and lower surfaces or on parts such as veins and stalks to make green-camouflaged insects conspicuous, and thus benefit the plants by favouring the removal of herbivores by carnivores. These hypotheses are testable.&lt;ref name="Lev-Yadun 2003 pp. 483–489"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lev-Yadun | first=Simcha | title=Why do some thorny plants resemble green zebras? | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=224 | issue=4 | year=2003 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00196-6 | pages=483–489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lev-Yadun |first=Simcha |year=2006 |title=Defensive coloration in plants: a review of current ideas about anti-herbivore coloration strategies |work=Floriculture, ornamental and plant biotechnology: advances and topical issues.

====Eliminating shadow====
[[File:Counteracting shadow.svg|thumb|Camouflaged animals and vehicles are readily given away by their shapes and shadows. A flange helps to hide the shadow and a pale fringe breaks up and averages out any shadow that remains.]]

Some animals, such as the horned lizards of North America, have evolved elaborate measures to eliminate [[shadow]]. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under the edge of the body.&lt;ref name="Sherbrooke"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America |publisher=University of California Press |author=Sherbrooke, W.

When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape.&lt;ref name="Sherbrooke"/&gt; Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, ''[[Pararge aegeria]]'', minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=104–105}} Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=104–105}} Eliminating shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="TTT"&gt;{{cite journal |author=U.S. War Department |title=Principles of Camouflage |journal=Tactical and Technical Trends |date=November 1943 |issue=37 |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt09/camouflage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Distractive camouflage}}

Many prey animals have conspicuous high-contrast markings which paradoxically attract the predator's gaze.{{efn|These distraction markings are sometimes called dazzle markings, but have nothing to do with motion dazzle or wartime dazzle painting.}}&lt;ref name="StevensMerilaita2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=M. |last2=Merilaita |first2=S. |title=Defining disruptive coloration and distinguishing its functions |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1516 |year=2009 |pages=481–488 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0216|pmid=18990673 |pmc=2674077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[distractive markings]] serve as camouflage by distracting the predator's attention from recognising the prey as a whole, for example by keeping the predator from identifying the prey's outline.

====Self-decoration====
{{main|Self-decoration}}

Some animals actively seek to hide by decorating themselves with materials such as twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a [[caddis fly]] larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a [[Naxia tumida|decorator crab]] covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=50–51 and passim}} The [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] of the predatory [[Reduvius personatus|masked bug]] uses its hind legs and a '[[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles ([[trichome]]s) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wierauch, C. |year=2006 |title=Anatomy of disguise: camouflaging structures in nymphs of Some Reduviidae (Heteroptera) |journal=American Museum Novitates |volume=3542 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1206/0003-0082(2006)3542[1:AODCSI]2.0.CO;2|hdl=2246/5820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bates |first=Mary |title=Natural Bling: 6 Amazing Animals That Decorate Themselves |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150610-animals-camouflage-decoration-bugs-science |publisher=National Geographic |access-date=11 June 2015|date=2015-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar principles can be applied for military purposes, for instance when a [[sniper]] wears a [[ghillie suit]] designed to be further camouflaged by decoration with materials such as tufts of grass from the sniper's immediate environment. Such suits were used as early as 1916, the British army having adopted "coats of motley hue and stripes of paint" for snipers.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=102–103}} Cott takes the example of the larva of the [[blotched emerald]] moth, which fixes a screen of fragments of leaves to its specially hooked bristles, to argue that military camouflage uses the same method, pointing out that the "device is ... essentially the same as one widely practised during the Great War for the concealment, not of caterpillars, but of caterpillar-tractors, [gun] battery positions, observation posts and so forth."{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=360}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ruxton |first1=Graeme D. |author1link=Graeme Ruxton |last2=Stevens |first2=Martin |author2link=Martin Stevens (biologist) |title=The evolutionary ecology of decorating behaviour |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/6/20150325 |journal=Biology Letters |date=1 June 2015 |page=20150325 |volume=11 |issue=6 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2015.0325|pmid=26041868 |pmc=4528480 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cryptic behaviour====
[[File:Leafy Seadragon Phycodurus eques 2500px PLW edit.jpg|thumb|The [[leafy sea dragon]] sways like seaweeds to reinforce its camouflage.]]
Movement catches the eye of prey animals on the lookout for predators, and of predators hunting for prey.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=141}} Most methods of crypsis therefore also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, or in the case of stalking predators such as the [[tiger]], moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=141}} As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2003/&gt; The [[flat-tail horned lizard]] similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators.&lt;ref name="HLCS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hornedlizards.org/horned-lizards.html |publisher=Horned Lizard Conservation Society |work=hornedlizards.org |title=What is a Horned Lizard? |access-date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ocean, the [[leafy sea dragon]] sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/teacher_resources/best_place_species/current_top_10/leafy_sea_dragon.cfm |title=Leafy Sea Dragon |publisher=WWF |access-date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, ''[[Extatosoma tiaratum]]''. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.&lt;ref name="Bian2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bian |first1=Xue |last2=Elgar |first2=Mark A. |last3=Peters |first3=Richard A. |title=The swaying behavior of Extatosoma tiaratum: motion camouflage in a stick insect? |journal=Behavioral Ecology |date=2016 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=83–92 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arv125 |url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/1/83/1742619/The-swaying-behavior-of-Extatosoma-tiaratum-motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motion camouflage====
{{main|Motion camouflage}}
[[File:Motion Camouflage Principle.svg|thumb|Comparison of motion camouflage and classical pursuit]]

Most forms of camouflage are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily seen by the observing predator, prey or enemy.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=141–143}} However, insects such as [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]]&lt;ref name="Srinivasan and Davey"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Strategies for active camouflage of motion |author1=Srinivasan, M.

[[File:Melanophores with dispersed or aggregated melanosomes.svg|thumb|Fish and frog melanophore cells change colour by moving pigment-containing bodies.]]

====Changeable skin coloration====
{{further|Snow camouflage}}

Animals such as [[chameleon]], frog,{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=30–31}} flatfish such as the [[peacock flounder]], squid and [[octopus]] actively change their skin patterns and colours using special [[chromatophore]] cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for [[Signalling theory|signalling]].{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=52, 236}} However, [[Smith's dwarf chameleon]] does use active colour change for camouflage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stuart-Fox |first1=Devi |last2=Moussalli |first2=Adnan |last3=Whiting |first3=Martin J. |title=Predator-specific camouflage in chameleons |journal=Biology Letters |date=23 August 2008 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=326–9 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0173 |pmid=18492645 |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/4/326|pmc=2610148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peacock Flounder Bothus mancus in Kona.jpg|thumb|left|Four frames of the same [[peacock flounder]] taken a few minutes apart, showing its ability to match its coloration to the environment]]
Each chromatophore contains pigment of only one colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated by the type of chromatophores known as [[melanophore]]s that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented [[organelle]]s which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.&lt;ref name="Wallin"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bioscience-explained.org/ENvol1_2/pdf/paletteEN.pdf |title=Nature's Palette |journal=Bioscience Explained |year=2002 |access-date=17 November 2011 |author=Wallin, M. |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skins of [[cephalopods]] such as the octopus contain complex units, each consisting of a chromatophore with surrounding muscle and nerve cells.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=32}} The cephalopod chromatophore has all its pigment grains in a small elastic sac, which can be stretched or allowed to relax under the control of the brain to vary its opacity. By controlling chromatophores of different colours, cephalopods can rapidly change their skin patterns and colours.&lt;ref name="Cloney"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ultrastructure of Cephalopod Chromatophore Organs |author1=Cloney, R. A. |author2=Florey, E. |journal=Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=250–280 |year=1968 |pmid=5700268 |doi=10.1007/BF00347297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=553 |title=Day Octopuses, Octopus cyanea |publisher=MarineBio Conservation Society |access-date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a longer timescale, animals like the [[Arctic hare]], [[Arctic fox]], [[stoat]], and [[rock ptarmigan]] have [[snow camouflage]], changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey in the summer to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the [[Canidae|dog family]] to do so.&lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://churchillpolarbears.org/churchill/arctic-wildlife |title=Arctic Wildlife |publisher=Churchill Polar Bears |year=2011 |access-date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of [[Canada]], where summer is very short, remain white year-round.&lt;ref name="Churchill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ParksCanada"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Status of Arctic Hare (Lepus arcticus bangsii) in Insular Newfoundland |url=http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/wildlife/endangeredspecies/ssac/arctic_hare.pdf |publisher=Newfoundland Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation |author=Hearn, Brian |date=20 February 2012 |access-date=3 February 2013 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of varying coloration either rapidly or with the changing seasons has military applications. ''[[Active camouflage]]'' could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple methods such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since World War II. In 2011, [[BAE Systems]] announced their [[Adaptiv]] infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The [[Peltier plate]] panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14788009 |journal=BBC News |title=Tanks test infrared invisibility cloak |date=5 September 2011 |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adaptiv-Cloak&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baesystems.com/en/feature/adativ-cloak-of-invisibility |title=Adaptiv – A Cloak of Invisibility |publisher=BAE Systems |year=2011 |access-date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baesystems.com/en/feature/adativ-cloak-of-invisibility#! |title=Innovation Adaptiv Car Signature |publisher=BAE Systems |year=2012 |access-date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Countershading====
{{main|Countershading}}
[[File:Countershading.svg|thumb|Countershading acts as a form of camouflage by 'painting out' the self-shadowing of the body or object. The result is a 'flat' appearance, instead of the 'solid' appearance of the body before countershading.]]

Countershading uses graded colour to counteract the effect of self-shadowing, creating an illusion of flatness. Self-shadowing makes an animal appear darker below than on top, grading from light to dark; countershading 'paints in' tones which are darkest on top, lightest below, making the countershaded animal nearly invisible against a suitable background.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=35–46}} Thayer observed that "Animals are painted by Nature, darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and ''vice versa''". Accordingly, the principle of countershading is sometimes called ''Thayer's Law''.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=72–73}} Countershading is widely used by [[terrestrial animals]], such as [[gazelle]]s&lt;ref name=Kiltie&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169534788900791 |title=Countershading: Universally deceptive or deceptively universal? |author=Kiltie, Richard A. |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=January 1998 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=21–23 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(88)90079-1|pmid=21227055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and grasshoppers; marine animals, such as [[sharks]] and [[Delphinus delphis|dolphins]];{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=41}} and birds, such as [[common snipe|snipe]] and [[dunlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Color_of_Birds.html |title=The Color of Birds |publisher=Stanford University |year=1988 |access-date=1 February 2013 |author1=Ehrlich, Paul R. |author2=Dobkin, David S. |author3=Wheye, Darryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=40}}

Countershading is less often used for military camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English [[zoologist]] [[Hugh Cott]] encouraged the use of methods including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=146–150}} Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting as a kind of invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from an enemy observer's viewpoint.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|page=152}}{{sfn|Barkas|1952|page=36}} At the same time in [[Australia]], zoologist [[William John Dakin]] advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.{{sfn|Elias|2011|pages=57–66}}

The term countershading has a second meaning unrelated to "Thayer's Law". It is that the upper and undersides of animals such as sharks, and of some military aircraft, are different colours to match the different backgrounds when seen from above or from below. Here the camouflage consists of two surfaces, each with the simple function of providing concealment against a specific background, such as a bright water surface or the sky. The body of a shark or the fuselage of an aircraft is not gradated from light to dark to appear flat when seen from the side. The camouflage methods used are the matching of background colour and pattern, and disruption of outlines.&lt;ref name=Kiltie/&gt;

====Counter-illumination====
[[File:Squid Counterillumination.png|thumb|Principle of [[counter-illumination]] in the [[Watasenia scintillans|firefly squid]]]]
{{main|Counter-illumination}}

Counter-illumination means producing light to match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it is a form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of [[squid]], such as the [[Watasenia scintillans|firefly squid]] and the [[Abralia veranyi|midwater squid]]. The latter has light-producing organs ([[photophores]]) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.&lt;ref name="Abralia with photo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi |title=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History |access-date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the [[bioluminescence]] of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1983/00000033/00000004/art00003 |title=Oceanic Bioluminescence: an Overview of General Functions |author=Young, Richard Edward |journal=Bulletin of Marine Science |date=October 1983 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=829–845}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to detect prey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Long-wave sensitivity in deep-sea stomiid dragonfish with far-red bioluminescence: evidence for a dietary origin of the chlorophyll-derived retinal photosensitizer of Malacosteus niger |author1=Douglas, R.

Counterillumination has rarely been used for military purposes. "[[Diffused lighting camouflage]]" was trialled by Canada's [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] during the Second World War. It involved projecting light on to the sides of ships to match the faint glow of the night sky, requiring awkward external platforms to support the lamps.&lt;ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/NMQ_MNQ/researches_recherches/diffusedLighting_camouflageLumineux/index-eng.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522231113/http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/NMQ_MNQ/researches_recherches/diffusedLighting_camouflageLumineux/index-eng.asp |archive-date=22 May 2013 |work=Naval Museum of Quebec |publisher=Royal Canadian Navy |title=Diffused Lighting and its use in the Chaleur Bay |access-date=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian concept was refined in the American [[Yehudi lights]] project, and trialled in aircraft including [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]] and naval [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Avengers]].&lt;ref name="Hambling"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hambling |first=David |title=Cloak of Light Makes Drone Invisible? |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/05/invisible-drone |publisher=Wired |access-date=17 June 2012 |date=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planes were fitted with forward-pointing lamps automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the night sky.&lt;ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec"/&gt; This enabled them to approach much closer to a target – within 3,000&amp;nbsp;yards (2,700&amp;nbsp;metres) – before being seen.&lt;ref name="Hambling"/&gt; Counterillumination was made obsolete by [[radar]], and neither diffused lighting camouflage nor Yehudi lights entered active service.&lt;ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec"/&gt;

====Transparency====
[[File:Expl0469 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Many animals of the open sea, like this ''[[Aurelia labiata]]'' jellyfish, are largely transparent.]]

Many [[Sea|marine]] animals that float near the surface are highly [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], giving them almost perfect camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from seawater. Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick [[Mesoglea|mesogloea]] is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}

[[File:Hyalinobatrachium uranoscopum01a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Glass frogs]] like ''[[Hyalinobatrachium uranoscopum]]'' use partial transparency for camouflage in the dim light of the rainforest.]]
Some tissues such as [[muscle]]s can be made transparent, provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. A familiar example is the transparency of the lens of the vertebrate [[eye]], which is made of the protein [[crystallin]], and the vertebrate [[cornea]] which is made of the protein [[collagen]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the [[retina]]s or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes – they must absorb light to be able to function. The [[camera]]-type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the [[nematocyst]]s (stinging cells) of the transparent [[siphonophore]] ''[[Agalma okenii]]'' resemble small [[copepod]]s.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of [[larva]]e, including [[radiata]] (coelenterates), siphonophores, [[salps]] (floating [[tunicate]]s), [[gastropoda|gastropod molluscs]], [[polychaete]] worms, many shrimplike [[crustacean]]s, and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} Adult [[comb jelly|comb jellies]] and jellyfish obey the rule, often being mainly transparent. Cott suggests this follows the more general rule that animals resemble their background: in a transparent medium like seawater, that means being transparent.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} The small [[Amazon river]] fish ''[[Microphilypnus amazonicus]]'' and the shrimps it associates with, ''[[Pseudopalaemon gouldingi]]'', are so transparent as to be "almost invisible"; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled (disruptively patterned) according to the local background in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-62252006000200008&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=The almost invisible league: crypsis and association between minute fishes and shrimps as a possible defence against visually hunting predators |author1=Carvalho, Lucélia Nobre |author2=Zuanon, Jansen |author3=Sazima, Ivan |journal=Neotropical Ichthyology |date=April–June 2006 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=219–224 |doi=10.1590/S1679-62252006000200008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silvering====
[[File:Herringadultkils2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The adult herring, ''[[Clupea harengus]]'', is a typical silvered fish of medium depths, camouflaged by reflection.]]
[[File:Herring Silvering.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|The herring's reflectors are nearly vertical for camouflage from the side.]]

Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as [[sardine]] and [[herring]] are camouflaged by silvering.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=192–195}}

The [[marine hatchetfish]] is extremely flattened laterally, leaving the body just millimetres thick, and the body is so silvery as to resemble [[aluminium foil]]. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide [[structural coloration]]: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of [[guanine]] spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=192–195}}

In fish such as the herring which live in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=192–195}} Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The [[cephalopods]], including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=192–195}}

===Motion dazzle===
[[File:Chapman-Zebra.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|The [[zebra]]'s bold pattern may induce motion dazzle in observers]]

Most forms of camouflage are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes.&lt;ref name=Scott-Samuel/&gt; Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape.&lt;ref name=StevensMotionDazzle&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/81/abstract |journal=BMC Biology |volume=9 |pages=9–81 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81 |pmid=22117898 |pmc=3257203 |title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses |date=25 November 2011 |author1=Stevens, Martin |author1link=Martin Stevens (biologist) |author2=Searle, W.

A. |author5=Ruxton, Graeme D. |author5link=Graeme Ruxton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target).

An animal that is commonly thought to be dazzle-patterned is the [[zebra]]. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage,{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=94}} background-blending and countershading.{{sfn|Thayer|1909|page=136}}{{efn|The belly of the zebra is white, and the dark stripes narrow towards the belly, so the animal is certainly countershaded, but this does not prove that the main function of the stripes is camouflage.}} After many years in which the purpose of the coloration was disputed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Contrasting coloration in terrestrial mammals |author=Caro, Tim |authorlink=Tim Caro |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |year=2009 |volume=364 |pages=537–548 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0221 |pmc=2674080 |issue=1516 |pmid=18990666}}&lt;/ref&gt; an experimental study by [[Tim Caro]] suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as [[Horse-fly|horseflies]] and [[Tsetse fly|tsetse flies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waage, J.

Ship camouflage was occasionally used in ancient times. [[Philostratus]] (c. 172–250 AD) wrote in his ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' that Mediterranean pirate ships could be painted blue-gray for concealment.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pages=211–212}}[[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]] (c. 360–400 AD) says that "Venetian blue" (sea green) was used in the [[Gallic Wars]], when [[Julius Caesar]] sent his ''speculatoria navigia'' (reconnaissance boats) to gather intelligence along the coast of Britain; the ships were painted entirely in bluish-green wax, with sails, ropes and crew the same colour.{{sfn|Casson|1995|page=235}} There is little evidence of military use of camouflage on land before 1800, but two unusual ceramics show men in [[Peru]]'s [[Mochica]] culture from before 500 AD, hunting birds with blowpipes which are fitted with a kind of shield near the mouth, perhaps to conceal the hunters' hands and faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jett, Stephen C. |date=March 1991 |title=Further Information on the Geography of the Blowgun and Its Implications for Early Transoceanic Contacts |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=89–102 |jstor=2563673 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1991.tb01681.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early source is a 15th-century French manuscript, ''The Hunting Book of Gaston Phebus'', showing a horse pulling a cart which contains a hunter armed with a crossbow under a cover of branches, perhaps serving as a hide for shooting game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Crossbow |publisher=Longmans, Green |author=Payne-Gallwey, Ralph |year=1903 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamaican Maroons]] are said to have used plant materials as camouflage in the [[First Maroon War]] (c. 1655–1740).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Saunders, Nicholas |title=The People of the Caribbean: An Encyclopedia of Archaeology and Traditional Culture |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green jacketed rifleman firing Baker rifle 1803.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Green-jacketed rifleman]] firing [[Baker rifle]] 1803]]
The development of military camouflage was driven by the increasing range and accuracy of infantry firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate [[musket]] with weapons such as the [[Baker rifle]] made personal concealment in battle essential. Two [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic War]] skirmishing units of the [[British Army]], the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Rifle Regiment]] and the 60th Rifle Regiment, were the first to adopt camouflage in the form of a [[rifle green]] jacket, while the Line regiments continued to wear scarlet tunics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Haythornthwaite, P. |title=British Rifleman 1797–1815 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year=2002 |page=20 |isbn=978-1841761770}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary study in 1800 by the English artist and soldier [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] provided evidence that grey uniforms were less visible than green ones at a range of 150 yards.{{sfn|Newark|2007|page=43}}

In the [[American Civil War]], rifle units such as the 1st United States Sharp Shooters (in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Federal]] army) similarly wore green jackets while other units wore more conspicuous colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/killers-in-green-coats.htm |title=Killers in Green Coats |publisher=Weider History Group |date=20 February 2008 |access-date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first British Army unit to adopt [[khaki (colour)|khaki]] uniforms was the [[Corps of Guides (British India)|Corps of Guides]] at [[Peshawar]], when [[Harry Burnett Lumsden|Sir Harry Lumsden]] and his second in command, [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]] introduced a "drab" uniform in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Khaki Uniform 1848-49: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson |journal=Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research |year=2004 |volume=82 |issue=Winter |pages=341–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodson wrote that it would be more appropriate for the hot climate, and help make his troops "invisible in a land of dust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India, being extracts from the letters of the late Major WSR Hodson |publisher=John W.

====Second World War====

In the [[Second World War]], the zoologist Hugh Cott, a [[protégé]] of Kerr, worked to persuade the British army to use more effective camouflage methods, including countershading, but, like Kerr and Thayer in the First World War, with limited success. For example, he painted two rail-mounted coastal guns, one in conventional style, one [[Countershading|countershaded]]. In aerial photographs, the countershaded gun was essentially invisible.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|pages=149–150}} The power of aerial observation and attack led every warring nation to camouflage targets of all types. The [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] created the comprehensive [[military doctrine|doctrine]] of ''[[Russian military deception|Maskirovka]]'' for military deception, including the use of camouflage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a112903.pdf |title=Maskirovka: The Soviet System of Camouflage |publisher=U.S. Army Russian Institute |year=1981 |access-date=8 July 2012 |author=Keating, Kenneth C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the [[Battle of Kursk]], [[Mikhail Katukov|General Katukov]], the commander of the Soviet 1st Tank Army, remarked that the enemy "did not suspect that our well-camouflaged tanks were waiting for him. As we later learned from prisoners, we had managed to move our tanks forward unnoticed". The tanks were concealed in previously prepared defensive emplacements, with only their turrets above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kursk: the greatest battle |publisher=Headline Review |author=Clark, Lloyd |year=2011 |page=278 |isbn=978-0-7553-3639-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the air, Second World War fighters were often painted in ground colours above and sky colours below, attempting two different camouflage schemes for observers above and below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Robert L. |title=Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering |year=1985 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |isbn=978-0-87021-059-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombers and night fighters were often black,&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Hubert Kirk (1948).

Vehicle camouflage methods begin with paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised materials such as blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb [[near infrared]] and [[radar]] waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.enlistment.us/field-manuals/series-2/FM21_305/TOC.PDF |title=FM 21-305/AFMAN 24-306 |work=Chapter 20: Vehicle Camouflage And Nuclear, Biological, And Chemical Operations |access-date=16 June 2012 |pages=1–9 |publisher=Department of the Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/5-103/APPD.HTM |title=5–103 |work=Appendix D: Camouflage |access-date=17 June 2012 |publisher=Department of the Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armedforces-int.com/suppliers/multispectral-camouflage.html |title=SSZ Camouflage |publisher=Military Suppliers &amp; News |year=2012 |access-date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from [[image intensification|night vision]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Color Stability of Olive Drab Infrared-Reflecting Camouflage Finishes |author1=Jukkola, E.

After the Second World War, radar made camouflage generally less effective, though coastal boats are sometimes painted like land vehicles.&lt;ref name=Sumrall/&gt; [[Aircraft camouflage]] too came to be seen as less important because of radar, and aircraft of different air forces, such as the Royal Air Force's [[English Electric Lightning|Lightning]], were often uncamouflaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richardson, Doug |title=Stealth Warplanes: Deception, Evasion, and Concealment in the Air |publisher=MBI Publishing, Zenith Press |year=2001 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/118487425/Stealth-Warplanes |isbn=978-0-7603-1051-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[List of camouflage patterns|camouflaged textile patterns]] have been developed to suit the need to match [[Battledress|combat clothing]] to different kinds of terrain (such as woodland, snow, and desert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_853_pfanner.pdf |title=Military uniforms and the law of war |author=Pfanner, Toni |journal=IRRC |date=March 2004 |volume=86 |issue=853 |pages=99–100 |doi=10.1017/s1560775500180113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of a pattern effective in all terrains has proved elusive.&lt;ref name=US-Army&gt;{{cite book |title=FM 21–76 US Army Survival Manual |publisher= Department of the Army |url=https://archive.org/details/Fm21-76SurvivalManual |access-date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Photosimulation Camouflage Detection Test |year=2009 |publisher=U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center |page=27 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19823845/Photosimulation-Camouflage-Detection-Test|access-date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brayley&gt;{{cite book |last=Brayley |first=Martin J |title=Camouflage uniforms: international combat dress 1940–2010 |year=2009 |publisher=Crowood |isbn=978-1-84797-137-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Universal Camouflage Pattern]] of 2004 attempted to suit all environments, but was withdrawn after a few years of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Freedberg, S.

===Hunting===
[[File:Deer blind.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|A [[hunting blind|hide]] used in [[field sports]]]]

Hunters of game have long made use of camouflage in the form of materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals.{{sfn|Newark|2007|page=38}} [[Field sports]] such as [[driven grouse shooting]] conceal hunters in [[hunting blind|hides]] (also called blinds or shooting butts).&lt;ref name=Blakeley2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Blakeley, Peter F. |title=Wingshooting |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2012 |pages=116, 125 |isbn=978-0-8117-0566-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic clothing for hunters, printed with images of specific kinds of vegetation such as grass and branches.{{sfn|Newark|2007|pages=48, 50}}

===Civil structures===
[[File:Camouflaged Microwave Cell Telephone Tower.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.4|Cellphone tower disguised as a tree]]

Camouflage is occasionally used to make built structures less conspicuous: for example, in [[South Africa]], towers carrying cell telephone antennae are sometimes camouflaged as tall trees with plastic branches, in response to "resistance from the community". Since this method is costly (a figure of three times the normal cost is mentioned), alternative forms of camouflage can include using neutral colours or familiar shapes such as cylinders and flagpoles. Conspicuousness can also be reduced by siting masts near, or on, other structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=du Plessis |first=A. |title=Telecommunication Mast Management Guidelines For The City of Tshwane |publisher=[[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] |date=3 July 2002 |url=http://www.tshwane.gov.za/AboutTshwane/CityManagement/CityDepartments/CorporateandSharedServices/legalservices/_layouts/mobile/view.aspx?List=1c67d863-b080-497c-b5e6-5f737c9debda&amp;View=01d8646a-31ab-4506-a31d-76c75e245307&amp;RootFolder=%2FAboutTshwane%2FCityManagement%2FCityDepartments%2FCorporateandSharedServices%2Flegalservices%2FPolicies%20Listing%2FTelkom%20Mast&amp;ViewMode=Detail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automotive manufacturers often use patterns to disguise upcoming products. This camouflage is designed to obfuscate the vehicle's visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns' purpose is to prevent visual observation (and to a lesser degree photography), that would subsequently enable reproduction of the vehicle's form factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The secrets behind all that camouflage |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150512/BLOG06/150519967/the-secrets-behind-all-that-camouflage |publisher=Automotive News |access-date=28 July 2015 |date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion, art and society===
[[File:Dazzle camouflage costume ball.PNG|thumb|The "dazzle ball" held by the Chelsea Arts Club, 1919|alt=1919 dazzle ball costumes]]
Military camouflage patterns influenced [[Fashion design|fashion]] and [[art]] from the time of the First World War onwards. [[Gertrude Stein]] recalled the [[cubism|cubist]] artist [[Pablo Picasso]]'s reaction in around 1915:

{{quote|I very well remember at the beginning of the war being with Picasso on the boulevard Raspail when the first camouflaged truck passed. It was at night, we had heard of camouflage but we had not seen it and Picasso amazed looked at it and then cried out, yes it is we who made it, that is cubism.|Gertrude Stein in ''From Picasso'' (1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.dwc.edu/wellman/Stein-Picasso.html |authors=[[Gertrude Stein|Stein, Gertrude]]; [[Alice B. Toklas|Toklas, Alice B.]] (trans.) |title=Picasso |publisher=Scribners |year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1919, the attendants of a "dazzle ball", hosted by the Chelsea Arts Club, wore dazzle-patterned black and white clothing. The ball influenced fashion and art via postcards and magazine articles.{{sfn|Forbes|2009|page=100}} The ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' announced:{{sfn|Forbes|2009|page=100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Illustrated London News |title=The Great Dazzle Ball at the Albert Hall: The Shower of Bomb Balloons and Some Typical Costumes |date=22 March 1919 |location=No. 154 |pages=414–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The scheme of decoration for the great fancy dress ball given by the Chelsea Arts Club at the Albert Hall, the other day, was based on the principles of "Dazzle", the method of "camouflage" used during the war in the painting of ships&amp;nbsp;... The total effect was brilliant and fantastic.}}

More recently, fashion designers have often used camouflage fabric for its striking designs, its "patterned disorder" and its symbolism.&lt;ref name="Galliano at Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.fitnyc.edu/museum/loveandwar/galliano.htm |title=Love and War: The Weaponized Woman |publisher=The Museum at FIT |work=John Galliano for Christian Dior, silk camouflage evening dress |date=9 September – 16 December 2006 |access-date=1 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212085814/http://www3.fitnyc.edu/museum/loveandwar/galliano.htm |archive-date=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camouflage clothing can be worn largely for its symbolic significance rather than for fashion, as when, during the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States, [[opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war protestors]] often ironically wore military clothing during demonstrations against the American involvement in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/media/news/the-story-of-camouflage-told-at-the-canadian-war-museum-this-summer/ |title=Camouflage: The Exhibition |publisher=Canadian War Museum |date=5 June 2009 |access-date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern artists such as [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] have used camouflage to reflect on war. His 1973 screenprint of a tank camouflaged in a leaf pattern, ''Arcadia'', is described by the [[Tate gallery|Tate]] as drawing "an ironic parallel between this idea of a natural paradise and the camouflage patterns on a tank".&lt;ref name="IanHF-Tate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hamilton-finlay-arcadia-collaboration-with-george-oliver-p07025 |title=Ian Hamilton Finlay: Arcadia (collaboration with George Oliver) |publisher=Tate |work=Arcadia, 1973 |date=July 2008 |access-date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the [[Utopia]]n [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of poetry and art, and the ''[[memento mori]]'' [[Latin phrase]] ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'' which recurs in Hamilton Finlay's work. In [[science fiction]], ''[[Camouflage (novel)|Camouflage]]'' is a novel about [[shapeshifting]] alien beings by [[Joe Haldeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Haldeman, Joe |title=Camouflage |publisher=Ace Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-441-01161-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used more figuratively in works of literature such as Thaisa Frank's collection of stories of love and loss, ''A Brief History of Camouflage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frank, Thaisa |title=A Brief History of Camouflage |publisher=Black Sparrow Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-87685-857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

'''Leonard''' "'''Chico'''" '''Marx''' (March 22, 1887 – October 11, 1961) was an American [[comedian]], musician, actor and film star.&lt;ref  name=NYTobit/&gt; He was a member of the [[Marx Brothers]] (with [[Groucho Marx]], [[Harpo Marx]], and [[Zeppo Marx]]). His persona in the act was that of a charming, uneducated but crafty con artist, seemingly of rural Italian origin, who wore shabby clothes and sported a curly-haired wig and [[Tyrolean hat]]. On screen, Chico is often in alliance with Harpo, usually as partners in crime, and is also frequently seen trying to con or outfox Groucho. Leonard was the oldest of the Marx Brothers to live past early childhood (first-born Manfred Marx had died in infancy). In addition to his work as a performer, he played an important role in the management and development of the act in its early years.

==Early years==
He was born on March 22, 1887.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=age&gt;During his lifetime, his year of birth had commonly been given as 1891 instead of the true year of 1887. As a result, obituaries reported his age at the time of his death as 70 rather than 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Billing himself as Chico, he used an Italian persona for his onstage character; stereotyped ethnic characters were common with vaudevillians. His non-Italian-ness was specifically referred to three times on film. In their second feature, ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', he recognizes someone he knows to be a shady character impersonating a respected art collector:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Ravelli''' (Chico): "How is it you got to be Roscoe W. Chandler?"&lt;br /&gt; '''Chandler''': "Say, how did ''you'' get to be an ''Italian''?"&lt;br /&gt; '''Ravelli''': "Never mind—whose confession is this?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', when Chico impersonates Groucho but retains his accent, [[Margaret Dumont]] asks what happened to his voice. Chico replies, "Well, maybe sometime I go to Italy and I'm practising the language." To which Dumont replies, "Your dialect is perfect."

In ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'', which begins in Italy, his character, Fiorello, claims not to be Italian, eliciting a surprised look from [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Driftwood''' (Groucho): "Well, things certainly seem to be getting better around the country."&lt;br /&gt; '''Fiorello''' (Chico): "Well, I wouldn't know about that; I'm a stranger here myself."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A scene in the film ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'', in which Chico attempts to placate an Indian chief of whom Groucho has run afoul, has a line that plays a bit on Chico's lack of Italian nationality, but is more or less proper Marxian wordplay:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''S. Quentin Quayle''' (Groucho): "Can you talk Indian?"&lt;br&gt;'''Joe Panello''' (Chico): "I was born in Indianapolis!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are moments, however, where Chico's characters appear to be genuinely Italian; examples include the film ''[[The Big Store]]'', in which his character Ravelli runs into an old friend he worked with in Naples (after a brief misunderstanding due to his accent), the film ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'', in which Chico claims his grandfather sailed with [[Christopher Columbus]], and their very first outing ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'', where Mr. Hammer (Groucho) asks him if he knew what an auction was, in which he responds "I come from Italy on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Auction]]!"  Chico's character is often assumed to be dim-witted, as he frequently misunderstands words spoken by other characters (particularly Groucho). However, he often gets the better of the same characters by extorting money from them, either by con or blackmail; again, Groucho is his most frequent target.

Chico was a talented [[pianist]]. He originally started playing with only his right hand and fake playing with his left, as his teacher did so herself. Chico eventually acquired a better teacher and learned to play the piano correctly. As a young boy, he gained jobs playing piano to earn money for the Marx family. Sometimes Chico even worked playing in two places at the same time. He would acquire the first job with his piano-playing skills, work for a few nights, and then substitute [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] on one of the jobs. (During their boyhood, Chico and Harpo looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for each other.)

In the brothers' last film, ''[[Love Happy]]'', Chico plays a piano and [[violin]] [[duet]] with 'Mr. Lyons' ([[Leon Belasco]]). Lyons plays some ornate riffs on the violin; Chico comments, "Look-a, Mister Lyons, I know you wanna make a good impression, but please don't-a play better than me!"

In a record album about the Marx Brothers, narrator [[Gary Owens]] stated that "although Chico's technique was limited, his repertoire was not." The opposite was true of Harpo, who reportedly could play only two tunes on the piano, which typically thwarted Chico's scam and resulted in both brothers' being fired.
[[File:Marx Brothers 1931.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The Marx Brothers, from top: Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo Marx]]
Groucho Marx once said that Chico never practiced the pieces he played. Instead, before performances he soaked his fingers in hot water. He was known for 'shooting' the keys of the piano. He played passages with his thumb up and index finger straight, like a gun, as part of the act. Other examples of his keyboard flamboyance are found in ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935), where he played the piano for a group of delighted children, and ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946), where he played a rendition of "The Beer Barrel Polka".

Chico became the unofficial manager of the [[Marx Brothers]] after their mother, [[Minnie Marx|Minnie]], died in 1929.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; As manager, he cut a deal to get the brothers a percentage of a film's gross receipts—the first of its kind in [[Hollywood]]. Furthermore, it was Chico's connection with [[Irving Thalberg]] of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] that led to Thalberg's signing the Brothers when they were in a career slump after ''Duck Soup'' (1933), the last of their films for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]].

For a while in the 1930s and 1940s, Chico led a [[big band]]. Singer [[Mel Tormé]] began his professional career singing with the Chico Marx Orchestra. Through the 1950s, Chico occasionally appeared on a variety of television anthology shows and some television commercials, most memorably with Harpo in "The Incredible Jewelry Robbery", a pantomime episode of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' in 1959.

===Pronunciation and origin of name===
[[File:Chico Marx The College Bowl 1950.jpg|thumb|Chico was the star of a 1950 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television comedy, ''The College Bowl''. He played the role of a campus malt shop owner who dispensed both sodas and advice to the students.]]
His nickname (acquired during a card game in Chicago in 1915) was originally spelled '''Chicko'''. A typesetter accidentally dropped the "k" in his name and it became Chico.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} It was still pronounced "Chick-oh" although those who were unaware of its origin tended to pronounce it "Cheek-oh". Numerous radio recordings from the 1940s exist where announcers and fellow actors mispronounce the nickname, but Chico apparently felt it was unnecessary to correct them. As late as the 1950s, Groucho was happy to use the wrong pronunciation for comedic effect. A guest on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' told the quizmaster she grew up around [[Chico, California|Chico]] (California) and Groucho responded, "I grew up around Chico myself. You aren't Gummo, are you?"

During Groucho's live performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1972, he states that his brother got the name Chico because he was a "chicken-chaser" (early 20th century slang for womanizer). "In England now, they call them birds."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/OTRR_An_Evening_With_Groucho_Singles/AnEveningWithGroucho_06_MyFamily_HowWeGotOurNames.mp3 Groucho Live At Carnegie Hall]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling===
&lt;!--[[File:Marx Brothers 1948.jpg|right|thumb|[[Marx Brothers|The Marx Brothers]] (clockwise from bottom: Groucho, Chico, and Harpo) by [[Yusuf Karsh]] in 1948]]--&gt;
[[File:Harpo and Chico Marx General Electric Theater 1959.JPG|thumb|right|Harpo and Chico Marx in "The Incredible Jewelry Robbery" on ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' in 1959]]
As well as being a compulsive womanizer, Chico had a lifelong [[gambling]] habit. His favorite gambling pursuits were card games, horse racing, dog racing, and various sports betting. His addiction cost him millions of dollars by his own account. When an interviewer in the late 1930s asked him how much money he had lost from gambling, he answered, "Find out how much money Harpo's got. That's how much I've lost." Gummo Marx, in an interview years after Chico's death, said: "Chico's favorite people were actors who gambled, producers who gambled, and women who screwed." Referring to Chico's love life, [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] quipped, "Chico didn't button his fly until he was seventy."&lt;ref&gt;Bader, Robert S., Four of the Three Musketeers: The Marx Brothers On Stage, Northwestern University Press, 2017, pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Chico's lifelong gambling addiction compelled him to continue in show business long after his brothers had retired in comfort from their Hollywood income, and in the early 1940s he found himself playing in the same small, cheap halls in which he had begun his career 30 years earlier.  The Marx Brothers' penultimate film, ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946), was made for Chico's benefit since he had filed for bankruptcy a few years prior. Because of his out-of-control gambling, the brothers finally took the money as he earned it and put him on an allowance, on which he stayed until his death.

Chico had a reputation as a world-class [[pinochle]] player, a game he and Harpo learned from their father. Groucho said Chico would throw away good cards (with the knowledge of spectators) to make the play "more interesting". Chico's last public appearance was in 1960, playing cards on the television show ''[[Championship Bridge]]''. He and his partner lost the game.

==Personal life==
Chico was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]]. His parents were [[Sam Marx]] (called "Frenchie" throughout his life), and his wife, [[Minnie Marx|Minnie Schoenberg Marx]]. Minnie's brother was [[Al Shean]]. The Marx family was Franco-German Jewish. His father was a native of [[Alsace]] who worked as a tailor and his mother was from [[East Frisia]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm ''La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers''] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Chico was married twice. His first marriage was to Betty Karp in 1917. Their union produced one daughter named Maxine (1918–2009). His first marriage was plagued by his infidelity, ending in divorce in 1940; he was very close to his daughter Maxine and gave her acting lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2009_09_20.html#017760|author=Evanier, Mark|title=News from me|date=September 20, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924174234/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2009_09_20.html|archivedate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chico's second marriage was to Mary De Vithas. They married in 1958, three years before his death.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In the [[46th Academy Awards|1974 Academy Awards telecast]], [[Jack Lemmon]] presented Groucho with an honorary [[Academy Award]] to a standing ovation. The award was also on behalf of Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances.  "I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor," he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time). Groucho also praised the late [[Margaret Dumont]] as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1YsAxiiH98 |title=Groucho Marx receiving an Honorary Oscar® |publisher=Oscars.org |date=November 24, 2009 |accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Chicograve.jpg|thumb|right|Grave]]
Chico died of [[arteriosclerosis]] at age 74 on October 11, 1961, at his Hollywood home.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Chico Marx, Stage and Film Comedian, Dies at 70.

He is entombed in a crypt at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]]. Chico's younger brother [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]] is in a crypt across the hall from him.

==Portrayals==

Many actors have portrayed Chico in stage revivals of Marx Brothers works, including Peter Slutsker, Les Marsden and [[Matt Roper]].

[[Image:CoDi CA signaling.png|thumb|right|A CA-space with 64x64 cells in the signaling phase with the CoDi-model with  axonal (red) signal trails and dendritic (green) and neuron bodies (white).]]

'''CoDi''' is a [[cellular automaton]] (CA) model for [[spiking neural network]]s (SNNs).&lt;ref name="Gers1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gers|first=Felix|author2=Hugo Garis |author3=Michael Korkin |year=1998|title=CoDi-1Bit : A simplified cellular automata based neuron model|volume=1363|pages=315–333|doi=10.1007/BFb0026610}}&lt;/ref&gt; CoDi is an acronym for Collect and Distribute, referring to the signals and spikes in a neural network.

CoDi uses a [[von Neumann neighborhood]] modified for a three-dimensional space; each cell looks at the states of its six orthogonal neighbors and its own state. In a growth phase a [[neural network]] is grown in the CA-space based on an underlying [[chromosome]]. There are four types of cells: [[neuron]] body, [[axon]], [[dendrite]] and blank. The growth phase is followed by a signaling- or processing-phase. Signals are distributed from the neuron bodies via their axon tree and collected from connection dendrites.&lt;ref name="Gers1998" /&gt; These two basic interactions cover every case, and they can be expressed simply, using a small number of rules.

== Cell interaction during signaling==

[[Image:CoDi CA signaling rules.png|thumb|right|Codi signaling: the arrows inside the axonal (red) signal trails and dendritic (green) signal trails indicate the direction of information flow during the signaling phase.]]

The [[neuron]] body cells collect neural signals from the surrounding [[dendrite|dendritic]] cells and apply an internally defined function to the collected data. In the CoDi model the neurons sum the incoming signal values and fire after a threshold is reached. This behavior of the neuron bodies can  be modified easily to suit a given problem. The output of the neuron bodies is passed on to its surrounding [[axon]] cells. Axonal cells distribute data  originating from the neuron body. Dendritic cells collect data and eventually pass it to the neuron body. These two types of cell-to-cell interaction cover all kinds of cell encounters.

Every cell has a gate, which is interpreted differently depending on the type of the cell. A neuron cell uses this gate to store its orientation, i.e. the direction in which the axon is pointing. In an axon cell, the gate points to the neighbor from which the neural signals are received. An axon cell accepts input only from this neighbor, but makes its own output available to all its neighbors. In this way axon cells distribute information. The source of information is always a neuron cell. Dendritic cells collect 
information by accepting information from any neighbor. They give their output, (e.g. a Boolean OR operation on the binary inputs) only to the neighbor specified by their own gate. In this way, dendritic cells collect and ''sum'' neural signals, until the final sum of collected neural signals reaches the neuron cell.

Each axonal and dendritic cell ''belongs'' to exactly one neuron cell. This configuration of the CA-space is guaranteed by the preceding growth phase.

== Synapses ==

The CoDi model does not use explicit synapses, because dendrite cells that are in contact with an axonal trail (i.e. have an axon cell as neighbor) collect the neural signals directly from the axonal trail. This results from the behavior of axon cells, which distribute to every neighbor, and from the behavior of the dendrite cells, which collect from any neighbor.

The strength of a neuron-neuron connection (a synapse) is represented by the number of their neighboring axon and dendrite cells. The exact structure of the network and the position of the axon-dendrite neighbor pairs determine the time delay and strength (weight) of a neuron-neuron connection. This principle infers that a single neuron-neuron connection can consist  of several synapse with different time delays with independent weights.

== Genetic encoding and growth of the network ==

[[Image:codi chromosome start growth.png|thumb|right|
CA-space with chromosome during growth phase with two randomly positioned neuron cells (white) with two dendrites and two axons each. (Right) The beginning of the growth phase, after three CA-steps.]]

The chromosome is initially distributed throughout the CA-space, so that every cell in the CA-space contains one instruction of the chromosome, i.e. one growth instruction, so that the chromosome belongs to the network as a whole. The distributed chromosome technique of the CoDi model makes maximum use of the available CA-space and  enables the growth of any type of network connectivity. The local connection of the grown circuitry to its chromosome, allows local learning to be combined with the evolution of grown neural networks.

[[Image:codi growth chromosome.png|thumb|right|
A growing neuron in the CoDi-model with two dendrites and two axons. The arrows inside the axonal and dendritic signal trails indicate the direction of information flow during the growth phase.]]

Growth signals are passed to the direct neighbors of the neuron cell according to its chromosome information. The blank neighbors, which receive a neural growth signal, turn into either an axon cell or a dendrite cell. The growth signals include information containing the cell type of the cell that is to be grown from the signal. To decide in which directions axonal or dendritic trails should grow, the grown cells consult their chromosome information which encodes the growth instructions. These growth instructions can have an absolute or a relative directional encoding. An absolute encoding masks the six neighbors (i.e. directions) of a 3D cell with six bits. After a cell is grown, it accepts growth signals only from the direction from which it received its first signal. This ''reception direction'' information is stored in the ''gate'' position of each cell's state.

== Implementation as a partitioned CA ==

[[File:Codi 16bit cell.png|thumb|State representation in the CoDi model. During the growth phase 6 of the bits are used to store the chromosome's growth instructions. The same 6 bits are later used to store the activity of a neuron cell during the signaling phase.]]

The states of our CAs have two parts, which are treated in different ways. The first part of the cell-state contains the cell's type and activity level and the second part serves as an interface to the cell's neighborhood by containing the input signals from the neighbors. Characteristic of  our CA is that only part of the state of a cell is passed  to its neighbors, namely the signal and then only to those neighbors specified in the fixed part of the cell state. This CA is called ''partitioned'', because the state is partitioned into two parts, the first being fixed and the second is  variable for each cell.

The advantage of this partitioning-technique is that the amount of information that defines the new state of a CA cell is kept to a minimum, due to its avoidance of redundant information exchange.

== Implementation in hardware ==

Since CAs are only locally connected, they are ideal for implementation on purely parallel hardware. When designing the CoDi CA-based neural networks model, the objective was to implement them directly in hardware (FPGAs). Therefore, the CA was kept as simple as possible, by having a small number of bits to specify the state, keeping the CA rules few in number, and having few cellular neighbors.

The CoDi model was implemented in the FPGA based CAM-Brain Machine (CBM) by Korkin.&lt;ref name="de Garis2001" /&gt;

== History ==

CoDi was introduced by Gers et al. in 1998.&lt;ref name="Gers1998" /&gt; A specialized parallel machine based on FPGA Hardware (CAM) to run the DoDi model on a large scale was developed by Korkin et al.&lt;ref name="de Garis2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Garis|first=Hugo|author2=Michael Korkin |author3=Gary Fehr |year=2001|journal=Autonomous Robots|volume=10|issue=3|pages=235–249|issn=0929-5593|doi=10.1023/A:1011286308522|title=The CAM-Brain Machine (CBM): An FPGA Based Tool for Evolving a 75 Million Neuron Artificial Brain to Control a Lifesized Kitten Robot}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Garis conducted a series of experiments on the CAM-machine evaluating the CoDi model. The original model, where learning is based on evolutionary algorithms, has been augmented with a local learning rule via feedback from dendritic spikes by Schwarzer.&lt;ref name="SchwarzerMüller-Schloer2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwarzer|first1=Jens|last2=Müller-Schloer|first2=Christian|title=Lernverfahren für evolutionär optimierte Künstliche Neuronale Netze auf der Basis Zellulärer Automaten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wVuqAAAACAAJ|accessdate=7 January 2013|date=2004-08-05|publisher=Logos Verlag Berlin|isbn=9783832506285|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20896">'''Dynamical systems theory''' is an area of [[mathematics]] used to describe the behavior of the  [[complex systems|complex]] [[dynamical system]]s, usually by employing [[differential equations]] or [[difference equations]]. When differential equations are employed, the theory is called [[continuous time|''continuous dynamical systems'']]. From a physical point of view, continuous dynamical systems is a generalization of [[classical mechanics]], a generalization where the [[equations of motion]] are postulated directly and are not constrained to be [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s of a [[Principle of least action|least action principle]]. When difference equations are employed, the theory is called [[discrete time|''discrete dynamical systems'']]. When the time variable runs over a set that is discrete over some intervals and continuous over other intervals or is any arbitrary time-set such as a [[cantor set]], one gets [[dynamic equations on time scales]]. Some situations may also be modeled by mixed operators, such as [[differential-difference equations]].

This theory deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems,&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies the nature of, and when possible the solutions of, the [[equations of motion]] of systems that are often primarily [[mechanics|mechanical]] or otherwise physical in nature, such as [[planetary orbit]]s and the behaviour of [[electronic circuit]]s, as well as systems that arise in [[biology]], [[economics]], and elsewhere. Much of modern research is focused on the study of [[chaotic system]]s.

This field of study is also called just ''dynamical systems'', ''mathematical dynamical systems theory'' or the ''mathematical theory of dynamical systems''.
[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|240px|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] is an example of a [[non-linear]] dynamical system. Studying this system helped give rise to [[chaos theory]].]]

== Overview ==
Dynamical systems theory and [[chaos theory]] deal with the long-term qualitative behavior of [[dynamical system]]s. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if so, what are the possible steady states?", or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

An important goal is to describe the fixed points, or steady states of a given dynamical system; these are values of the variable that don't change over time. Some of these fixed points are ''attractive'', meaning that if the system starts out in a nearby state, it converges towards the fixed point.

Similarly, one is interested in ''periodic points'', states of the system that repeat after several timesteps. Periodic points can also be attractive. [[Sharkovskii's theorem]] is an interesting statement about the number of periodic points of a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system.

Even simple [[nonlinear dynamical system]]s often exhibit seemingly random behavior that has been called ''chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grebogi |first=C. |last2=Ott |first2=E. |last3=Yorke |first3=J. |year=1987 |title=Chaos, Strange Attractors, and Fractal Basin Boundaries in Nonlinear Dynamics |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=238 |issue=4827 |pages=632–638 |jstor=1700479 |doi=10.1126/science.238.4827.632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch of dynamical systems that deals with the clean definition and investigation of chaos is called ''[[chaos theory]]''.

== History ==
The concept of dynamical systems theory has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]]. There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is given implicitly by a relation that gives the state of the system only a short time into the future.

Before the advent of [[computer|fast computing machines]], solving a dynamical system required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could only be accomplished for a small class of dynamical systems.

Some excellent presentations of mathematical dynamic system theory include {{harv|Beltrami|1990}}, {{harv|Luenberger|1979}}, {{harv|Padulo|Arbib|1974}}, and {{harv|Strogatz|1994}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome R.

== Concepts ==

=== Dynamical systems ===
{{main|Dynamical system (definition)}}
The [[dynamical system]] concept is a mathematical [[formal system|formalization]] for any fixed "rule" that describes the [[time]] dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each spring in a lake.

A dynamical system has a ''state'' determined by a collection of [[real numbers]], or more generally by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Point (geometry)|points]] in an appropriate ''state space''.  Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers.  The numbers are also the coordinates of a geometrical space—a [[manifold]].   The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state.  The rule may be [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] (for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state) or [[stochastic differential equation|stochastic]] (the evolution of the state is subject to random shocks).

=== Dynamicism ===
[[Dynamicism]], also termed the ''dynamic hypothesis'' or the ''dynamic hypothesis in cognitive science'' or ''dynamic cognition'', is a new approach in [[cognitive science]] exemplified by the work of philosopher [[Tim van Gelder]]. It argues that [[differential equations]] are more suited to modelling [[cognition]] than more traditional [[computer]] models.

=== Nonlinear system ===
{{main|Nonlinear system}}
In [[mathematics]], a [[nonlinear system]] is a system that is not [[linear system|linear]]—i.e., a system that does not satisfy the [[superposition principle]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"/&gt; Less technically, a nonlinear system is any problem where the variable(s) to solve for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components. A [[Homogeneity (physics)|nonhomogeneous]] system, which is linear apart from the presence of a function of the [[independent variable]]s, is nonlinear according to a strict definition, but such systems are usually studied alongside linear systems, because they can be transformed to a linear system as long as a particular solution is known.

== Related fields ==

=== Arithmetic dynamics ===
:[[Arithmetic dynamics]] is a field that emerged in the 1990s that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, [[dynamical systems]] and [[number theory]]. Classically, discrete dynamics refers to the study of the [[Iterated function|iteration]] of self-maps of the [[complex plane]] or [[real line]]. Arithmetic dynamics is the study of the number-theoretic properties of integer, rational, {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}}-adic, and/or algebraic points under repeated application of a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]].

=== Chaos theory ===
:[[Chaos theory]] describes the behavior of certain [[dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]]s – that is, systems whose state evolves with time – that may exhibit dynamics that are highly sensitive to initial conditions (popularly referred to as the [[butterfly effect]]). As a result of this sensitivity, which manifests itself as an exponential growth of perturbations in the initial conditions, the behavior of chaotic systems appears [[randomness|random]]. This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic]], meaning that their future dynamics are fully defined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply ''chaos''.

=== Complex systems ===
:[[Complex systems]] is a scientific field that studies the common properties of [[system]]s considered [[Complexity|complex]] in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]]. It is also called ''complex systems theory'', ''complexity science'', ''study of complex systems'' and/or ''sciences of complexity''. The key problems of such systems are  difficulties with their formal [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]]. From such perspective, in different research contexts complex systems are defined on the base of their different attributes.

:The study of complex systems is bringing new vitality to many areas of science where a more typical [[reductionist]] strategy has fallen short. ''Complex systems'' is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines including [[neurosciences]], [[social sciences]], [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[economics]], earthquake prediction, [[molecular biology]] and inquiries into the nature of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s themselves.

=== Control theory ===
:[[Control theory]] is an interdisciplinary branch of [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]], that deals with influencing the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s.

=== Ergodic theory ===
:[[Ergodic theory]] is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies [[dynamical system]]s with an [[invariant measure]] and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of [[statistical physics]].

=== Functional analysis ===
:[[Functional analysis]] is the branch of [[mathematics]], and specifically of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], concerned with the study of [[vector space]]s and [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of [[functional space]]s, in particular transformations of [[function (mathematics)|functions]], such as the [[Fourier transform]], as well as in the study of [[differential equations|differential]] and [[integral equations]]. This usage of the word ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' goes back to the [[calculus of variations]], implying a function whose argument is a function. Its use in general has been attributed to mathematician and physicist [[Vito Volterra]] and its founding is largely attributed to mathematician [[Stefan Banach]].

=== Graph dynamical systems ===
:The concept of [[graph dynamical system]]s (GDS) can be used to capture a wide range of processes taking place on graphs or networks. A major theme in the mathematical and computational analysis of graph dynamical systems is to relate their structural properties (e.g. the network connectivity) and the global dynamics that result.

=== Projected dynamical systems ===
:[[Projected dynamical systems]] is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory investigating the behaviour of [[dynamical system]]s where solutions are restricted to a constraint set. The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems and the dynamical world of [[ordinary differential equations]]. A projected dynamical system is given by the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] to the projected differential equation.

=== Symbolic dynamics ===
:[[Symbolic dynamics]] is the practice of modelling a topological or smooth [[dynamical system]] by a discrete space consisting of infinite [[sequence]]s of abstract symbols, each of which corresponds to a state of the system, with the dynamics (evolution) given by the [[shift operator]].

=== System dynamics ===
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behaviour of systems over time.  It deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behaviour and state of the entire system.&lt;ref name="sysdyn"&gt;[http://sysdyn.clexchange.org MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163801/http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/ |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].  These elements help describe how even seemingly simple systems display baffling [[nonlinearity]].

=== Topological dynamics ===
:[[Topological dynamics]] is a branch of the theory of dynamical systems in which qualitative, asymptotic properties of dynamical systems are studied from the viewpoint of [[general topology]].

== Applications ==

=== In biomechanics ===
In [[sports biomechanics]], dynamical systems theory has emerged in the movement sciences as a viable framework for modeling athletic performance. From a dynamical systems perspective, the human movement system is a highly intricate network of co-dependent sub-systems (e.g. respiratory, circulatory, nervous, skeletomuscular, perceptual) that are composed of a large number of interacting components (e.g. blood cells, oxygen molecules, muscle tissue, metabolic enzymes, connective tissue and bone). In dynamical systems theory, movement patterns emerge through generic processes of self-organization found in physical and biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S Glazier, Keith Davids, Roger M Bartlett (2003). [http://www.sportsci.org/jour/03/psg.htm "DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS THEORY: a Relevant Framework for Performance-Oriented Sports Biomechanics Research"]. in: Sportscience 7. Accessed 2008-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no research validation of any of the claims associated to the conceptual application of this framework.

=== In cognitive science ===
Dynamical system theory has been applied in the field of [[neurodynamics|neuroscience]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive development]], especially in [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]. It is the belief that cognitive development is best represented by physical theories rather than theories based on syntax and [[AI]]. It also believed that differential equations are the most appropriate tool for modeling human behavior. These equations are interpreted to represent an agent's cognitive trajectory through [[state space]]. In other words, dynamicists argue that [[psychology]] should be (or is) the description (via differential equations) of the cognitions and behaviors of an agent under certain environmental and internal pressures. The language of chaos theory is also frequently adopted.

In it, the learner's mind reaches a state of disequilibrium where old patterns have broken down. This is the phase transition of cognitive development. [[Self-organization]] (the spontaneous creation of coherent forms) sets in as activity levels link to each other. Newly formed macroscopic and microscopic structures support each other, speeding up the process. These links form the structure of a new state of order in the mind through a process called ''scalloping'' (the repeated building up and collapsing of complex performance.) This new, novel state is progressive, discrete, idiosyncratic and unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Promise of Dynamic Systems Approaches for an Integrated Account of Human Development|journal=Child Development|date=2000-02-25|first=Mark D.|last=Lewis|volume=71|issue=1|pages=36–43|id= |url=http://home.oise.utoronto.ca/~mlewis/Manuscripts/Promise.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00116|pmid=10836556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic systems theory has recently been used to explain a long-unanswered problem in child development referred to as the [[A-not-B error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2003-07-30|first=Linda B.|last=Smith|author2=Esther Thelen|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–8|id= |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~cogdev/labwork/dynamicsystem.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In second language development===
{{Main|Dynamic approach to second language development}}
The application of Dynamic Systems Theory to study [[second language acquisition]] is attributed to [[Diane Larsen-Freeman]] who published an article in 1997 in which she claimed that [[second language acquisition]] should be viewed as a developmental process which includes [[language attrition]] as well as language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/applij/article-abstract/18/2/141/134192|title=Chaos/Complexity Science and Second Language Acquisition|date=1997|publisher=Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article she claimed that language should be viewed as a dynamic system which is dynamic, complex, nonlinear, chaotic, unpredictable, sensitive to initial conditions, open, self-organizing, feedback sensitive, and adaptive.

==Amateur career==
In 2009, Spence won the U.S. National [[Golden Gloves]], and also won three consecutive [[United States national amateur boxing welterweight champions|national amateur welterweight championships]] from 2009 to 2011, all in the [[welterweight]] division.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110828084301/http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/more-sports/olympics/20110804-desoto_s-spence-can-make-u.s.-boxing-team-today.ece]&lt;/ref&gt; Spence reached the quarter-finals at the [[2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships – Welterweight|2011 World Championships]], losing to [[Serik Sapiyev]].

On August 3, 2012 Errol won his fight against [[Vikas Krishan Yadav]] after the original result was overturned and made it to the quarterfinals of the [[Boxing at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's welterweight|London Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/olympics-2012/aiba-overturns-errol-spence-loss-indian-welterweight-krishan-vikas-late-friday-night-article-1.1128873 |title=Olympics Insider: AIBA overturns Spence's loss |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=2012-08-04 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5931821/another-ridiculous-olympic-boxing-decision-gets-reversed|title=Another Ridiculous Olympic Boxing Decision Gets Reversed|author=Tom Ley|work=Deadspin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence lost in the quarter finals of the 2012 London Olympics to Andrey Zamkovoy and turned professional shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer/2012/boxing/story/_/id/8245146/2012-summer-olympics-errol-spence-loss-ensures-no-us-boxing-medal |title=2012 Summer Olympics - Errol Spence's loss ensures no U.S. boxing medal |website=Espn.com |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
=== Early career ===
On 9 November 2012, a 22 year old Spence made his professional debut at the [[Fantasy Springs Resort Casino|Fantasy Springs Casino]] in [[Indio, California|Indio]], [[California]] in a scheduled 4 round bout against 19 year old Jonathan Garcia. Spence knocked Garcia down and out in the 3rd round. In December 2012, Spence knocked out Richard Andrews at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Sports Arena]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, which was part of undercard for [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]]'s comeback fight against Carlos Molina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.boxing247.com/boxing-result/khan-vs-molina-early-undercard-results-santa-cruz-wins/6534/amp |title=Khan defeats Molina; Wilder, Angulo, Santa Cruz win |website=Boxing247.com |date=2012-12-15 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence fought eight times in 2013, being victorious in all of them, winning six inside the distance. He was taken the distance in an eight-round bout in October by Emmanuel Lartei Lartey. The fight was rather one-sided, with all judges scoring the fight 79-73 in favor of Spence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Scavone |url=http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/news/errol-spence-jr-forgoes-knockout-goes-distance-his-greatest-hits |title=Errol Spence Jr. forgoes the knockout, goes the distance in his Greatest Hits |website=Premierboxingchampions.com |date=2015-04-08 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/178655-qaa-errol-spence-jr|title=Q&amp;A: Errol Spence Jr.|author=Anson Wainwright|date=2 May 2013|work=Ring TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2013, Spence had won all of his 10 professional fights, 8 of them by way of knockout.

Spence made his [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television debut on 27 June 2014 at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas in a 10-round fight against Ronald Cruz. Spence was taken the distance and won a shutout unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/news/errol-spence-jr-forgoes-knockout-goes-distance-his-greatest-hits|title=Errol Spence Jr. forgoes the knockout, goes the distance in his Greatest Hits|work=PBC Boxing|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2014, Spence beat Javier Castro by TKO in the 5th round at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2014/12/13/7388639/khan-vs-alexander-results-jermell-charlo-victor-ortiz-errol-spence|title=Khan vs Alexander results: Jermell Charlo, Victor Ortiz, Errol Spence score wins|author=Scott Christ|date=14 December 2014|work=Bad Left Hook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rising up the ranks ===
On 11 April 2015, Spence defeated [[Samuel Vargas]] by TKO in Round 4 of 10 in a ''[[Premier Boxing Champions]]'' fight card at [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], bringing his record to 16-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/news/errol-spence-jr-brutally-outguns-samuel-vargas-en-route-tko-victory|title=Errol Spence Jr. brutally outguns Samuel Vargas en route to TKO victory|work=PBC Boxing}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, it was announced that Spence would feature on the undercard of [[Shawn Porter]] vs. [[Adrien Broner]] on June 20 at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena|MGM Grand Arena]]. Spence defeated [[Phil Lo Greco]] (26-1, 14 KOs) via 3rd-round TKO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/13108400/phil-lo-greco-approved-new-opponent-errol-spence-jr|title=Lo Greco approved as new opponent for Spence|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spence was originally scheduled to fight [[Roberto García (Mexican boxer)|Roberto García]]. García backed out of the fight three days before the card due to weight issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/12895562/shawn-porter-adrien-broner-meet-june-20-welterweight-main-event|title=Welterweights Porter, Broner to meet June 20|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spence  landed 73 of 142 punched thrown (51%) and Lo Greco landed 19 of 132 (14%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/13122196/errol-spence-jr-demolishes-late-replacement-phil-lo-greco-three-rounds|title=Spence looks impressive in win|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence next fought on the undercard of [[Adonis Stevenson|Stevenson]]-[[Tommy Karpency|Karpency]] against [[Chris van Heerden]] at the [[Ricoh Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ringtv.com/398991-chris-van-heerden-looks-to-make-his-mark-tonight-against-errol-spence-jr/|title=Chris van Heerden looks to make his mark tonight against Errol Spence Jr. - The Ring|date=2015-09-11|work=The Ring|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee stopped the fight in round 8, after Spence knocked down van Heerden twice in round 7 to win the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] International welterweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Premier Boxing Champions|title=Errol Spence Jr. vs Chris van Heerden: FULL FIGHT, September 11th, 2015 - PBC on Spike|date=2015-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kaahbUTnB8|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/news/errol-spence-jr-mugs-mugging-chris-van-heerden-smashing-tko-win|title=Errol Spence Jr. mugs a mugging Chris van Heerden in smashing TKO win|work=PBC Boxing|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spence vs. Algieri ====
On 10 March 2016, it was announced that Spence would fight former [[light welterweight]] titlist [[Chris Algieri]] at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] on 16 April, his biggest fight to date. The fight was scheduled for 10 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/14943874/errol-spence-jr-faces-toughest-test-date-chris-algieri|title=Spence looking to make statement against Algieri|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In front of a pro-Algieri 7,628 crowd, Spence became the first boxer to stop Algieri. This was Spence's seventh straight knockout. The end came when Spence delivered a left hook to Algieri’s face. The hard shot sent Algieri straight to the canvas and referee Benjy Esteves waived the count. After the bout, Spence said "[[Kell Brook]] knows what time it is. We got to get in the ring and fight.". IBF later stated that Spence must have a final eliminator before he is declared mandatory challenger. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12040/10246771/errol-spene-jr-stopped-chris-algieri-in-five-rounds|title=Errol Spence Jr stopped Chris Algieri in five rounds|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/spence-vs-algieri|title=Spence vs Algieri Results &amp; Highlights {{!}} April 16, 2016|work=PBC Boxing|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the fight, Spence earned $225,000 whilst Algieri earned $325,000.

==== Spence vs. Bundu ====
On 16 May 2016, Spence denied that his team turned down a fight against Brook, which had been previously insinuated by [[Eddie Hearn]], Brook's promoter. Spence said that the IBF had ordered him to fight their #3 contender [[Konstantin Ponomarev (boxer)|Konstantin Ponomarev]] in order to become the mandatory challenger to Brook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2016/05/errol-spence-denies-turning-kell-brook-fight/|title=Errol Spence denies turning down Kell Brook fight|date=2016-05-16|website=Boxing News 24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were no agreements to fight, on June 9, Ponomarev injured his hand, forcing him out of the eliminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/16054321/konstantin-ponomarev-hurt-fight-eliminator-vs-errol-spence-jr|title=Ponomarev hurt, won't fight eliminator vs. Spence|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was confirmed that Spence Jr. would fight IBF #7 [[Leonard Bundu]] (33-1-2, 12 KOs) in the eliminator on August 21 at the [[Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island|Ford Amphitheater]]. The fight would be aired on a Sunday night edition of ''[[Premier Boxing Champions]]'' on [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelivingdaylights.co/2016/06/30/errol-spence-jr-closing-in-on-deserved-title-shot/|title=Errol Spence Jr. closing in on deserved title shot|date=2016-06-30|website=The Living Daylights|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2016/06/errol-spence-jr-vs-leonard-bundu-ibf-147lb-eliminator/|title=Errol Spence Jr. vs. Leonard Bundu in IBF 147lb eliminator|date=2016-06-08|website=Boxing News 24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence focused on breaking down Bundu from the start. After five one-sided rounds, Spence backed Bundu against the ropes and connected with an uppercut that dropped Bundu. Referee Johnny Callas waved off the fight without starting a count. After the fight, Spence Jr. reiterated his desire of becoming IBF World champion stating, "I definitely want my shot at Kell Brook and his title, I want him next. If he vacates or gets stripped, then I'll fight for his vacant title. I've paid my dues." For the fight, Spence received $250,000 compared to Bundu's $30,000 purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10547358/errol-spence-jr-becomes-kell-brooks-mandatory-challenger-after-stopping-leonard-bundu|title=Errol Spence Jr becomes Kell Brook's mandatory challenger after stopping Leonard Bundu|last=|first=|date=August 22, 2016|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/17361984/errol-spence-knocks-leonard-bundu-6th-round-pbc-card|title=Spence scores sixth-round knockout of Bundu|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight drew 4.8 million viewers on NBC and peaked at 6.34 million.

=== IBF welterweight champion ===

==== Spence vs. Brook ====
In January 2017, IBF welterweight champion [[Kell Brook]] and his team were in talks with [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]] over a potential fight, whilst also keeping the mandatory fight with Spence as second choice. During negotiations, Khan urged Brook to fight Spence first and eventually talks broke down between Brook and Khan. Brook's promoter [[Eddie Hearn]] mentioned talks were already ongoing with Spence's manager [[Al Haymon]] for a fight to take place possibly in the UK in May. Hearn received an extension from the IBF for negotiations between himself and TGB Promotions boss Tom Brown, as they were progressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/kell-brook-vs-errol-spence-targeted-uk--112576|title=Kell Brook vs. Errol Spence is Targeted For May in The UK - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[purse bid]]s for the fight was set for 7 February by the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ringtv.com/483013-kell-brook-likely-face-errol-spence-purse-bid-looming/|title=Kell Brook likely to face Errol Spence with purse bid looming - The Ring|date=2017-01-31|newspaper=The Ring|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, Hearn claimed that Brook will be keeping his title and make the defense against Spence and that he had reached out to Spence's team, to no reply.

In front of 27,000 fans, Spence dropped and eventually stopped Brook to win the IBF welterweight title after 11 rounds. In a fight where mostly power shots were landed, Spence threw combinations to the head and to the body, gradually wearing down Brook. Brook did well working the counter, and landed his own shots to the body. In round 10, Spence cornered Brook against the ropes and unloaded some heavy power shots, which caused Brook to take a knee. In round 11, Brook motioned many times that he couldn't see through his left eye and voluntarily took a knee. The referee started the 10 count, which Brook was unable to beat, giving him back to back defeats and his first as a welterweight. At the time of stoppage, all three judges had Spence ahead on their scorecards (97-92, 96-93, 95-94).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/40071749|title=Kell Brook loses IBF world welterweight title to Errol Spence Jr|date=2017-05-27|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he won the fight, Spence admitted it was not his best performance, "I give myself a B-. I was a little bit off with my offence and defence, but I give Kell a lot of credit. This is what true champions do. You go anywhere to fight." Spence landed 246 of 633 punches thrown (39%) while Brook landed 136 of 442 (31%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/errol-spence-drops-stops-kell-brook-eleven-win-results--117009|title=Errol Spence Drops, Stops Kell Brook in Eleven To Win IBF Belt - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/19477017/kell-brook-loses-ibf-welterweight-title-errol-spence-11th-round-tko-sheffield-bramall-lane|title=Brook loses world title to Spence in Sheffield|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/19480639/next-welterweight-titlist-errol-spence-jr|title=What's next for welterweight titlist Errol Spence Jr.?|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was shown in the afternoon in the US on Showtime and averaged 291,000 viewers, peaking at 337,000 viewers.

On fight night, in front of 12,107, Spence broke Peterson down mentally and physically eventually forcing Peterson's trainer Barry Hunter to stop the fight a second into round 8. Peterson was dropped in round 5 from a left hand by Spence. Peterson beat the count and looked unsteady, surviving the round. Peterson took a lot of punishment, but managed to fire back some offence of his own before the round ended. Peterson’s face looked swollen and his eyes were puffy from Spence’s hard shots. Spence also worked the body from the opening bell. After round 6, Peterson knew he was behind on the scorecards and indicated to his trainer, who said he would give him a few more rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11216632/errol-spence-jr-defeats-lamont-peterson-to-successfully-defend-ibf-welterweight-title|title=Errol Spence Jr defeats Lamont Peterson to successfully defend IBF welterweight title|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-fight interviews, Spence said, "I want to thank Lamont. A lot guys turned down the fight, and he took like a real warrior, and I commend him for that. My coach [Derrick James] came with a great game plan, and I just followed through with it. Keep my range, keep my composure." Spence admitted he would need to work on his defence a little. When interviewer [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] asked Hunter about the stoppage, he replied, "It was really hard [to stop the fight], but if you know Lamont, you know he was not going to give up. So I had to stop it. At the end of the day this is my son right here. And there's nothing more valuable than his well being. If it comes to him or winning, I pick him. I care about him." After the fight, Spence called out unified champion [[Keith Thurman]], referring him to 'sometime'. At the time of stoppage, all three judges had their scorecards at 70-62 for Spence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/errol-spence-drops-beats-down-lamont-peterson-results--124483|title=Errol Spence Drops, Beats Down Lamont Peterson For TKO Win|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/spence-i-want-some-time-thurman-he-keeps-making-excuses--124496|title=Spence: I Want 'Some Time' Thurman - He Keeps Making Excuses!|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2018 the IBF sent a letter to TGB Promotions ordering Spence to make a mandatory defence against unbeaten prospect [[Carlos Ocampo]] (22-0, 13 KOs) next. Zanfer Promotions, who promote Ocampo were also notified and were given until February 22 to reach a deal before purse bids take place. Because Ocampo was not rated in the top 2 in the IBF rankings at the time, at purse bids, he would be entitled to 15% rather than the 25% that a mandatory challenger receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/22188987/errol-spence-ordered-make-title-defense-carlos-ocampo|title=Spence ordered to make defense vs. Ocampo|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/errol-spence-vs-carlos-ocampo-ordered-by-ibf--124564|title=Errol Spence vs. Carlos Ocampo Ordered By The IBF|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, Showtime announced that Spence would next fight on June 16 in Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/errol-spence-carlos-ocampo-next-june-16--124612|title=Errol Spence: Carlos Ocampo Could Be Next For June 16|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, according to ESPN, the IBF ordered purse bids to take place on March 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2018/2/24/17048220/errol-spence-jr-ordered-to-purse-bid-for-mandatory-defense|title=Errol Spence Jr ordered to purse bid for mandatory defense|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=1-22558407|title=The representatives for welterweight world titlist...|date=2018-02-24|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, it was revealed that both sides had reached a deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/errol-spence-vs-carlos-ocampo-deal-reached-june-16--125723|title=Errol Spence vs. Carlos Ocampo Deal Reached For June 16|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/22599858/errol-spence-jr-defend-welterweight-title-hometown-dallas-carlos-ocampo|title=Spence to defend belt against Ocampo in June|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, an official press release confirmed the bout would take place at [[the Ford Center at The Star]] in Frisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/errol-spence-vs-carlos-ocampo-finalized-june-16--127700|title=Errol Spence vs. Carlos Ocampo Finalized For June 16|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In front of a sellout crowd of 12,604, Spence knocked Ocampo out in round 1 to retain his IBF title. In response to some body shots from Ocampo, Spence hit back with a hard left to the body that sent Ocampo to the canvas. Referee Lawrence Cole made the 10 count as Ocampo tried to get up, but was in too much pain. The time of the stoppage was at 3:00 of round 1. The knockout for Spence was his 11th consecutive stoppage since 2014. Spence stated he wanted to unify the division by going after the winner of the Shawn Porter vs. Danny Garcia, Keith Thurman and Terence Crawford. After the bout, Spence said, "I was a little disappointed. I wanted to give the crowd their money's worth. I wanted him to sustain a bit and give him some punishment, but the body shot got him and I dropped him." Spence wanted to go at least 5 rounds. According to Ocampo, it was overconfidence that caught up to him and ended his world title challenge. For the fight, Spence made $1.2 million and Ocampo was given a $75,000 purse. Numerous Cowboys players were in attendance, including quarterback Dak Prescott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/errol-spence-wipes-out-carlos-ocampo-one-round-results--129189|title=Errol Spence Wipes Out Carlos Ocampo in One Round|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/23816623/errol-spence-jr-makes-quick-work-carlos-ocampo-first-round-ko|title=Spence KO's overmatched Ocampo in 1st round|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight averaged 683,000 viewers and peaked at 726,000 viewers on Showtime, an increase from his previous bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/showtimes-spence-ocampo-main-event-peaked-726k-viewers--129268|title=Showtime's Spence-Ocampo Main Event Peaked at 726K Viewers|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spence vs. Garcia ====
On October 25, 2018 BoxingScene.com reported that negotiations between Spence and [[Mikey Garcia]] (39-0, 30 KOs) were progessing, with the fight likely to take place in Febryary 2019 on Showtime PPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/garcia-commey-not-next-garcia-spence-negotiations-progressing--133128|title=Garcia-Commey Not Next; Garcia-Spence Negotiations Progressing|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia first began to call out Spence for a fight before he defeated and unified the lightweight division in July. On October 30, Garcia vacated his IBF lightweight title and the purse bid for the potential [[Richard Commey]] fight was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/mikey-garcia-gives-up-ibf-ibf-order-commey-chaniev--133265|title=Mikey Garcia Gives Up IBF; IBF To Order Commey-Chaniev|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 13, PBC made an official announcement for their 2019 schedule. It was announced the fight between Garcia and Spence would take place at the welterweight limit at the [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]] on March 16, 2019 exclusively on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX PPV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/spence-garcia-announced-fox-ppv-march-16--133684|title=Spence-Garcia To Be Announced As FOX PPV March 16|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/25269962/errol-spence-jr-vs-mikey-garcia-announced-march-16-dallas|title=Spence-Garcia bout to headline March 16 card|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Many fans reacted to fight being announced. Some welcoming the fight and praising Garcia for 'daring to be great' and some fans believed the size difference would be too much as Spence is considered a big welterweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/2018/11/14/boxing-world-reacts-to-errol-spence-vs-mikey-garcia-super-fight/|title=Boxing World Reacts To Errol Spence vs Mikey Garcia Super Fight|date=2018-11-14|work=Boxing News and Views|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">'''Florence Wyndham''' (1538-1596), wife of Sir John Wyndham (died 1572) of [[Orchard Wyndham]] in Somerset, was a daughter of [[John Wadham (died 1578)]] of [[Merryfield, Ilton]] in Somerset and [[Edge, Branscombe]] in Devon and was a sister and co-heiress of [[Nicholas Wadham]]  (1531/2 – 1609), co-founder of [[Wadham College, Oxford]].

==Buried alive==
Her fame rests on a remarkable escape from a horrific death and her singular importance to the survival of the Wyndham family.

In 1556 she married Sir John Wyndham of [[Orchard Wyndham]] and a year later was taken ill and thought to have died. She was buried in the Wyndham family vault in St [[Decuman]]’s church at [[Watchet]], Somerset and that same night a covetous sexton opened her coffin in order to remove her rings and cut one of her fingers in the process. She had in fact fallen into some sort of [[catalepsy|cataleptic trance]], and was now awakened by the pain and rose from her coffin. The sexton fled leaving his lantern behind him; and with its aid she made her way home across the fields to her astounded family.

Soon afterwards she gave birth to her only son, Sir [[John Wyndham (1558-1645)|John Wyndham]] (1558–1645), from whom every member of the Wyndham family is descended (apart from a branch of the family in the United States whose progenitor is Vice Admiral Sir Thomas Wyndham, [[Henry VIII]]'s distinguished naval commander).

Her remarkable survival and importance as a valuable heiress is celebrated in the family by successive generations naming the eldest son [[Wadham Wyndham (disambiguation)|Wadham Wyndham]], most especially by the Salisbury branch of [[St Edmund's College, Salisbury|St Edmund's College]] founded by Sir [[Wadham Wyndham (judge)|Wadham Wyndham]].

===Source of story===
The source of the story is unclear, but it appears to have become much embellished over time. Delderfield (1968) calls the sexton a [[verger]], by the name of Attewell.&lt;ref&gt;Delderfield, Eric, ''West Country Historic Houses and their Families'', Newton Abbot, 1968,  pp.86-8: ''Kentisford Farm'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest renditions is by the Somerset historian [[John Collinson (died 1793)|Collinson]] (d.1793), published in 1791, who was more charitable to the sexton/verger than later narrators and states relatively simply:&lt;ref&gt;[[John Collinson (historian)|Collinson, John]], ''History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset'', Volume 3, London, 1791, p.490: ''Orchard''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qoIgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA486&amp;lpg=PA486&amp;dq=collinson+st+decuman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dDOuq8mp3z&amp;sig=ppdTdyD_ehEjyYLpXDNpD2Hm2lE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdrsf_4bjJAhUBSBoKHfX6AWYQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=collinson%20st%20decuman&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
:"It is said that this lady was the year after her marriage, 1562, (''sic, her son was born in 1558'') buried, having in a sickness lost all appearance of life; but the sexton hearing some noise in the coffin, as he was closing the vault in the church of St. Decuman's, she was happily taken up, and soon after delivered of Sir John Wyndham".

==Lady Wyndham's Return==
(See full text on wikisource [[s:Lady Wyndham's Return]]
A poem about her remarkable escape, called 'Lady Wyndham's Return', was written by Rev. Lewis H. Court, Vicar of St Decuman's church, and includes the following verses:

He seized the slender fingers white&lt;br /&gt;
And stiff in their repose&lt;br /&gt;
Then sought to file the circlet through;&lt;br /&gt;
When to his horror blood he drew,&lt;br /&gt;
And the fair sleeper rose

She sat a moment gazed around,&lt;br /&gt;
Then great was her surprise,&lt;br /&gt;
And sexton startled saw at a glance&lt;br /&gt;
This was not death but a deep trance,&lt;br /&gt;
And madness leapt to his eyes.

The stagnant life steam in her veins&lt;br /&gt;
Again began to flow&lt;br /&gt;
She felt the sudden quickening,&lt;br /&gt;
For her it was a joyous thing,&lt;br /&gt;
For him a fearsome woe.

'''Gemma Rose Veronica McCluskie''' (5 February 1983 – 1 March 2012) was a British television actress. Her most notable role was in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', in which she played the semi-regular character [[Kerry Skinner]].

In March 2012, McCluskie disappeared from her home in [[East (London sub region)|East London]]; a few days later, her dismembered body was discovered in the [[Regent's Canal]]. Her brother, Tony McCluskie, was found guilty of her murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/10/gemma-mccluskie-eastender-actor-murder-brother-charged|title=Gemma McCluskie's brother charged with her murder|last=Jones|first=Cass|date=2012-03-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
McCluskie's best-known role was [[Kerry Skinner]] in the BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', her character appeared between October 2000 and February 2001. In the show, McCluskie's character was a close friend of [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) and the great-niece of the recently killed off [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]), and also the girlfriend of long-serving character [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]).&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrest after torso feared to be EastEnders actress found|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17290560|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in the TV series ''[[No Sweat (TV series)|No Sweat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-scotsman/20121208/283716951684539|work=The Scotsman|title=I killed her, says brother of Eastenders actress found dead in canal|date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance and death==
McCluskie went missing from her East London flat, where she lived with her brother Tony,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21014793 Gemma McCluskie 'killed after sink row']&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 March 2012. She was seen at home with her brother that afternoon, and a subsequent investigation found that she had entered a [[kebab shop]] around 8&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=huffpost7march/&gt;

A search party of 100 people was organised by McCluskie's cousins on 5 March, which spread out from the [[East End of London|east]] and [[South London|south]] of London, attempting to discover information related to McCluskie's disappearance.&lt;ref name=huffpost7march&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Sara C|title=Gemma McCluskie Missing: Body Pulled From Regents Canal In Hunt For Former EastEnders Star|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/07/gemma-mccluskie-missing-body-pulled-from-regents-canal-in-hunt-for-former-eastenders-star_n_1326068.html|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post UK|date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headless [[torso]] of a woman was recovered from [[Regent's Canal]] in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] on 6 March.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; On 9 March, the police announced that the body had been formally identified as McCluskie.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|title=Canal body is ex-Eastenders actress MuCluskie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17319303|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=9 March 2012|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March, a 35-year-old male (later identified as her brother, Tony McCluskie) was charged with her murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/2376/eastenders-actress-murder-brother-charged |title=EastEnders Actress Murder: Brother Charged |publisher=British Sky Broadcasting |work=Sky News |date=11 March 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared at Thames [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] on Monday, 12 March&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/892848-brother-of-gemma-mccluskie-appears-in-court-charged-with-her-murder Brother of Gemma McCluskie Appears in Court Charged With Her Murder] Metro, 12 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17328033 Brother of Ex-EastEnders McCluskie charged with her murder] BBC News, 10 March 2012.

On 10 September, police found a head in the same stretch of canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Hall|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/severed-head-recovered-from-regents-canal-where-decapitated-remains-of-former-eastenders-actress-gemma-mccluskie-were-found-8120976.html|title=Severed head recovered from Regent's Canal where decapitated remains of former EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie were found|publisher=Independent Print Ltd|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police confirmed the head was McCluskie's two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Margaret|last=Davis|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-confirm-severed-head-found-in-hackney-canal-belongs-to-exeastenders-actress-gemma-mccluskie-8130737.html|title=Police confirm severed head found in Hackney canal belongs to ex-Eastenders actress Gemma McCluskie|publisher=Independent Print Ltd|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 September 2012|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 28 September, Tony McCluskie accepted responsibility for the death of his sister.

Gemma McCluskie's funeral was held on 30 November at St Monica's Roman Catholic Church, Hoxton Square, East London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/gemma-mccluskie-death-mourners-gather-for-actress-s-funeral-1-1716738|work=East London Advertiser|title=Gemma McCluskie death: Mourners gather for actress's funeral|date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and sentence of brother==
The trial began on 14 January 2013 at the Old Bailey. During the trial, it was reported that Tony McCluskie was a heavy cannabis user and that the siblings frequently argued. On 1 March 2012, he allegedly argued with his sister about an overflowing bath. She told him to leave, and he then grabbed her by the wrists and punched her to the floor, but claimed he had no further recollection of his actions. Her death was caused by several blows to the head with a blunt instrument. He spent several hours dismembering her body. [[CCTV]] footage showed Tony carrying a suitcase the next day; the suitcase contained her remains, which Tony disposed of in Regent's Canal. McCluskie initially admitted manslaughter, but denied murder, citing a "loss of control". He was found guilty of her murder on 30 January 2013 and jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 20 years.&lt;ref name="brother"&gt;{{cite news|title=EastEnders' Gemma McCluskie death: Brother faces murder trial|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20640533|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German new humanism''' or '''''Neuhumanismus''''' was a movement that emerged in Germany around 1750. The term was coined by the historian [[Friedrich Paulsen]] in 1885. It was a continuation of the original [[renaissance humanism|humanism of the renaissance]]. Central to the movement was a rediscovery of the [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], and the movement was linked to a humanistic idea of knowledge, referred to as [[Bildung]], and to the idea of ''humanity'', the intellectual, physical, and moral formation of "a better human being." Some its major participants include [[Johann Matthias Gesner]], [[Johann August Ernesti]], [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]], [[Friedrich August Wolf]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].

Its program was described by [[Friedrich August Wolf]] as ''Studia humanitatis'' which "include anything that contribute to make human ''Bildung'' and mental and emotional forces into a beautiful harmony of the inner and outer man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich August Wolf]], ''Darstellung der Alterthumswissenschaften'', 1832, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Heaven and Hell'' (Swedenborg)}}
[[File:Emanuel Swedenborg.PNG|thumb|220px|Portrait of Swedenborg by [[Carl Frederik von Breda]]]]

'''''Heaven and Hell''''' is the common English title of a book written by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in [[Latin]], published in 1758. The full title is '''''Heaven and its Wonders and Hell From Things Heard and Seen''''', or, in Latin: '''''De Caelo et Eius Mirabilibus et de inferno, ex Auditis et Visis.''''' It gives a detailed description of the [[afterlife]], how people live after the death of the [[physical body]]. The book owes its appeal to that subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic30.htm|title=The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 30|website=www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
An article about Swedenborg&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html "Who Was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)?"], accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; includes a list of biographies about him, with a brief analysis of each biographer's point of view. Some of the things he claims to have experienced are that there are [[Jews]], [[Muslims]] and people of pre-Christian times ("[[Paganism|pagans]]" such as [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]]) in Heaven. He says he spoke to married angel couples from the Golden Age who had been happy in heaven for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=75 ''Marriage Love'' #7] at smallcanonsearch.com&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental issue of life, he says, is that love of self or of the world drives one towards Hell, and love of God and of fellow beings drives one towards Heaven.

The work proved to be influential. It has been translated into a number of languages, including [[Danish language|Danish]], French, English, [[Hindi]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. A variety of important cultural figures, both writers and artists, were influenced by Swedenborg, including [[Johnny Appleseed]], [[William Blake]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ebook-page-02.asp|title=Arthur Conan Doyle - The History of Spiritualism Vol I Page 02|website=www.classic-literature.co.uk|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ondb2uKhq_YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Representative men: seven lectures|first=Ralph Waldo|last=Emerson|date=30 October 2018|publisher=B. Tauchnitz|accessdate=30 October 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Flaxman]], [[George Inness]], [[Henry James, Sr.]], [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Carl Gustav Jung News - The New York Times|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/carl_gustav_jung/index.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sara | last=Corbett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[August Strindberg]], [[D. T. Suzuki]], and [[W. B. Yeats]].  [[Edgar Allan Poe]] mentions this book in his work ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, B. Little Masterpieces. Poe, E.A.  The Fall of the House of Usher, Garden City, MY, Doubleday 1921&lt;/ref&gt;  It also plays an important role in [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Louis Lambert (novel)|Louis Lambert]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1943 |title=Louis Lambert at Project Gutenberg| accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blake]] referred to and criticized ''Heaven and Hell'' and Swedenborg by name several times in his poetical/theological essay ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]''.

Swedenborg wrote about Heaven and Hell based on what he said was revelation from [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html ''Heaven and its Wonders and Hell. From Things Heard and Seen''] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1946).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenborg, God is love itself&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, ''Heaven and Hell'' 545ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; and intends everyone to go to heaven. That was His purpose for creation.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/dptc.html ''Angelic Wisdom concerning The Divine Providence''] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1954, #234:6,7)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, God is never angry, Swedenborg says, and does not cast anyone into Hell. The appearance of Him being angry at evil-doers was permitted due to the primitive level of understanding of people in Biblical times. Specifically, holy fear was needed to keep the people of those times from sinking irretrievably into the consequences of their evils. The holy fear idea was in keeping with the fundamental truth that even they could understand, that everything comes from Jehovah.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AC.htm ''Arcana Coelestia. The heavenly arcana contained in the Holy Scripture or Word of the Lord unfolded, beginning with the book of Genesis together with wonderful things seen in the World of Spirits and in the heaven of angels.''] Swedenborg Foundation, 1956 #6997:2, 7632)&lt;/ref&gt; In the internal, spiritual sense of the Word, however, revealed in Swedenborg’s works, God can be clearly seen for the loving Person He actually is.&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell,'' #546ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some basic teachings==

===God is One===
''Heaven and Hell'' opens with an  affirmation&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.[http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html  ''Heaven and Hell''] Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #2&lt;/ref&gt; of the many statements in the Old and New Testaments (e.g. Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 44:6, 45: 14, 21, Mark 12: 29,32, John 1:18, Revelation 11:17) and Swedenborg’s revelation (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html  ''The True Christian Religion''] Swedenborg Foundation, 1946  # 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/dlwtc.html ''The Divine Love and Wisdom''] Swedenborg Foundation 1946, # 23)&lt;/ref&gt;) that there is a God and He is one. If God is all-powerful, He must be one. It is self-contradictory to say that there is more than one being who is all-powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Kingslake, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angels===
Swedenborg details a life after death that consists of real experiences in a world in many basic ways quite similar to the natural world. According to Swedenborg, [[Angel|angels]] in heaven do not have an ethereal or ephemeral existence but enjoy an active life of service to others. They sleep and wake, love, breathe, eat, talk, read, work, play, and worship. They live a genuine life in a real spiritual body and world.&lt;ref&gt;Synnestvedt, S. ''The Essential Swedenborg'', Swedenborg Foundation 1977, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Swedenborg, we in the natural world can only see angels here when our spiritual eyes are opened. This corresponds to many instances in the Old Testament &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/contrib/exec_outlines/angel/angel_02.htm|title=Ministering Spirits - Angels In The Old Testament|website=www.ccel.org|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Testament (Matthew 18, Luke 2:14, Matthew 17, Luke 24, Revelation 1:10). Swedenborg received his revelation by the same process of his spiritual eyes being opened by God.&lt;ref&gt;''True Christian Religion,'' #779&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”From things heard and seen,” part of ''Heaven and Hell' book title.&lt;/ref&gt;

An angel’s whole environment – clothes, houses, towns, plants, etc. – are what Swedenborg terms [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. In other words, their environment spiritually reflects, and thus "corresponds" to, the mental state of the angel and changes as the angel's state changes.&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell'' #179, 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg writes that angels have no power of their own. God's power works through the Angel's to restrain evil spirits, one angel being able to restrain a thousand such spirits all at once. Angels exercise God's power chiefly in defending people against hell. Swedenborg is explicitly clear that Angels have no power whatsoever of their own, they neither take nor like to receive thanks or accept any credit.&lt;ref&gt;E. Swedenborg: [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AC.htm ''The Arcana Coelestia''], Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #6344&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Christian world it is believed that in the beginning angels and [[Devil|devils]] were created in heaven, also that the devil or Satan was an angel of light, but having rebelled he was cast down with his crew, and thus hell was formed.  Swedenborg states that, on the contrary, every angel or devil began life as an inhabitant of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell'' #311&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there are no angels or demons who were not people on Earth first.&lt;ref&gt;Benz , E. ''Emanuel Swedenborg. Visionary Savant in the Age of Reason'', Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, p. 403; Originally published as ''Emanuel Swedenborg. Naturforscher und Sehr'', Zurich; Swedenborg Verlag 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell'' #311-317, 544&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who die go directly to heaven, where they are raised by angel mothers.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter on "Children in Heaven" in ''Heaven and Hell'' #332ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kingslake, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men and women===
Angels are men and women in every detail just as they were here on earth, only they are spiritual and thus more perfect. See Chapter on “Marriage  in Heaven” in ''Heaven and Hell''&lt;ref&gt;[http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html ''Marriage Love'']  Swedenborg Foundation 1946, Chapter 40, # 366ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and  Swedenborg’s  book on the topic, ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love'' in older translations).&lt;ref&gt;E. Swedenborg [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/MLtc.html  ''Marriage (“Conjugial”) Love'']  Swedenborg Society 1953, # 27ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The spiritual conjunction of husband and wife that is the basis of true marriage in this world and the next is explained in ''Heaven and Hell'' # 366ff. and ''Marriage Love'' #156ff. {{quotation|The states of [true marriage love] are innocence, peace, tranquility, intimate friendship, full trust and a desire shared by the disposition and heart of each to do the other all the good they can. All these things give rise to blessedness, bliss, joy and pleasure, and by their everlasting heavenly happiness.|''Marriage Love'' #180}} Swedenborg says that this true married love was known in antiquity but largely lost since then, mainly due to loss in belief that this love is eternal and that there is life after death.&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Love''# 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Christian marriage ideal===
According to Swedenborg, married life continues after death as before, agreeing with the instinctive conviction of poets and lovers whose inward assurances tell them their love will surmount death and that they will live again and love again in human form.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic38.htm|title=The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 38|website=www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there is no “till death do us part” of happily married couples. (See “The Lord God Jesus Christ on marriage in heaven”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven/|title=The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven|date=22 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Swedenborg also says that Christian marriage love of one man and one woman is the highest of all loves, the source of the greatest bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; “For in themselves Christian marriages are so holy that there is nothing more holy. They are the seminaries of the human race, and the human race is the seminary of the heavens.” &lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia''# 9961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"/&gt;

The spiritual conjunction of husband and wife that is the basis of Christian marriage in this world and the next, is explained in ''Heaven and Hell'' # 366ff. and ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love'' in older translations) #156ff. Evidence  of this conjunction is found in the fact that husband and  wife together are called [one] “man” or “one flesh” in Genesis 1:27, 2:22-24, 5:2, and Mark 10:8.

In heavenly marriages neither partner tries to dominate the other since love of dominion of one partner eliminates the delight of that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell''  #369, 380&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancients believed in a fountain of perpetual youth. In heaven their dream is realized, for those who leave this world old, decrepit, diseased in body or deformed, renew their youth, and maintain their lives in the full vigor of early manhood and womanhood.&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg says that couples who lived in a chaste love of Christian marriage are more than all others in the order and form of heaven, and therefore in all beauty, and continue unceasingly in the flower of youth. The delights of their love are ineffable, and increase to eternity. What their outward delights are it is impossible to describe in human words.&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell'' # 489&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polygamy===
“[[Polygamy]]” is used here to describe any marital relationship between men and women other than one [[husband]] with one [[wife]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Love'' #332ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further variant is “Multiple Partners, but One at a Time” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/01/20/the-gingrich-question-cheating-vs-open-marriage/americans-prefer-serial-monogamy-to-open-relationships | work=The New York Times | title=The Gingrich Question: Cheating vs. Open Marriage | date=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (i.e. serial monogamy).  If  done for evil reasons, such as lust, it constitutes “successive polygamy.” &lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Love'' #317ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg said in his revelation that true Christian marriage love between one husband and several wives is impossible for its spiritual origin, which is the formation of one mind out of two, is thus destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Love,'' # 379&lt;/ref&gt; He says that love that is divided among a number of Christian partners is not true marriage love, but lasciviousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia'' # 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenborg, a Christian who marries more than one wife commits not only natural adultery but also spiritual adultery.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Marriage Love,'' #339ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In the highest sense to commit adultery means to deny the divinity of Jesus Christ and to profane the Word. Adultery is so great an evil, Swedenborg says, "that it may be called diabolism itself".&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. ''Doctrine of Life'' (Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #74)&lt;/ref&gt;  After death the damnation of Christian polygamists is more severe than the damnation of those who committed only natural adultery.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the other life adulterers love filth and live in filthy hells &lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia,'' # 5394, 5722&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synnestvedt, p. 74ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, p. 356ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time and space in the spiritual world===
There is neither time nor space as we understand them in the other world.  Both are replaced by a sense of state.  See  Chapter 18, “Time in Heaven” and Chapter 22, “Space in Heaven,” in Swedenborg E. ''Heaven and Hell,'' Swedenborg Foundation 1946, # 70, 191&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html|title=Heaven and its Wonders and Hell From Things Heard and Seen by Emanuel Swedenborg|website=swedenborgdigitallibrary.org|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World of Spirits===
The "World of Spirits" is not to be confused with “the spiritual world,” which is a general term referring to the whole extent of Heaven, Hell and the World of Spirits. The traditional Christian idea was of resurrection on Judgment Day at the end of history. Swedenborg says judgment takes place in the World of Spirits immediately after each individual’s death.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; After we die, we wake up in the intermediate region of the spiritual world, neither in Heaven nor Hell, but in a neutral "no man's land" that Swedenborg terms the "World of Spirits." &lt;ref&gt;See Chapter on “World of Spirits” in ''Heaven and Hell.'' Swedenborg Foundation, 1946, pp. 421ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Here we gradually lose the ability to pretend and the spiritual “real us” comes out.&lt;ref&gt;Kingslake, B. ''Inner Light. Swedenborg Explores the Spiritual Dimension,'' J. Appleseed &amp; Co., 2001, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting stripping of one's self bare, even to one's most secret thoughts and intentions, is the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Kingslake, B. ''Inner Light. Swedenborg Explores the Spiritual Dimension", J. Appleseed &amp; Co., 2001, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; “There is nothing concealed that shall not be uncovered, and nothing secret that shall not be known …” (Luke 12:2, 3; Matthew 10:26, ''Heaven and Hell,'' #498). Following this judgment the new spirit goes on to Heaven or Hell of his or her own free will. God does not force them. Spirits gather with those that are alike to themselves, whether in Heaven or Hell. Each Spirit is granted Angels and good Spirits, though evil spirits cannot endure their presence and so depart.&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell,'' #545&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equilibrium and spiritual free will===
According to Swedenborg, people are kept in spiritual freedom by means of the equilibrium between Heaven and Hell.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter on “The Equilibrium Between Heaven and Hell”  in ''Heaven and Hell'', #589ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Arcna Coelestia'', #597&lt;/ref&gt;

So who sends people to Heaven or Hell? Nobody but themselves. There is no inquiry as to their faith or former church affiliations, or whether they were baptized, or even what kind of life they lived on Earth. They migrate toward a heavenly or hellish state because they are drawn to its way of life, and for no other reason.&lt;ref&gt;Kingslake, B. ''Inner Light. Swedenborg Explores the Spiritual Dimension'', J. Appleseed, 2001, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can enter heaven. However, as soon as an evil person inhales the air there they have excruciating torment so they quickly shun it and escape to a state/place in keeping with their true state.&lt;ref&gt;Spalding, JH. ''Introduction to Swedenborg’s Religious Thought'', Swedenborg Publishing Association 1966, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  As the old saying goes, “Where the tree falls, there it lies.”&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastes 11:3, ''Divine Providence'', #277&lt;/ref&gt; The basic spiritual orientation of a person toward good or evil cannot be changed after death. Thus, an evil spirit could leave hell, but never wants to.&lt;ref&gt;''Heaven and Hell'', #480&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on Joseph Smith and Mormon theology ==

[[D. Michael Quinn]] suggests in his book ''[[D. Michael Quinn#Early Mormonism and the Magic World View|Early Mormonism and the Magic World View]]'' that ''Heaven and Hell'' influenced [[Joseph Smith]] in the creation of the [[Latter Day Saint]] view of the afterlife detailed in Doctrine and Covenants Section 76.

However, many of the similarities are rooted in Biblical language and by interpreting Biblical texts{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.  For example, the general view of three Heavens in the resurrection appears{{According to whom|date=August 2013}} to have its root from the writings attributed to the apostle Paul found in the New Testament, 1 Cor 15:40–42:

:"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead."

Allegorically, Swedenborg likens both the nature of each heaven as well as the illumination in the sky of each heaven to the sun, moon, and stars.&lt;ref&gt;Heaven and Hell, #119&lt;/ref&gt;  He states that the sun of the celestial heaven and the moon of the spiritual kingdom is the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Heaven and Hell, #118&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Mormonism]]'s view of I Cor 15:40–42, the resurrected bodies of those in three [[degrees of glory]] (celestial, terrestrial, and telestial heavens) are likened to the Sun, Moon, and stars.

Others who acknowledge parallels, including Mormon historian [[Richard Bushman]], propose that the similarities between the revelations of Smith and Swedenborg are due to the influence of Paul's writing on both of them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bushman|Bushman, Richard]]: ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'', 2005, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted, however, that Corinthians is not included in the list of books that, according to Swedenborg, constitute the divinely inspired Biblical canon listed in ''Arcana Coelestia'' 10,325,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=10325|title=AC 10325 - Small Canon Search - Reading - The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing

''The Swedenborg Epic'' (Bookman Associates 1952, p. 324)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kingslake, B.[ Lawrence, J., ed.] ''Inner Light. Swedenborg Explores the Spiritual Dimension'' (J.

'''Marla Hiromi Hayakawa Salas''' (October 19, 1982 – September 27, 2017), known professionally as '''Hiromi Hayakawa''', was a [[Japanese Mexicans|Japanese-born Mexican]] actress and singer who began her music career as a contestant in the reality show ''[[La Academia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/92504.hiromi-se-va-de-la-academia.html|title=Hiromi se va de La Academia|date=7 June 2004|work=[[El Siglo de Torreón]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked mostly in [[musical theatre]], however she has had occasional television roles. Hayakawa was also a [[voice acting|voice actress]], who worked primarily on the [[Hispanic America|Spanish American]] dub of films and series from the United States.

==Early life==
Hayakawa was born in [[Fukuoka]] to Alfonso Javier Hayakawa, who is of [[Japanese Mexicans|Japanese]] descent and a native of [[Torreón]], [[Coahuila]] and Lourdes Elsa Salas, from the city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], making her of Mexican and Japanese descent. Her parents resided in Fukuoka while her father studied Industrial Engineering there. They returned to Mexico when Hiromi was only two years old and at the time, her mother was pregnant with her second child, Kaori.

==Career==
===''La Academia''===
When she attended a casting call for ''[[La Academia]]'', Hayakawa scored 9.7 points out of a possible ten points. Though, before competing in ''La Academia'', Hayakawa studied Industrial Engineering and Systems at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] in Coahuila. She decided to attend the casting for ''La Academia'' because, as with most people who attend the castings, she saw it as a chance of pursuing a musical career.

Hayakawa left ''La Academia'' after the thirteenth concert; though she was later re-cast and became the sixth runner-up as the winner. The last song she sang as an official contestant was "La Playa" by La Oreja de Van Gogh. Two weeks after her expulsion, Hayakawa was given the opportunity to return to La Academia and become a finalist. Hayakawa and two other ex-students (Ricardo Hernández Quiñones and Dulce Lopez Rodriguez) were given a song which they had to perform in the next concert. The public would then vote on who they wanted to return to the finale instead of voting on who was going to be expelled. In the end Dulce Lopez Rodriguez won and went to the finale where she won 2nd place. One of the judges, Lolita Cortez, was very disappointed in the results.

===Theater===
Hayakawa is best known for her work on ''Mentiras: The Musical'', based on the pop culture and music of the 1980s. She has played all of the main roles: [[Daniela Romo|Daniela]], Dulce, [[Lupita D'Alessio|Lupita]], [[Yuri (Mexican singer)|Yuri]], [[Emmanuel (singer)|Emmanuel]] and [[Manoella Torres|Manoella]].

She is also known for her role as [[Mulan]] in ''12 Princesas en Pugna'', a satirical take on the [[Disney Princesses]]. Hayakawa has also worked on the Mexican adaptations of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]''.

==Death==
Hayakawa was expecting a baby, due on October 21, 2017. On September 26, she was rushed to a hospital and was discovered to have bleeding in the [[liver]]. Efforts were made to save the child, named Julieta, but she died at around 11&amp;nbsp;pm. Hayakawa died before noon, the following day. She was 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.univision.com/entretenimiento/muere-la-cantante-y-actriz-mexicana-hiromi-hayakawa-y-tambien-su-bebe-julieta |title=Muere Hiromi Hayakawa de 'La Academia' por complicaciones en el embarazo: también falleció la bebé |date=September 27, 2017 |publisher=[[Univision]] |access-date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, Hayakawa and Julieta were cremated, and the ashes will remain in Mexico City with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/farandula/familia-teatral-da-el-ultimo-adios-hiromi|title=Familia teatral da el último adiós a Hiromi|date=2017-09-28|work=El Universal|access-date=2017-09-28|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schema Theorem says that short, low-order schemata with above-average fitness increase exponentially in frequency in successive generations. The theorem was proposed by [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] in the 1970s. It was initially widely taken to be the foundation for explanations of the power of [[genetic algorithm]]s. However, this interpretation of its implications has been criticized in several publications reviewed in &lt;ref&gt;Altenberg, L. (1995). [http://dynamics.org/Altenberg/FILES/LeeSTPT.pdf The Schema Theorem and Price’s Theorem]. Foundations of genetic algorithms, 3, 23-49.&lt;/ref&gt;, where the Schema Theorem is shown to be a special case of the [[Price equation]] with the schema indicator function as the macroscopic measurement.  

A [[schema (genetic algorithms)|schema]] is a template that identifies a [[subset]] of strings with similarities at certain string positions. Schemata are a special case of [[cylinder set]]s, and hence form a [[topological space]].

== Description ==

Consider binary strings of length 6. The schema &lt;code&gt;1*10*1&lt;/code&gt; describes the set of all strings of length 6 with 1's at positions 1, 3 and 6 and a 0 at position 4. The * is a [[Wildcard character|wildcard]] symbol, which means that positions 2 and 5 can have a value of either 1 or 0. The ''order of a schema'' &lt;math&gt; o(H)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template, while the ''[[defining length]]'' &lt;math&gt; \delta(H) &lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the first and last specific positions. The order of &lt;code&gt;1*10*1&lt;/code&gt; is 4 and its defining length is 5. The ''fitness of a schema'' is the average fitness of all strings matching the schema. The fitness of a string is a measure of the value of the encoded problem solution, as computed by a problem-specific evaluation function. Using the established methods and [[genetic operator]]s of [[genetic algorithms]], the schema theorem states that short, low-order schemata with above-average fitness increase exponentially in successive generations. Expressed as an equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(m(H,t+1)) \geq {m(H,t) f(H) \over a_t}[1-p].&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;m(H,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of strings belonging to schema &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; at generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''observed'' average fitness of schema &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_t&lt;/math&gt; is the ''observed'' average fitness at generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The probability of disruption &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that crossover or mutation will destroy the schema &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. It can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;p = {\delta(H) \over l-1}p_c + o(H) p_m&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; o(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the order of the schema, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the code, &lt;math&gt; p_m&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of mutation and &lt;math&gt; p_c &lt;/math&gt; is the probability of crossover. So a schema with a shorter defining length &lt;math&gt; \delta(H) &lt;/math&gt; is less likely to be disrupted.&lt;br /&gt;An often misunderstood point is why the Schema Theorem is an ''inequality'' rather than an equality. The answer is in fact simple: the Theorem neglects the small, yet non-zero, probability that a string belonging to the schema &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; will be created "from scratch" by mutation of a single string (or recombination of two strings) that did ''not'' belong to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in the previous generation.

==Limitation==
[[File:Bimodal-bivariate-small.png|thumb|right|Plot of a multimodal function in two variables.]]
The schema theorem holds under the assumption of a genetic algorithm that maintains an infinitely large population, but does not always carry over to (finite) practice: due to [[sampling error]] in the initial population, genetic algorithms may converge on schemata that have no selective advantage. This happens in particular in [[multimodal distribution|multimodal optimization]], where a function can have multiple peaks: the population may [[genetic drift|drift]] to prefer one of the peaks, ignoring the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Goldberg |last1=David E. |first2=Jon |last2=Richardson |title=Genetic algorithms with sharing for multimodal function optimization |conference=2nd Int'l Conf. on Genetic Algorithms and their applications |year=1987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYJ_AAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that the Schema Theorem cannot explain the power of genetic algorithms is that it holds for all problem instances, and cannot distinguish between problems in which genetic algorithms perform poorly, and problems for which genetic algorithms perform well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5471">'''Homothallic''' refers to the possession, within a single organism, of the resources to reproduce sexually;&lt;ref name="urlOn-Line Glossary: H"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantpath.cornell.edu/glossary/Defs_H.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908130055/http://www.plantpath.cornell.edu/glossary/Defs_H.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-08 |title=On-Line Glossary: H |work= |accessdate=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., having male and female reproductive structures on the same [[thallus]].  The opposite sexual functions are performed by different cells of a single mycelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Homothallic|title=Homothallic|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be contrasted to [[heterothallic]].

It is often used to categorize [[fungus|fungi]]. In yeast, heterothallic cells have mating types '''a''' and '''α'''. An experienced mother cell (one that has divided at least once) will switch mating type every cell division cycle because of the ''HO'' allele.

Sexual reproduction commonly occurs in two fundamentally different ways in fungi.  These are outcrossing (in heterothallic fungi) in which two different individuals contribute nuclei to form a zygote, and self-fertilization or selfing (in homothallic fungi) in which both nuclei are derived from the same individual.

Among the 250 known species of aspergilli, about 36% have an identified sexual state.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dyer PS, O'Gorman CM |title=Sexual development and cryptic sexuality in fungi: insights from Aspergillus species |journal=FEMS Microbiol. Rev. |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=165–92 |date=January 2012  |pmid=22091779 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00308.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0168-6445&amp;date=2012&amp;volume=36&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species for which a sexual cycle has been observed, the majority in nature are homothallic (self-fertilizing).&lt;ref name=Dyer /&gt;  Selfing in the homothallic fungus ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' involves activation of the same mating pathways characteristic of sex in outcrossing species, i.e. self-fertilization does not bypass required pathways for outcrossing sex but instead requires activation of these pathways within a single individual.&lt;ref name="pmid17669651"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paoletti M, Seymour FA, Alcocer MJ, Kaur N, Calvo AM, Archer DB, Dyer PS |title=Mating type and the genetic basis of self-fertility in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=1384–9 |date=August 2007  |pmid=17669651 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.012 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960-9822(07)01690-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fusion of haploid nuclei occurs within reproductive structures termed [[Ascocarp|cleistothecia]], in which the [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] [[zygote]] undergoes [[Meiosis|meiotic]] divisions to yield [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] [[ascospores]].

A [[lichen]] is a composite organism consisting of a [[fungus]] and a [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] partner that are growing together in a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship. The photosynthetic partner is usually either a [[Green algae|green alga]] or a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]]. Lichens occur in some of the most extreme environments on Earth—[[Tundra#Arctic|arctic tundra]], hot [[desert]]s, rocky coasts, and toxic [[Slag|slag heaps]]. Most lichenized fungi produce abundant sexual structures and in many species sexual spores appear to be the only means of dispersal (Murtagh et al., 2000).  The lichens ''Graphis scripta'' and ''Ochrolechia parella'' do not produce symbiotic vegetative propagules.  Rather the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e. they are homothallic), and it was proposed that this breeding system allows successful reproduction in harsh environments (Murtagh et al., 2000).&lt;ref name="pmid10766229"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murtagh GJ, Dyer PS, Crittenden PD |title=Sex and the single lichen |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6778 |pages=564 |date=April 2000  |pmid=10766229 |doi=10.1038/35007142 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35007142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Homothallism appears to be common in natural populations of fungi. Although self-fertilization employs meiosis, it produces minimal genetic variability. Homothallism is thus a form of sex that is unlikely to be adaptively maintained by a benefit related to producing variability.  However, homothallic meiosis may be maintained in fungi as an adaptation for surviving stressful conditions; a proposed [[Meiosis|benefit of]] [[Meiosis#Theory that DNA repair is the adaptive advantage of meiosis|meiosis]] is the promoted [[Homologous recombination|homologous meiotic recombinational]] repair of DNA damages that are ordinarily caused by a stressful environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

[[File:Fountain of Eternal Life crop.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[Fountain of Eternal Life]]'' in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] is described as symbolizing "Man rising above death, reaching upward to God and toward Peace."&lt;ref name="GVCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |title=GCVM History and Mission |accessdate=2009-01-14 |publisher=Greater Cleveland Veteran's Memorial, Inc. |date=2003 |author=Marshall Fredericks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216170723/http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Immortality''' is eternal [[life]], being exempt from [[death]], unending existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immortality|website=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immortality#Biological immortality|Some modern species]] may possess [[biological immortality]].

Certain scientists, [[futurist]]s, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that [[life extension]] is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or [[major trauma|physical trauma]]; although [[mind uploading]] could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282157696|title=Artificial Neural Command Theory(American English) (US)|last=Hentrich |first=Michael|date= September 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion|religious]] contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of [[God]] (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow [[divine law]]. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial [[soul]] exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of [[religion]], as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.

==Definitions==

===Scientific===
{{main|Anti-aging movement}}
[[Life extension]] technologies promise a path to complete [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. [[Cryonics]] holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]] and [[Planarian|planarian worms]], it is indeed possible for a creature to be [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]], it is not known if it is possible for humans.

[[Mind uploading]] is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kurzweil, Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology |publisher=Viking Adult |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
{{See also|Soul}}
The belief in an ''[[afterlife]]'' is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]; however, the concept of an immortal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not. The "soul" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.

==Alchemy==
{{Main|Alchemy}}
{{See also|Elixir of life|Philosopher's stone}}

==Physical immortality==
Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as [[cryonics]], [[digital immortality]], breakthroughs in [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] or predictions of an impending [[technological singularity]], or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] or [[Rebirthing-Breathwork|Rebirthers]].

===Causes of death===
{{Main|Death}}

There are three main causes of death: [[aging]], [[disease]] and [[physical trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayflick|first=L|title=Biological Aging is No Longer an Unsolved Problem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1100|issue=1|pages=1–13|date=2007|url=http://0-content.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/pdf19_22/pdf/2007/YQR/11Apr07/24963097.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=24963097&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr0qepq5Srqi4TLSWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvrki0ra9JuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|doi=10.1196/annals.1395.001|pmid=17460161|bibcode=2007NYASA1100....1H}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

====Aging====
[[Aubrey de Grey]], a leading researcher in the field,&lt;ref name="Garreau"/&gt; defines [[aging]] as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an adult [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], [[oncology|oncogenic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[mutation]]s and [[epimutation]]s, cell [[senescence]], [[mitochondria]]l mutations, [[lysosomal]] aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [[immune system]] decline, and [[endocrine]] changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|engineered negligible senescence]]. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) ''Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair''.

====Disease====
Disease is theoretically surmountable via [[technology]]. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of diseases functioning and disability|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human understanding of [[genetics]] is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. [[Preventative medicine]] is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] may soon be curable with the use of [[stem cells]]. Breakthroughs in [[cell biology]] and [[telomere]] research are leading to treatments for [[cancer]]. [[Vaccine]]s are being researched for [[AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Genes associated with [[type 1 diabetes]] and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the [[nervous system]] may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

====Trauma====
[[Physical trauma]] would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of [[paramedic]] [[disaster relief operation|response]] remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=International Search and Rescue Teams, A League Discussion Paper |date=1991 |publisher=[[IFRC|League of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] |location=[[Geneva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for [[nanotechnology]], would mitigate this factor.
Being the seat of [[consciousness]], the [[brain]] cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

====Environmental change ====
Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the [[cumulative probability]] of death over an infinite horizon is less than [[certainty]], even when the risk of fatal trauma [[Survival analysis#Hazard function and cumulative hazard function|in any finite period]] is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving "[[Indefinite lifespan#Actuarial escape velocity|actuarial escape velocity]]"

===Biological immortality===
[[File:Telomere caps.gif|thumb|right|Human [[chromosome]]s (grey) capped by telomeres (white)]]
{{Main|Biological immortality}}

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in [[rate of mortality]] as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.

[[Biologist]]s have chosen the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not limited by the [[Hayflick limit]], where cells no longer divide because of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is [[HeLa]], developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of [[Henrietta Lacks]] without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of [[Leonard Hayflick]], there was the erroneous belief fostered by [[Alexis Carrel]] that all normal [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a "cap" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. [[Telomerase]] is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name="LinKahWai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lin Kah Wai |authorlink=Lin Kah Wai |title=Telomeres, Telomerase, and Tumorigenesis -- A Review |journal=MedGenMed |date=18 April 2004 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=19 |pmid=15520642 |pmc=1435592}}&lt;/ref&gt; No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html|title=New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals|website=nytimes.com|access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biologically immortal species====

Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:
* ''[[Bacteria]]'' – Bacteria reproduce through [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 [[PLoS Biology]] paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/08/01/54/PDF/stewart_Plos.pdf|title= Aging and Death in an Organism That Reproduces by Morphologically Symmetric Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18524855.800-bacteria-death-reduces-human-hopes-of-immortality.html |title=Bacteria Death Reduces Human Hopes of Immortality |date=February 5, 2005 |website=New Scientist magazine, issue 2485, page 19 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution of aging====
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}&lt;!--that's how they spell aging in England ... and in that article--&gt;
As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no [[second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] from the environment and unloads its [[entropy]] as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of [[evolution]], but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere "end replication problem" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.R. 1999. ''A Means to an End: The biological basis of aging and death.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{cite web |url=http://wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212036/http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }} About telomeres and programmed cell death.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Ch. 69, Cancer cell biology and angiogenesis, Robert G. Fenton and Dan L. Longo, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:
* Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
* [[Pleiotropy|Antagonistic pleiotropy]] is a theory proposed as an alternative by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. 1957. Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. ''Evolution'', '''11''':398-411. {{cite web|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging. ''Nature'', '''270''': 301-304. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html] Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospects for human biological immortality===

====Life-extending substances====
There are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phytochemicals.info/abstracts/resveratrol-life-span.php |title=Resveratrol may increase life span |publisher=Phytochemicals.info |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=:: compound resveratrol may turn off a protein that guards cancer cells from cancer-fighting therapies |url=http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |publisher=Wordpress.rudramani.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803231526/http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[scientist]]s believe that boosting the amount or proportion of [[telomerase]] in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of [[chromosome]]s, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre ([[Madrid]]) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3489881/Scientists-take-a-step-closer-to-an-elixir-of-youth.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Scientists take a step closer to an elixir of youth |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their [[Hayflick limit]]. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [[DNA]], and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

[[Embryonic stem cells]] express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

====Technological immortality, biological machines, and  "swallowing the doctor"====
{{Main|Transhumanism}}

Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, [[biological engineering]], [[regenerative medicine]], [[microbiology]], and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of [[human cloning]], cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. [[Robert Freitas]], a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical [[nanorobot]]s could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., ''Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol'', self-published, 2001 [http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Microbivores.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=The Singularity Is Near |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Cryonics====
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]], the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and [[rejuvenation (aging)|aging is reversible]]. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] which creates a glass-like state rather than [[freezing]] as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.

====Mind-to-computer uploading====
{{Main|Mind uploading}}

One idea that has been advanced involves [[Mind uploading|uploading]] an individual's habits and memories via [[direct mind-computer interface]]. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. [[Extropian]] [[futures studies|futurists]] like Moravec and [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] have proposed that, thanks to [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] computing power, it will someday be possible to [[mind uploading|upload human consciousness]] onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of [[identity (social science)|identity]], thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anders |first=Sandberg |last2=Nick |first2=Boström |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.'' |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2009 |series=Technical Report #2008‐3 |date=2008 |publisher=Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of [[consciousness]] in the functions of the [[mind]]. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/iva-to/on-achieving-immortality-3ed1d567f7a2|title=On Achieving Immortality|last=Ruparel|first=Bhavik|date=2018-07-30|website=Iva.to|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[neural correlates of consciousness]] is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}

====Cybernetics====
{{Main|Cyborg}}

Transforming a human into a [[cyborg]] can include [[brain implants]] or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.

====Digital immortality====
{{Main|Digital immortality}}

==Religious views==
{{Main|Afterlife|Soul}}
As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the ''[[A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas|Syntopicon]]'' found in their compilation of the [[Great Books of the Western World]], that "The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul."&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 788"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=788 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the [[afterlife]].

===Ancient Greek religion===
Immortality in [[ancient Greek religion]] originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either [[Elysium]], the [[Islands of the Blessed]], heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were [[Amphiaraus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Iphigenia]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuce]], the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]] were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]], the 7th century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a belief first appearing with either [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] or the [[Orphics]], and most importantly advocated by [[Plato]] and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of [[Jesus]] was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say&amp;nbsp;... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21).

===Buddhism===
The goal of [[Hinayana]] is [[Arhatship]] and [[Nirvana]].  By contrast, the goal of [[Mahayana]] is [[Buddhahood]].

According to one [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching, [[Dzogchen]], individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the [[rainbow body]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Eternal life (Christianity)|Christian conditionalism|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 3.jpg|thumb|Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''Danse Macabre'', 16th century]]

[[Christianity|Christian theology]] holds that [[Adam and Eve]] lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the [[Fall of man]], although this initial "imperishability of the bodily frame of man" was "a preternatural condition".&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 784"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=784 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians who profess the [[Nicene Creed]] believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected from the dead]] at the [[Second Coming]], and this belief is known as [[Universal resurrection]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[N.T. Wright]], a theologian and former [[Bishop of Durham]], has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told [[Time (magazine)|Time]]: "Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon [[Second Coming of Christ|his return]]. Part of this will be the [[Universal resurrection|resurrection of all the dead]], who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says [[John Polkinghorne]], a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [[Intermediate state]]) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [[World to Come|Christ's kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html |work=Time |title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&amp;#13; |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |first=David |last=Van Biema}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kingdom will consist of [[World to Come|Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"]], he said.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Chiranjivi|Naraka (Hinduism)}}
[[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|Representation of a soul undergoing ''punarjanma''. Illustration from ''Hinduism Today'', 2004]]

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] believe in an immortal soul which is [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called ''[[samsara]]''. If they live their life well, their ''[[karma]]'' improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss.  There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There are explicit renderings in the [[Upanishad]]s alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That man indeed whom these (contacts)&lt;br&gt;do not disturb, who is even-minded in&lt;br&gt;pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit&lt;br&gt;for immortality, O best of men.&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, pp 94-95 (v 15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, "Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life&amp;nbsp;... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life."&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"/&gt;

An Indian Tamil saint known as [[Vallalar]] claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallalar.org |title=vallalar.org |publisher=vallalar.org |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Fabled East: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y1RgQC-hw1MC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Vallalar+immortality+1874#v=onepage&amp;q=Vallalar%20immortality%201874&amp;f=false|author=Adam Schroeder|publisher=[[Douglas &amp; McIntyre|D &amp; M Publishers]]|page=174|isbn=9781553656159|date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
Sikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to  earth as they please to help the world a better place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/sikhs-soul-lives-on-body-dies_n_1763220.html|title=For Sikhs, The Soul Lives On Long After The Body Dies|last=Burke|first=Daniel|date=2012-10-08|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{primary sources|date=June 2015}}
The traditional concept of an immaterial and [[Immortality of the soul|immortal soul]] distinct from the body was not found in [[Judaism]] before the [[Babylonian Exile]], but developed as a result of interaction with [[Persian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]]. Accordingly, the Hebrew word ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' (''psūchê''), the Greek word for soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (''nephesh'') in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term "soul," we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.", Avery-Peck, "Soul", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] speaks about ''[[Sheol]]'' (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the [[Resurrection of the dead#Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism|resurrection of the dead]]. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:1–4|ESV}} although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the [[intertestamental period]].

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in [[Second Temple Period]]. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” &lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the [[Messianic Age]] with the coming of the [[messiah in Judaism|messiah]]. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The [[Tanakh]] is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Taoism===
{{See also|Chinese alchemy|Taoism and death|Xian (Taoism)}}

It is repeatedly stated in [[Lüshi Chunqiu]] that death is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creel|first=Herrlee G.|title=What is Taoism? : and other studies in Chinese cultural history|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226120478|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Maspero]] noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a ''way of life'' than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle. Taoism: Growth of a Religion (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997 [original French 1992]), p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Legge, James. The Texts of Taoism. 1962, Dover Press. NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Zoroastrian]]s believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for "immortal" is associated with the month "Amurdad", meaning "deathless" in Persian, in the [[Iranian calendar]] (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or [[Ameretat]] is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the "Angel of Immortality" won over the "Angel of Death" in this month.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshang, Dr. Bhadha. http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727145155/http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html |date=2017-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul==

===Alcmaeon of Croton===
[[Alcmaeon of Croton]] argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.&lt;ref name="alcmaeon"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Phaedo#The Cyclical Argument|Cyclical Argument]], or Opposites Argument explains that [[Theory of forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.

* The [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Theory of Recollection]] explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.

* The [[Phaedo#The Affinity Argument|Affinity Argument]], explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The [[Phaedo#The Argument from Form of Life|Argument from Form of Life]], or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Plotinus===
[[Plotinus]] offers a version of the argument that Kant calls "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Plotinus first argues that the soul is [[Simple (philosophy)|simple]], then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s [[Phaedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, D. (2008) "The Neoplatonic Achilles" in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metochites===
[[Theodore Metochites]] argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.&lt;ref name="metochites"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/#ImmSou&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna===
[[Avicenna]] argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna's Metaphysics: Al-Shifâ’, Al-Ilâhiyyât, ed. Mohammad Youssef Moussa, Solayman Dunya, Sa’id Zayed (Cairo, Organisme Général des Imprimeries Gouvernementales, 1960), II: 431–2; translated by A.J. Arberry, Aspects of Islamic Civilization (London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964), p. 153. See too Jean R, Michot, La destinée de l’homme selon Avicenne (Louvain, Peeters, 1986), pp. 22–56, and particularly pp. 26–27, and 43; J. Janssens, “Ibn Sînâ's Ideas of ultimate Realities, Neoplatonism and the Qur’ân as Problem-Solving paradigms in the Avicennian System,” Ultimate Reality and Meaning 10 (1987), 259–261. Cf. too Michael Marmura's complete translation, Avicenna: The Metaphysics of the Healing, Provo, Utah, Brigham Young University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquinas===
The full argument for the immortality of the soul and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Rozemond, M. (2010). "Descartes and the Immortality of the Soul". in Mind, Method and Morality: Essays in Honor of Anthony Kenny. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
In early work, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his [[monadology]] he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses Mendelssohn===
[[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Phaedon]]'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, B. (2008). "Kant and Mendelssohn on the Implications of the ‘I Think’ ".in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{See also|Life extension#Ethics and politics of life extension}}

The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include [[persistent vegetative state]]s, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, [[Human enhancement#Inequality and Social Disruption|social and economic]] disparities created by [[longevity]], and survival of the [[heat death of the universe]].

===Undesirability===
Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s short story "The Mortal Immortal", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story "[[The Immortal (short story)|The Immortal]]"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book ''Thursday's Fictions'', and the stage and film adaptations of it, [[Richard James Allen]] tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poems-book/thursday-s-fictions-0371000|title=Thursday's Fictions - Richard James Allen - Poems by book - Australian Poetry Library|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the novel ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]'' depicts immortality as "falling off the wheel of life" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime ''[[Casshern Sins]]'' humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In [[Anne Rice]]'s book series ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', [[vampire]]s are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.

In his book ''Death'', Yale philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''Death''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 238-46. As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] in his book ''Problems of the Self'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' [[social structures]]. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] shapes their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[Dossey, Larry; In: Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing; Mar/Apr2017; v.13. n.2, 81-87. 7p. (editorial) ISSN 1550-8307 {{PMID|28108110}}, Database: CINAHL Complete]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global [[demographic shift]] of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Goodkind, Kowal|first1=Wan, Daniel, Paul|title=An Aging World: 2015|journal=International Population Reports: U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2016|volume=1|issue=16|page=1–30|url=census.gov|accessdate=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

== Politics ==
Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php|title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science|website=Fight Aging!|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:Ankh-Symbol.svg|right|thumb|80px|The ankh]]

There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The [[ankh]] is an [[Egypt]]ian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the [[:Category:Egyptian deities|gods]] and [[pharaoh]]s, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The [[Möbius strip]] in the shape of a [[trefoil knot]] is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the [[Ouroboros]], the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ''ten'' [[kanji]], the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the [[peacock]] in Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesuswalk.com/christian-symbols/peacock.htm |author=Wilson, Ralph F. |title=Peacock as an Ancient Christian Symbol of Eternal Life |publisher=Jesus Walk Bible Study Series |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the colors [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] (in [[Western culture]]) and [[Peach (color)|peach]] (in [[Chinese culture]]).

==Fiction==
{{Main|Immortality in fiction}}
Immortality is a popular subject in [[fiction]], as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own [[Death|mortality]]. Immortal beings and [[species]] abound in fiction, especially [[fantasy]] fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.&lt;ref name="Garreau"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Garreau |authorlink=Joel Garreau |title=The Invincible Man |date=October 31, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/30/AR2007103002222_pf.html |pages=C01 |journal=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with [[Morgoth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the Dreaming God of ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, [[Superman]] is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: [[Kryptonite]]. (See also [[Achilles' heel]].)

Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy [[elf|elves]] often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as [[vampire]]s and the immortals in the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', can only die from [[beheading]]. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a [[silver bullet]] (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/how-to-kill-a-vampire.html|title=How To Kill a Vampire - The Only 5 Methods Known To Man|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102231840/http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |archivedate=2012-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial fermentation''' is the intentional use of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] by [[microorganism]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] as well as eukaryotic cells like [[Cho cells|CHO cells]] and [[insect cell culture|insect cells]], to make products useful to humans. Fermented products have applications as [[food]] as well as in general [[industry]]. Some commodity chemicals, such as [[acetic acid]], [[citric acid]], and [[ethanol]] are made by fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yusuf Chisti|editor1-last=Robinson|editor1-first=Richard K.|title=Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology|date=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-227070-3|pages=663–674|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~ychisti/FermentInd.PDF|ref=Chisti1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of fermentation depends on the concentration of microorganisms, cells, cellular components, and enzymes as well as temperature, pH&lt;ref name="Fermentation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/SeniorLab/Fermentation/ |title=Fermentation |publisher=Rpi.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Evolution of aerobic fermentation|aerobic fermentation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RUMRF5jpIUC&amp;pg=PA103 |title=Introduction to Biochemical Engineering – Dubasi Govardhana Rao |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; oxygen. Product recovery frequently involves the concentration of the dilute solution. Nearly all commercially produced enzymes, such as [[lipase]], [[invertase]] and [[rennet]], are made by fermentation with [[genetic engineering|genetically modified microbes]]. In some cases, production of biomass itself is the objective, as in the case of [[baker's yeast]] and lactic acid bacteria [[starter cultures]] for cheesemaking. In general, fermentations can be divided into four types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanbury|first1=Peter F.|last2=Whiitaker|first2=Allan|last3=Hall|first3=Stephen J.|title=Principles of Fermentation Technology|date=1999|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0750645010|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Fermentation_Technology.html?id=UGdyQgAACAAJ|ref=Stanbury1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Production of biomass (viable cellular material)
*Production of extracellular metabolites (chemical compounds)
*Production of intracellular components (enzymes and other proteins)
*Transformation of substrate (in which the transformed substrate is itself the product)

These types are not necessarily disjoint from each other, but provide a framework for understanding the differences in approach. The organisms used may be bacteria, yeasts, molds, algae, animal cells, or plant cells. Special considerations are required for the specific organisms used in the fermentation, such as the dissolved [[oxygen]] level, nutrient levels, and [[temperature]].

==General process overview==
In most industrial fermentations, the organisms or eukaroyotic cells are submerged in a liquid medium; in others, such as the fermentation of [[cocoa bean]]s, [[coffee]] cherries, and [[miso]], fermentation takes place on the moist surface of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~ychisti/FermentInd.PDF |format=PDF |title=Fermentation (Industrial) |publisher=Massey.ac.nz |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wurm2004&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wurm FM |title=Production of recombinant protein therapeutics in cultivated mammalian cells |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=1393–1398 |date=2004 |doi=10.1038/nbt1026 |pmid=15529164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also industrial considerations related to the fermentation process. For instance, to avoid biological process contamination, the fermentation medium, air, and equipment are sterilized. Foam control can be achieved by either mechanical foam destruction or chemical anti-foaming agents. Several other factors must be measured and controlled such as pressure, temperature, agitator shaft power, and viscosity. An important element for industrial fermentations is scale up. This is the conversion of a laboratory procedure to an industrial process. It is well established in the field of industrial microbiology that what works well at the laboratory scale may work poorly or not at all when first attempted at large scale. It is generally not possible to take fermentation conditions that have worked in the laboratory and blindly apply them to industrial-scale equipment. Although many parameters have been tested for use as scale up criteria, there is no general formula because of the variation in fermentation processes. The most important methods are the maintenance of constant power consumption per unit of broth and the maintenance of constant volumetric transfer rate.&lt;ref name="Fermentation"/&gt;

===Phases of growth===
[[image:Bacterial growth en.svg|250px|right|thumb|Bacterial growth curve\Kinetic Curve]]
When a particular organism is introduced into a selected growth medium, the medium is inoculated with the particular organism.  Growth of the inoculum does not occur immediately, but takes a little while.   This is the period of adaptation, called the lag phase.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.ifr.ac.uk/bacanova/project_backg.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205637/http://www.ifr.ac.uk/bacanova/project_backg.html |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the lag phase, the rate of growth of the organism steadily increases, for a certain period—this period is the log or exponential phase.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  After a certain time of exponential phase, the rate of growth slows down, due to the continuously falling concentrations of nutrients and/or a continuously increasing (accumulating) concentrations of toxic substances. This phase, where the increase of the rate of growth is checked, is the deceleration phase.  After the deceleration phase, growth ceases and the culture enters a stationary phase or a steady state. The biomass remains constant, except when certain accumulated chemicals in the culture lyse the cells (chemolysis). Unless other micro-organisms contaminate the culture, the chemical constitution remains unchanged. If all of the nutrients in the medium are consumed, or if the 
concentration of toxins is too great, the cells may become [[senescence|scenescent]] and begin to die off. The total amount of biomass may not decrease, but the number of viable organisms will decrease.

===Fermentation medium===
The microbes or eukarytic cells used for fermentation grow in (or on) specially designed [[growth medium]] which supplies the nutrients required by the organisms or cells. A variety of media exist, but invariably contain a carbon source, a nitrogen source, water, salts, and micronutrients. In the production of wine, the medium is grape must. In the production of bio-ethanol, the medium may consist mostly of whatever inexpensive carbon source is available.

Carbon sources are typically sugars or other carbohydrates, although in the case of substrate transformations (such as the production of vinegar) the carbon source may be an alcohol or something else altogether. For large scale fermentations, such as those used for the production of ethanol, inexpensive sources of carbohydrates, such as [[molasses]], [[corn steep liquor]],&lt;ref name="CORN STEEP LIQUOR IN MICROBIOLOGY"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=180696 | pmid=16350125 | volume=12 | issue=4 | title=Corn Steep Liquor in Microbiology. | date=Dec 1948 | journal=Bacteriol Rev | pages=297–311 | last1 = Liggett | first1 = RW | last2 = Koffler | first2 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; sugar cane juice, or sugar beet juice are used to minimize costs. More sensitive fermentations may instead use purified [[glucose]], [[sucrose]], [[glycerol]] or other sugars, which reduces variation and helps ensure the purity of the final product. Organisms meant to produce enzymes such as [[beta galactosidase]], [[invertase]] or other amylases may be fed starch to select for organisms that express the enzymes in large quantity.

[[nitrogen fixation|Fixed nitrogen]] sources are required for most organisms to synthesize [[proteins]], [[nucleic acid]]s and other cellular components. Depending on the enzyme capabilities of the organism, nitrogen may be provided as bulk protein, such as soy meal; as pre-digested polypeptides, such as [[peptone]] or [[tryptone]]; or as ammonia or nitrate salts. Cost is also an important factor in the choice of a nitrogen source. Phosphorus is needed for production of [[phospholipids]] in cellular membranes and for the production of [[nucleic acid]]s. The amount of phosphate which must be added depends upon the composition of the broth and the needs of the organism, as well as the objective of the fermentation. For instance, some cultures will not produce secondary metabolites in the presence of phosphate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/ebooks/archive/free/BK9780854046065/BK9780854046065-00001.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202194708/http://www.rsc.org/ebooks/archive/free/BK9780854046065/BK9780854046065-00001.pdf |date=December 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth factors and trace nutrients are included in the fermentation broth for organisms incapable of producing all of the vitamins they require. [[Yeast extract]] is a common source of micronutrients and vitamins for fermentation media. Inorganic nutrients, including [[trace element]]s  such as iron, zinc, copper, manganese, molybdenum and cobalt are typically present in unrefined carbon and nitrogen sources, but may have to be added when purified carbon and nitrogen sources are used. Fermentations which produce large amounts of gas (or which require the addition of gas) will tend to form a layer of foam, since fermentation broth typically contains a variety of foam-reinforcing proteins, peptides or starches. To prevent this foam from occurring or accumulating, [[antifoaming agent]]s may be added. Mineral buffering salts, such as carbonates and phosphates, may be used to stabilize pH near optimum. When metal ions are present in high concentrations, use of a [[chelator|chelating agent]] may be necessary.

==Production of biomass==
[[Microbial]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[biomass]] is sometimes the intended product of fermentation. Examples include [[single cell protein]], [[bakers yeast]], [[lactobacillus]], [[E. coli]], and others. In the case of single-cell protein, [[algae]] is grown in large open ponds which allow photosynthesis to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfalaval.com/industries/industrial-fermentation/algae-harvesting/pages/algae-harvesting.aspx |title=Algae harvesting – Industrial fermentation – Separators |publisher=Alfalaval.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the biomass is to be used for inoculation of other fermentations, care must be taken to prevent [[mutation]]s from occurring.

==Production of extracellular metabolites==
[[Metabolite]]s can be divided into two groups: those produced during the growth phase of the organism, called '''primary metabolites''' and those produced during the stationary phase, called '''secondary metabolites'''. Some examples of primary metabolites are [[ethanol]], [[citric acid]], [[glutamic acid]], [[lysine]], [[vitamin]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s. Some examples of secondary metabolites are [[penicillin]], [[cyclosporin A]], [[gibberellin]], and [[lovastatin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Primary metabolites===
[[Primary metabolite]]s are compounds made during the ordinary metabolism of the organism during the growth phase. A common example is ethanol or lactic acid, produced during [[glycolysis]]. Citric acid is produced by some strains of ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' as part of the [[citric acid cycle]] to acidify their environment and prevent competitors from taking over. Glutamate is produced by some '' [[Micrococcus]] '' species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15965888 | volume=50 | issue=6 | title=Studies on the amino acid fermentation. Part 1. Production of L-glutamic acid by various microorganisms. | date=Dec 2004 | journal=J Gen Appl Microbiol | pages=331–43 | last1 = Kinoshita | first1 = S | last2 = Udaka | first2 = S | last3 = Shimono | first3 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some '' [[Corynebacterium]] '' species produce lysine, threonine, tryptophan and other amino acids. All of these compounds are produced during the normal "business" of the cell and released into the environment. There is therefore no need to rupture the cells for product recovery.

===Secondary metabolites===
[[Secondary metabolite]]s are compounds made in the stationary phase; penicillin, for instance, prevents the growth of bacteria which could compete with ''[[Penicillium]]'' molds for resources. Some bacteria, such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' species, are able to produce [[bacteriocin]]s which prevent the growth of bacterial competitors as well. These compounds are of obvious value to humans wishing to prevent the growth of bacteria, either as [[antibiotic]]s or as [[antiseptic]]s (such as [[gramicidin S]]). Fungicides, such as [[griseofulvin]] are also produced as secondary metabolites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Typically secondary metabolites are not produced in the presence of glucose or other carbon sources which would encourage growth,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and like primary metabolites are released into the surrounding medium without rupture of the cell membrane.

In the early days of the biotechnology industry, most [[biopharmaceutical]] products were made in ''[[E. coli]]''; by 2004 more biopharmaceuticals were manufactured in eukaryotic cells, like [[Cho cells|CHO cells]], than in microbes, but used similar [[bioreactor]] systems.&lt;ref name="Wurm2004"/&gt;  [[Insect cell culture]] systems came into use in the 2000s as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drugmand|first1=JC|last2=Schneider|first2=YJ|last3=Agathos|first3=SN|title=Insect cells as factories for biomanufacturing.|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=2012|volume=30|issue=5|pages=1140–57|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.09.014|pmid=21983546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production of intracellular components==
Of primary interest among the intracellular components are microbial [[enzyme]]s: [[catalase]], [[amylase]], [[protease]], [[pectinase]], [[glucose isomerase]], [[cellulase]], [[hemicellulase]], [[lipase]], [[lactase]], [[streptokinase]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Lourdes|first1=Maria |last2=Polizeli |first2=T. M. |last3=Rai |first3=Mahendra |title=Fungal Enzymes |date=2013 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-466-59454-8 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Fungal-Enzymes/Polizeli-Rai/p/book/9781466594548}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recombinant proteins, such as [[insulin]], [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[interferon]], [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[streptokinase]] and others are also made this way.&lt;ref name=Wurm2004/&gt; The largest difference between this process and the others is that the cells must be ruptured (lysed) at the end of fermentation, and the environment must be manipulated to maximize the amount of the product. Furthermore, the product (typically a protein) must be separated from all of the other cellular proteins in the lysate to be purified.

==Transformation of substrate==
Substrate transformation involves the transformation of a specific compound into another, such as in the case of [[phenylacetylcarbinol]], and [[steroid]] [[biotransformation]], or the transformation of a raw material into a finished product, in the case of food fermentations and sewage treatment.

===Food fermentation===
{{main article|Fermentation (food)}}
Ancient fermented food processes, such as making [[bread]], [[wine]], [[cheese]], [[curds]], [[idli]], [[dosa]], etc., can be dated to more than [[5th millennium BC|seven thousand years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-011-7691-0_24#page-1 |title=Industrial Fermentation: Principles, Processes, and Products |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02 |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7691-0_24 |journal=Riegel's Handbook of Industrial Chemistry |pages=916–986|year=1992 |last1=Humphrey |first1=Arthur E |last2=Lee |first2=S. Edward |isbn=978-94-011-7693-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were developed long before man had any knowledge of the existence of the [[microorganism]]s involved. Some foods such as [[Marmite]] are the byproduct of the fermentation process, in this case in the production of [[beer]].

===Ethanol fuel===
{{main article|Ethanol fuel}}
Fermentation is the main source of ethanol in the production of [[ethanol fuel]]. Common crops such as sugar cane, potato, cassava and corn are fermented by yeast to produce ethanol which is further processed to become fuel.

===Sewage treatment===
{{main article|Sewage disposal}}
In  the process of sewage treatment, sewage is digested by enzymes secreted by bacteria. Solid organic matters are broken down into harmless, soluble substances and carbon dioxide. Liquids that result are disinfected to remove pathogens before being discharged into rivers or the sea or can be used as liquid fertilizers.  Digested solids, known also as sludge, is dried and used as fertilizer.  Gaseous byproducts such as methane can be utilized as [[biogas]] to fuel electrical generators.  One advantage of bacterial digestion is that it reduces the bulk and odor of sewage, thus reducing space needed for dumping. The main disadvantage of bacterial digestion in sewage disposal is that it is a very slow process.

===Agricultural feed===
A wide variety of agroindustrial waste products can be fermented to use as food for animals, especially ruminants. Fungi have been employed to break down cellulosic wastes to increase protein content and improve ''in vitro'' digestibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=173313796008 |title=Biodegradation of agroindustrial wastes by Pleurotus spp for its use as ruminant feed |doi=10.2225/vol9-issue3-fulltext-2 |publisher=Redalyc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Blake Miller''' (born July 10, 1984) is a [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran of the [[Iraq War]], who fought in the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] and was dubbed the "[[Marlboro Man]]" (and the "Marlboro Marine") after an iconic photograph of him with a cigarette was published in newspapers in the [[United States]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=LAT111107&gt;Luis Sinco, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/photography/la-na-marlboro11nov11,0,2214837.story Two lives blurred together by a photo], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Pettegrew|title=Light It Up: The Marine Eye for Battle in the War for Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfEyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT170|date=28 October 2015|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-1-4214-1786-8|pages=170–172}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Regina Lee Blaszczyk|title=Producing Fashion: Commerce, Culture, and Consumers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRKu_r1VnAUC&amp;pg=PA187|date=3 October 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0605-3|page=187}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Westwell|title=Parallel Lines: Post-9/11 American Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plUZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158|date=21 October 2014|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-0-231-17203-5|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] after the war.&lt;ref name=LAT111107 /&gt;

==Early life==
Miller grew up in [[Jonancy, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=LAT111107/&gt; Miller's parents inspiration of his middle name was the show ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', and both grandfathers served in the military with one serving in combat during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=SFGate2006&gt;{{cite news |last=Stannard |first=Matthew B. |date=29 January 2006 |title=The War Within |url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/THE-WAR-WITHIN-2505577.php |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle  |access-date=1 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an [[ordained minister]].&lt;ref name=LAT111107/&gt; Not interested in working in the [[coal mine]]s, Miller joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] with the intention to eventually work in [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].&lt;ref name=LAT111107/&gt;

==Iraq War==
[[File:James Blake Miller as Marlboro Marine.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|The "Marlboro Marine" photo of Miller by Luis Sinco|alt=A man with dirt and ash on his face in a military helmet, staring intently forward while he smokes a cigarette]]

===Second Battle of Fallujah===
Miller was part of [[Charlie Company]] of the [[1st Battalion 8th Marines|1st Battalion]], [[8th Marine Regiment (United States)|8th Marine Regiment]], a unit which took part in the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] in November 2004.  ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' photographer [[Luis Sinco]] took a photo of 20-year-old Miller leaning against a wall, smoking a cigarette.  In explaining the photograph, Sinco said that "His expression caught my eye. To me, it said: terrified, exhausted, and glad just to be alive. I recognized that look because that's how I felt too."&lt;ref name=LAT111107/&gt;

===Marlboro Marine===
Sinco's photograph of Miller was published in many newspapers. ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' anchor [[Dan Rather]] singled out the photo for its excellence, and turned the then-unidentified Marine into a celebrity. Sinco was told to find the Marine for a follow-up story and tracked down Miller four days later in an auditorium near Fallujah's civic center. Miller was embarrassed about the photo's notoriety, but shared information with Sinco. The two would remain friends thereafter.&lt;ref name=LAT111107 /&gt;

After his identity was made public, people sent him [[care package]]s, including lots of cigarettes; President [[George W. Bush]] sent [[cigar]]s, candy and memorabilia from the [[White House]]. The forward command center soon featured a large blowup of the photo. The Commanding General of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], [[Richard F. Natonski]], made a special trip to see Miller, to Miller's surprise. The general shook Miller's hand and let him know that, because Americans had "connected" with his photo, and nobody wanted to see him wounded or dead, he was offered a trip home. Miller turned down the offer because he did not want to leave his comrades behind.&lt;ref name=LAT111107 /&gt;

The photo was nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=RS2008&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eliscu |first=Jenny |date=3 April 2008 |title=The Troubled Homecoming of the Marlboro Marine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-troubled-homecoming-of-the-marlboro-marine-20080403 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=29 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jennifer Good|author2=Paul Lowe|author3=Brigitte Lardinois|title=Mythologizing the Vietnam War: Visual Culture and Mediated Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDlQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=16 October 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-6948-5|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph was nominated by [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] in 2011 for a list of "New Classics", products of the culture since 2000 that will withstand the test of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/new_classics/2011/10/the_new_classics_the_most_enduring_books_shows_movies_and_ideas_since_2000_.single.html|author=Heather Murphy|title=The New Classics|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=2011-11-06|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] '''James Thomas Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCB}} (16 October 1797&amp;nbsp;– 28 March 1868) was an officer in the [[British Army]] who commanded the [[Light cavalry|Light Brigade]] during the [[Crimean War]]. He led the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=95}}

Throughout his life in politics and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant [[aristocrat]] of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but also by generosity to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As a member of the [[Landed gentry|landed aristocracy]] he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but in the last year of his life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.
{{anchor|Biography|History}}

==Life==
===Early life===
[[File:Hambleden Manor crop.png|thumb|Hambleden Manor, where Brudenell was born]]
James Brudenell was born in a modest, by the standards of the [[Earl of Cardigan|Brudenell family]], manor house at [[Hambleden]], [[Buckinghamshire]] to [[Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan|Robert Brudenell]] and his wife [[Penelope Brudenell, Countess of Cardigan]].&lt;ref name=david13/&gt; In February 1811 his [[Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan|father]] inherited the [[Earl of Cardigan|Cardigan earldom]], along with the immense estates and revenues that went with it, and the [[family seat]] of [[Deene Park]], [[Northamptonshire]]. James accordingly became "Lord Brudenell", and took up residence in the most grand of households, at the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name=david13&gt;{{harvp|David|1997|pp=13–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] where, notwithstanding the fears of his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin.&lt;ref name=cws14&gt;{{harvp|Woodham-Smith|1953|pp=14–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; He made good academic progress, but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: it was the fact of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl).&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a [[Spoiled child|spoilt child]], accustomed to getting his own way. This has been seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.&lt;ref name=cws14/&gt;

Brudenell was a fine rider and, inspired by the decisive role of cavalry at the [[battle of Waterloo]], his wish was to [[Sale of commissions|purchase a commission]] in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family [[Pedigree chart#In human use|pedigree]] from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to [[Christ Church, Oxford]];&lt;ref name=David29 /&gt; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did not take a degree.{{refn|"He stayed for his third year and was 'submitted for examination in the Easter term of 1818'...in the event he did not take [it]".&lt;ref name=David29&gt;David (1997), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodham-Smith says he was two years at university,{{sfnp|Woodham-Smith|1953|p=8}} as does Sweetman.{{sfnp|Sweetman|2004}}}}

===Parliamentary career===
In February 1818, during his last term at Oxford, and again following his father's wishes, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Marlborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Marlborough]], a [[pocket borough]] owned by his cousin [[Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Marquess of Ailesbury|Charles, Earl of Ailesbury]].&lt;ref name=David29/&gt; The intention was to give Brudenell a grounding in parliamentary affairs before, eventually, he would take his place in the [[House of Lords]].

Brudenell's first action on leaving [[Oxford]] was not to take his parliamentary seat but, as was traditional for wealthy young men of the time, to take the [[Grand Tour]]. His itinerary, with [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]] included, was more extensive than the traditional destinations of [[France]] and [[Italy]]. The trip allowed Brudenell to enjoy the full pleasures of both cultural and social opportunities afforded by the countries he visited.&lt;ref name="David29" /&gt;

On his return Brudenell took his seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], naturally on the ruling, [[Tory]], side of the House. His contribution to government was minimal: he served with parliamentarians, such as [[George Canning|Canning]], [[Robert Peel|Peel]] and [[Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], of great commitment and intellect and he could offer nothing to compete.&lt;ref name=David35&gt;David (1997), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; On one issue, however, he made a stand. In 1829 his party introduced a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] allowing limited [[Catholic emancipation]] but his patron, cousin Charles, instructed him to oppose it. In three crucial votes Brudenell abstained, because of his admiration for [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]], the bill's sponsor, and in consequence he was thrown out of his seat.&lt;ref name=David59&gt;David (1997), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deene Park Northamptonshie.jpg|thumb|left|Deene Park, Northamptonshire - seat of the Brudenell family]]
His return to parliament in 1830 cost him dearly. After his earlier disobedience he could not expect to be handed a pocket borough so, instead, he had to buy his own. He was elected member for [[Fowey (UK Parliament constituency)|Fowey]], Cornwall, at a cost of at least £5,000 ({{Inflation|UK|5000|1830|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}).&lt;ref name=David64&gt;David (1997), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The money, however, was not well spent. Only two years later the seat was one of those abolished in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] of 1832, designed to do away with such malpractices. He sought instead the newly created constituency of [[North Northamptonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Northamptonshire North]], local to the [[family seat]] of Deene Park but, despite holding the advantage that many of the electors were dependent on family's patronage and goodwill, the campaign did not go smoothly. On 12 September in [[Wellingborough]] he was beaten up and "considerabl[y]" injured while campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=14 September 1832| title=Disturbance at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=14957|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a precaution he distributed about £20,000 ({{Inflation|UK|20000|1832|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-5}}) among the electorate and the seat was won, albeit as "junior member" to his [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] rival.&lt;ref name=David76&gt;David (1997), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837 he inherited the [[Earl of Cardigan|earldom]] from his father, together with the extensive family estates, including Deene Park.&lt;ref name=Sweetman2004&gt;{{harvp|Sweetman|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
Early in the 1820s Brudenell met Mrs. Elizabeth Tollemache Johnstone (8 December 1797 – 15 July 1858). Her husband, Lt.-Col. Christian Johnstone, had been a friend of Cardigan's since childhood, but, according to the account of Johnstone's mother, the wooing of his friend's new wife started soon after the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone started divorce proceedings in June 1824 and the suit was finalised early in 1826. Johnstone, who had received damages of £1,000 from Brudenell, was apparently happy to be rid of her, calling her "the most damned bad-tempered and extravagant bitch in the kingdom".&lt;ref name=CWS19&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Cardigan married on 19 June 1826. It was not a happy marriage;  they had no children, and by 1837 they had separated.&lt;ref name="Sweetman2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 47; 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving his first wife, Elizabeth, he married for a second time, on 20 September 1858, to [[Adeline, Countess of Cardigan and Lancastre|Adeline de Horsey]], achieving still greater notoriety as he had been conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying.&lt;ref name=David467&gt;David (1997), pp. 467–469.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society for the rest of her days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Cardigan spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable.&lt;ref name=Davd471&gt;David (1997), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Adeline even remained on good terms with Cardigan's principal mistress, Maria [[Marquess of Ailesbury#Marquesses of Ailesbury|Marchioness of Ailesbury]], and tolerated his other affairs.&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), pp. 467; 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early military career===
[[File:James Thomas Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan by Sir Francis Grant.jpg||alt=painting of man wearing a British 19th-century cavalry uniform astride a black horse|thumb|James Brudenell on horseback, by [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], circa 1841]]
Beyond all other interests, which included politics and the preservation of the ancient privileges of the [[aristocracy]] against the [[Reform movement#Great Britain/United Kingdom: Reform movements from the late 18th century|reformist]] climate of the period, Brudenell committed himself to a career in the [[British Army|army]].&lt;ref name=david27&gt;David (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 22 he formed his own [[troop]] of horse, armed from official stocks, to guard against possible reformist demonstrations in Northamptonshire. On 6 May 1824, at the age of 27, he joined the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars]].&lt;ref name=Sweetman2004/&gt; Making extensive use of the [[sale of commissions|purchase of commissions]] system then in use, he became a lieutenant in January 1825, a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in June 1826, a major in August 1830 and a [[lieutenant-colonel]], albeit on [[half-pay]], only three months later, on 3 December 1830. He obtained command of the [[15th The King's Hussars]]—at a reported premium of £35,000 ({{Inflation|UK|35000|1832|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}})—on 16 March 1832.&lt;ref name=Sweetman2004/&gt;

Parliamentary business, in the form of the hotly contested [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] campaign, delayed his taking command until May. His youth and inexperience, compared with that of the battle-tested officers whom he led (some were veterans of the [[battle of Waterloo]]) drew his naturally punctilious nature to manifest itself in petty-minded bullying.&lt;ref name="Sweetman2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cws37&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), pp. 37–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=David82&gt;David (1997) p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 he was publicly censured for "reprehensible...conduct" in a [[court martial]] held to determine charges he had laid against Captain Augustus Wathen, a subordinate. Brudenell was dismissed, by personal order  of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William]] (who concurred with "Lord Hill's righteous judgement"), early in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Macdonald|first=John|date=1 February 1834|title=Lord Brudenell and Captain Wathen: Removal of Lord Brudenell|journal=[[Morning Chronicle]]|location=London|issue=20107|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1974) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He had, however, influence at [[Court (royal)|court]] and he asked his sister Harriet, married to [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]]'s chamberlain, [[Richard Curzon-Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], to get the decision reversed. He pestered senior officers and politicians until in March 1836 he was allowed command of the 11th Light Dragoons (later restyled the [[11th Hussars]]), notwithstanding the view of his commander-in-chief, [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Lord Hill]], that he was "constitutionally unfit for command".&lt;ref&gt;David (1997) p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; After a leisurely passage with his wife, he joined his new command in India in October of the following year, just in time to enjoy some tiger-shooting before seeing the regiment off for Britain at the end of its long posting.&lt;ref name="Sweetman2004" /&gt; He travelled separately in a hired vessel, disdaining to share the discomforts of the warship carrying his troops. Of the two years following his appointment, only four weeks were spent with his regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in India that Brudenell received word that, consequent on the death of his father on 14 August 1837, he had inherited the title of 7th Earl of Cardigan.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1974) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In a genuine desire to lead a smart and efficient unit, Cardigan set about using his own fortune to improve his regiment's reputation and performance.&lt;ref name=Sweetman2004/&gt; [[George Ryan (journalist)|George Ryan]], a writer otherwise highly critical of Cardigan, estimated that he spent about £10,000 ({{Inflation|UK|10000|1837|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}) a year towards [[remount]]s and distinctive uniform for his troops.{{sfnp|Ryan|1855b|p=13}} In purchasing brilliant new uniforms for his men, Cardigan caused resentment among his professional officers; they had to match the men's attire with even more costly uniforms (a Hussar officer's jacket, for example, cost £40—{{Inflation|UK|40|1837|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-2}}) and officers had to buy their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Calthorpe| first = Somerset John Gough| title = Letters from Headquarters: Or, The Realities of the War in the Crimea, by an Officer on the Staff| publisher = John Murray| year = 1857| location = London| page = 337| oclc =3613905 }}. The letters have a modern reprint as ''Cadogan's Crimea'', Atheneum Books, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;   He wished his officers to be as aristocratic, flamboyant and stylish as he was himself and as a consequence he had no time for those men—"Indian officers"—who had learnt their profession over many years of service with the 11th during its long posting to India. This attitude was particularly in evidence in the [[mess]]: Cardigan had forbidden the serving of [[Porter (beer)|porter]], the beverage of choice among the professional officers, and when at a formal mess dinner a visitor had requested [[Moselle wine]], which was served in a "black bottle" similar to that of porter, he decided that the "Indian" Captain John Reynolds, who had ordered it for the guest, was defying him. Reynolds was arrested and in due course received a strongly worded reprimand from [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Lord Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=2 November 1840|title=Conduct of Lord Hill|journal=Morning Chronicle|location=London|issue=22133|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who although privately believing that his misgivings about Cardigan had been well founded, felt that, in the interests of good order and discipline, a public demonstration of support was necessary. Reynolds's guardian sent the details of the case to all the London papers and for many months thereafter Brudenell, his regiment and the commander-in-chief were subject to ridicule, hissing and cat-calls of "black bottle" whenever they appeared in public.&lt;ref name="CWS63–66"&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953) pp. 63–66.&lt;/ref&gt; A more serious punishment was administered to Richard Reynolds, cousin to John Reynolds and another long-serving captain, who was court-martialled for sending Cardigan an "insubordinate" letter in response to being barred from his commanding officer's quarters. Hill drafted a strong memorandum urging Cardigan to employ "temper and discretion" in dealings with his officers, but Reynolds was [[cashiered]].&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), pp. 184–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the "Indian" officers of the 11th found themselves the object of Cardigan's disfavour: when, in October 1840, Major Jenkins, a long-serving veteran, fell seriously ill, Cardigan attended his bedside for two nights and, when he died, made a substantial payment to the family and secured a suitable position for his younger son.&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; George Ryan acknowledged his generosity towards his officers and men when in hardship and noted him to be a regular, anonymous subscriber to many civic charities.{{refn|"Not only was he was ever ready to minister to the pressing necessities of the married men but many officers were in the moment of difficulty succoured by his lordship" {{harvp|Ryan|1855b|pp=19–20}}.}}

===Duel with Captain Tuckett===
Cardigan was prosecuted in 1841 for a [[duel]] with one of his former officers, another long-serving professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gurney|first1=Wlliam Brodie|title=The Trial of James Thomas Earl of Cardigan|date=February 1841|publisher=[[House of Lords]]|oclc=976980872|authorlink=William Brodie Gurney}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was acquitted on a legal technicality, notwithstanding his boast on arrest that "I have hit my man". The prosecution had demonstrated that Cardigan—using a [[duelling pistol]] with concealed [[rifling]] and a [[hair trigger]] (supplied by the Mayfair gunsmiths [[Joseph Manton|Manton and Hudson]]) which was thought unsporting according to the usages of duelling—had fired upon Captain Harvey Tuckett.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Busain|first=John|date=25 October 1840|title=The Cardigan Dual|journal=The Examiner|publisher=[[Albany Fonblanque]]|location=London|issue=1708|pages=683|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1974) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment, however, was that the victim had been "Harvey Garnet Phipps Tuckett". Evidence was received from an army agent paying Tuckett's [[Half pay|army pension]] that this was indeed the  full name of Captain Tuckett of the 11th Hussars, yet this discrepancy in the wording of the charge allowed the jury of his [[Privilege of peerage#Trial by peers|peers]], 120 in number, unanimously to acquit him;&lt;ref&gt;Gurney (1841) pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=examiner18040221&gt;{{citation|last=Staff|date=21 February 1841|title=Defeat of Justice|journal=The Examiner|publisher=Albany Fonblanque|location=London|issue=1725|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Nobility|nobleman]] the law of the time allowed him to be tried for a capital crime before the [[House of Lords]] sitting as a jury, with the [[Lord High Steward]] as judge. This added to his unpopularity, with ''[[The Times]]'' alleging that there was deliberate, high level complicity to leave the loop-hole in the prosecution case and reporting the view that "in England there is one law for the rich and another for the poor" and ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'' describing the verdict as "a defeat of justice".&lt;ref name=examiner18040221/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' 17 and 18 February 1841, quoted in Woodham-Smith (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; Even his obituary described this evasion of justice as "an absurd technical deficiency".&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{citation|date=May 1868|title=The Earl of Cardigan|journal=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|location=London|page=676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimean War===
His most notorious exploit took place during the [[Crimean War]] on 25 October 1854 when, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the [[battle of Balaclava]], he led the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] reaching the Russian guns before returning, personally unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command who took part in the charge (although others may have died of wounds later on).&lt;ref&gt;The ''Nominal Returns'' of the regiments for the day, quoted in David.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]], commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well.&lt;ref name=cws132&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The order had been conveyed by [[Louis Edward Nolan|Captain Louis Nolan]], who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Kinglake| first = A W| authorlink = Alexander Kinglake| title = The Invasion of the Crimea, Volume IV| publisher = [[William Blackwood]]| year = 1863| location = Edinburgh| page = 382| oclc =221799935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer to army commander [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], Colonel the Hon. [[Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, 7th Baron Calthorpe|Somerset John Gough Calthorpe]], alleged in his book ''Letters from a Staff Officer in the Crimea'' that Cardigan had survived only because he had fled the scene before the charge made contact with the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=25 April 1863|title=Lord Cardigan's prosecution of Colonel Calthorpe|journal=The Manchester Guardian|page=6|quote=The reader is left to infer that he fled of his own accord precipitately to the rear while the Light Brigade dashed into the battery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first edition, Calthorpe allowed that Cardigan's horse may have bolted,&lt;ref&gt;Calthorpe (1857: 130)&lt;/ref&gt; but later editions pointedly stated the earl was too fine a horseman for this to be a satisfactory explanation. The horse, "Ronald", a famous charger bred on Cardigan's Deene Park estate, survived the war and returned safely to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Online Collection {{!}} National Army Museum, London|url=https://collection.nam.ac.uk/detail.php?q=searchType%3Dsimple%26resultsDisplay%3Dlist%26simpleText%3Dronald&amp;pos=2&amp;total=7&amp;page=1&amp;acc=1967-02-19-1|website=collection.nam.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Undated issue of ''Saddle &amp; Bridle'' {{ISSN|0036-2271}}, St Louis, MO, quoted in {{citation| title = Ronald, Heroic War Horse of the Charge of the Light Brigade| publisher = Horse Show Central| location=Muncie, IN| url = http://www.horseshowcentral.com/flex/ronald_heroic_war_horse_of_the_charge_of_the_light_brigade/268/1| accessdate = 3 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=21 January 1855|title=Earl Cardigan's Cavalry Horses|journal=[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]|publisher=Frederick Ledger|location=London|issue=852}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some preliminary legal skirmishing, Cardigan sought an indictment for [[criminal libel]] in 1863, but his action failed, although the [[King's Bench|bench]] made plain that it was only his competence, and not his courage, that was in doubt. They found that he had led his men onto the enemy's guns with "valour...conspicuously displayed" but thereafter "his conduct as a General was open to criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Staff|date=11 June 1863|title=The Queen, On The Prosecution of the Earl of Cardigan, V. The Hon. Colonel Calthorpe|journal=The Times|location=London |issue=24582|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is shared by historian [[Alexander Kinglake]], who concludes that although Cardigan displayed a "want...of competence" after the charge, he had lost contact with his men only through his brave persistence in galloping too far ahead of them.&lt;ref&gt;Kinglake (1863), '''IV''' p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt that Cardigan had reached and overrun the enemy battery: he was recognised beyond the guns by [[Prince Leon Hieronim Radziwiłł]] ([[:ru:Радзивилл,_Лев_Людвигович|ru]]), an enemy officer with whom he was acquainted before the war; Radziwiłł issued instructions that Cardigan was to be taken prisoner and not killed.&lt;ref&gt;On 1 June 1844 [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] docked at Woolwich on a diplomatic mission to London. Prince Leon Radziwiłł was one of Nicholas’s aides-de-camp for the duration of the visit and it was during this time that he and Cardigan met. At the time of the Battle of Balaclava, Radziwiłł had just been promoted to major-general commanding the [[Uhlan]] division and, as Kinglake notes, it was in this capacity he again encountered Cardigan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kinglake2&gt;Kinglake (1863) '''II''' pp. 534–537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Arrival Of The Emperor of Russia |journal=The Times |date=3 June 1844 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Waverley Ball |journal=[[Morning Post]] |date=10 July 1844 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kieniewicz |first1=Stefan|authorlink=Stefan Kieniewicz|title=Большая биографическая энциклопедия |date=2009 |language=ru |chapter=Радзивил, князь Лев Людвигович}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardigan, considering his duty then done and disdaining, as he later explained, to "fight the enemy among private soldiers", turned about and made his way steadily—he himself said that his return was at the walk to avoid any unseemly appearance of haste—for his own lines.&lt;ref name=Kinglake2/&gt; Lucan recalled things differently, later giving evidence that Cardigan had been galloping back, only slowing to walk when he realised he was being watched.&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; This hurried retreat was also noticed by [[Pavel Liprandi|General Liprandi]], Russian commander, who made enquiries to identify the English officer whom he saw galloping away after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Kinglake (1863), '''II''' p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; Officers and men of the second and third lines—men for whom as brigade commander Cardigan remained responsible—were still advancing at the charge when they saw their commander riding in retreat.&lt;ref name=Kinglake2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Other officers too had noticed his absence and when [[Lord George Paget]] of the [[4th Hussars]], one of the last to return after some intense, hand-to-hand fighting, encountered a "composed" Cardigan, he challenged him to account for himself. Unsatisfied with the response, Paget wrote an official complaint to the new Commander-in-Chief, the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=cws240&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), pp. 240—250.&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge forwarded the letter to Cardigan for comment and Cardigan's reply in turn complained that Paget had not in fact taken the part he claimed during the attack that day.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1974) p. 288 quotes from Cardigan's letter: "I never can admit that [Paget] led [the] second line into action on that day.".&lt;/ref&gt; Inconclusive claim and counter-claim followed, until Cardigan's attentions were diverted to the allegations made public when Calthorpe's book ''Letters'' went on sale.&lt;ref name= David453&gt;David (1997), p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week following the battle of Balaclava, the remnants of the Light Brigade were posted inland, to high ground overseeing the British lines surrounding [[Inkerman]]. Cardigan, who had spent most nights of the campaign aboard his luxury yacht ''Dryad'' in Balaclava harbour, found this move a great inconvenience and his leadership of the brigade suffered as a result.&lt;ref name=david423/&gt; He missed the [[Battle of Inkerman]] (4 and 5 November 1854), casually asking journalist [[William Howard Russell|William Russell]] (who was returning from the conflict) "What are they doing, what was the firing for...?" as he rode up from the harbour at noon on the first day.&lt;ref name=david423/&gt; The decisive stages of the battle were on the second day and again Cardigan was absent, although he managed to arrive at a more creditable 10.15&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=david423/&gt; The part played by the brigade was not great and, to avoid embarrassing the earl, it was not mentioned in the official account of the battle forwarded to London.&lt;ref name=david423&gt;David (1997), pp. 423–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever Cardigan's faults, he had always tried to ensure that the troops under his command were well equipped. However, as the Crimean winter fell over the Light Brigade's exposed position, food, fodder, clothing and shelter were all in short supply.&lt;ref name=woodford/&gt; Beyond writing letters pointing out the deficiencies, Cardigan did nothing. Food and fodder were available at the coast, but he refused to release any men and horses to carry up stores, as his officers pleaded,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Staff|date=20 February 1856|title=Leader|journal=The Times|issue=22295|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of a surprise attack by the enemy and because "I had no orders to do so".&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel [[Alexander Tulloch]], who gave evidence to a board of enquiry into the failure, noted that in fact Cardigan had more horses than he had needed: indeed more horses than men to ride them,&lt;ref name=woodford&gt;{{citation|last=Woodford|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander George Woodford|title=Report of the Board of General Officers Appointed to Inquire into the Statements Contained in the Reports of Sir John McNeill and Colonel Tulloch|publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode|location=London|year=1856|oclc=62431432|pages=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=3 February 1857|title=Colonel Tulloch's Review of the 'Chelsea' Report|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=22594|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote privately after his evidence was excluded from the final report: "Because Lord Cardigan might have had some difficulty in carrying up all the barley to which his corps was entitled he [resolved himself] therefore justified in bringing up none."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Tulloch|first1=Alexander|authorlink1=Alexander Tulloch|last2=McNeill|first2=John|authorlink2=John McNeill (diplomat)|title=The Crimean Commission and the Chelsea Board|year=1857|publisher=Harrison|location=London|pages=26–30|oclc=248323087}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was great hardship and many horses died.&lt;ref name=woodford/&gt;

On 5 December 1854, citing ill-health, Cardigan set off for England. In these circumstances, the word of an officer regarding his fitness to serve would normally be accepted, but Raglan permitted his departure only after a medical board had confirmed his claimed disability.&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
[[File:Charge of the Light Brigade.jpg|thumb|right|''The Charge of the Light Brigade'' by [[Richard Caton Woodville Jr.]]]]
Newspaper accounts of the gallant charge had been given wide circulation in England by the time Cardigan's ship berthed at the port of Folkestone on 13 January 1855 and the town offered him a rapturous welcome.&lt;ref name=david431&gt;David (1997), pp. 431–436.&lt;/ref&gt; In London he was mobbed by an enthusiastic crowd and on 16 January at [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s invitation he was received at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] to explain to her and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] the details of the battle.&lt;ref name="Freeman18550123"&gt;{{citation|title=Fashionable Intelligence|date=23 January 1855|journal=[[Freeman's Journal]]|location=Dublin|publisher=[[John Gray (Irish politician)|John Gray]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria noted how "modestly" he presented his story,&lt;ref name="david431" /&gt; but this reticence was absent in his public appearances: on 5 February, he gave a highly exaggerated account of his participation in the charge at a banquet held in his honour at the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], London. On 8 February, at a speech in his home town of Northampton, he went even further, describing how he had shared the privations of his men by living the "whole time in a common tent" and how, after the charge, he had rallied his troops and pursued the fleeing enemy artillerymen as far as the [[Chernaya River (Ukraine)|Tchernaya river]]. As his biographer [[Saul David]] points out, "a more misleading account of his own exploits could hardly have been given".&lt;ref name="david431" /&gt;

Cardigan was able to enjoy many months of adulation before doubts about his conduct emerged: He was made [[Inspector General#United Kingdom|Inspector-General]] of Cavalry, the government recommended him for the [[Order of the Garter]], although the Queen denied him this honour because of the previous unseemly incidents in his private life; he was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]]. Merchants, eager to profit from his fame, sold pictures depicting his role in the charge and written chronicles, based on his own accounts, were rushed into print. The "[[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]", a knitted waistcoat supposedly as worn by the earl on campaign, became fashionable and many were sold.&lt;ref name="david431" /&gt;

Cardigan's commanding officer and brother-in-law, [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]], had been recalled in disgrace—largely brought about by the determination of the commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, to displace blame from himself—&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), pp. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived in England only two weeks after his subordinate but, as the officer who had "looked on" (a pun on his name much exploited by Cardigan) while the charge had taken place, little regard was given to his version of events. (Lucan had earned the unfortunate nickname of "Lord Look-on" when Lord Raglan ordered him to withdraw, and remain in reserve, during a skirmish at the [[Bulganek River]] before the earlier [[Battle of Alma]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkin|first1=Mark|title=The Charge: The Real Reason Why the Light Brigade Was Lost|date=1996|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|isbn=9781844137343|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=8 February 1855|title=Recall of the Earl of Lucan|journal=Freeman's Journal|location=Dublin|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1855, ''The Times'' hinted that the public had been misled over "the real nature of [Cardigan's] services in the East",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=9 July 1855|title=Demonstration in Hyde Park|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=22101|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in the absence of anything definitive, his popularity remained. However, officers who had taken command in the aftermath of the charge, the role that Cardigan was claiming for himself, had heard of his reception in England and were anxious to put the record straight. The writer [[George Ryan (journalist)|George Ryan]], who had rushed out a hasty pamphlet praising Cardigan,{{sfnp|Ryan|1855a|p=43}} retracted his words, and was the first to report Cardigan's fellow officers' reservations about the earl's conduct on the day.{{sfnp|Ryan|1855b|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=25 July 1855|title=Classified Advertising|journal=The Times|location=London|issue=22115|page=13|quote=Was Lord Cardigan a Hero at Balaklava?&amp;nbsp;...

It was not until the following year, however, with the official enquiries of Colonel Tulloch and the publication of Calthorpe's ''Letters'', was there proof that Cardigan had not been telling the truth. Nonetheless he continued, with characteristic arrogance and self-delusion, as if nothing was amiss and he remained in his cavalry post for the next five years.&lt;ref name="Sweetman2004" /&gt; ''Eight months on active service, or, A diary of a general officer of cavalry, in 1854'', published in 1855, was Cardigan's own account of his time in the Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Brudenell|first1=James Thomas|title=Eight months on active service, or, A diary of a general officer of cavalry, in 1854|date=1855|publisher=W Clowes &amp; Sons|location=London|oclc=367558095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardigan's overwhelming enthusiasm for the army remained and the meticulous standards of dress and parade that he had required of his earlier commands he now applied to the whole cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; He was made [[Colonel of the Regiment]] of the [[5th Dragoon Guards]] in 1859, but he derived more satisfaction when, after his formal retirement in 1860, and its accompanying promotion to Lieutenant-General, he became colonel of his favourite regiment, the [[11th Hussars]], which he had first commanded in 1836.&lt;ref name="David471" /&gt; He remained in royal favour and early in 1861 he was selected to accompany [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]], heir to the throne, to inspect Prussian cavalry manoeuvres. He was possibly an unwise choice as his arrogant behaviour towards his hosts, themselves no strangers to high self-esteem among military officers, resulted in numerous challenges to duel; he was quickly sent home.&lt;ref name=David471/&gt; The Queen, however, blocked his colonelcy of one of the [[Household Cavalry|Household regiments]] because of his dalliance with Adeline while still married to Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;David (1997), p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; His last military function was a mounted review of the 11th Hussars before their embarkation for India in May 1866. He was joined by Colonel John Reynolds, who had been Cardigan's adversary in the "black bottle affair", but the men had at last settled their differences in the previous year.&lt;ref name=David471&gt;David (1977) pp. 471–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===

After his retirement in 1866, he lived happily at Deene, passing his time with horse-racing, hunting and shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1974), pp 313–16&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a member of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] and was [[Commodore (yacht club)|Commodore]] of the [[Royal Southern Yacht Club]].&lt;ref name="Sweetman2004" /&gt;

In acknowledging his change of heart he said that the time for trying to stem the tide of reform, an endeavour in which he had long strived, had passed and given "good luck" the extension of the vote would "confer... a great benefit upon every class of the community".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=1 August 1867|title=Representation of the People Bill|journal=Hansard|location=London|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1867/aug/01/committee#S3V0189P0_18670801_HOL_31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Parliamentary Intelligence|journal=The Times|date=2 August 1867|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 he presented to the House a petition calling for additional recognition of the late General [[Henry Shrapnel]], inventor of the explosive artillery shell, in recognition of its effectiveness at Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=16 March 1868|title=House of Lords Debate 16 March 1868: Petition|journal=Hansard|location=London|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1868/mar/06/petition#S3V0190P0_18680306_HOL_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died from injuries caused by a fall from his horse on 28 March 1868, possibly following a stroke,&lt;ref name=cws271&gt;Woodham-Smith (1953), pp. 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in the family vaults at [[St Peter's Church, Deene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6302|title=Lord Cardigan – Find A Grave|publisher=''findagrave.com''|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded in his title by his second cousin, [[George Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury|George William Brudenell-Bruce]], who died childless in 1878.

After the death of his widow in 1915, Deene Park reverted to the descendants of George William's younger brother, [[Ernest Brudenell-Bruce, 3rd Marquess of Ailesbury|Ernest Augustus Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1001030|desc=Deene Park|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
Assessments of Lord Cardigan have varied significantly over time. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ninth Edition|9th edition]] (1889) of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' noted that his actions at Balaclava had become "the subject of much controversy, some critics having an eye only to the splendid daring and unquestioning obedience to orders, and others seeing only a foolhardy and unjustifiable throwing away of valuable lives",{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=96}} while the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition]] (1910–11) rephrased the passage to read that "Cardigan and his men alike have been credited by the bitterest critics of the charge with splendid daring and unquestioning obedience to orders".{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=319}}

In her sweeping condemnation of the Victorian class system, ''The Reason Why (1953),'' [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]] used the Earl as a prism on the ills of British society of the time (but conceded that in the Charge itself Cardigan conducted himself with unwavering courage and discipline). [[Donald Serrell Thomas|Donald Thomas]]'s 1974 biography ''Cardigan: The Hero of Balaclava'' provided a more sympathetic portrayal. [[Saul David]]'s 1997 hostile assessment, on the other hand, was entitled simply ''The Homicidal Earl''. [[Terry Brighton]]'s 2005 book ''Hell Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade''{{sfnp|Brighton|2004}} provides a more recent critical account of Cardigan as a brigade commander but finds him in no way to blame for the charge.

==Cultural depictions==
''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'', a 1968 film based on Woodham-Smith's research, made Cardigan (played by [[Trevor Howard]]) its primary antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Connelly|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Connelly (historian)|title=The Charge of the Light Brigade|publisher=I. B. Taurus|location=London|year=2003|series=The British Film Guide|pages=24–25|isbn=1-86064-612-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie depicts Cardigan as a harsh disciplinarian, womaniser and military incompetent. It shows the "black bottle" affair, though it incorrectly makes [[Louis Nolan]] Cardigan's antagonist, and heavily features his rivalry with Lord Lucan. It also fictitiously shows Cardigan pursuing an affair with [[Fanny Duberly]].

[[George MacDonald Fraser]]'s ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'' novels feature Cardigan as a recurring villain. In [[Flashman (novel)|the first instalment]], he commands Flashman in the 11th Hussars and transfers him to India after he marries Elspeth on the grounds that she is the daughter of a tradesman. Cardigan reappears in ''[[Flashman at the Charge]]'', where Flashman catches Cardigan trying to seduce Elspeth. Flashman later reluctantly joins Cardigan for the Charge of the Light Brigade. He appears briefly in ''[[Flashman in the Great Game]]'', where Cardigan demands Flashman defend Cardigan's reputation against hostile journalists. Flashman not only refuses but pointedly insults Cardigan. His last mention comes in ''[[Flashman and the Angel of the Lord]]'', where Flashman observes Cardigan's liaison with Fanny Paget.

Cardigan appears as an antagonist in the 2015 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'' by [[Ubisoft]], set in 1868. In the game, Cardigan is a member of the [[Templar Order]] who headed a plot to assassinate the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime-Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. The lead character, [[Jacob Frye]], discovers the plot, prevents Disraeli's death and finally tracks down and kills Cardigan.

'''Lawrence Sigmund Bittaker''' (born September 27, 1940) and '''Roy Lewis Norris''' (born February 5, 1948), also known as the '''Tool Box Killers''', are American [[serial killer]]s and [[Rape|rapists]] who [[kidnapping|kidnapped]], raped, tortured, and killed five teenage girls in [[Southern California]] over a period of five months in 1979.

Described by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent|Special Agent]] [[John E. Douglas]] as the most disturbing individual for whom he has ever created a [[Offender profiling|criminal profile]],&lt;ref name="Team Killers"&gt;{{cite book |title=Team Killers: A Comparative Study of Collaborative Criminals |year=2001 |first=Jennifer |last=Furio |isbn=1892941635 |publisher=Algora Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQYntwuZs68C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}} Bittaker was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for five murders on March 24, 1981, and is currently on [[death row]] at [[San Quentin State Prison]].&lt;ref name=DeathRowList&gt;{{cite web |author=Division of Adult Operations|title=Death Row Tracking System Condemned Inmate List (Secure)|publisher=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Capital_Punishment/docs/CondemnedInmateListSecure.pdf|date=July 5, 2011|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dan-morain/article96800957.html|title=Lawrence Bittaker, a Most Depraved Killer, Twists Justice System|publisher=Sacramento Bee|last=Morain|first=Dan|date=August 20, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris accepted a [[plea bargain]] whereby he agreed to testify against Bittaker and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on May 7, 1980, with possibility of [[parole]] after serving 30 years. He is currently incarcerated at [[Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Results.aspx|title=State of California Inmate Locator|first=State of|last=California|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittaker and Norris became known as the "Tool Box Killers" due to the fact the majority of instruments used to torture and murder their victims, such as pliers, ice picks, and sledgehammers, were items normally stored inside a household [[toolbox]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Almanac'' {{ISBN|978-1-897-78404-4}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Lawrence Bittaker===
Lawrence Sigmund Bittaker was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, on September 27, 1940, as the unwanted child of a couple who had chosen to not have children.&lt;ref name="Furio"&gt;{{cite book |last=Furio |first=Jennifer |year=1998 |title=The Serial Killer Letters |publisher=The Charles Press |isbn=0-914783-84-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}} Bittaker was placed in an orphanage by his natural mother and was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. George Bittaker as an infant. Bittaker's adoptive father worked in the aviation industry, which required the family to frequently move around the United States throughout his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/2.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626162314/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/2.html|archive-date=June 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittaker was first arrested for shoplifting at the age of 12 and obtained a minor criminal record over the next four years after further arrests for the same offense—in addition to petty theft—which brought him to the attention of juvenile authorities. Bittaker would later claim these numerous theft-related offenses committed throughout his adolescence had been attempts to compensate for the lack of love he received from his parents.&lt;ref name="Markman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Markman |first1=Ronald |last2=Bosco |first2=Dominick |year=1989 |title=Alone with The Devil |publisher=Piatkus Publishing |isbn=0-7499-1002-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}

Although reported to have an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 138, Bittaker considered school a tedious experience and dropped out of high school in 1957.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|257}} By this stage in his adolescence, he and his adoptive parents were living in California. Within a year of dropping out, he had been arrested for car theft, a [[hit and run]], and evading arrest.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}} For these offenses he was imprisoned at the [[California Division of Juvenile Justice|California Youth Authority]], where he remained until he was 18 years old.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}} Upon release, Bittaker discovered his adoptive parents had disowned him and had relocated to another state. He would never see his adoptive parents again.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}}&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

===Roy Norris===
Roy Lewis Norris was born in [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]], Colorado, on February 5, 1948.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|74}} Norris was conceived out of wedlock; his parents had married to avoid the social stigma surrounding illegitimate birth at the time.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|74–77}}

Norris' family lived within a short distance of his parents' home due to his grandfather's real estate investments.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|74}} His father worked in a scrapyard and his mother was a drug-addicted housewife. He occasionally lived with his parents throughout his childhood and adolescence but was repeatedly placed in the care of foster families throughout the state of Colorado.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|136}}

Norris' childhood recollections are interspersed with memories of wrongful accusations while living with his biological parents, and being neglected by many of the foster families he lived with, frequently being denied sufficient food or clothing. He also claims he was sexually abused when in the care of a Hispanic family and later went on to state that this is where his prejudice towards Hispanics originates from.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|136}}

While living with his birth parents at the age of 16, Norris visited the home of a female relative who was in her early twenties and began speaking to her in a sexually suggestive manner. She ordered him to leave her house and informed Norris' father, who threatened to subject him to a beating. Norris subsequently stole his father's car and drove into the [[Rocky Mountains]], where he attempted to commit suicide by injecting pure air into an artery in his arm.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|76}} He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. Upon his return home, Norris's parents informed him that he and his younger sister were unwanted children and that they intended to divorce when both reached adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Serial Killer Letters'' {{ISBN|978-0-914-78384-8}} p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later Norris dropped out of school and joined the [[United States Navy]]. He was stationed in [[San Diego]] in 1965 and was deployed to [[Vietnam]] in 1969, although he did not see active combat during his four-month tour of duty.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}} While stationed in Vietnam, he experimented with [[heroin]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], becoming a regular user of the latter. He was [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharge]]d from the Navy after one tour of duty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Serial Killer Letters'' {{ISBN|978-0-914-78384-8}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==First offenses==

===Bittaker===
Within days of his parole from the California Youth Authority, Bittaker was arrested for transporting a stolen vehicle across state lines.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}} In August 1959, Bittaker was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, to be served in the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]]. He was later transferred to the medical center for federal prisoners in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], Missouri, to serve the remainder of his sentence.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250–251}}

In 1960, Bittaker was released from prison and soon reverted to crime. Within months of his release, he had been arrested in Los Angeles for robbery and, in May 1961, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. While incarcerated for this robbery, he was diagnosed by a [[psychiatrist]] as being highly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]. The psychiatrist also described Bittaker as "having considerable concealed hostility."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251}}

Bittaker was released on parole in 1963 after completing two years of his sentence. In October 1964, he was again imprisoned for parole violation. In 1966, Bittaker underwent further examinations by two independent psychiatrists, both of whom classified him as a borderline psychopath: a highly manipulative individual unable to acknowledge the consequences of his actions.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251–252}} Bittaker explained to one of them that his criminal activities gave him a feeling of self-importance, although he insisted circumstantial matters pertaining to his environment and upbringing decreased his ability to resist committing crimes. Bittaker was prescribed anti-psychotic medication. A year later, he was again released into society.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251–252}}

A month after his parole in July 1967, Bittaker was again arrested and convicted of theft and of leaving the scene of an accident. He was sentenced to five years but was released in April 1970. In March 1971, Bittaker was again arrested for burglary. Due to repeated parole violations, he was sentenced to 6 months to 15 years' imprisonment in October 1971.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251}} Three years later, Bittaker was again released from prison.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251}}

In 1974, Bittaker was arrested for assault with attempt to commit murder, after he stabbed a young supermarket employee who had accused him of stealing. The supermarket employee had observed Bittaker stealing a steak and had followed Bittaker outside and into the store's parking lot, where he calmly asked Bittaker whether he had forgotten to pay. Bittaker responded by stabbing his pursuer in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. He attempted to flee but was quickly restrained by two other supermarket employees.&lt;ref name="Justia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/cal3d/48/1046.html|title=People v. Bittaker (1989)|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employee, Gary Louie, survived the stabbing, and Bittaker was convicted of the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon&lt;ref&gt;''Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit'' {{ISBN|978-0-684-80376-0}} p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and sent to [[California Men's Colony]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

===Norris===
In November 1969, Roy Norris was arrested for his first known sexual offenses: he was charged with both rape and assault with attempt to commit rape.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}} In the latter incident, he had attempted to force his way into the car of a lone woman. Three months later, in February 1970, Norris attempted to deceive a lone woman into allowing him to enter her home. When the woman refused, he attempted to break into her house; the woman phoned the police, who arrested Norris before he had the opportunity to cause the woman any harm.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}}

Less than three months after this offense, Norris was diagnosed by [[Military psychology|military psychologists]] with a severe [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid personality]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}}&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"/&gt; He was given an administrative discharge from the Navy under terms labeled as psychological problems.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|267}}&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/3.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626180643/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/3.html|archive-date=June 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, Norris—on bail for his latest offense—attacked a female student whom he had been stalking on the grounds of the [[San Diego State University]] campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to her knees before he repeatedly beat her head against the sidewalk as he knelt upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the [[Atascadero State Hospital]], where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.&lt;ref&gt;''Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-483-35072-1}} p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris was released from the Atascadero State Hospital in 1975, with five years' probation, having been declared by doctors as an individual who was of "no further danger to others".&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"/&gt; Just three months after his release, Norris approached a 27-year-old woman walking home from a restaurant in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] and offered her a ride on his motorcycle. When she declined, Norris parked his motorcycle and grabbed the woman's scarf, twisting it around her neck, before informing her he intended to rape her&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}} and dragging her into nearby bushes. Fearing for her life, the woman did not resist the rape.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

Although the rape was reported to police, they were initially unable to find the perpetrator. However, one month later, the victim observed Norris' motorcycle and noted the license number, which she immediately gave to police. Norris was arrested for the rape; one year later, he was tried and convicted for this offense&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} and sent to the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. While incarcerated at the California Men's Colony, Norris met and befriended Lawrence Bittaker.&lt;ref name="True Detective"&gt;{{cite book |title=True Detective |date=February 2011 |issn=0262-4133 |url=https://www.truecrimelibrary.com/product/true-detective-february-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

==Acquaintance==
[[File:California Mens Colony CDCR.jpg|right|thumb|[[California Men's Colony]], where Bittaker and Norris first became acquainted; discovering a common interest in [[sexual violence]].]]
Bittaker and Norris initially became loosely acquainted in 1977, one year after Norris arrived at San Luis Obispo. Bittaker's initial impression of Norris upon his arrival at the California Men's Colony was that he was a savvy individual, who largely associated with hardened criminals from motorcycle gangs, in addition to dealing in contraband drugs.&lt;ref name="True Detective"&gt;{{cite book |title=True Detective |date=February 2011 |issn=0262-4133 |url=https://www.truecrimelibrary.com/product/true-detective-february-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} The pair gradually became more closely acquainted, and only began talking in friendly terms when Norris taught Bittaker how to construct jewelry.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

According to Norris, Bittaker saved him from being attacked by fellow inmates on at least two occasions. By 1978,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}} the pair had become close acquaintances; discovering they shared a common interest in sexual violence and [[misogyny]], with Norris also divulging to Bittaker the biggest stimulation for him was of seeing frightened young women, adding this was the primary reason he had amassed a lengthy record for sexual offenses.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}} Bittaker—who is not known to have committed any sexual offenses prior to his meeting Norris—himself divulged to Norris that if he ever raped a woman, he would kill her so as not to leave a witness to the crime.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

When alone, the pair regularly discussed plans to assault and murder teenage girls once they were freed. This shared fantasy evolved into an elaborate plan to murder one girl of each teenage year from 13 through 19.&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"/&gt; The pair vowed to become reacquainted once they were released.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-7472-5361-7}} p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittaker was released from the California Men's Colony on October 15, 1978; he returned to Los Angeles and found work as a skilled machinist. This work earned Bittaker close to $1,000 a week, and despite classifying himself as a loner, he became friendly with several people in his neighborhood,&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}} earning a reputation as a generous and helpful individual who occasionally donated money to [[The Salvation Army]].&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}} On one occasion, he is known to have purchased large quantities of fast food and wine which he then handed to homeless individuals in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Bittaker was particularly popular amongst the local teenagers, and later admitted the primary reason he always had beer and marijuana in his [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] motel was that his residence would remain a popular place for teenagers to socialize.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Three months after Bittaker was released from the California Men's Colony, on January 15, 1979, Norris was released from prison and moved into his mother's home in Redondo Beach. He soon found employment as an electrician in [[Compton, California|Compton]].&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}} Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from Bittaker.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} In late February, the pair met at a hotel and rekindled their plan to kidnap and rape girls.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}}

In order for the pair to be able to successfully abduct teenage girls, Bittaker decided they would need a van as opposed to a car. With financial assistance from Norris,&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|136}} Bittaker purchased a silver 1977 [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] cargo van in February 1979. The vehicle was windowless on the sides and had a large passenger-side sliding door. According to Bittaker, when viewing this sliding door, he realized he or Norris could "pull up [to a teenage girl] real close and not have to open the doors all the way."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} Bittaker and Norris would nickname this van "Murder Mac".&lt;ref&gt;''Murders in the United States: Crimes, Killers and Victims of the Twentieth'' {{ISBN|0-786-42075-8}} p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
From February to June 1979, Bittaker and Norris picked up over 20 female hitchhikers.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} The pair did not assault these girls in any manner: these practice runs were merely a way for them to develop ruses to lure girls into the van voluntarily and of discovering secluded locations.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} In late April, the pair discovered a secluded [[Firebreak|fire road]] located in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Bittaker broke the locked gate to this fire road with a crowbar and replaced the lock with one he owned.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255–256}}

===Lucinda Lynn Schaefer===
Bittaker and Norris killed their first victim, 16-year-old Lucinda Lynn Schaefer, on June 24, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websleuths.com/forums/showthread.php?t=50676|title=Deceased/Not Found CA - Lucinda Schaefer, 17, Torrance, 24 June 1979 *Bittaker &amp; Norris guilty*|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaefer was last seen leaving a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] meeting in Redondo Beach. In his written accounts of the events of this day, Bittaker stated he and Norris first finished constructing the bed the pair had installed in the rear of the van, beneath which they placed tools, clothes and a cooler filled with beer and soft drinks. At approximately 11 a.m., the pair drove to "the beach area, drinking beer, smoking [[marijuana|grass]] and flirting with girls. We had no set routine."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

At approximately 7:46&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findthemissing.org/cases/case_report_html/4571|title=NamUs - National Missing Persons Data System Case Report - 4571|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris spotted Schaefer walking down a side street and remarked to Bittaker, "There's a cute little blonde."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

[[File:San Gabriel Mountains 1, CA.JPG|right|thumb|The [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Bittaker and Norris murdered and discarded the bodies of four of their victims at this location.]]
After unsuccessfully attempting to entice Schaefer into their van with alternative offers of marijuana and a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's arms and legs and gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

Despite initially screaming when she was abducted, Lucinda Schaefer quickly regained her composure. In his written account of the night that followed, Bittaker wrote that Lucinda Schaefer "displayed a magnificent state of self-control and composed acceptance of the conditions of which she had no control. She shed no tears, offered no resistance and expressed no great concern for her safety&amp;nbsp;... I guess she knew what was coming."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

At the fire road, Norris first raped Schaefer after instructing Bittaker to "go take a walk" and return in one hour. Upon returning to the van, Bittaker similarly raped the girl in Norris' absence. Upon the second occasion in which she was raped by Norris in Bittaker's absence, Schaefer asked him whether they intended to kill her, to which Norris replied, "No." In response, Schaefer requested to be allowed time to pray before she was killed if that was Bittaker and Norris' intention.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1989109448Cal3d1046_11056.xml/PEOPLE%20v.%20BITTAKER|title=PEOPLE v. BITTAKER - 48 Cal.3d 1046 (1989) - Leagle.com|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their subsequent accounts of the actual murder, Bittaker and Norris have given differing accounts as to who argued over whether they should kill her rather than release her: each stated the other argued that they should kill her.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|259}} In any event, Schaefer pleaded for "only a second, to pray,"&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|137}} before Norris attempted to manually strangle her. After approximately 45 seconds, he became disturbed at "the look in her eyes"&lt;ref name="Gadsden Times Mar. 19, 1980"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man faces 45 years in killings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19800319&amp;id=6aIfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3911,3354844|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Gadsden Times]]|page=20|agency=Associated Press|date=March 19, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran to the front of the van, vomiting. Bittaker then manually strangled Schaefer until she collapsed to the ground and began [[convulsion|convulsing]]. He then twisted a wire coat hanger around her neck with [[Locking pliers|vise-grip pliers]] until Schaefer's convulsions ceased. Lucinda Schaefer was denied her requests to pray before Bittaker and Norris killed her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Crime Classification Manual: A Standard System for Investigating and Classifying Violent Crime'' {{ISBN|978-1-897-78404-4}} p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucinda Schaefer's body was wrapped in a plastic shower curtain and thrown over a steep canyon Bittaker had selected. According to Norris, after Bittaker had thrown Schaefer over the canyon, Bittaker assured him "the animals would eat her up, so there wouldn't be any evidence left."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258}}

===Andrea Joy Hall===
On July 8, 1979, two weeks after the murder of Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker and Norris encountered 18-year-old Andrea Joy Hall hitchhiking along the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258}} As the pair slowed the van to offer Hall a lift, another vehicle pulled over and offered Hall exactly that, which she accepted. Bittaker and Norris followed the vehicle from a distance until Hall exited the vehicle in Redondo Beach.&lt;ref name="Farr1980"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farr|first1=Bill|title=Girls' killer tells a gruesome story|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19800319&amp;id=4y8dAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6593,4087049|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|page=27|date=March 19, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1977 Chevrolet van (5879255416).jpg|left|thumb|A 1977 Chevrolet van with sliding door. Bittaker and Norris used a windowless [[Chevrolet van#Third generation (1971–1995)|GMC Vandura]] model similar to this van when committing their abductions.]]
On this occasion, Norris hid in the back of the van in order to dupe Hall into thinking Bittaker was alone. Inside the van, Bittaker offered Hall a soft drink from the cooler located in the rear of the van. Norris pounced on her when she went to retrieve it and, after a strenuous fight, managed to subdue Hall by twisting her arm behind her back, causing her to scream in pain. Norris then gagged Hall with adhesive tape and bound her wrists and ankles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/5.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626141808/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/5.html|archive-date=June 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a location in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Lucinda Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; While Bittaker was raping Hall for the second time, Norris saw what he believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Bittaker clasped his hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle thought he had seen. When he returned, the pair drove to a location farther in the San Gabriel Mountains. Bittaker forced Hall to walk uphill naked alongside the road and to then perform oral sex on him, before ordering Hall to pose for several [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] pictures.&lt;ref name="Markman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Markman |first1=Ronald |last2=Bosco |first2=Dominick |year=1989 |title=Alone with The Devil |publisher=Piatkus Publishing |isbn=0-7499-1002-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|259}}

Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a third location, where Bittaker again walked Hall up a nearby hill, this time as Norris drove to a nearby store to purchase alcohol. When Norris returned, Bittaker was alone and in possession of two further Polaroid pictures he had taken,&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; both of which depicted Hall's face in expressions Norris later described as being of "sheer terror" as she begged for her life to be spared.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|88}} Bittaker informed Norris that he had told Hall he was going to kill her and challenged her to give him as many reasons as she could come up with as to why she should be allowed to live, before thrusting an [[ice pick]] through her ear into her brain. He then turned her body over and thrust the ice pick into her other ear, stomping on it until the handle broke.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; Bittaker then strangled before throwing her body off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258–259}}

===Jackie Doris Gilliam and Jacqueline Leah Lamp===
On September 3, Bittaker and Norris observed two girls named Jackie Doris Gilliam and Jacqueline Leah Lamp sitting on a bus stop bench located close to [[Hermosa Beach, California|Hermosa Beach]]. Lamp and Gilliam had been hitchhiking along the Pacific Coast Highway before Bittaker and Norris observed them as they were resting at the bus stop. Bittaker and Norris offered the girls a ride, which Gilliam and Lamp accepted. Inside the van, both girls were offered marijuana by Norris, which they accepted.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|259}}

Shortly after entering the van, both girls realized that Bittaker had steered the van off the Pacific Coast Highway and was driving in the direction of the San Gabriel Mountains. When the girls protested, both Bittaker and Norris attempted to allay the girls' concerns with excuses, which did not deceive either girl. Lamp, aged 13, attempted to open the sliding door, whereupon Norris hit her on the back of the head with a bag filled with lead weights,&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; briefly knocking her unconscious, before overpowering 15-year-old Jackie Gilliam. As he began to bind and gag Gilliam, Jacqueline Lamp regained consciousness and again attempted to flee the van, whereupon Norris twisted her arm behind her back and dragged her back into the van. As this struggle ensued, Bittaker—noting the girls' struggle was in full view of potential witnesses—stopped the van, punched Gilliam in the face, and assisted Norris in finishing binding and gagging the two girls.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}}

Gilliam and Lamp were driven to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} being bound and gagged between repeated instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also informed Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In the first of three instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed he buried the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an ice pick and using vise grip pliers to tear off part of one nipple.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-supreme-court/1774155.html|title=The People, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. Lawrence Sigmond Bittaker, Defendant and Appellant|publisher=findlaw.com|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost two days of captivity, Lamp and Gilliam were murdered. At Bittaker's subsequent trial, Norris claimed he had suggested that Gilliam be killed quickly as, unlike Lamp, she had been largely cooperative throughout the period of her captivity, whereupon Bittaker replied, "No, they only die once anyway." Gilliam was struck in each ear with an ice pick, then strangled to death.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

After Bittaker had murdered Jackie Gilliam, he then forced Jacqueline Leah Lamp out of the van. Upon exiting the sliding door, Bittaker shouted to her: "You wanted to stay a virgin; now you can die a virgin!"&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"&gt;[http://murders.ru/Classific.pdf Crime Classification Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232}} before Norris struck her upon the head with a sledgehammer. Bittaker then strangled Lamp until he believed she had died; when Lamp opened her eyes,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} Norris again bludgeoned her repeatedly as Bittaker strangled her to death.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

The bodies of Jackie Gilliam and Jacqueline Lamp were thrown over an embankment into the [[chaparral]].&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

===Shirley Lynette Ledford===
Bittaker and Norris abducted their final victim, 16-year-old Shirley Lynette Ledford, on October 31, 1979. Ledford was abducted as she stood outside a gas station;&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|252}} hitchhiking home from a Halloween party in the [[Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles|Sunland-Tujunga]] suburb of Los Angeles. Investigators believe Ledford accepted a ride home from Bittaker and Norris because she recognized Bittaker, as he is known to have frequented the restaurant in which Ledford held a part-time job as a waitress.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Upon accepting the offer of a lift home and entering the van, Ledford was offered marijuana by Norris, which she refused.&lt;ref name="Farr1980"/&gt; Bittaker drove the van to a secluded street, where Norris drew a knife, then bound and gagged Ledford with [[Barricade tape|construction tape]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258}}

Bittaker then traded places with Norris, who drove in an aimless manner for in excess of an hour as Bittaker remained with Ledford in the back of the van. After removing the construction tape from the girl's mouth and legs, Bittaker tormented Ledford: initially slapping and mocking her, then beating her with his fists as he repeatedly shouted for her to "say something", then, as Shirley Ledford began screaming, shouting for her to "scream louder". As Ledford continued screaming, Bittaker began asking her as he struck her: "What's the matter? Don't you like to scream?"&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|261}}

As Shirley Ledford began to cry, she pleaded with Bittaker, saying, "No, don't touch me." In response, Bittaker again ordered her to scream as loud as she wished, then began alternately striking her with a hammer, beating her breasts with his fists&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|232}} and torturing her with pliers both between and throughout instances when he raped and sodomized her. Repeatedly, Ledford can be heard pleading for the abuse to cease and making statements such as, "Oh no! No!"&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262}} as sounds of Bittaker alternately extracting either the sledgehammer or the pliers from the toolbox can be heard on a tape recorder he had switched on after entering the rear of the van. Norris later described hearing "screams ... constant screams" emanating from the rear of the van as he drove.&lt;ref name="Farr1980"/&gt;

Shortly after Norris switched places with Bittaker, he himself switched on the tape recorder which Bittaker had used to record much of the time he had been in the rear of the van with Ledford.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; Norris first shouted for Ledford to: "Go ahead and scream or I'll make you scream."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262}} In response, Ledford pleaded, "I'll scream if you stop hitting me," then emitted several high-pitched screams as Norris encouraged her to continue until he ordered her to stop.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262}}

Norris then reached for the sledgehammer as Shirley Ledford—seeing him do this—screamed, "Oh no!" Norris then struck Ledford once upon the left elbow. In response, she informed Norris he had broken her elbow, before pleading, "Don't hit me again."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262–263}} In response, Norris again raised the sledgehammer as Ledford repeatedly screamed, "No!" Norris then proceeded to strike Ledford 25 consecutive times upon the same elbow with the sledgehammer, before asking her, "What are you sniveling about?" as Ledford continuously screamed and wept.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

}}
After approximately two hours of captivity, Norris killed Ledford by strangling her with a wire coat hanger, which he tightened with pliers. Ledford did not react much to the act of strangulation, although she died with her eyes open.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|89}} Bittaker then opted to discard her body on a random lawn in order to view the reaction from the press. The pair drove to a randomly selected house in Sunland and discarded Ledford's body in a bed of ivy upon the front lawn.

Shirley Lynette Ledford's body was found by a jogger the following morning. An autopsy revealed that, in addition to having been sexually violated, she had died of strangulation after receiving extensive blunt-force trauma to the face, head, breasts, and left elbow, with her [[olecranon]] sustaining multiple fractures. Her genitalia and rectum had been torn, caused in part by Bittaker having inserted pliers inside her body.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|233–234}} In addition, her left hand bore a puncture wound and a finger on her right hand had been slashed.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|226}}&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt;

Bittaker would later claim the tape recording the pair had created of Shirley Ledford's clear abuse and torture offered nothing other than the evidence of a threesome, adding that, towards the very end, Shirley Ledford was screaming for he and Norris to kill her.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|139}}

==Investigation==
In November 1979, Roy Norris became reacquainted with a friend named Jimmy Dalton, an individual with whom he had previously been incarcerated at the California Men's Colony.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Norris confided in this individual as to his and Bittaker's exploits over the previous five months, including graphic details of the murder of Shirley Ledford (the only victim whose body had been found at this time). Norris also divulged to Dalton that, in addition to the five murders he and Bittaker had committed, there had been three additional incidents in which he and Bittaker had abducted or attempted to abduct young women who had either successfully escaped their attackers or, in one instance, had actually been raped but released.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|226}}

Upon hearing Norris's confessions, Dalton consulted his attorney, who advised him to inform authorities.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} Dalton agreed, and he and his attorney informed the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], who in turn relayed the two men to the Redondo Beach police.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}}

A Redondo Beach Detective named Paul Bynum was assigned to investigate Dalton's claims as to Norris's confessions of the murders, attempted abductions, and rapes which he had confided to Dalton had occurred between June and October.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} Bynum initially noted that Dalton's statements as to Norris's confessions did match reports on file of several teenage girls who had been [[missing person|reported missing]] over the previous five months.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} In addition, the incident Norris had confided to Dalton where he claimed he and Bittaker had sprayed [[Mace (spray)|mace]] in the face of a woman, who had then been dragged into Bittaker's GMC van and raped by both men, matched a report filed in relation to an incident which occurred on September 30. In this filed report, a young woman named Robin Robeck had had mace sprayed in her face before being dragged into a van and raped by two Caucasian men in their mid-30s, before being released.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|263}} Although Robeck had reported the abduction and rape to police, they had been unable to identify her assailants.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|263–264}}

Bynum dispatched an investigator to visit Robin Robeck at her residence in [[Oregon]], to show her a series of mug shots. Without hesitation, Robeck positively identified two photos presented to her as those of the men who had kidnapped and raped her on September 30. The two individuals she identified were Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}}

==Arrest==
Upon linking Bittaker and Norris to the rape of Robin Robeck, the Hermosa Beach police placed Roy Norris under [[surveillance]];&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|263}} within days, they had observed his dealing in marijuana. On November 20, 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girls Marked for Murder?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=Af8hAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2651,309156|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|agency=Associated Press|date=February 16, 1980|pages=1A, 2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris was arrested by the Hermosa Beach police for parole violation. The same day, at the Burbank motel where he resided, Bittaker was arrested for the rape of Robin Robeck.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/48/1046.html ''law.justia.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Robeck had been able to identify mug shots of Bittaker and Norris, in a police lineup she was unable to positively identify her assailants.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=October 16, 2017|date=February 2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, police had observed Norris dealing in marijuana, whereas Bittaker had been in possession of drugs at the time of his arrest. Both were held on charges of parole violation.&lt;ref&gt;''Couples Who Kill: Profiles of Deviant Duos'' {{ISBN|0-74908-357-3}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

A search of Bittaker's apartment revealed several Polaroid photographs which were determined as depicting Andrea Joy Hall and Jackie Gilliam—both of whom had been reported as missing earlier the same year. Inside Bittaker's van, investigators discovered a sledgehammer, a plastic bag filled with lead weights, a book detailing how to locate police radio frequencies,&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; a jar of Vaseline, two necklaces (later confirmed as belonging to two of the victims) and a tape recording of a young woman in obvious distress; screaming and pleading for mercy while in the process of torture and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt; The mother of Shirley Lynette Ledford—named by Jimmy Dalton as being one of the women whom Norris had confessed he and Bittaker had killed—identified the voice on the tape as being that of her only daughter; the voices of the two men mocking and threatening Shirley Ledford in the process of her torture and abuse were identified as being Roy Norris and Lawrence Bittaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl Begs for Mercy on Recording of Rape and Torture in Los Angeles|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19800215&amp;id=V2dQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5121,4024715|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Evening Independent]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 15, 1980|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also found in Bittaker's motel were seven bottles of various acidic materials. (Investigators would later discover Bittaker planned to use these acidic materials upon their next victim.)&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

Inside Norris's apartment, police discovered a bracelet he had taken from Shirley Ledford's body as a souvenir. Also found at the homes of both Bittaker and Norris were Polaroid pictures of almost 500 teenage girls and young women, most of which had apparently been taken at Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach,&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|41}} with others taken by Bittaker at a Burbank high school. Most of these pictures had been taken without the girls' knowledge or consent.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=October 16, 2017|date=February 2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

===Confession===
On November 30, 1979, Norris attended a [[preliminary hearing]] in relation to the September 30 rape. By this stage, Norris was beginning to display visible signs of stress.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|265}} At the hearing, Norris waived his [[Miranda warning|Miranda rights]], before Detective Bynum and Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay began questioning him, initially in relation to the rape of Robin Robeck; then in relation to the statements given to police by Jimmy Dalton and the evidence recovered from his and Bittaker's residences.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264–265}}

Initially, Norris flatly denied any involvement in any murders, rapes or disappearances; however, when confronted with the evidence investigators had compiled, Norris began to confess, although he did attempt to portray Bittaker as being more [[culpability|culpable]] in the murders than himself. In what Bynum and Kay later described as a "casual, unconcerned manner,"&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}} Norris divulged that he and Bittaker had been in the habit of driving around areas such as the Pacific Coast Highway and randomly approaching girls whom they found attractive with offers of a ride, posing with the pair for photographs,&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt; or marijuana. Most of those whom they approached rejected whatever given ruse Bittaker and Norris used to entice them into the van; although four girls had accepted lifts from the pair and had been murdered, with a fifth victim—their first—being grabbed by force.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

Inside the van, the girls would typically be overpowered, bound hand and foot, gagged, and driven to locations deep within the San Gabriel Mountains, where they would be sexually assaulted by both men, then usually killed by strangulation with a wire coat hanger,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; although two of the victims had had ice picks driven into their ears before being strangled. Norris admitted to bludgeoning their youngest victim, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, about the head with a sledgehammer as Bittaker strangled her, and admitted to repeatedly striking Shirley Ledford upon the elbow with a sledgehammer before strangling her to death. The bottles of acid found at Bittaker's motel, Norris stated, were intended for use upon the next victim they abducted.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

According to Norris, the level of brutality Bittaker had exhibited towards their victims had increased on each successive instance they had successfully lured a girl into the van: their final victim, Shirley Ledford, had actually pleaded to be killed in order that her agony could cease. Additional details provided by Norris provided further [[corroborating evidence]] to support his confessions. For example, he knew that their first victim, Lucinda Schaefer, had left a meeting at a Presbyterian Church shortly before she was abducted and that Schaefer had lost one shoe as she had been dragged into Bittaker's van. Norris also knew part of Shirley Ledford's ancestry was Hispanic, and that Bittaker had unsuccessfully asked her to date him prior to October 1979.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

In a press statement relating to the police investigation into the murders issued on February 7, 1980, Los Angeles County Sheriff [[Peter J. Pitchess|Peter Pitchess]] stated the victims had been subjected to "[[wikt:sadism|sadistic]] and barbaric abuse,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recordings link two to brutal sex slayings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19800210&amp;id=aaMfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1870,2643728|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=The Gadsden Times|agency=Associated Press|date=February 10, 1980|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that five charges of [[first-degree murder]] would be sought against both Bittaker and Norris. Sheriff Pitchess also stated that, in relation to the Polaroid pictures found in Bittaker and Norris's apartments, police had located 60 of the young women depicted—none of whom had been harmed.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

Nonetheless, Pitchess also stated that police had also identified 19 of the women depicted in the pictures as being individuals who had been reported missing,&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Pictorial History of World Crime, Volume 2'' {{ISBN|978-1-442-23843-5}} p. 718&lt;/ref&gt; and that these teenage girls and young women may well have been murdered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillott|first1=Roger|title=Were 500 marked for death?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19800218&amp;id=0Z0rAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4015,3660802|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 18, 1980|location=[[Nashua, New Hampshire]]|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Pitchess did stress that they had no conclusive evidence to suggest that these additional 19 women photographed had fallen victim to Bittaker and Norris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disappearance of 40 girls investigated|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=ErgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=981,1519107|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|agency=[[UPI]]|date=February 16, 1980|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the individuals depicted in the Polaroid pictures seized from Bittaker and Norris depicts an unidentified young white woman, alone with Bittaker and Norris, in circumstances very similar to the pictures found depicting known victims Andrea Hall, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, and Jackie Gilliam. The young woman in the pictures has never been identified. This photograph is indicative there may have been one further victim&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|234}} whom neither Bittaker or Norris have ever mentioned to investigators.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

===Search of San Gabriel Mountains===
Norris agreed to return to the San Gabriel Mountains to search for the bodies of the girls to whose abduction and murder he had confessed to assisting in. In each instance, Norris brought detectives to the area where he and Bittaker had disposed of their victims' bodies. Despite extensive searches of the areas where he stated the bodies of Lucinda Schaefer and Andrea Hall had been discarded, their bodies were never found. Nonetheless, on February 9, 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi/search.cgi California Death Records. Gilliam, Jackie Doris.]&lt;/ref&gt; the skeletalized bodies of Jacqueline Leah Lamp and Jackie Doris Gilliam were found at the bottom of a canyon, alongside a dry river bed.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}} The bodies were scattered over an area measuring hundreds of feet in diameter. An ice pick was still lodged in the skull of Jackie Gilliam;&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} the skull of Jacqueline Leah Lamp bore multiple indentations—evidence of the numerous hammer blows Norris had stated he inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|0-816-06987-5}} pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wpdms shdrlfi020l san gabriel mountains.jpg|205px|right|thumb|The [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Norris was able to lead investigators to the bodies of two of the four victims he and Bittaker had murdered at this location.]]
In February 1980, Norris and Bittaker were formally charged with the murders of the five girls.&lt;ref name="MarkedForMurder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Were Young Girls Marked for Murder?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=VoIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6200,2826929|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 16, 1980|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[arraignment]], Bittaker was denied bail, whereas Norris's bail was set at $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rape-torture-murder plot claims at least five girls' lives|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=lbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6992,3054781|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Wilmington Morning Star]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 16, 1980|page=4A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one month of his being charged with murder, Norris had accepted a plea bargain in which he would testify against Bittaker in return for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] against him.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

==Guilty plea==
On March 18, 1980, Roy Norris pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder; one count of second-degree murder (in relation to victim Andrea Joy Hall),&lt;ref name="Gadsden Times Mar. 19, 1980"/&gt; two counts of rape, and one count of robbery. Formal sentencing was postponed until May 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guilty in torture murder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19800319&amp;id=RVpGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2186,2694929|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=The Evening News|agency=Associated Press|date=March 19, 1980|location=[[Newburgh, New York]]|page=5A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In return for Norris's agreeing to plead guilty and to testify against Lawrence Bittaker, prosecutors had agreed to seek neither the death penalty nor life without parole at the upcoming sentencing hearing.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}}

Prior to his May 7 sentencing, Norris was reviewed by a probation officer who testified at his sentencing that Norris had again accused Bittaker of the actual torture of their victims, and that for Norris himself, the feeling of power and the dominance he had over the victims was the main overriding factor, as opposed to having sexual intercourse with them.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}} The parole officer added that Norris "never exhibited any remorse or compassion about his brutal acts towards the victims ... the defendant appears compulsive in his need to desire to inflict pain and torture upon women." In conclusion, the probation officer testified that Norris "can realistically be regarded as an extreme [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]], whose depraved pattern of behavior is beyond rehabilitation."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}}

On May 7, 1980, Roy Norris was sentenced to 45 years to life imprisonment, with eligibility for parole from 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-7472-5361-7}} p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arraignment===
On April 24, 1980, Lawrence Bittaker was arraigned on a total of 29 charges of kidnapping, rape, sodomy, and murder in addition to various charges of [[criminal conspiracy]] and possession of a firearm.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}} He was also charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder dating from December 1979 in which he had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade two inmates due to be released to murder Robin Robeck in order to prevent her from testifying against him at his upcoming trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pleas given in 5 slayings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19800429&amp;id=_RQ0AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3376,7110894|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Lodi News-Sentinel|agency=UPI|date=April 29, 1980|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges for the rape of Robin Robeck would later be dropped because of a lack of physical evidence as well as Robeck's failing to identify her attackers in a lineup.&lt;ref name="MarkedForMurder"/&gt;

When asked by Judge William Hollingsworth as to how he pleaded, Bittaker remained silent—refusing to answer any questions.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}} In response, the judge entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/01/19/Trial-begins-in-sex-torture-case/5475348728400/|title=Trial Begins in Sex-torture Case|publisher=UPI.com|date=August 19, 1981|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

==Trial==
The trial of Lawrence Bittaker began on January 19, 1981.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|226}} He was tried in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]] before Judge Thomas Fredericks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trial of Accused Pliers Killer Begins Today |date=January 5, 1981 |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/01/05/Trial-of-accused-pliers-killer-begins-today/7082347518800/ |publisher=UPI.com |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The star witness to appear for the prosecution at the trial of Lawrence Bittaker was Roy Norris,&lt;ref name="MorningNews1981"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury recommends death sentence for Bittaker|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19810223&amp;id=qAIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4293,3287036|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Morning News|agency=Associated Press|date=February 23, 1981|location=[[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]|page=6A}}&lt;/ref&gt; who began his testimony on January 22. Norris testified as to how he became acquainted with Bittaker in jail, and how the pair had formulated a plan to kidnap, rape and kill teenage girls. Responding to questions from the prosecutor, Norris stated that in June 1979, he had unsuccessfully attempted to abduct and rape a woman, who escaped unharmed.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; When he informed Bittaker of this incident, they both agreed to act together on all future abductions.&lt;ref name="Spokane Daily Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen girls' deaths bring 'guilty' ruling|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19810218&amp;id=zPpLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6628,768455|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|agency=Associated Press|date=February 18, 1981|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

Norris then chronologically recounted for the court the details of each of the five murders he and Bittaker had committed in addition to the September 30, 1979 rape of Robin Robeck, the attempted abduction of a woman named Jan Malin, which had also occurred on September 30, and the attempted abduction of an unidentified young woman on September 27.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt;

In reference to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire coat hanger. The pair had then thrown her body into a location at or near the San Dimas Canyon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In reference to the murder of Andrea Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for "over a day" before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that "I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. I knew this was coming, so I agreed." Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|89}}

Several witnesses testified as to Bittaker having shown them pictures of the victims he had retained as keepsakes and which had been found in his motel. One witness, a 17-year-old neighbor of Bittaker's named Christina Dralle, testified that Bittaker had shown her a Polaroid picture he had taken of Jackie Gilliam before stating, "The girls I get won't talk anymore."&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; Another witness to testify was an individual named Lloyd Douglas, who had shared a jail cell with Bittaker following his November 1979 arrest. Douglas testified that Bittaker had discussed in detail the torture he had inflicted on victims Jackie Gilliam and Shirley Ledford, stating Bittaker had informed him he had stabbed one of Gilliam's breasts with an ice pick, which he then twisted as the tool remained inserted in the wound;&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; he had also "pinched" Gilliam on the legs and breasts with a vise grip, before tearing off part of one nipple.&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; Douglas also stated Bittaker had informed him he had "pulled on" the genitals and breasts of Shirley Ledford with the same instrument, and that he had attempted to beat her breasts "back into her chest."&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|232}}

The defense contended that Norris was the actual perpetrator of the murders and that Bittaker had only become aware of Norris's activities shortly before his arrest when Norris had informed him he had murdered several girls with whom they had both encountered and engaged in sexual activities. To support their case, the defense produced a friend of Norris named Richard Shoopman, who testified as to Norris's repeatedly divulging to him his desire to rape young girls.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; Shoopman also testified that Norris had informed him that the look of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] and fear on the face of a young girl was a prime sexual stimulus for him. In support of Bittaker's case, the defense also harked to the Polaroid images taken of the facial expressions of Andrea Hall, and of Bittaker's statements as to Norris's revelations to Bittaker regarding his prime sexual stimulations while both were incarcerated at the California Men's Colony in 1977.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

[[File:Shirley Lynette Ledford Sunland-Tujunga 1979.jpg|upright|thumb|Shirley Lynette Ledford. The audio recording of her abuse at Bittaker's hands was the most damning evidence presented at his trial.]]
The most damning evidence presented at Bittaker's trial was a 17-minute section of the audio tape the pair had created of Shirley Lynette Ledford's abuse and torment. The audiotape, which had been found inside Bittaker's van and which Norris had earlier testified Bittaker had repeatedly played as he drove in the weeks prior to his arrest—adding that Bittaker considered the contents to be "real funny"&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}—was presented in evidence on January 29, with Stephen Kay forewarning the jury: "For those of you who do not know what hell is like, you will find out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/01/29/A-stunned-jury-in-the-murder-trial-of-Lawrence/3810349592400/ |title=A Stunned Jury in the Murder Trial of Lawrence Bittaker |publisher=upi.com |date=January 29, 1981 |accessdate=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Judge Fredericks had earlier denied motions by the defense to omit the tape recording from admission as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury asks death penalty|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19810222&amp;id=lp5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2387,1880312|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=The Prescott Courier|agency=Associated Press|date=February 22, 1981|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

More than 100 people were present in the courtroom as the tape was played, and many members of both the jury and the audience wept openly upon hearing the contents, with several members of the audience either burying their heads in their hands, dabbing tears from their eyes or rushing out of the courtroom before the tape had finished.&lt;ref name="The Evening Independent 1981"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jurors, Lawyers Weep at Taped Screams of Victim|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19810130&amp;id=fGFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3483,4536403|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Evening Independent|agency=Associated Press|date=January 30, 1981|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bittaker was undisturbed at hearing the contents of the tape—smiling throughout the hearing of the recording.&lt;ref&gt;C''ouples who Kill'' {{ISBN|978-0-7490-8175-1}} p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of two instances throughout the trial when prosecutor Stephen Kay was reduced to tears,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|267}} he walked out of the courtroom during recess following the hearing of the recording of Shirley Ledford's rape, abuse, and torture. Weeping openly, Kay stated to the reporters gathered outside the courtroom: "Everybody who has heard that tape has had it affect their lives. I just picture those girls&amp;nbsp;... how alone they were when they died."&lt;ref name="The Evening Independent 1981"/&gt; When questioned by reporters as to whether the audiotape should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: "You're darn right it [the audio tape] should have been. The jury needs to know what these guys did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury Hears Tape Made During Rape, Torture |date=January 31, 1981 |url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1981_01_31/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1981_01_31_djvu.txt |publisher=The Times-News |accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 1981, Bittaker testified on his own behalf.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|234}} Bittaker denied any knowledge in the abduction and murder of Lucinda Schaefer, and claimed he had paid Andrea Hall to pose for the Polaroid photographs depicting her found at his Burbank motel after Hall had agreed to his offer of $200 for sex. He then claimed Norris had walked Hall into the San Gabriel Mountains, before returning alone and informing Bittaker he had told Hall to "find her own way home."&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

Bittaker had a similar explanation as to the double murder of Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam: he claimed Gilliam accepted an offer of money for sex and posing for pictures, and that he had last seen the girls alone with Norris in his GMC van. With regards to the murder of Shirley Ledford, he claimed she had agreed to theatrically scream for the tape recorder, and that she was not tortured in his presence, but had been left alone with Norris.

Bittaker's trial lasted for over three weeks. On February 10, 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/62443464/|title=A Coathanger the State Claims Lawrence Bittaker Used to Kill One Victim|access-date=October 16, 2017|newspaper=The San Bernardino County Sun|date=February 10, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecution and defense counsels began their [[closing argument]]s. In the closing argument delivered by the prosecution, Stephen Kay apologized to the jury that he was only asking for the death penalty, adding that he wished the law permitted him to request that the same suffering be inflicted upon Bittaker that he had inflicted upon his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/20110209/dennis-mccarthy-pain-lingers-as-death-row-inmate-lives-on|title=Dennis McCarthy: Pain lingers as death row inmate lives on|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay then described Bittaker as an "excuse for a man" as he held aloft pictures of each of the five murdered girls before the jury. Seeking the death penalty for Bittaker, Kay referred to the case as "one of the most shocking, brutal cases in the history of American crime," before adding: "If the death penalty is not appropriate in this case, then when will it ever be?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death sentence ordered for murderer of 5 girls|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19810225&amp;id=0vpLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5477,2221303|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|agency=UPI|date=February 25, 1981|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defense attorney Albert Garber requested the jury discount the testimony of Roy Norris; arguing in favor of Bittaker's claims that Norris had committed the actual murders, and claiming the testimony of the prosecutors throughout the trial amounted to little more than a "bloodlust," adding that the prosecution had repeatedly recited the "gory details" of the murders. Garber harked to the earlier testimony of a psychologist named Michael Maloney, who had testified as to Bittaker's inability to [[empathy|empathize]] with other people's feelings and emotions&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; in addition to the fact that, with the exception of Bittaker's 1974 stabbing of Gary Louie, all of Bittaker's previous criminal convictions were for nonviolent offenses. The defense also claimed that insufficient corroborative evidence existed to convict Bittaker.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt;

On February 17, 1981,&lt;ref name="Spokane Daily Chronicle"/&gt; after deliberating for three days, the jury found Bittaker guilty of five counts of first-degree murder, one charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, five charges of kidnapping, nine charges of rape, two charges of forcible oral copulation,&lt;ref name="Bittaker sentenced to death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bittaker sentenced to death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19810225&amp;id=jeoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4579,5400162|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Boca Raton News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|page=3A|date=February 25, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; one charge of sodomy, and three charges of unlawful possession of a firearm.&lt;ref name="The Bulletin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect guilty in 5 murders|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19810218&amp;id=WvpXAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4020,5643401|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]|agency=UPI|date=February 18, 1981|location=[[Bend, Oregon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberations as to whether Bittaker should be sentenced to death or life without parole began February 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor wants Death Penalty: Suspect Guilty in 5 Murders |date=February 18, 1981 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19810218&amp;id=WvpXAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4020,5643401 |publisher=The Bulletin |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury deliberated for just 90 minutes&lt;ref name="The Bulletin"/&gt; before they returned with their verdict: Bittaker was sentenced to death for the five counts of first-degree murder upon which the prosecution had sought this penalty.&lt;ref name="MorningNews1981"/&gt; He showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered. Superior Court Judge Thomas Fredericks then ordered Bittaker to appear in court on March 24 for formal sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/24/Bittaker-sentenced-to-death/5880354258000/|title=Bittaker Sentenced to Death|date=March 24, 1981|publisher=|via=www.upi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, in accordance with the jury verdict, Lawrence Bittaker was formally sentenced to death. In the event that the sentence imposed was ever reverted to life imprisonment, Judge Thomas Fredericks imposed an alternative sentence of 199 years, 4 months' imprisonment to take immediate effect.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|234}}

===Imprisonment and appeals===
Bittaker appealed his conviction and sentencing, citing procedural errors such as the validity of warrants used to authorize the search of his van and motel room, and the dismissal by the judge of a woman initially hired at the stage of jury selection to advise the defense counsel in matters relating to jury views upon the death penalty. Nonetheless, Bittaker's appeal was dismissed on June 22, 1989, with the court ruling that any procedural errors were minor and—in view of the strong evidence against Bittaker—did not affect the overall verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-23/news/mn-2460_1_lawrence-sigmond-bittaker-conviction-and-sentence-fair-trial|title=Death Sentence Upheld for Killer Who Showed 'Astonishing Cruelty'|first=Philip|last=Hager|date=June 23, 1989|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A renewed execution date was scheduled for July 23, 1991. Bittaker again appealed the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that he be executed, and was granted a further stay of execution on July 9, 1991.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|253}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:SanQuentinSP.jpg|right|thumb|Bittaker remains incarcerated on death row at [[San Quentin State Prison]].]]
Lawrence Bittaker has granted several death row interviews following his 1981 conviction. To date, he has never expressed any remorse for his crimes, and states the only remorse he feels is for the fact he and Norris were arrested, thus "ruining" his own life.&lt;ref&gt;''Journey into Darkness'' {{ISBN|978-0-749-32394-3}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact Bittaker currently considers his life to have been a "wasted" one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article96592997.html|title=Death Row Inmate Lawrence Bittaker said he's Getting Afraid of Death|access-date=October 15, 2016|newspaper=The Sacramento Bee|date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has also marveled that he and Norris had little in common before their acquaintance at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo in 1977, before adding that they have "one hell of a lot in common now!"&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}} In reference to one of the torture- and murder implements he and Norris used upon their victims, Bittaker responds to letters he receives with the nickname "Pliers" Bittaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence Bittaker, a Most Depraved Killer, Twists Justice System |date=August 20, 2016 |url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dan-morain/article96800957.html |publisher=The Sacramento Bee |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his incarceration, Bittaker has filed more than 40 [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawsuits Let Murderer Delay Day of Justice |date=March 4, 1997 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60HE%27S+JUST+SO+CLEVER,+THOUGH,+AND+KNOWS+HOW+TO+PLAY+THE+SYSTEM.%27+%3A...-a083858046 |publisher=The Free Library |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; over issues as trivial as his being served a broken cookie and crushed sandwiches by the prison cafeteria, which he cited as an example of his being subjected to [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let's curb jailhouse lawyers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19960429&amp;id=Bh5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3046,7756635|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Scripps Howard News Service|date=April 29, 1996|page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bittaker was declared a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious litigant]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-20/news/ls-5250_1_vexatious-litigant-list|title=Courting Trouble: A Unique Law Turns the Tables on Those Who File Numerous or Frivolous Lawsuits|first=Pamela|last=Warrick|date=November 20, 1995|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this declaration, he may no longer file lawsuits without the express permission of an attorney or a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-20/news/ls-5250_1_vexatious-litigant-list|title=Courting Trouble: A Unique Law Turns the Tables on Those Who File Numerous or Frivolous Lawsuits|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 20, 1995|access-date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Norris remains incarcerated at Donovan State Prison. Since his conviction, he has repeatedly claimed the sole reason he participated in the murders was out of fear of Bittaker.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|135}} Norris also claims to have twice contemplated confessing to his and Bittaker's responsibility in the murders to the police; he also claims to have successfully deterred three potential victims from entering Bittaker's van.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|78}}

Norris claims that although he enjoyed the actual intercourse with the victims, only Bittaker enjoyed the act of torture and murder, stating: "I didn't enjoy killing—that was Lawrence [Bittaker]. It was his favorite part:&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|135}} watching the women struggle to live; knowing he'd soon be taking life away." (Both investigators and psychologists have stated Norris derived extreme gratification from the domination, abuse, and torture inflicted upon his victims; these respective parties have also harked towards Norris's extensive history of physical and sexual violence against women prior to his meeting Bittaker, and his repeated instances of denial of culpability for his actions.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|66}})

Roy Norris initially became eligible for parole in 2009.&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"/&gt; Norris declined to attend the parole hearing, thereby automatically deferring his parole eligibility for another 10 years. He is next eligible for parole in 2019.&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Altman|first1=Larry|title=Redondo Beach killer is denied parole|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/2009/03/25/redondo-beach-killer-is-denied-parole/|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Catherine|title=A Look Back At The "Tool Box Killers" Who Tortured, Killed Five Teens in 1979 - CrimeFeed|url=http://crimefeed.com/2016/10/look-back-tool-box-killers-tortured-killed-five-teens-1979/|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=CrimeFeed|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.|date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No parole for killer of 5|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/2009/03/25/no-parole-for-killer-of-5/|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Daily Breeze|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Kay, the prosecutor at Bittaker's trial, still considers the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as being the worst criminal case he has ever prosecuted or encountered and remains insistent in his belief that Bittaker deserves to be executed more than any other inmate incarcerated on California's death row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCarthy|first1=Dennis|title='He's just so clever, though, and knows how to play the system.' : Lawsuits let murderer delay day of justice.|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%20:...-a083858046|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=March 4, 1997|via=[[TheFreeLibrary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, he has stated that for over two years following the trial of Lawrence Bittaker, his sleep was disturbed by recurring nightmares in which he would be rushing to Bittaker's van to prevent harm coming to the girls, but would "always get there too late."&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"/&gt;

Detective Paul Bynum, the chief investigator of the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris, committed suicide in December 1987. He was 39 years old. In a ten-page suicide note,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|276}} Bynum specifically referred to the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as haunting him, and of his fear they may be released from prison.&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"/&gt;

The audio tape Bittaker and Norris created of themselves raping and torturing Shirley Lynette Ledford remains in the possession of the [[FBI Academy]]. The audio cassette is now used to train and [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitize]] FBI agents to the raw reality of torture and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jack|title=Broken Cookies Vex Death Row Serial Killer|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J6U_AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3520,4031941|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Times-Union|date=February 19, 1997|location=[[Warsaw, Indiana]]|page=4A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mario Scelba''' (5 September 1901 – 29 October 1991) was an Italian [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democratic]] politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|33rd Prime Minister of Italy]] from February 1954 to July 1955. He was also [[President of the European Parliament]] from 1969 to 1971.

==Early career==
Scelba was born in [[Caltagirone]], Sicily, the son of a poor [[sharecropper]] on land owned by the priest Don [[Luigi Sturzo]], one of the founders of the [[Italian People's Party (1919–1926)|Italian People's Party]] (''Partito Popolare Italiano'', PPI).&lt;ref name=tim220254&gt;{{cite web|url=http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C860459%2C00.html |title=Italy’s New Premier |accessdate=2017-06-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719223841/http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C860459%2C00.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}, ''Time Magazine'', February 22, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tim040455&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C866106%2C00.html |title=The Iron Sicilian |accessdate=2017-06-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130071018/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C866106%2C00.html |archivedate=November 30, 2010 |df= }}, ''Time Magazine'', April 4, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law and graduated at the University of Rome.

Scelba was Sturzo's godchild and protégé. Sturzo paid for his law studies in Rome and employed him as his private secretary. When the [[Italian fascism|Fascists]] suppressed the PPI and forced Sturzo into exile (in [[Brooklyn]], part of the time), Scelba remained in Rome as his agent. He wrote for the underground paper ''Il Popolo'' during World War II. Arrested by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]], he was released within three days as a worthless catch.&lt;ref name=tim220254/&gt;&lt;ref name=tim040455/&gt;

On the day of [[Allied invasion of Italy|Rome's liberation]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]], he joined the new five-man national directorate of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (''Democrazia Cristiana'', DC).&lt;ref name=tim040455/&gt; The Christian Democrats started organising post-Fascist Italy in competition with, but also for a time in coalition with, the parties of the centre and left. In 1945, Scelba won a seat in the post-war [[Italian Constituent Assembly]] and entered [[Ferruccio Parri]]'s anti-fascist government as Minister of Post and Telecommunications, a post he retained in the two successive governments of [[Alcide de Gasperi]].&lt;ref name=nyt311091&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DA1439F932A05753C1A967958260 Mario Scelba Dies at 90 in Rome; A Prime Minister in Postwar Italy], Obituary in ''The New York Times'', October 31, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minister of the Interior==
===The "Iron Sicilian"===
On February 2, 1947, Scelba became Minister of the Interior in the third government of Premier [[Alcide de Gasperi]], remaining, with some brief interludes, until July 1955.  The short, bald, plump, oddly-impressive Scelba was probably the most powerful man in the successive governments of De Gasperi, after the Premier himself.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.unitn.it/files/download/9722/wpwhite.pdf | title = De Gasperi through American Eyes | first = Steven F | last = White | publisher = School of International Studies, University of Trento | year = 2005 | place = Trento (Italy) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003452/http://www.unitn.it/files/download/9722/wpwhite.pdf | archivedate = September 27, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}  Working Paper .&lt;/ref&gt;

As Minister, his hard-fisted record earned him the nickname "Iron Sicilian" for his ruthless suppression of left-wing workers protests and strikes, as well as [[Italian Social Movement-National Right|Neo Fascist]] rallies. When he first took over, the police were so shoddy that Scelba exclaimed: "If I were Communist, I'd start a revolution tomorrow."&lt;ref name = tim040455 /&gt; He wrote the so-called Scelba law, formally banning Fascism, but also designed to restrain the activities of the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/11/22/edold.t_42.php 1950: Italian Activism], International Herald Tribune&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Reparto Celere.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Reparto Celere'', a special jeep-riding riot squad of the Italian police.]]

Scelba built the country's dishevelled police into a force of some 200,000, heavily armed and equipped with armoured cars and special jeep-riding riot squads called the ''Reparto Celere''.&lt;ref name=tim220254/&gt; He made himself known as a man of action against what he considered Communist disorder.  In doing so, Scelba made himself many enemies, including many democrats who disapproved his harsh methods. His short, stubby figure and broad eye-twinkling smile was popular with political cartoonists.&lt;ref name=tim220254/&gt;

Scelba had a conservative attitude toward certain issues such as scant bathing suits, public kissing and nude statues. Despite this and his single-minded concern for law and order, on [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] issues Scelba leaned left of centre in the ''Democrazia Cristiana''.  He favoured more social reforms and public works, attacking speculators for pushing up prices. "It is virtually impossible," he once said, "to be Minister of Interior for a government that doesn't care if the people work or not."&lt;ref name = tim040455 /&gt; Scelba emphasized the possibility of undermining Communist strength "by determined measures of social and economic improvement – land reform of the great [[latifundia]]s in south Italy, for example."&lt;ref name = white/&gt;

Scelba was involved in setting up the [[Gladio in Italy|Gladio]] network, the clandestine [[NATO]] "[[stay-behind]]" operation in Italy after World War II, intended to organise resistance after a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ganser, ''[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/media/2006/12/358945.pdf NATO’s secret Armies]'', p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portella della Ginestra massacre===
[[Image:Ginestra.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mural of the Portella della Ginestra massacre]]
After just three months in office as Minister of the Interior, Scelba was confronted with the [[Portella della Ginestra massacre]]. Twelve days after the left-wing election victory in the Sicilian regional elections of 1947, the May 1 labour parade in Portella della Ginestra was attacked, culminating in the killing of 11 people and the wounding of over thirty. The attack was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader [[Salvatore Giuliano]],&lt;ref name=tim120547&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C855656%2C00.html |title=Battle of the Inkpots |accessdate=2017-06-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203075549/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C855656%2C00.html |archivedate=February 3, 2011 |df= }}, ''Time Magazine'', May 12, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; the aim being to punish local leftists for the recent election results.&lt;ref name=dickie265&gt;Dickie, ''Cosa Nostra'', pp. 265–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Scelba reported to Parliament the next day that so far as the police could determine, the Portella della Ginestra shooting was non-political.  He claimed that bandits notoriously infested the valley in which it occurred.&lt;ref name=tim120547/&gt;  However, that version was challenged by the left. The Communist deputy [[Girolamo Li Causi]] stressed the political nature of the massacre, claiming that [[the Mafia]] had perpetrated the attack, in cahoots with the large landowners, monarchists and the rightist [[Uomo Qualunque Front]].&lt;ref name=tim120547/&gt; He also claimed that police inspector Ettore Messana – supposed to coordinate the prosecution of the bandits – had been in league with Giuliano and denounced Scelba for allowing Messana to remain in office. Later documents would substantiate the accusation.&lt;ref name=servadio128&gt;Servadio, ''Mafioso'', pp. 128–9&lt;/ref&gt; Li Causi and Scelba would be the main opponents in the aftermath of the massacre – the subsequent killing of alleged perpetrator, Salvatore Giuliano, and the trial against Giuliano's lieutenant [[Gaspare Pisciotta]] and other remaining members of Giuliano's gang.

The trial of those responsible was held in the city of [[Viterbo]], starting in the summer of 1950. During the trial, Scelba was again accused of involvement in the plot to carry out the massacre, but the accusations were often contradictionary or vague. In the end, the judge concluded that no higher authority had ordered the massacre, and that the Giuliano band had acted autonomously.&lt;ref name=dickie265/&gt; At the trial Pisciotta said: “Again and again Scelba has gone back on his word: [[Bernardo Mattarella|Mattarella]] and Cusumano returned to Rome to plead for total amnesty for us, but Scelba denied all his promises.” Pisciotta also claimed that he had killed Salvatore Giuliano in his sleep by arrangement with Scelba. However, there was no evidence that Scelba had had any relationship with Pisciotta.&lt;ref name=ser135&gt;Servadio, ''Mafioso'', pp. 135–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==1948 elections==
[[File:Mario Scelba 1947.jpg|thumb|right|Mario Scelba in 1947]]
The [[Italian general election, 1948|general elections in April 1948]] were heavily influenced by the cold-war confrontation between the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States. After the Soviet-inspired February 1948 communist coup in [[Czechoslovakia]], the US became alarmed about Soviet intentions and feared that, if the leftist coalition were to win the elections, the Soviet-funded [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) would draw Italy into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. The election campaign remains unmatched in verbal aggression and fanaticism in Italy's history, on both sides. The Christian Democratic propaganda became famous in claiming that in Communist countries "children sent parents to jail", "children were owned by the state", "people ate their own children", and claiming disaster would strike Italy if the left were to take power.&lt;ref name=tim120448&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779791,00.html Show of Force], ''Time Magazine'', April 12, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html How to Hang On], ''Time Magazine'', April 19, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

Interior Minister Mario Scelba announced that the government had 330,000 men under arms, including a special shock force of 150,000 ready to take on the Communists if they tried to make trouble on election day.&lt;ref name=tim120448/&gt; The definitive test of strength came in 1950 during a nationwide general strike and mounting street clashes. On one day in March 1950, hundreds were wounded, including many policemen, and 7,000 people were arrested.&lt;ref name=nyt311091/&gt;

==Prime Minister==
On February 10, 1954, Scelba formed a new centrist government with a thin majority. It lasted until July 2, 1955. He sought strong relations with the United States and helped resolve outstanding wartime issues like the recovery of [[Trieste]] for Italy and pushed through the [[Paris Peace Treaties of 1947]] with the wartime Allied powers.&lt;ref name=nyt311091/&gt;&lt;ref name= A040755&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,807244,00.html The Fall of Scelba], ''Time Magazine'', July 4, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

While appointed Prime Minister, the aftermath of the [[Portella della Ginestra massacre]] came to haunt Scelba again. On February 9, 1954, Gaspare Pisciotta was found dead in his cell.&lt;ref name=tim220254-2&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860461,00.html The Big Mouth], ''Time Magazine'', February 22, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; After Pisciotta had been sentenced to life in imprisonment and forced labour, he realized that he had been abandoned by all. He declared that he was going to tell the whole truth, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano, which demanded the massacre at Portella delle Ginestra in exchange for liberty for the bandits and which Giuliano had destroyed immediately.&lt;ref name="ser135"/&gt;

[[File:Mario Scelba 1953.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Scelba speaks with journalists in 1953.]]
The cause of Pisciotta's death, as revealed by the autopsy, was the ingestion of 20&amp;nbsp;mg of [[strychnine]]. All Italy was alive with theories about who killed Pisciotta. Both the government and [[the Mafia]] were suggested as being behind the murder of Pisciotta, but no one was ever brought to trial. The fascist and Communist press did their best to put it on newly appointed Premier Scelba's administration, but had no evidence to go on.&lt;ref name=tim220254-2/&gt;

Another scandal that rocked Scelba’s government was the [[Wilma Montesi|Montesi affair]]. Foreign Minister [[Attilio Piccioni]], a co-founder of Italy's Christian Democrat Party, as well as the national police chief, had to resign when Piccioni's jazz-pianist son was implicated in the scandal involving sex, narcotics and the death of party girl Wilma Montesi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,819571,00.html  The Montesi Affair], ''Time Magazine'', March 22, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,857554,00.html  Action at Last], ''Time Magazine'', October 4, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1954, Scelba approved a package of measures against the Communist party and trade unions that was largely modelled on United States [[psychological warfare]] plans first elaborated in 1951–2. However, it proved to be only cosmetic, as well as a desperate attempt to consolidate his precarious position at home by obtaining formal American backing. Its half-hearted implementation exacerbated Washington's resentment toward its Italian allies and barely affected PCI's organizational structure. The PCI used the episode to denounce the illiberal nature of the Christian Democrat regime and to pose itself once more as the real defender of political liberties and constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=delpero&gt;{{citation | publisher=International Center for Advanced Studies, New York University | place = New York | url = http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/icas/MarioDelPero.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | title = Containing Containment: Rethinking Italy's Experience during the Cold War | first = Mario | last = Del Pero | date = April 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scelba's fall was accomplished by his own party, due to political manoeuvring of party rivals like ex-Premier [[Giuseppe Pella]] (who wanted to be Premier again) and Party Secretary [[Amintore Fanfani]] (who also liked to be Premier). His chief regret, said Scelba, was that he had been overthrown not by a parliamentary vote but by party manoeuvring.&lt;ref name=A040755/&gt;

In social policy, a law was passed in August 1954 that introduced an investment plan for the public construction of economic housing.&lt;ref&gt;Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Parliament==
After Scelba's fall, a political rival from the party's left wing, [[Antonio Segni]], put together the first of Italy's many centre-left coalitions. Although he remained a member of the Italian parliament, Scelba's moderate right wing of the party never had the strength to command another government.&lt;ref name=nyt311091/&gt; In 1958, Scelba formed his own ''corrente'' or faction within the [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian Democratic Party]], the ''Centrismo popolare'', made up by conservative politicians such [[Guido Gonella]], [[Roberto Lucifredi]], [[Mario Martinelli]] and [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]. Scelba absolved the faction in 1968. In 1960–2 he again served as Minister of the Interior in the government of [[Amintore Fanfani]].

Scelba was elected in the [[Italian Constituent Assembly]] in 1946 and was a member of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] from 1948–68. He was elected as a [[Italian Senate|Senator]] in 1968 and served until 1979 when he resigned. He was a fervent supporter of [[European Unity]] and was a member of the [[European Parliament]] from 1960–79, and was its [[President of the European Parliament|president]] from 1969 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.degasperi.net/scheda_fonti.php?id_obj=2892 Mario Scelba] Alcide De Gasperi nella storia d'Europa, Istituto Luigi Sturzo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 29, 1991, Scelba died of [[thrombosis]] at age of 90 at his home in Rome.&lt;ref name=nyt311091/&gt;

'''Metanoia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μετάνοια}}, ''metanoia'', "changing one's mind") has been used in psychology since at least the time of American thinker [[William James]] to describe a process of fundamental change in the human personality.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] words μετά ([[Meta|''metá'']]) (meaning "beyond" or "after") and  νόος ([[Nous|''noeō'']]) (meaning "perception" or "understanding" or "mind"), and takes on different meanings in different contexts.

==Developments==
William James used the term metanoia to refer to a fundamental and stable change in an individual's life-orientation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Carl Gustav Jung]] developed the usage to indicate a spontaneous attempt of the psyche to heal itself of unbearable conflict by melting down and then being reborn in a more adaptive form – a form of self healing often associated with the [[mid-life crisis]] and psychotic breakdown, which can be viewed as a potentially productive process.&lt;ref&gt;R. Arp. ''1001 Ideas That Changed the Way We Think'' (2013) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered that psychotic episodes in particular could be understood as an [[existential crisis]] which might be an attempt at self-reparation: in such instances metanoia could represent a shift in the balance of the personality away from the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] towards the [[Shadow (Jung)|shadow]] and the self.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's concept of metanoia influenced [[R. D. Laing]] and his emphasis on the dissolution and replacement of everyday ego consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Leeming et al, ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (2010) p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; Laing's colleague, [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]], considered that "metanoia means change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance" – a process that in the second of its three stages "generates the 'signs' of depression and mourning".&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (1974) p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly influenced was the [[therapeutic community]] movement. Ideally, it aimed to support people whilst they broke down and went through spontaneous healing, rather than thwarting such efforts at self-repair by strengthening a person's existing character defences and thereby maintaining the underlying conflict.

In [[transactional analysis]], metanoia is used to describe the experience of abandoning an old scripted self or [[false self]] for a more open one: a process which may be marked by a mixture of intensity, despair, self-surrender, and an encounter with the inner void.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 63-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miracles from Heaven''''' is a 2016 American [[Christian film industry|Christian]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Patricia Riggen]] and written by Randy Brown. It is based on ''[[Miracles from Heaven]]'' by Christy Beam, which recounts the true story of her young daughter who had a near-death experience and was later cured of an incurable disease. The film stars [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Kylie Rogers]], [[Martin Henderson]], [[John Carroll Lynch]], [[Eugenio Derbez]], and [[Queen Latifah]]. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in July 2015. The film was released on March 16, 2016. The movie was financially successful, and although critical reception was mixed, Garner's performance earned general praise.

== Plot ==
Set in [[Burleson, Texas|Burleson]], [[Texas]], between 2008 and 2012, the film centers on a 10-year-old girl named Annabel Beam, daughter of Christy Beam. One day, Anna starts to vomit, and when examined by her doctor, he does not find anything abnormal. On March 20, 2008, Anna wakes up her family at midnight because of an intense stomach pain, severe enough that her parents decide to take her to the hospital.  Doctors find no signs of illness, except to say it could be either [[acid reflux]], or [[lactose intolerance]], but Christy is not convinced by this. The following morning, Christy finally finds a pediatrician in the hospital that is able to diagnose Anna with an abdominal obstruction, and he tells them he must operate immediately or she will die. After the emergency surgery is performed, the doctor explains that Anna has been left with [[Intestinal pseudoobstruction|pseudo-obstruction motility disorder]] and she is unable to eat, so feeding tubes are needed for her nutrition. The doctor then tells the Beams about America's foremost pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Nurko, who practices in Boston, but explains it could take months for them to be seen. In January 2009, Christy and Anna travel to [[Boston]] despite not having an appointment with the doctor.

Dr. Nurko has a last minute opening, and when Anna is subsequently examined at [[Boston Children's Hospital]], the extent of her chronic illness is found. She then goes through extensive treatment. During this ordeal, Anna and her mother befriend a local Massachusetts resident named Angela, as well as Ben and his sick daughter, Haley.

On December 29, 2011, Anna, along with her bigger sister Abbie, climb up to a very high branch of an old cotton tree. While they are on that branch, it begins to break. Anna goes to the trunk for safety, whereupon stepping on it, she falls in a hole to the base of the tree. When Christy finds out what has happened, she desperately calls her husband, as well as the fire department. Anna is then rescued by the firefighters, who warn Christy to expect the worst by saying that nobody could fall 30 feet without sustaining a serious injury; broken bones or paralysis. Once out, Anna is airlifted to a hospital, where a battery of tests are run on her, and all of the tests come back negative. Other than a minor concussion, Anna is uninjured.
.
.
.
Sometime after the fall, Anna seems to no longer be affected by her illness. When Christy and Anna go to an appointment with Dr. Nurko, he tells Christy that Anna is miraculously cured. Anna then recounts with her parents the experience she had during the fall. She describes how her soul left her body during the fall, and God promised that she would be cured of her illness upon her return to Earth. At church, Christy shares the story of how God miraculously healed her daughter with His love. As Christy finishes her speech, one of the congregation protests, stating that she does not believe Christy. Ben, who has traveled from Boston upon hearing the story about Anna, believes her and tells her that his daughter Haley died peacefully because Anna gave her faith when in the hospital.

Money is historically an [[Emergence#Money|emergent market phenomenon]] establishing a [[commodity money]], but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on [[fiat money]].&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt; Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without [[use value]] as a physical commodity. It derives its value by being declared by a government to be [[legal tender]]; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Etymology of Money |url=http://www.thewallstreetpsychologist.com/recent_posts/the-etymology-of-money/ |website=Thewallstreetpsychologist.com |accessdate=24 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403151319/http://www.thewallstreetpsychologist.com/recent_posts/the-etymology-of-money/ |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Counterfeit money]] can cause [[good money]] to lose its value.

The [[money supply]] of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of [[bank money]] (the balances held in [[transactional account|checking accounts]], [[savings account]]s, and other types of [[bank accounts]]). Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of [[broad money]] in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boyle |first1=David |authorlink1=David Boyle (author) |title=The Little Money Book |publisher=The Disinformation Company |year=2006 |page=37 |isbn=978-1-932857-26-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Money |url=http://zzaponline.com/history-of-money/ |website=Zzaponline.com |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Peter, ''A Primer on Money and Banking, and Gold'', Wiley, 2008 edition, pp. 29–39&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "money" is believed to originate from a temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], on [[Capitoline]], one of Rome's seven hills.  In the ancient world Juno was often associated with money. The temple of [[Juno Moneta]] at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located.&lt;ref&gt;D'Eprio, Peter &amp; Pinkowish, Mary Desmond (1998). ''What Are the Seven Wonders of the World?'' First Anchor Books, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-385-49062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Juno" may derive from the Etruscan goddess [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).

In the Western world, a prevalent term for coin-money has been ''[[wikt:specie|specie]]'', stemming from Latin ''in specie'', meaning 'in kind'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=specie&amp;searchmode=phrase |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=etymonline.com |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of money}}
[[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|A 640 BC one-third [[stater]] [[electrum]] coin from [[Lydia#First coinage|Lydia]]]]

The use of [[barter]]-like methods may date back to at least 100,000 years ago, though there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]]. ''The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies''. pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of [[gift economy]] and [[debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/08/what-is-debt-%E2%80%93-an-interview-with-economic-anthropologist-david-graeber.html |title=What is Debt? – An Interview with Economic Anthropologist David Graeber |publisher=[[Naked Capitalism]]|date=2011-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Graeber: ''Debt: The First 5000 Years'', Melville 2011.

Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of [[commodity money]]. The Mesopotamian [[shekel]] was a unit of weight, and relied on the mass of something like 160 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] of [[barley]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'', pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage of the term came from [[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC.  Societies in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used [[shell money]] – often, the shells of the [[cowry]] (''Cypraea moneta L.'' or ''C. annulus L.''). According to [[Herodotus]], the [[Lydians]] were the first people to introduce the use of [[gold coin|gold]] and [[silver coin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought by modern scholars that these first stamped [[coins]] were minted around 650–600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html |author=Goldsborough, Reid |title=World's First Coin |publisher=rg.ancients.info |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jiao zi.jpg|thumb|upright|Song Dynasty ''Jiaozi'', the world's earliest paper money]]

The system of [[commodity money]] eventually evolved into a system of [[representative money]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This occurred because gold and silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors – redeemable for the [[commodity money]] deposited. Eventually, these receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used as money. Paper money or [[banknotes]] were first used in China during the [[Song dynasty]]. These banknotes, known as "[[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]]", evolved from [[promissory notes]] that had been used since the 7th century. However, they did not displace commodity money, and were used alongside coins. In the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[William of Rubruck]]&lt;!-- Giljom de Rubruk --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moshenskyi |first=Sergii |title=History of the weksel: Bill of exchange and promissory note |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4363-0694-2 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Polo's account of paper money during the [[Yuan dynasty]] is the subject of a chapter of his book, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'', titled "[[s:The Travels of Marco Polo/Book 2/Chapter 24|How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country]]."&lt;ref name="Marco Polo"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marco Polo |title=The Travels of Marco Polo, a Venetian, in the Thirteenth Century: Being a Description, by that Early Traveller, of Remarkable Places and Things, in the Eastern Parts of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JetQAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |accessdate=19 September 2012 |year=1818 |pages=353–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banknotes were first issued in Europe by [[Stockholms Banco]] in 1661, and were again also used alongside coins. The [[gold standard]], a [[monetary system]] where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the 17th–19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made [[legal tender]], and redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.

After [[World War II]] and the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]. The U.S. dollar was in turn fixed to gold. In 1971 the U.S. government suspended the convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold. After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments' fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods via payment. According to proponents of [[Modern Money Theory|modern money theory]], fiat money is also backed by taxes. By imposing taxes, states create demand for the currency they issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wray |first1=L. Randall |title=Modern money theory: a primer on macroeconomics for sovereign monetary systems |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire |isbn=978-0230368897 |pages=45–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
{{also|monetary economics}}
{{Economics sidebar}}
In ''Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875)'', [[William Stanley Jevons]] famously analyzed money in terms of four functions: a ''[[medium of exchange]]'', a ''common measure of value'' (or [[unit of account]]), a ''standard of value'' (or [[standard of deferred payment]]), and a ''[[store of value]]''. By 1919, Jevons's four functions of money were summarized in the [[couplet]]:
:Money's a matter of functions four,
:A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.&lt;ref name="a_milnes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Milnes |first=Alfred |title=The economic foundations of reconstruction |publisher=Macdonald and Evans |year=1919 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics textbooks.&lt;ref name="dwivedi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dwivedi |first=DN |title=Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |year=2005 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern textbooks now list only three functions, that of [[medium of exchange]], [[unit of account]], and [[store of value]], not considering a standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the others.&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;Krugman, Paul &amp; Wells, Robin, ''Economics'', Worth Publishers, New York (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abel_bernanke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th |pages=266–269 |chapter=7 |isbn=978-0-201-32789-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a [[medium of exchange]] is in conflict with its role as a [[store of value]]: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate.&lt;ref name="greco" /&gt;  Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time. The term "financial capital" is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniformly recognized tender.

=== Medium of exchange ===
{{Main|Medium of exchange}}

When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a ''medium of exchange''. It thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the "[[coincidence of wants]]" problem.  Money's most important usage is as a method for comparing the values of dissimilar objects.

=== Measure of value ===
{{Main|Unit of account}}

A ''unit of account'' (in economics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boundless.com/business/textbooks/boundless-business-textbook/the-functions-of-money-and-banking-21/money-as-a-tool-123/functions-of-money-568-3194/ |title=Functions of Money |website=[[Boundless (company)|boundless.com]]|date=2017-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard numerical monetary unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a "measure" or "standard" of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt.

Money acts as a standard measure and common denomination of trade. It is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices. It is necessary for developing efficient accounting systems.

=== Standard of deferred payment ===
{{Main|Standard of deferred payment}}
While ''standard of deferred payment'' is distinguished by some texts,&lt;ref name="greco" /&gt; particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other functions.&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krugman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abel_bernanke"/&gt; A "standard of deferred payment" is an accepted way to settle a [[debt]] – a unit in which debts are denominated, and the status of money as [[legal tender]], in those jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real value of debts may change due to inflation and [[deflation]], and for sovereign and international debts via [[debasement]] and [[devaluation]].

=== Store of value ===
{{Main|Store of value}}
To act as a ''store of value'', a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value.&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt;

==Properties==
To fulfill its various functions, money must have certain properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Desjardins |first1=Jeff |title=Infographic: The Properties of Money |url=http://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/ |publisher=The Money Project |accessdate=18 July 2017 |date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fungibility]]: its individual units must be capable of mutual substitution (i.e., interchangeability).
* [[Durability]]: able to withstand repeated use.
* Portability: easily carried and transported.
* Cognizability: its value must be easily identified.
* Stability of value: its value should not fluctuate.

== Money supply ==
{{Main|Money supply}}
[[File:MB, M1 and M2 aggregates from 1981 to 2012.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Money Base, M1 and M2 in the U.S. from 1981 to 2012]]
[[File:RIAN archive 978776 Printing paper money at Goznak factory in Perm.jpg|thumb|right|Printing paper money at a printing press in [[Perm]]]]
In economics, money is a broad term that refers to any [[Instrument (finance)|financial instrument]] that can fulfil the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively referred to as the [[money supply]] of an economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments (usually currency, demand deposits and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a ''monetary aggregate''.

[[Modern monetary theory]] distinguishes among different ways to measure the stock of money or money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system that focuses on the [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus [[demand deposit]]s (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus [[savings account]]s and [[time deposit]]s under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2 etc. may be different in different countries.

Another measure of money, M0, is also used; unlike the other measures, it does not represent actual [[purchasing power]] by firms and households in the economy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} M0 is [[base money]], or the amount of money actually issued by the [[central bank]] of a country. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the [[reserve requirements]] of [[commercial banks]].

=== Creation of money ===
In current economic systems, money is created by two procedures:

'''Legal tender''', or '''narrow money''' (M0) is the cash money created by a Central Bank by minting coins and printing banknotes.

'''Bank money''', or '''broad money''' (M1/M2) is the money created by private banks through the recording of loans as deposits of borrowing clients, with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, bank money is created as electronic money.

In most countries, the majority of money is mostly created as M1/M2 by commercial banks making loans. Contrary to some popular misconceptions, banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and do not depend on central bank money (M0) to create new loans and deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy|title=Money creation in the modern economy {{!}} Bank of England|website=www.bankofengland.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market liquidity ===
{{Main|Market liquidity}}
"Market liquidity" describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognised and accepted as the common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the [[liberty|freedom]] to trade goods and services easily without having to barter.

Liquid financial instruments are easily [[tradable]] and have low [[transaction cost]]s. There should be no (or minimal) [[Bid/offer spread|spread]] between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.

== Types ==
Currently, most modern monetary systems are based on fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was commodity money, such as gold and silver coins. As economies developed, commodity money was eventually replaced by [[representative money]], such as the [[gold standard]], as traders found the physical transportation of gold and silver burdensome. Fiat currencies gradually took over in the last hundred years, especially since the breakup of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in the early 1970s.

=== Commodity ===
{{Main|Commodity money}}
[[File:1914 Sydney Half Sovereign - St. George.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1914 British [[Sovereign (British coin)|gold sovereign]]]]
Many items have been used as [[commodity money]] such as naturally scarce [[precious metal]]s, [[conch shell]]s, [[barley]], beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having [[Intrinsic theory of value|value]]. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;Mises, Ludwig von. ''[[The Theory of Money and Credit]]'', (Indianapolis, IN: [[Liberty Fund, Inc.]], 1981), trans. H. E. Batson. Ch.3 Part One: The Nature of Money, Chapter 3: The Various Kinds of Money, Section 3: Commodity Money, Credit Money, and Fiat Money, Paragraph 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, [[Wampum]], salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or [[price system]] economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic [[unit of account]] for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some [[gold coins]] such as the [[Krugerrand]] are considered [[legal tender]], there is no record of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their [[Millesimal fineness|fine gold]] content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randrefinery.com/products_krugerrands.htm randRefinery.com]. Retrieved July-18-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[American Gold Eagle|American Eagles]] are imprinted with their gold content and legal tender [[face value]].&lt;ref name="usmint.gov"/&gt;

=== Representative ===
{{Main|Representative money}}
In 1875, the British economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] described the money used at the time as "[[representative money]]". Representative money is money that consists of [[token coin]]s, [[paper money]] or other physical tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed quantity of a commodity such as gold or silver. The value of representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.&lt;ref name="Jevons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=Money and the Mechanism of Exchange |year=1875 |chapter=XVI: Representative Money |chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=318&amp;chapter=9990&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |accessdate=2009-06-28 |isbn=978-1-59605-260-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2006 AEGold Proof Rev.png|thumb|upright|Gold coins are an example of legal tender that are traded for their intrinsic value, rather than their face value.]]
Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]] in the U.S.) to be [[legal tender]], making it unlawful not to accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.&lt;ref name="www-personal.umich"&gt;{{cite web |author=Deardorff, Prof. Alan V. |year=2008 |title=Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/f.html |publisher=Department of Economics, University of Michigan |accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackHenry"&gt;Black, Henry Campbell (1910).

Some [[bullion coins]] such as the [[Australian Gold Nugget]] and [[American Gold Eagle|American Eagle]] are legal tender, however, they trade based on the [[market price]] of the metal content as a [[commodity]], rather than their legal tender [[face value]] (which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion value).&lt;ref name="usmint.gov"&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/american_eagles/index.cfm?flash=no&amp;action=American_Eagle_Gold usmiNT.gov].

Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins) can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the same laws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated [[Federal Reserve Note]]s (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091018013943/http://www.bep.treas.gov/section.cfm/8/39 Shredded &amp; Mutilated: Mutilated Currency], ''Bureau of Engraving and Printing''. Retrieved 2007-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, commodity money which has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.

=== Coinage ===
{{main|Coin}}
These factors led to the shift of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, and at one point there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new [[unit of account]], which helped lead to banking. [[Archimedes' principle]] provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their [[Fineness|fine]] weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see [[Numismatics]]).

In most major economies using coinage, copper, silver and gold formed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the military and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of account for taxes, dues, contracts and fealty, while copper coins represented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient [[Indian coinage|India]] since the time of the [[Mahajanapadas]]. In Europe, this system worked through the [[medieval]] period because there was virtually no new gold, silver or copper introduced through mining or conquest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.

=== Paper ===
{{main|Banknote}}
[[File:Hui zi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Huizi (currency)|Huizi currency]], issued in 1160]]
In [[History of China|premodern]] China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led to the introduction of [[banknote|paper money]], commonly known today as [[banknote]]s. This economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) into the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for [[receipt]]s of deposit issued as [[promissory note]]s from shops of wholesalers, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the [[Song dynasty]] government began circulating these notes amongst the traders in their [[monopoly|monopolized]] salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; it was not until the mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of [[woodblock printing]] and then [[Pi Sheng]]'s [[movable type]] printing by the 11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern China.

At around the same time in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], a vigorous [[monetary economy]] was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the [[dinar]]). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of [[Credit (finance)|credit]],&lt;ref name=Banaji&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banaji |first=Jairus |year=2007 |title=Islam, the Mediterranean and the Rise of Capitalism |journal=Historical Materialism |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=47–74 |issn=1465-4466 |doi=10.1163/156920607X171591 |bibcode= |oclc=440360743 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14246569/Banaji-Jairus-Islam-The-Mediterranean-and-the-Rise-of-Capitalism |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523015524/http://www.scribd.com/doc/14246569/Banaji-Jairus-Islam-The-Mediterranean-and-the-Rise-of-Capitalism |archivedate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cheque]]s, [[promissory note]]s,&lt;ref name="Medieval Trade in the Mediterranean World: Illustrative Documents"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lopez |first1=Robert Sabatino |authorlink1=Roberto Sabatino Lopez |last2=Raymond |first2=Irving Woodworth |last3=Constable |first3=Olivia Remie |title=Medieval trade in the Mediterranean world: Illustrative documents |series=Records of Western civilization.; Records of civilization, sources and studies, no. 52 |year=2001 |origyear=1955 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |url=http://cup.columbia.edu/bookpreview/978-0-231-12356-3/ |isbn=978-0-231-12357-0 |oclc=466877309 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309144011/http://cup.columbia.edu/bookpreview/978-0-231-12356-3/ |archivedate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[savings account]]s, [[transactional account]]s, loaning, [[trusts]], [[exchange rate]]s, the transfer of credit and [[debt]],&lt;ref name=Labib&gt;{{cite journal |last=Labib |first=Subhi Y. |date=March 1969 |title=Capitalism in Medieval Islam |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–86 |issn=0022-0507 |oclc=478662641 |jstor=2115499}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[banking institution]]s for loans and [[deposit account|deposits]].&lt;ref name=Labib /&gt;

In Europe, paper money was first introduced in [[Sweden]] in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made. The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the risks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier, since the specie (gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of [[stock]] in [[joint stock company|joint stock companies]], and the redemption of those [[shares]] in paper.

However, these advantages held within them disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by [[David Hume]] in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a [[standing army]]. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established [[mint (coin)|mints]] to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.

At this time both silver and gold were considered [[legal tender]], and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the [[Gresham's law|instability in the ratio]] between the two grew over the course of the 19th century, with the increase both in supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called [[bimetallism]] and the attempt to create a [[Bimetallism|bimetallic]] standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of inflationists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States [[United States Note|Greenback]], to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.

[[File:Billets de 5000.jpg|thumb|upright|Banknotes with a face value of 5000 of different currencies]]
By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private banks and governments across the world followed [[Gresham's Law]]: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the [[gold standard]] was the United States in 1971.

No country anywhere in the world today has an enforceable [[gold standard]] or [[silver standard]] currency system.

=== Commercial bank ===
{{Main|Demand deposit}}
[[File:Sweet success.jpg|thumb|right|A check, used as a means of converting funds in a [[demand deposit]] to cash]]
Commercial bank money or [[demand deposit]]s are claims against financial institutions that can be used for the purchase of goods and services. A demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn at any time by check or [[cash]] withdrawal without giving the bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the legal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using [[automatic teller machine]]s (ATMs), or through [[online banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M.

Commercial bank money is created through [[fractional-reserve banking]], the banking practice where banks keep only a ''fraction'' of their [[demand deposit|deposits]] in [[bank reserves|reserve]] (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bank Credit Analysis Handbook: A Guide for Analysts, Bankers and Investors'' by Jonathan Golin. Publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons (August 10, 2001). {{ISBN|0-471-84217-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-471-84217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankintroductions.com/definition.html |title=bankintroductions.com – Economic Definitions |publisher= |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent. The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of [[money creation]] by commercial banks, as it expands [[money supply]] (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be.  Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the [[M2 (economics)|broad money supply]] of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of [[Monetary base|base money]] created by the country's [[central bank]]. That multiple (called the [[money multiplier]]) is determined by the [[reserve requirement]] or other [[financial ratio]] requirements imposed by financial regulators.

The money supply of a country is usually held to be the total amount of currency in circulation plus the total value of checking and savings deposits in the commercial banks in the country. In modern economies, relatively little of the money supply is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in broad money supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/20110127/|title=FRB: H.6 Release – Money Stock and Debt Measures|date=January 27, 2011|website=www.federalreserve.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital or electronic===
{{Main|Digital money}}
The development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990, in the United States all money transferred between its central bank and commercial banks was in electronic form.  By the 2000s most money existed as [[digital currency]] in banks databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm|title=How Currency Works|date=2 September 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic (dependant on country).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150724-the-truth-about-the-death-of-cash|title=The truth about the death of cash|first=Rose|last=Eveleth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-national digital currencies where developed in the early 2000s. In particular [[Flooz]] and [[Beenz]], had gained momentum before the [[Dot-com bubble]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Not much innovation occurred until the conception of [[Bitcoin]] in 2009, which introduced the concept of a [[cryptocurrency]] – a decentralised trustless currency.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Monetary policy ==
{{Main|Monetary policy}}
[[File:USCurrency Federal Reserve.jpg|210px|thumbnail|US dollar banknotes]]
When gold and silver are used as money, the money supply can grow only if the supply of these metals is increased by mining. This rate of increase will accelerate during periods of [[gold rush]]es and discoveries, such as when Columbus discovered the [[New World]] and brought back gold and silver to Spain, or when gold was [[California Gold Rush|discovered in California in 1848]]. This causes inflation, as the value of gold goes down. However, if the rate of [[gold mining]] cannot keep up with the growth of the economy, gold becomes relatively more valuable, and prices (denominated in gold) will drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the more typical situation for over a century when gold and paper money backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Modern day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer tied to the value of gold. The control of the amount of money in the economy is known as monetary policy. Monetary policy is the process by which a government, central bank, or [[monetary authority]] manages the [[money supply]] to achieve specific goals. Usually the goal of monetary policy is to accommodate economic growth in an environment of stable prices. For example, it is clearly stated in the [[Federal Reserve Act]] that the [[Board of Governors]] and the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] should seek "to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Reserve. [http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_2.pdf 'Monetary Policy and the Economy".] ([[PDF]]) ''Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System'', (2005-07-05). Retrieved 2007-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an economy and the society that depends on it. These include [[hyperinflation]], [[stagflation]], [[recession]], high unemployment, shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption of a much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]].

Governments and central banks have taken both regulatory and [[free market]] approaches to monetary policy. Some of the tools used to control the money supply include:
* changing the [[interest rate]] at which the central bank loans money to (or borrows money from) the commercial banks
* currency purchases or sales
* increasing or lowering [[Government debt|government borrowing]]
* increasing or lowering [[government spending]]
* manipulation of [[exchange rate]]s
* raising or lowering bank reserve requirements
* regulation or prohibition of [[Private currency|private currencies]]
* taxation or tax breaks on imports or exports of capital into a country

In the US, the [[Federal Reserve]] is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the [[Euro area]] the respective institution is the [[European Central Bank]]. Other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the [[Bank of Japan]], [[People's Bank of China]] and the [[Bank of England]].

For many years much of monetary policy was influenced by an [[Economics|economic theory]] known as monetarism. [[Monetarism]] is an economic theory which argues that management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s was a key finding of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Milton Friedman |author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz |title=Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=978-0-691-00354-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the work of [[David Laidler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Laidler |title=Money and Macroeconomics: The Selected Essays of David Laidler (Economists of the Twentieth Century) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=978-1-85898-596-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. The nature of the demand for money changed during the 1980s owing to technical, institutional, and legal factors{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} and the influence of monetarism has since decreased.

== Counterfeit ==
{{Main|Counterfeit money}}
Counterfeit money is imitation currency produced without the legal sanction of the state or government. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as money itself. Plated copies (known as [[Fourrée]]s) have been found of [[Lydia#First coinage|Lydian coins]] which are thought to be among the first western coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Case for the World's Oldest Coin |url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the introduction of [[Banknotes|paper money]], the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver. A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During [[World War II]], the [[Nazis]] forged British pounds and American dollars. Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called ''[[Superdollar]]s'' because of their high quality and likeness to the real U.S. dollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of [[Euro]] banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than for the U.S. dollar.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itsamoneything.com/money/counterfeiting-cash-money-infographic/#.VB71g5R_uJQ |title=Counterfeiting statistics for several currencies |publisher=Itsamoneything.com |accessdate=2014-09-21|date=2012-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laundering ==
{{Main|Money laundering}}
Money laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets.&lt;ref name="Duhaimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime, Christine. |title=What is Money Laundering?

In spiritual terminology, '''piety''' is a [[virtue]] that may include [[religion|religious devotion]], [[spirituality]], or a mixture of both. A common element in most conceptions of piety is [[humility]].

== Etymology ==
The word piety comes from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Pietas (virtue)|pietas]]'', the noun form of the adjective ''pius'' (which means "devout" or "dutiful"). 

==Classical interpretation==
''Pietas'' in traditional Latin usage expressed a complex, highly valued [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] virtue; a man with ''pietas'' respected his responsibilities to gods, country, parents, and kin.&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero, ''Nature of the Gods'', 1. 116 and ''On Rhetorical Invention'', 2. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In its strictest sense it was the sort of love a son ought to have for his father. [[Aeneas]]'s consistent epithet in [[Virgil]] and other Latin authors is ''pius'', a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness. At the fall of Troy, Aeneas carries to safety his father, the lame [[Anchises]], and the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods.

In addressing whether children have an obligation to provide support for their parents, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] quotes, [[Cicero]], "..."piety gives both duty and homage": "duty" referring to service, and "homage" to reverence or honor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3101.htm Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', "Question 101. Piety", Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filial piety]] is central to Confucian [[role ethics|ethics]].&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a virtue==
In [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Anglicanism]], piety is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. "It engenders in the soul a filial respect for God, a generous love toward him, and an affectionate obedience that wants to do what he commands because it loves the one who commands."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=33735 "Gift of Piety", Catholic Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Piety belongs to the virtue of Religion, which the concordant judgment of theologians put among the moral virtues, as a part of the [[Cardinal virtues|cardinal virtue]] Justice, since by it one tenders to God what is due to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm  Delany, Joseph.

[[Pope Francis]] described piety as recognizing “our belonging to God, our deep bond with him, a relationship that gives meaning to our whole life and keeps us resolute, in communion with him, even during the most difficult and troubled moments” in life.

'''Princess Frederica Louise Wilhelmina Marianne ''Charlotte'' of Prussia''' (21 June 1831 &amp;ndash; 30 March 1855), was by birth a Princess of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and by marriage Hereditary Princess of Saxe-Meiningen.

She was the eldest child and daughter of [[Prince Albert of Prussia (1809–1872)|Prince Albert of Prussia]] (younger son of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]) and his first wife [[Princess Marianne of the Netherlands]] (daughter of [[William I of the Netherlands]] and [[Wilhelmine of Prussia (1774–1837)|Wilhelmine of Prussia]]).{{sfn|Ebel|1913}}

==Life==

===Family and early years===
[[Image:CharlotteenAlexandrinevanPruisen.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Charlotte (left) and her younger sister [[Princess Alexandrine of Prussia (1842-1906)|Alexandrine]], ca. 1853.]]
Her parents' marriage was unhappy due to Prince Albert's several affairs, and finally was dissolved on 28 March 1849, after which Princess Marianne began to live with her former coachman Johannes van Rossum, with whom she had a son, Johannes William of Reinhartshausen.

The custody of Charlotte and her two surviving siblings [[Prince Albert of Prussia (1837–1906)|Albert]] and [[Princess Alexandrine of Prussia (1842–1906)|Alexandrine]] was given to their father; however, their childless aunt [[Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria|Queen Elisabeth Ludovika]] (wife of [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]]) took care of them, moreover after Prince Albert's second and morganatic marriage in 1853 with [[Rosalie von Rauch]], who bore him two sons, Counts William and Frederick of Hohenau.

===Marriage===
As a young woman, Charlotte was highly eligible, due to her Dutch fortune and Hohenzollern connections. In [[Charlottenburg]] on 18 May 1850, the nineteen-year-old princess married [[Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen|Georg, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen]] who was twenty-four years old.{{sfn|Koller|1984|p=50}}{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=279}} The only son of [[Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]] and [[Princess Marie Frederica of Hesse-Kassel|Princess Marie of Hesse-Kassel]], he had led a battalion from Meiningen in support of the Prussians in the [[First Schleswig War]] in 1849.{{sfn|Osborne|1988|p=15}} After resuming his military career in Berlin, Georg soon became engaged to Charlotte, whose position as a niece of [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] surely recommended her to him. It was a love match and their marriage occurred after a short engagement.{{sfn|Koller|1984|p=50}}{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=279}} Among the wedding gifts was an opulent old villa on Lake Como from her mother Marianne, as well as a substantial collection of paintings and sculptures.{{sfn|Koller|1984|p=50}}{{sfn|Osborne|1988|p=15}} It was renamed the [[Villa Carlotta]] in the bride's honour. Due to their Prussian connections, the couple spent the next five years in Berlin and Potsdam but returned to Meiningen for the birth of their children.{{sfn|Koller|1984|p=50}}

The two shared many interests, particularly with the theater, as they were both ardent attendees; during their engagement, they had even acted in amateur court theatricals together.{{sfn|Koller|1984|p=50}} They had four children.{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=279}} Charlotte had a talent for music, and was taught by the likes of [[Wilhelm Taubert]], [[Theodor Kullak]], and [[Julius Stern]] in her youth. She wrote a number of military marches, songs, and piano pieces.{{sfn|Ebel|1913}} Her daughter, [[Princess Marie Elisabeth of Saxe-Meiningen|Princess Marie Elisabeth]], would inherit these interests.

===Death===
On 27 January 1855, their second son Georg died. Charlotte followed him three months later, dying of childbirth complications on 30 March at the age of twenty-three. Georg was inconsolable, but would eventually remarry to [[Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]] in order to provide a mother to his remaining children.{{sfn|Koller|1984|p=51}}{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=279}}{{sfn|Lodge|1890|p=59}} He succeeded his father as Duke of Saxe-Meiningen in 1866, ten years after Charlotte's death.{{sfn|Koller|1984|p=54}}

===Issue===
[[File:Charlotte of Prussia, hereditary princess of Saxe-Meiningen, with her children.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Charlotte, Hereditary Princess of Saxe-Meiningen and her three children.]]
They had four children:
* [[Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]] (1 April 1851 - 16 January 1928); married [[Princess Charlotte of Prussia]] and had issue.
* Prince Georg Albrecht (12 April 1852 - 27 January 1855); died in infancy.
* [[Princess Marie Elisabeth of Saxe-Meiningen|Princess Marie Elisabeth]] (23 September 1853 - 22 February 1923); died unmarried.
* An unnamed son (29 March 1855 - 30 March 1855).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3070">'''Ralph Acton''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 14th century), was a supposed English [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]], apparently primarily known for his writings, some of which still exist. More recent enquiries suggest that Acton may have been a scribe or, indeed, non-existent.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{harvnb|Catto|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
According to the 1885 [[Dictionary of National Biography]], Ralph Acton is assigned by [[John Leland (antiquary)|Leland]] and his followers to the first half of the fourteenth century. Of the details of his life nothing definite is known, for the sketch given by [[John Bale|Bale]] and [[John Pitts (Catholic scholar)|Pitts]] is so vague as to suggest that it is chiefly made up of inferences. According to these writers Ralph received his early education in country schools, whence in due time he proceeded to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. After taking his master's degree in philosophy and theology at this university he was appointed head of a famous church (‘rector cujusdam insignis ecclesiæ’), and henceforward devoted himself in the retirement of his parish to the study of the Scriptures and the care of his flock.{{sfn|Archer|1885|pp=85,86}}

His writings apparently consist of ''Homiliæ in quatuor Evangelia'', ''Commentarii in Epistolas Paulinas'', ''Illustrationes in Petrum Langobardum'', and other works of a similar kind. Two manuscripts of this author are still preserved in the library of [[Lincoln College, Oxford]]-—the one written in an early fifteenth-century hand; the other the gift of Robert Fleming, a near kinsman of [[Richard Fleming]], the founder of this college (1427). We thus get a date later than which our author cannot have flourished; and Leland, Bale, and Pits conjecturally assign him to the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] (1320). Other manuscripts of Acton's works are said by Tanner to be in the [[Bodleian Library]] and that of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]].{{sfn|Archer|1885|p=86}}

==Literary ghost==
More recent study, summarised in Acton's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry suggest that Bale misidentified the author of a number of works, which are in fact by [[Radulfus Ardens]], attributing them mistakenly to a Ralph Acton, who may have been a scribe or book name, rather than an author.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

The Morgan name comes from the RepRap convention of naming printers after famous deceased biologists.  The Morgan printers was named after [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]].  He worked on the genome of the common fruitfly with his wife, [[Lilian Vaughan Morgan]].  Their names were used in the development codenames for the first two generations of Morgan 3D Printers.

Morgan printers are now manufactured full-time by the inventor in a small workshop factory in the House4Hack makerspace.

'''Schering AG''' was a research-centered [[Germany|German]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company]] headquartered in [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Berlin]], which operated as an independent company from 1851 to 2006. In 2006 it was bought by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] and merged to form the Bayer subsidiary [[Bayer Schering Pharma|Bayer Schering Pharma AG]], which was renamed [[Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals]] in 2011. Schering was listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] and had 26,000 employees as of 2004.

The American pharmaceutical company [[Schering-Plough]], formerly the Schering Corporation, was originally the US subsidiary of Schering AG, and merged with [[Merck &amp; Co.]] in 2009.

==History==
In 1851, [[Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering]] opened the ''Grüne Apotheke'' (Green Pharmacy) in [[Berlin]]'s ''Chausseestraße'', and in 1871 converted into the name ''Chemische Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering). This date is the company's date of incorporation.

The company grew strongly in the following years. In 1913, the company employed 935 workers, 112 [[Master craftsman#Germany|master craftsman]] and 180 office employees. In addition to the Berlin site, two factories were also located in Russia ([[Moscow]] and Wydriza) with over 1,000 workers and a plant in [[Great Britain]]. Turnover at the time was about 10 million [[German gold mark]], created with the production of photochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Important products produced were [[salicylic acid]], the antigout preparation [[Cinchophen|atophan]], various sleeping and disinfecting agents.

At the beginning of the 1920s, Schering took over the wash and colouring company {{ill|W. Spindler|de}} located in the Berlin district ''Köpenick''. In 1922, the management acquired the majority of shares in the chemical factory ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering) from the [[Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian]] {{ill|Oberschlesische Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken|de}}.

In 1937, the companies ''Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken AG'' and the ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' amalgamated with the sister company ''Schering-Kahlbaum AG'' and, on the same day, renamed on account of the internationally respected name ''Schering'' to ''Schering Aktiengesellschaft''. The pharmaceutical business thus became part of a mining and chemical group, which also produced [[Radiography|radiographic]] products and [[pesticide]] products.

Schering was the manufacturer of [[Primodos]].

=== Bayer takeover 2006 ===
In March 2006, [[Merck KGaA]] announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering, which by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion&lt;ref&gt;Schering AG press release. Feb 20, 2006 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2005-a-record-year-for-schering-ag-55363567.html 2005 a Record Year for Schering AG]&lt;/ref&gt; and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.&lt;ref name=KumarMergers/&gt; [[Bayer]] responded with a [[White knight (business)|white knight]] bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Eve Laforte for First Word Pharma. July 12th, 2006 [http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/144265 Bayer completes acquisition of Schering AG]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,&lt;ref name=KumarMergers&gt;B Rajesh Kumar. Mega Mergers and Acquisitions: Case Studies from Key Industries.

At the time of the merger, the company employed more than 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.  Schering's annual gross revenue was nearly €5 billion (2003).

Schering AG focused on the business areas of [[gynaecology]], [[andrology]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[oncology]], and [[Contrast medium|contrast agents]]. Schering's best-known products are probably its brands of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s. Other key products included the [[Interferon beta-1b|interferon-beta]] brand Betaferon (Betaseron in North America) and the paramagnetic contrast agent [[Gadopentetic acid|Magnevist]].

The largest German manufacturing facility was located in [[Bergkamen]].

A '''struggle session''' was a form of [[public humiliation]] and [[torture]] that was used by the [[Communist Party of China]] in the [[Mao era]], particularly during the [[Cultural Revolution]], to shape public opinion and humiliate, persecute, or execute political rivals and those deemed [[Class enemy|class enemies]].&lt;ref name="lipman-harrell"/&gt;

In general, the victim of a struggle session was forced to admit various crimes before a crowd of people who would verbally and physically abuse the victim until he or she confessed.  Struggle sessions were often held at the workplace of the accused, but they were sometimes conducted in sports stadiums where large crowds would gather if the target was well-known.&lt;ref name="lipman-harrell"&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology==

According to [[Lin Yutang]], the expression comes from "批判" ({{zh|p=pīpàn|l=to judge}}) and "鬥爭" ({{zh|p=dòuzhēng|l=to fight}}), so the whole expression conveys the message of ''inciting the spirit of judgment and fighting''. Instead of saying the full phrase "批判鬥爭" ({{zh|p=pīpàn dòuzhēng}}), it was shortened to "批鬥" ({{zh|p=pīdòu}}).

==Origins and purpose==

Struggle sessions developed from similar ideas of criticism and [[Self-criticism#Communist states|self-criticism]] in the [[Soviet Union]] from the 1920s. The term refers to [[class struggle]];  the session is held to "benefit" the target, by eliminating all traces of counterrevolutionary, reactionary thinking. Chinese communists resisted this at first, because struggle sessions conflicted with the Chinese concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|saving face]], but struggle sessions became commonplace at [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] meetings during the 1930s due to public popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Red Flag: A History of Communism|first=David|last=Priestland|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8021-1924-7|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounts==
Margaret Chu, writing retrospectively for the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation's ''Mindszenty Report'', in November 1998, said: 

{{quote|'…the [[Cultural Revolution]] began and I was transferred to another labor camp…  Two years after I had been in this new camp, I received a parcel from my family. Immediately, an inmate accused me of giving something out of it to another prisoner. I was dragged to the office. Without any investigation, the officer assembled the entire camp to start a struggle session against me. In the session the officer suddenly asked me whether I had committed my alleged original crime leading to my 8-year sentence. I was stunned. It then dawned on me that this session was in fact prearranged. The parcel was only a pretense. Their real motive was once again to force me to admit all my alleged crimes. "I did not commit any crimes," I asserted firmly. Immediately two people jumped on me and cut off half of my hair. The officer screamed again: "are you guilty?" I replied firmly again, "no." Two people then used a rope to tie my hands back tightly. It was connected to a loop around my shoulder and underneath my armpits. It was knotted in such a way that a slight movement of my hands would cause intense pain. This struggle session lasted for two hours. Afterwards, they untied me and handcuffed me instead. The handcuffs became a part of me for the next one hundred days and nights...'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindszenty.org/report/1998/nov98/mr_nov98.html |title=A Catholic Voice Out of Communist China - November 1998 Mindszenty Report |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2011-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313115857/http://www.mindszenty.org/report/1998/nov98/mr_nov98.html |archivedate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne F. Thurston, in ''Enemies of the People'', gave a description of an infamous struggle session for the professor You Xiaoli:

{{quote|'You Xiaoli was standing, precariously balanced, on a stool. Her body was bent over from the waist into a right angle, and her arms, elbows stiff and straight, were behind her back, one hand grasping the other at the wrist. It was the position known as "doing the airplane." Around her neck was a heavy chain, and attached to the chain was a blackboard, a real blackboard, one that had been removed from a classroom at the university where You Xiaoli, for more than ten years, had served as a full professor. On both sides of the blackboard were chalked her name and the myriad crimes she was alleged to have committed...'

The scene was taking place at the university, too, in a sports field at one of China's most prestigious institutions of higher learning. In the audience were You Xiaoli's students and colleagues and former friends. Workers from local factories and peasants from nearby communes had been bussed in for the spectacle. From the audience came repeated, rhythmic chants ... "down with You Xiaoli! Down with You Xiaoli!"

"I had many feelings at that struggle session," recalls You Xiaoli. "I thought there were some bad people in the audience. But I also thought there were many ignorant people, people who did not understand what was happening, so I pitied that kind of person. They brought workers and peasants into the meetings, and they could not understand what was happening. But I was also angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldandischool.com/public/1987/june/school-resource12592.asp |title= Enemies of the People |publisher= World and ischool |date= June 1987 |accessdate= 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lately, the term "struggle session" has come to be applied to any scene where victims are publicly badgered to confess imaginary crimes under the pretext of self-criticism and rehabilitation{{Citation needed |date= April 2010}}.

==Disuse after 1978==

Struggle sessions were disowned in China after 1978, when the reformers led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power. Deng Xiaoping prohibited struggle sessions and other kinds of Mao-era violent political campaigns.

In September 2013, [[Xi Jinping]] has taken his "criticism and self-criticism" campaign on the road, attending a series of meetings where Hebei provincial cadres were made to admit shortcomings and offer ideas for correcting their behaviour. Xi has instructed regional officials to "promote self-criticism and criticism" to implement his "mass line" campaign, which he said is necessary to eliminate formality, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance among rank-and-file cadres.&lt;ref name="hsu-shang-li"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130927000096|title= Xi Jinping promotes criticism, self-criticism campaign|author= Hsu Shang-li|date= 27 September 2013|website= Want China Times|access-date= 23 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Eerie Silence: Renewing Our Search for Alien Intelligence''''' is a 2010 science text by [[Paul Davies]], chair of the [[SETI]]: Post-Detection Science and Technology Taskgroup of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]]. ''The Eerie Silence'' explores the possibilities of intelligent extraterrestrial life, and its potential consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Paul |title=The Eerie Silence |date=2010 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston, New York |isbn=978-0-547-13324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

===Chapter 1: Is Anybody Out There?===

In this chapter, Davies goes over the history of aliens as conceived by humanity, culminating in a discussion about [[SETI]]. He makes the point that SETI is science, despite opposing views in the public. Various possibilities for a [[habitable zone]] are mentioned, and Davies also debunks various [[UFO]] stories.

===Chapter 2: Life: Freak Side-Show or Cosmic Imperative?===

Here, Davies debates the point of whether life is common in the universe. He discusses two opposing viewpoints: that of [[Christian de Duve]], which is that life will inevitably arise on Earth-like planets given enough time, and that of [[Jacques Monod]], which is that life has only arisen once in the universe, on Earth.

===Chapter 3: A Shadow Biosphere===

Davies discusses the possibility of [[shadow biosphere|multiple biospheres]] on Earth which evolved separately from normal life, which would be strong evidence for life being a cosmic imperative. He gives several examples of possible [[shadow life]]forms, as well as various methods to search for them.

===Chapter 4: How Much Intelligence is Out There?===

In this chapter, Davies analyzes the probability of intelligent life arising on an Earth-like planet and communicating with us. His discussion is centered around the [[Drake Equation]].

===Chapter 5: New SETI: Widening the Search===

Davies argues for a new search method for SETI, which would be less anthropocentric but at the same time scientifically eliminating various uninhabitable regions. He also discusses whether or not we have already received signals from extraterrestrials, but have not yet discovered them.

In this chapter, Davies brings up an interesting theory about [[Milankovitch cycles|habitability on the Galactic Plane]]. The theory is as such: the [[Solar system]] moves up and down relative to the Galactic Plane, in a cycle of 62 million years, wandering 230 light years out of the plane as a result. According to Richard Muller and Robert Rohde, this cycle closely matches that of marine extinctions in the past 542 million years. The death rate is highest when the solar system is located at a maximum distance from the galactic plane in the direction of galactic north and lowest when it is down south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Robert A. Rohde|author2 =Richard A. Muller|title=Cycles in fossil diversity|journal=Nature|volume=434|date=2005|pages=208–10|doi=10.1038/nature03339|pmid=15758998|issue=7030|bibcode=2005Natur.434..208R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An explanation for this has been proposed by Mikhail Medvedev and Adrian Melott. They point out that the galactic halo is not symmetric between north and south. The galaxy emits a wind that consists of protons and other charged particles, creating a cloud that extends into intergalactic space but is lopsided towards the south. These protons make up a large fraction of [[cosmic rays|high energy cosmic rays]] that impact the Earth. The effect is so great that the Earth receives five times more cosmic radiation at its northernmost point relative to the galactic plane compared to its southernmost point. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mikhail V. Medvedev|author2=Adrian L. Melott|title=Do extragalactic cosmic rays induce cycles in fossil diversity?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=664|date=2007|pages=879|doi=10.1086/518757|bibcode=2007ApJ...664..879M|arxiv=astro-ph/0602092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lopsided effect exists because the Milky Way travels at a speed of 200 kilometres per second in the direction of the [[Virgo supercluster]] of galaxies, which lie to the galactic north. The [[intergalactic medium]], consisting mostly of ionized hydrogen gas, serves as an impediment, which has deformed the [[galactic halo]] towards the south. When the halo gas meets the interstellar medium, a [[bow shock]] is created. The energy in the shock front is transferred via a magnetic process to protons from both the intergalactic medium and the halo. These are the protons which form the cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Paul |title=The Eerie Silence |date=2010 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston, New York |isbn=978-0-547-13324-9 |pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in this chapter Davies considers viruses as possible vehicles for interstellar communication which store intelligent messages in their DNA and then 'upload' it into host cells on arrival at inhabited planets. He also speculates that if extraterrestrials visited the Earth in the past, they could gerrymander genomes of some living organisms, what he calls 'genomic SETI'. Even though these methods of communication face great obstacles, primarily because DNA is notoriously mutable, Davies thinks it is worth trying to check that since genome sequencing is performed anyway and genomes are uploaded into Internet, so it costs almost nothing to run the data through a computer to look for suspicious patterns.

===Chapter 6: Evidence for a Galactic Diaspora===

Davies begins by mentioning the [[Fermi Paradox]], and mentions various ways we could find signs of extraterrestrial life tampering with their environments.

===Chapter 7: Alien Magic===

Davies discusses the advanced nature of alien technology, and the problems we might have at distinguishing this technology. Davies characterizes technology as "nature-plus", i.e. it performs the functions of nature in an accelerated manner. Also, he believes that technology has gone through two stages: the manipulation of matter (the [[wheel]], [[steam engine]], etc.) and the manipulation of information ([[computers]], [[phone]]s, etc.).

===Chapter 8: Post-Biological Intelligence===

Davies continues his discussion of alien technology, and comes to the conclusion that extraterrestrial intelligence might not be interested in the physical world at all and would instead take on the form of a quantum computer.

===Chapter 9: First Contact===

Here, Davies talks about the consequences of detecting intelligent aliens, and various reactions from governments, scientists, the media, and religious organizations.

===Chapter 10: Who Speaks for the Earth?===

In this chapter, Davies asks what the best message to send to the aliens is. Finally, he discusses his own viewpoint on the probability of extraterrestrial life, and concludes that, as a scientist, he believes that intelligent aliens are highly unlikely. However, as a human being, he hopes that such aliens in fact exist.

==Plot==
&lt;!--DO NOT USE EXCESSIVE DETAIL.  Film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words per WP:FILMPLOT--&gt;
Denny Colt ([[Gabriel Macht]]), also known as "the Spirit", learns about a major case from Detective Sussman (Dan Gerrity) involving his nemesis, "[[Octopus (comics)|the Octopus]]" ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]). The Spirit dons his costume and travels across rooftops, saving a woman before connecting with Officer Liebowitz ([[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]). At the swampland, [[femme fatale]] Sand Saref ([[Eva Mendes]]) rises from the water to shoot Sussman.

The Spirit and Liebowitz find the wounded Sussman. Sand and her husband Mahmoud ([[Eric Balfour]]) had earlier fled with chests they recovered from the water. Shot at, Sand escaped, leaving one chest behind which was retrieved by Octopus. The Octopus kills Liebowitz, and his cloned henchmen attack the Spirit. His accomplice [[Silken Floss]] ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) flees with the chest as the two arch-nemeses fight.

The next morning, the Spirit is awakened by his lover, [[Dr. Ellen Dolan]] ([[Sarah Paulson]]), daughter of Commissioner Eustace Dolan ([[Dan Lauria]]). He is undeterred by his gunshot wounds. He notices a gold locket in Sussman's hand, which had been torn from Sand Saref's neck. The locket contains pictures of a much-younger Colt and Sand, and had been his gift to her. Sand had become disenchanted with the city's corruption following the death of her father, a police officer, and left for fifteen years. In a secret lair, the Octopus and Silken Floss discover their chest contains the [[Golden Fleece]], not the Blood of Heracles, as expected. Sand and Mahmoud visit an underworld figure who sold them the location of the treasure, and it is implied he gave the location to the Octopus.

Having fully regenerated, Commissioner Dolan calls The Spirit away to a case and relates Sand's history as one of the world's great jewel thieves. While arresting her, he reveals he knows she is looking for the Golden Fleece, and she shoves him through a window, which he survives. The Spirit receives a tip on the location of the Octopus's lair but is captured while investigating. The Octopus reveals that his and Floss's experimentation led to the creation of an immortality serum. The Octopus first tested it on Colt's dead body; Colt came back to life and earned the ire of [[Death (personification)|Death]] for escaping her clutches. Eventually, the Octopus injected himself with the serum, but he needs the blood of [[Hercules|Heracles]], a demi-god, to perfect the formula. The Spirit escapes by seducing assassin Plaster of Paris ([[Paz Vega]]), who as a parting gift turns on The Octopus. When the Spirit mentions Sand's name, she stabs him out of spite.

After recovering, the Spirit stumbles to the city docks and collapses into the water, where the Lorelei ([[Jaime King]]), the Angel of Death, confronts him. He initially submits but changes his mind after remembering the women he has known. As he swims to the surface, she vows to have him. At the projects, Sand, Floss, and their henchmen meet to exchange the Blood of Heracles for the Golden Fleece. Sand attempts to convince Floss to leave the Octopus before he kills her. Floss gains the upper hand and the Octopus asks Floss for the vase of blood. As the Spirit suddenly materializes, Floss drives off, unable to take a side.

The Octopus shoots a series of progressively larger guns at the Spirit, apparently killing him, but Dolan's [[SWAT]] team storms the area and opens fire. The Octopus is maimed; as he desperately tries to drink the Blood of Heracles, Sand shoots the vase. The Spirit rises, shown to be wearing a bullet-proof vest, and blows up the Octopus with a grenade while Sand uses the Golden Fleece to protect them from the explosion.

The Spirit gives Sand her locket back. They kiss as Ellen looks on, feeling betrayed. The old flames bid each other goodbye and the Spirit convinces Dolan to let Sand go in gratitude for saving him and the world. Nearby, Floss discovers one of the Octopus's severed fingers crawling towards her; she picks it up and departs with two of the clones. Meanwhile, the Spirit and Ellen make amends and embrace.

==Production==
Miller required auditions for the starring role, and Macht was able to attain the role in August 2007.&lt;ref name="macht"/&gt; The actress [[Eva Mendes]] told director [[Frank Miller (comics creator)|Frank Miller]] that she wanted to work with him on ''The Spirit'' before she had even seen a script for the film.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite web|author=Larry Carroll |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/10/10/eva-mendes-has-the-spirit/ |title=Eva Mendes Has 'The Spirit' |publisher=MTV |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was Miller's first choice for the role and was cast in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|last2=Kit|first2=Borys|title=Miller sees Jackson as evil 'Spirit'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ie62938636be2f71fecac797ed78e3302|website=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=19 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520052817/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ie62938636be2f71fecac797ed78e3302|archivedate=20 May 2007|date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson, Miller, and the costume designer developed elaborate costumes for the Octopus to wear; they are different for each of his scenes. They include a [[samurai]] robe complete with a wig, a full [[Nazi]] ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' uniform, a [[Western (genre)|Western]] duster-influenced outfit with an out-of-proportion [[cowboy hat]], and a costume consisting of a [[Karakul (hat)|karakul hat]] and a [[fur coat|fur-lined coat]] influenced by 1970s [[blaxploitation]] [[pimp]]s. When asked about the change from the Octopus being recognized in the comics by distinctive gloves, Jackson said, "It's just an opportunity to be larger than life to take the Octopus's theme of dressing the way he feels every day, or having a theme to his day to day life and making some sense with it. And hopefully, the audience will take the ride with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shawn Adler |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2592607/samuel-l-jackson-takes-us-through-his-spirit-wardrobe/ |title=Samuel L.

===Development===
In the 1970s, director [[William Friedkin]] obtained the film rights to ''[[Spirit (comics)|The Spirit]]'' and contacted [[Will Eisner]] to write a script for him. Eisner declined but recommended [[Harlan Ellison]], who wrote a two-hour [[live-action]] script for the filmmaker. Friedkin and Ellison afterward had an unrelated argument, and the project was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kiel Phegley |url=http://www.cbr.com/ellison-gets-in-the-spirit/ |title=Ellison Gets In "The Spirit" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, [[Brad Bird]], [[Jerry Rees]], and producer [[Gary Kurtz]] attempted to get an animated adaptation off the ground, though studio executives praised the screenplay, they thought the film would be unmarketable, and this version was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Paul Leiva |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2008/12/12/the-spirit-that/ |title=‘The Spirit’ movie that could have been |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fiamma|first1=Andrea|title=Il trailer del film di Spirit mai realizzato da Brad Bird|url=http://www.fumettologica.it/2015/04/spirit-brad-bird-trailer/|website=Fumettologica|accessdate=2016-12-30|language=it-IT|date=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, producer [[Michael Uslan]] and executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Steven Maier subsequently obtained the rights for a live-action [[film adaptation]]. The producer promised Eisner that he would not permit anyone who "didn't get it" to work on the project. Two ideas pitched to Uslan were to put the Spirit in a costume and to have the Spirit be a resurrected dead man who possessed supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="xtra"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Justin|title=NYCC, Xtra: "Will Eisner's The Spirit" Panel|url=http://www.cbr.com/nycc-xtra-will-eisners-the-spirit-panel/|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=25 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter [[John Turman]], a comic book fan, expressed interest in writing the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Worley|first1=Rob|title=Countdown To Hulk: John Turman talks about 'Hulk' and other heroes|url=http://www.cbr.com/countdown-to-hulk-john-turman-talks-about-hulk-and-other-heroes/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=10 February 2017|date=1 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, financier [[OddLot Entertainment]] acquired the rights to the film. OddLot's producers Gigi Pritzker and Deborah Del Prete began a collaboration with Uslan, Melniker, and Maier working at Batfilm Productions, to adapt the story. Eisner, who was protective of the rights to his creations, said that he believed in the producers to faithfully adapt ''The Spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Fleming |url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/odd-lot-batfilm-join-forces-for-spirit-1117908165/ |title=Odd Lot, Batfilm join forces for ‘Spirit’ |publisher=Variety |date=2004-07-22 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, comic-book writer [[Jeph Loeb]] was hired to adapt ''The Spirit'' for the big screen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Mohr |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/loeb-will-get-into-the-spirit-1117920635/ |title=Loeb will get into ‘The Spirit’ |publisher=Variety |date=2005-04-05 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the writer eventually left the project. Later in April, Uslan approached [[Frank Miller (comics creator)|Frank Miller]] at Will Eisner's memorial service in New York City several weeks after Miller's ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' was released in theaters, interested in initiating the adaptation technique with Miller's film for ''The Spirit''.&lt;ref name="panel"/&gt;  Miller had initially hesitated, doubting his skill in adapting ''The Spirit'', but ultimately embraced his first solo project as writer-director.&lt;ref name="xtra"/&gt; Miller described his decision-making: {{quote|The only thought in my mind was, "It's too big—I can't possibly do it."

{{quote|It's Sand Saref (Eva Mendes) who has the most elaborate of all the themes because it's based on her relationship with Denny Colt when they were in their teens, well before he became the Spirit. Saref's music ultimately becomes the love theme of the movie. It's very romantic, almost old fashioned, especially when they finally kiss. Frank Miller and I talked about that scene quite a bit. He really wanted me to 'go for it'—to make their music as romantic as possible. In the end, the Spirit is like a modern day [[Don Juan]], without the psychological ambivalence towards women. He truly loves every woman he meets. It's part of his makeup.

[[Christina Aguilera]] sings a cover of the classic "[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)|Falling in Love Again]]" in the closing credits of ''The Spirit''. The song dates to 1930, written by [[Frederick Hollander]], with lyrics written by [[Sammy Lerner]]. The song was originally sung and popularized by [[Marlene Dietrich]] in the film ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930) and has been covered by [[Billie Holiday]] (1940), [[Doris Day]] (1961), and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] (1962).

===Critical reception===
The film was a [[box office bomb]] and received negative reviews, with critics citing its unnecessary humor, melodramatic acting and style, lack of originality, and exploitative overtones, and divergences from its source material.

''The Spirit'' received a 14% approval rating at the review aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Based on 112 reviews, the consensus reads, "Though its visuals are unique, ''The Spirit's'' plot is almost incomprehensible, the dialogue is ludicrously mannered, and the characters are unmemorable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_spirit/ |title=The Spirit |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave it an aggregate rating of 30 out of 100, denoting "generally negative reviews", from 24 reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/spirit2008 |title='&amp;#39;The Spirit'&amp;#39; |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2008-12-25 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film one out of four stars and said, "There is not a trace of human emotion in it. To call the characters cardboard is to insult a useful packing material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sobczynski |first=Peter |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081223/REVIEWS/812239987 |title=The Spirit Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2008) |publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricky Bentley of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' said, "Macht manages to meld macho with melodrama to make the Spirit come to life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/movies/news/story/824526.html]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Newsday]]'', a one-time comic-book writer, found that "gorgeous [[cinematography]] and design can't mask the hollow core and bizarre ugliness of this mishandled comics adaptation", and noted that while Eisner's own Spirit was "an average-Joe [...] in a rumpled suit—a vulnerable but insouciant [[everyman]] in humanist fables", Miller's Spirit "now has a superpower—a healing factor. Eisner's own spirit must be spinning in its grave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lovece|first1=Frank|title='The Spirit'|url=http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/exploreli/ny-ete5975235dec24a%2C0%2C6764122.story|website=Newsday|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=1 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208014344/http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/exploreli/ny-ete5975235dec24a%2C0%2C6764122.story|archivedate=8 February 2009|date=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Barsanti of ''[[Filmcritic.com]]'' stated, "It's a frankly gorgeous effect, liberated by the fact that Miller adapted freely from Eisner's panels—the two were longtime friends—to create an organic story instead of slavishly following the master's work", and calling it "one of the year's most refreshingly fun films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barsanti|first1=Chris|title=The Spirit Movie Review, DVD Release|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/The-Spirit|website=Filmcritic.com|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=1 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102065832/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/The-Spirit|archivedate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', found the movie a "ludicrously knowing and mannered noir pastiche, full of burnt-end romance and 'style', but robotic at its core".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Owen Gleiberman |url=http://ew.com/article/2008/12/24/spirit-7/ |title=The Spirit – |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=2008-12-24 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Hanke of ''[[Mountain Xpress]]'' observed, "The film may not move smoothly—Miller's too fond of 'just damn weird' digressions for that—but it does move and isn't hard to follow. Its screwiness is deliberate and it's all a matter of taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Hanke |url=http://www.mountainx.com/movies/review/spirit |title=The Spirit |publisher=Mountain Xpress |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A.O. Scott]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' summed up, "To ask why anything happens in Frank Miller's sludgy, hyper-stylized adaptation of a fabled comic book series by Will Eisner may be an exercise in futility. The only halfway interesting question is why the thing exists at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A. O. Scott |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/12/25/movies/25spir.html?ref=movies |title=Gabriel Macht, Directed by Frank Miller, Is Ducking Villains and Vixens |publisher=The New York Times |date=2008-12-24 |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine listed the film at {{Abbr|No.|number}} 32 on their "Top 50 Worst Movies Of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 50 Worst Movies Ever|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/50-worst-movies-ever/|website=Empire|accessdate=3 June 2017|language=en|date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986 to 1990 he studied at the [[Grieg Academy|Bergen Conservatory of Music]] (now known as the Grieg Academy) and at the [[University of Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=q64561/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography], [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 1994 he worked at the Bergen Conservatory as a teacher of [[contemporary classical music]]. Furthermore, he was leader of the ''Autunnale-festivalen - (Music Factory and Autunnale)'', also in Bergen. In 1992 and 1993 he arranged and composed for the ''Forsvarets Stabsmusikkorps Vestlandet - Norwegian Army Band, Bergen (NABB)'', writing, among other works, ''Arctic Landscape''. In this period Aagaard-Nilsen wrote many works for [[wind band]] and [[brass band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.torsteinaagaardnilsen.no/index.php/cv |title= Bio from Aagard-Nilsen’s own website  |website= torsteinaagaardnilsen.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aagaard-Nilsen works as [[Conducting|conductor]] of various school and amateur orchestras, and also as a teacher at the ''Manger Folkehøgskule''. He founded the forum ''Av garde'' together with [[Ketil Hvoslef]], Jostein Stalheim and Knut Vaage.

As a composer he has written for [[orchestra]], chamber ensemble, [[choir]], wind band and brass band. Works that exemplify Aagard-Nilsen fosuc on narrative and visual aspects in a nearly impulsive form include ''Fabula I ''and ''Fabula II'' (1996), ''Sinfonietta'' (1998) and ''The Season of Blue Lights'' (2008) commissioned by [[BIT20 Ensemble]]. A stronger focus on expressive elements in Aagard-Nilsen’s output is evident in works such as ''Pierrot´s Lament'' (Concerto for Euphonium and Orchestra), premiered in 2001 with the [[Lahti Symphony Orchestra]]. The trumpet concerto ''Blue Phrases'' (2007), the sinfonietta ''The Season of Blue Light'' and quartet ''Blue Fragments'' (2008) are additional examples of Aagard-Nilsen’s expressive focus; while the orchestral work ''Boreas Sings'' (2012) represents a new direction in which a spectrum of colours and dancing rhythms become evident. 2014 saw his orchestral work ''Boreas Blæs'' (2014) premiered by the [[Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra]] at the opening ceremony of Stormen, [[Bodø]]’s concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listento.no/symfoni/kontakt.nsf/pub_e/per2000062811055384476081/ |title= Bio from MIC Music Information Centre Norway |website= listento.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 2016 saw Aagard-Nilsen being bestowed with the Norwegian Music Publishing Association’s Annual Award for his work ''Dirty Dancing'', commissioned and premiered by the Christiania Blåseensemble in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ballade.no/sak/disse-vant-musikkforleggerprisen/ |title= Ballade.no on the 2016 Norwegian Music Publishing Association’s Annual Award  |website= ballade.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency with which the US government has chosen to employ the practice of transferring prisoners to countries that practice torture has fluctuated from one administration to the next. Before the [[September 11 attacks]], renditions to countries that practice torture were sporadic and ad hoc.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Articles.latimes.com_June_16_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/11/opinion/ed-torture11 |title=Torture by Proxy - latimes |newspaper=Articles.latimes.com |date=March 11, 2005  |author= |accessdate= June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] created a dedicated rendition bureaucracy and streamlined procedures which radically expanded abductions for torture by proxy, most commonly sending victims to be abused in Egypt, sometimes to Syria and Morocco.&lt;ref name= "Outsourcing Torture"/&gt;  Despite protestations that it does not condone torture, recently the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] has been accused of transferring prisoners to face brutal treatment in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Slate.com_June_16_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/06/16/senate_votes_to_ban_torture_will_it_stick_this_time.html |title=Senate votes to ban torture: Will It Stick This Time? |newspaper=Slate.com |date= June 16, 2015 |author=Joshua Keeting |accessdate= June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Capelin'' (SS-289)''', a [[Balao class submarine|''Balao''-class submarine]], was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[capelin]], a small fish of the [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] family.  Her keel was laid down by [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]].  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 20 January 1943 sponsored by Mrs. I.C. Bogart, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 4 June 1943, Lieutenant Commander E.E. Marshall in command.

[[Image:Ss-289.jpg|left|thumb|View of ''Capelin'''s bow and conning tower]]

''Capelin'' sailed from [[New London, Connecticut]], on 3 September 1943, bound for [[Brisbane]], Australia, and duty with Submarine Force, Southwest Pacific. Her first war patrol, conducted in the [[Molucca Sea]], [[Flores Sea]], and [[Banda Sea]] between 30 October and 15 November, found her sinking a 3127-ton Japanese cargo ship on 11 November off [[Ambon Island]].

''Capelin'' returned to [[Darwin, Australia]], with a defective conning tower hatch mechanism, excessively noisy bow planes, and a defective radar tube.  These flaws were corrected, and ''Capelin'' put out on her second war patrol 17 November 1943, in the Molucca Sea and [[Celebes Sea]], and she was to pay particular attention to [[Kaoe Bay]], [[Morotai Strait]], [[Davao Gulf]], and trade routes in the vicinity of [[Siaoe Island]], [[Sangi Island]], [[Talaud Islands]] and [[Sarangani Island]]. She was to leave her area at dark 6 December.

{{USS|Bonefish|SS-223|3}} reported having seen an American submarine on 2 December 1943 in the area assigned to ''Capelin'' at that time.  The unknown sub quickly dove, probably after sighting Bonefish. Bonefish sent a message via sonar giving Commander Marshall's nickname, 'Steam'. The sub returned an acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, H. (1994). The Last Patrol. Shrewsbury, Eng.: Airlife Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, ''Capelin'' was never heard from again.  The Navy broke radio silence on 9 December, but without success.

Japanese records studied after the war listed an attack by minelayer ''Wakataka'' on a supposed United States submarine on 23 November, off Kaoe Bay, [[Halmahera]], with the Japanese ship noting the attack produced oily black water columns that contained wood and cork splinters and later a raft was found.  This is the only reported attack in the appropriate area at that time.  Also, Japanese minefields are now known to have been placed in various positions along the north coast of [[Sulawesi]] (Celebes) in ''Capelin'''s area, and she may have been lost because of a mine explosion.  Gone without a trace, with all her crew, ''Capelin'' remains in the list of ships lost without a known cause.

''Capelin'' received one [[battle star]] for [[World War II]] service. She is credited with having sunk 3,127&amp;nbsp;tons of shipping on her single war patrol. See also [[List of U.S. Navy losses in World War II]].

'''Voskhod 1''' ({{lang-ru|'''Восход-1'''}}; ''Восход'' is Russian for ''Sunrise'') was the seventh manned [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space flight. In October 1964 it achieved a number of "firsts" in the history of [[Human spaceflight|manned spaceflight]], being the first space flight to carry more than one crewman into orbit, the first flight without the use of [[spacesuit]]s, and the first to carry either an engineer or a physician into outer space. It also set a manned spacecraft altitude record of {{convert|336|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voskhod 1|url = http://www.astronautix.com/flights/voskhod1.htm|website = www.astronautix.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513200004/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/voskhod1.htm|archivedate = 13 May 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three spacesuits for the Voskhod 1 cosmonauts were omitted; there was neither the room nor the payload capacity for the Voskhod to carry them. The original Voskhod had been designed to carry two cosmonauts, but Soviet politicians pushed the Soviet space program into squeezing three cosmonauts into Voskhod 1. The only other space flight in the short Voskhod program, [[Voskhod 2]], carried two suited cosmonauts &amp;mdash; of necessity, because it was the flight on which [[Alexei Leonov]] made the world's first [[spacewalk|walk in space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voskhod 2|url = http://www.astronautix.com/flights/voskhod2.htm|website = www.astronautix.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131122065235/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/voskhod2.htm|archivedate = 22 November 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its payload Voskhod 1 carried a ribbon off a [[Communards|Communard]] banner from the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 into orbit.&lt;ref name=Horne&gt;{{cite book | last = Horne | first = Alistair | title = The Fall of Paris | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1965 | page = 433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Soviet Union-1964-stamp-Woschod 1-001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Postal stamp commemorating Voskhod 1 mission]]
The original prime crew of cosmonauts for Voskhod 1, composed of [[Boris Volynov]], [[Georgi Katys]], and [[Boris Yegorov]], was rejected just three days before the scheduled launch date for the [[spacecraft|space capsule]]. Katys was reportedly removed after the KGB discovered that his father had been shot during the [[Great Purge]] in 1937 and Volynov apparently was the victim of discrimination due to his part-Jewish background, although he would later fly on [[Soyuz 5]] and [[Soyuz 21]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Volynov|url = http://www.astronautix.com/astros/volynov.htm|website = www.astronautix.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics played a role in the crew's selection. Various factions each supported their own representatives for the flight. [[Sergei Korolev]] wanted his engineers to become cosmonauts, believing that spacecraft designers should fly in their own vehicles. The [[Soviet Air Force]] agreed to a crew composed of a military pilot, an engineer or scientist, and a doctor, but advocated for an all-military crew. [[Konstantin Feoktistov]], who had been a design engineer for the [[Vostok programme|Vostok]], [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]], and [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] programs, was selected for this flight, becoming the only Soviet outer space designer to make a spaceflight. Yegorov, a medical doctor, used his political influence to get selected for the crew through his father's [[Politburo]] connections. The Soviet space program viewed its crews as passengers more than pilots; the new cosmonauts received only three to four months of training, perhaps the briefest in space history other than that received by the American politicians [[Jake Garn]] and [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] for Space Shuttle flights in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=siddiqi2000&gt;{{cite book | last = Siddiqi | first = Asif A. | url = https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/series95.html | title = Challenge To Apollo: The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945-1974 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|413–414,416}}

==Mission highlights==
[[image:Voskhod 1 and 2.png|left|thumb|200px|Voskhod 1 and 2 space capsules]]The [[Voskhod spacecraft]] were basically [[Vostok spacecraft]] with a backup [[solid fuel rocket|solid-fuel]] retrorocket added onto the top of the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok cosmonaut's position. Because of the cramped conditions, the cosmonauts also had to go on a diet to fit in their couches. A solid-fuel [[braking rocket]] was also added to the space capsule's parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok space capsule, no ejection seats were fitted in the Voskhod; the cosmonauts had to land inside the descent module.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spaceflight mission report: Voskhod 1|url = http://www.spacefacts.de/mission/english/voskhod-1.htm|website = www.spacefacts.de|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from that, the Vostok booster had lacked sufficient payload capacity to support the extra weight of a retrorocket package, however the larger upper stage used on the 11A57 launch vehicle meant that this was no longer an issue. As there was no launch escape system, the mission could not be aborted until three minutes after liftoff when the payload shroud was jettisoned and so a low-altitude booster accident would have meant the loss of the crew. As the cosmonauts rode the gantry elevator to the top of the launch vehicle, they could look across the steppe which was strewn with debris from previous failed R-7 launches, a grim reminder of what could potentially happen on their flight.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

Liftoff took place at 7:30 on the morning of 12 October. For the first few minutes of the launch, the blockhouse was extremely tense knowing that the cosmonauts were doomed if any problem with the booster developed.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}} Much of the mission of Voskhod 1 was devoted to biomedical research, and to the study of how a multidisciplinary team could work together in space. The mission was short, at only slightly over 24 hours. Incidentally, the Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was removed from power during the spaceflight, and it has been speculated that this led to the mission's being cut short.&lt;ref&gt;An example appears in [[The Times]] obituary of Feoktistov: [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6943167.ece]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cramped conditions of the Voskhod space capsule has also been suggested as a factor ruling out a longer-duration spaceflight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the flight, Khrushchev spoke with the cosmonauts via radio phone from his ''[[dacha]]'' in the Crimea. Shortly after this conversation, he was summoned back to Moscow where he learned that he was being expelled from office and the Communist Party. When the crew returned to Earth the next day, they were greeted by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Alexei Kosygin]] in their first public appearance as leaders of the Soviet Union.

Despite the propaganda boasting around Voskhod 1, it was privately referred to by the leadership of the Soviet space program as "a circus" due to the messy process of crew selection, the cosmonauts needing to diet to fit inside their spacecraft, Khrushchev's expulsion during the flight, and also the extremely dangerous circumstances of it (the crew having neither pressure suits nor any way to escape from a malfunctioning launch vehicle).

Happening as it did before the beginning of the [[Project Gemini]] two-man flights, Voskhod 1 had a significant, but temporary, international impact. The [[NASA]] Administrator, [[James E. Webb]], called the flight of Voskhod 1 a "significant space accomplishment" adding that it was "a clear indication that the Russians are continuing a large space program for the achievement of national power and prestige."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{clear|left}}
