==Introduction==
The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] is legislated to collect, hold and disseminate census data under the [https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00618 ''Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975'' (ABS Act)], and the [https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2015C00247 ''Census and Statistics Act 1905'' (Census and Statistics Act)].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/Privacy,%20confidentiality%20&amp;%20security|title=Privacy, Confidentiality and Security|last=|first=|date=22 February 2018|website=Australian Bureau of Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[2016 Australian census]] was the previous census completed. Participation in the [[census]] is compulsory which empowers the Statistician to request persons to complete forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/privacypolicy Census Privacy Policy] - The personal information you provide in your Census form remains strictly confidential to the ABS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/2011%20Census%20-%20Census%20Help%20-%20About%20the%20Census|title=2011 Census: Census help: About the Census|date=16 July 2011|work=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=5 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929185539/http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/2011%20Census%20-%20Census%20Help%20-%20About%20the%20Census|archivedate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.census.abs.gov.au/help/popquestions?gclid=CJXImIPmn84CFUEsvQodz64KtQ#backtotop|title=Popular questions|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|accessdate=1 August 2016|quotation='''Is the Census compulsory?''' Yes, completing the Census is compulsory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personally-identified information kept and securely held by the National Archives of Australia (NAA) for 99 years will be made public in 2120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2008.0~2016~Main%20Features~Census%20Time%20Capsule~143 Census Time Capsule] - Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

The final 2021 census questions are anticipated to be published in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/2021+Census+review+of+topics Review of 2021 Census topics] - Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
===Census topic development===
The 2021 census topics have been developed by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/census-consult Review of 2021 Census topics] - Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/2021+Census+overview 2021 Census overview] - Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;
# ABS begins consultation 
# Publishes details of submission process (March 2018)
# Public submissions open (April - June 2018)
# ABS publishes consultation summary and refined recommendations (late 2018)
# Approvals by Australian Government (mid 2019)
# ABS publishes final 2021 census questions (late 2020)

==Data collection==
Due to public expectations of interacting with government through digital services. People will also be able to complete their Census using the paper form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/2021+Census+Sourcing+the+2021+Census+Digital+Service Sourcing the 2021 Census Digital Service] - Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online===
From the 2006 to 2016 censuses, completing it online has been an optional method with sixty-three percent in 2016. People will again be able to complete their Census online in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/2021+Census+Sourcing+the+2021+Census+Digital+Service Sourcing the 2021 Census Digital Service] - Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Dhubi''', '''Al-Dubi''' ({{Lang-ar|الضُبي}} ''Dhubī''), or the '''Dhubi Sheikhdom''' ({{Lang-ar|مشيخة الضُبي}} ''Mashyakhat ad-Dhubī''), was a small state in the [[British Empire|British]] [[Aden Protectorate]]. Dhubi was located between [[Mawsata]] in the southwest, [[Hadrami sheikhdom|Hadrami]] in the northeast, [[Lower Yafa]] in the south and [[Upper Yafa]] in the north.

Its last sheikh was deposed in 1967 upon the founding of the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]] and the area is now part of the Republic of [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch. ''A History of Modern Yemen.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Al-Dhubi was one of the five sheikhdoms of [[Upper Yafa]].
It was part nominally of the [[Western Aden Protectorate]], although the date of the treaty is unknown. 
Al-Dhubi never joined the [[Federation of South Arabia]], but became part of the [[Protectorate of South Arabia]] between 1963 and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Gavin. Aden Under British Rule: 1839-1967. London: C. Hurst &amp; Company, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Rulers===
Al-Dhubi was ruled by sheikhs who bore the title ''Shaykh al-Mashyakha ad-Dhubiyya''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yemen_protectorate.html States of the Aden Protectorates]&lt;/ref&gt;

In individuals with [[substance use disorder]] (problematic use or [[substance abuse|abuse]] with [[substance dependence|dependence]]), psychotherapy is currently the best treatment option as no pharmacological treatment has been approved.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pérez-Mañá|first=C|author2=Castells X |author3=Torrens M |author4=Capellà D |author5=Farre M.|title=Efficacy of psychostimulant drugs for amphetamine abuse or dependence|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=September 2013|issue=9|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009695.pub2|url=http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD009695/efficacy-of-psychostimulant-drugs-for-amphetamine-abuse-or-dependence#sthash.R4ahNJF3.dpuf|accessdate=8 September 2013|pmid=23996457|volume=9|pages=CD009695}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] is expected to develop with regular [[substituted amphetamine]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Patrick|title=Amphetamines: Drug Use and Abuse|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/special_subjects/drug_use_and_abuse/amphetamines.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|publisher=Merck|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When substituted amphetamines are abused, drug tolerance develops rapidly.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2013" /&gt; Psychostimulants – including amphetamine and methamphetamine – do not cause [[physical dependence]].&lt;ref name="NHMH_3e-Physical dependence + psychostimulant addiction treatment"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE, Holtzman DM | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2015 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071827706 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Chapter 16: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote = Pharmacologic treatment for psychostimulant addiction is generally unsatisfactory.

The acute effect of amphetamine use manifests itself in euphoria, intensification of the train of thought, speech and motoricity and an increase in initiative and urge to move. In case of chronic abuse, vegetative disorders soon occur such as bouts of sweating, [[Insomnia|trouble sleeping]], [[tremor]], [[ataxia]] and [[diarrhea]]; the degradation of the personality takes place relatively slowly.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Severe withdrawal associated with dependence from recreational substituted amphetamine use can be difficult for a user to cope with.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000166/CH162.htm#SSAT Chronic Amphetamine Use and Abuse] {{webarchive | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100403085040/http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000166/CH162.htm#SSAT | date=April 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = J Addict Dis. | year = 2001 | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 55–65 | title = Behavioral sensitization in humans |vauthors=Sax KW, Strakowski SM | pmid = 11681593 | doi = 10.1300/J069v20n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=I.

There is a small but recognizable community of '''Angolans in Brazil''' consisting mainly of immigrants and expatriates from [[Angola]].

'''Axininca''' (also ''Axininca Campa,&lt;ref&gt;The name ''Campa'' is offensive.&lt;/ref&gt; Ajyíninka Apurucayali, Campa, Ashaninca, Ashéninca Apurucayali, Apurucayali Campa, Ajyéninka'') is an [[Arawakan language]] spoken along the Apurucayali tributary of the [[Pachitea River]] in [[Peru]].

It has figured prominently in formal linguistic theory involving [[phonology]] (especially [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] including its [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]) and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (Black 1991; Casali 1996, 2011; De Lacy 2002, 2006; De Lacy &amp; Kingston 2013; Itô 1986, 1989; Levin 1985; Lombardi 2002; McCarthy &amp; Prince 1993; Morley 2015; Rosenthall &amp; Horn 1997; Spring 1990a, 1990b, 1990c, 1992; Yip 1983).

==Demographics and language policy==
There is 20% literacy in Ajyíninka Apurucayali and 30% literacy in Spanish, there is much bilingualism.

It is an official language.

The '''Bajuni people''' are an ethnic minority mainly residing on the [[Bajuni Islands]] and surrounding coastal areas between the port city of [[Kismayo]] and [[Mombasa]] area of [[Kenya]] and Somalia.

==Overview==
The Bajuni principally inhabit the tiny [[Bajuni Islands]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many also traditionally reside in [[Kenya]], mainly in [[Mombasa]] and other towns in that country's [[Coast Province]].&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;Abdullahi, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;Mwakikagile, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population's members trace their origins to diverse groups; primarily coastal [[Somali Bantu|Bantu]] and [[Khoisan]]oid hunter-gather groups, as well as later additions such as [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Somalis]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"/&gt; Some also have [[Indonesia]]n ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory Norton|first=Flyktningeråd (Norway) |title=Land, property, and housing in Somalia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ed1DAQAAIAAJ&amp;|publisher=Norwegian Refugee Council|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bajuni follow the laws of Islam to conduct their affairs. Almost all are Shafite [[Muslim]]s. Their lives revolve around the mosque and daily prayer. In the course of saying five prayers a day, they also wash at least five times. Every Muslim parent insists on giving his child the basic Islamic education. A Muslim judge, or [[Qadi|kadhi]], handles the criminal and civil disputes of the community.

When a child is born, it is held up by the father, a friend, or a teacher, who recites the traditional call of prayer into its ear. From the moment of birth, the child is instructed in the basic teachings of Islam. Men are the working breadwinners. A woman's place among the Bajuni is usually within the home. She customarily leaves the house only to visit or to go to the market. Her visiting is done late in the afternoon when the housework is finished and the children are playing. The husbands like to gather at a men's meeting place or the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=10586 |title=Swahili, Bajuni |publisher=Joshua Project |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bajuni are traditionally fishermen and sailors. Some also pursue other trades such as [[metalwork]].&lt;ref name="Godfrey"/&gt;

==End of colonisation, Civil War and inclusion in peace talks== 
By 1960, Somalia (then known as Somaliland) gained its freedom from colonial governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://countrystudies.us/somalia/14.htm |title= Somalia - Trusteeship and Protectorate: The Road to Independence |publisher= Countrystudies.us |date=1971 |accessdate= 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya gained its independence in December 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/dec-12-1963-kenya-gains-independence/comment-page-1/?_r=0] {{dead link |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the downfall of the Somali government in 1991, Bajuni people experienced abandonment by both the Somalia and Kenyan governments. The Bajuni refer to this period as "The Troubles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.mun.ca/dnurse/Database/ |title=Derek Nurse &amp;#124; Bajuni Database |publisher=Faculty.mun.ca |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marginalization led Chairman of the Bajuni, Hon. Mohamed Ismail Barkale (Maxamed Ismaaciil Barkaale) to petition I.G.A.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">'''Consumer import of prescription drugs''' refers to an individual person, typically a patient, getting [[prescription drugs]] from a foreign country for their own personal use in their own country.

==Import mechanisms==
People might have drugs shipped to them from [[online pharmacies]]. They may travel internationally for the purpose of [[medical tourism]], and purchase drugs there to be used back home.

==Causes==
Individual consumers will only consider seeking drugs from other countries if they have some barrier to access in their own country. One barrier to access is high local prices compared to other markets. Another barrier to access could be legal restrictions preventing an individual from getting a drug they want or need.

===International drug market prices===
In some markets, drug prices are set or influenced by the prices in other, nearby markets.&lt;ref name="Vogler 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogler|first1=Sabine|last2=Paris|first2=Valérie|last3=Ferrario|first3=Alessandra|last4=Wirtz|first4=Veronika J.|last5=de Joncheere|first5=Kees|last6=Schneider|first6=Peter|last7=Pedersen|first7=Hanne Bak|last8=Dedet|first8=Guillaume|last9=Babar|first9=Zaheer-Ud-Din|title=How Can Pricing and Reimbursement Policies Improve Affordable Access to Medicines? Lessons Learned from European Countries|journal=Applied Health Economics and Health Policy|date=6 January 2017|doi=10.1007/s40258-016-0300-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, for example, people freely and easily travel to different countries, and the price of a certain drug in one country affects the price in other, nearby countries.&lt;ref name="Vogler 2017"/&gt; Having this kind of competitive exchange can keep prices low, but it can also lead to lowered drug accessibility.&lt;ref name="Vogler 2017"/&gt; Sometimes a manufacturer may choose not to offer a drug in one market, to ensure success in selling the drug at a higher price in a different market.&lt;ref name="Vogler 2017"/&gt;

Businesses, manufacturers and drug retailers wish to control the supply of pharmaceuticals in their own marketplace.&lt;ref name="Pashkov 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pashkov|first1=VM|last2=Golovanova|first2=IA|last3=Olefir|first3=AA|title=The impact of the legal regime of intellectual property protection in the pharmaceutical market.|journal=Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)|date=2016|volume=69|issue=3 pt 2|pages=582–586|pmid=27717949}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, if low-cost drugs entered a market from other lower-cost territories, what might develop is pure [[price-based selling]].&lt;ref name="Pashkov 2016"/&gt; The [[TRIPS agreement]] is an example of a [[World Trade Organization]] treaty which regulates how drugs can be traded in the international marketplace.&lt;ref name="Pashkov 2016"/&gt;

Some developing countries might receive access to lower-cost drugs through [[compulsory licenses]].&lt;ref name="Stavropoulou 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stavropoulou|first1=Charitini|last2=Valletti|first2=Tommaso|title=Compulsory licensing and access to drugs|journal=The European Journal of Health Economics|date=10 January 2014|volume=16|issue=1|pages=83–94|doi=10.1007/s10198-013-0556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory licenses affect markets outside the country in which they are issued.&lt;ref name="Stavropoulou 2014"/&gt;

===Variation in legality===
Drugs which are legal in one place may not be legal in another.

==By region==

===Canada to United States===
People in the United States have easy access to Canada. The quality of medicine in Canada is comparable to that of the United States. Drug prices are often much lower in Canada than in the United States. To save money, some consumers in the United States seek to purchase drugs in Canada. Different people have published different perspectives on this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepherd|first1=M|title=Drug importation and safety of drugs obtained from Canada.|journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy|date=July 2007|volume=41|issue=7|pages=1288–91|pmid=17578879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major on-line supplier, CanadaDrugs.com, has announced it will close on July 13, 2018 as part of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadadrugs.com/website-closure&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Petition for government reform===
Consumers may feel that prescription drugs which are available to multiple countries to be of equivalent quality, and feel comfortable buying and using drugs by choosing to purchase from the country which offers the drugs at the lowest price.

===Legal status===
Governments typically oversee the import of prescription drugs so bringing a prescription drug from a foreign country could be [[Illegal drug trade]].

[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|right|A 1960 [[United States presidential debate]] between [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] had a panel of four moderators.]]
A '''discussion moderator''' or '''debate moderator''' is a person whose role is to act as a neutral participant in a debate or discussion, holds participants to time limits and tries to keep them from straying off the topic of the questions being raised in the debate.  Sometimes moderators may ask questions intended to allow the debate participants to fully develop their argument in order to ensure the debate moves at pace.

In panel discussions commonly held at [[academic conference]]s, the moderator usually introduces the participants and solicits questions from the audience. On television and radio shows, a moderator will often take calls from people having differing views, and will use those calls as a starting point to ask questions of guests on the show. Perhaps the most prominent role of moderators is in [[political debate]]s, which have become a common feature of election campaigns. The moderator may have complete control over which questions to ask, or may act as a filter by selecting questions from the audience.

==History==
The role of the discussion moderator became significant in the year 1780, when a "Rage for publick debate" led to a number of different organizations advertising and hosting debates for anywhere between 650 and 1200 people.&lt;ref&gt;Donna T. Andrew, Introduction to ''London Debating Societies,'' ix; Mary Thale, "London Debating Societies in the 1790s," ''The Historical Journal'' 32, no. 1 (March 1989), p. 59.; Thomas Munck, ''The Enlightenment: A Comparative Social History 1721-1794'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The question for debate was introduced by a president or moderator who proceeded to regulate the discussion. Speakers were given set amounts of time to argue their point of view, and, at the end of the debate, a vote was taken to determine a decision or adjourn the question for further debate.&lt;ref&gt;Thale, "London Debating Societies in the 1790s," 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers were not permitted to slander or insult other speakers, or diverge from the topic at hand, illustrating the value placed on politeness.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, "Popular Culture and Public Debate," 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[television]] era, it is common for political debate moderators to be [[Journalism|journalists]], either individually or as a panel.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Robinson, Shelia R. Cotton, Jeremy Schulz, ''Communication and Information Technologies Annual'' (2015), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dwight Dudley''' (born May 30, 1954) is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Florida House of Representatives]], representing the 68th District, which includes southern [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]], since 2012.

==History==
Dudley was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and moved to the state of [[Florida]] in 1959. He attended [[St. Petersburg College]], where he graduated with an [[Associate's degree]] in 1978, and later [[Florida State University]], where he graduated with a degree in speech communication in 1980. Afterwards, he attended the [[Florida State University College of Law]], graduating in 1987. After graduation, he worked as a legislative aide and analyst in the [[Florida House of Representatives]] before moving back to [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], where he served as an assistant public defender. Dudley eventually started his own law firm, where he worked for sixteen years.

==Florida House of Representatives==
In 2012, following the reconfiguration of Florida House districts, Dudley opted to run in the newly created 68th District. He won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination unopposed, and in the general election, he faced former [[Florida House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Frank Farkas]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, and [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidate Matthew Weidner. A contentious election ensued, with Dudley attacking Farkas for his association with gambling lobbyists, and Farkas attacking Dudley over his history as a criminal defense attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/race-between-dwight-dudley-and-frank-farkas-for-house-district-68-gets/1258431|title=Race between Dwight Dudley and Frank Farkas for House District 68 gets uglier|date=October 25, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2014|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|first=Mark|last=Puente}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' endorsed Dudley, declaring that he "would bring a fresh voicer to Tallahassee and better represent consumers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/for-a-better-florida-house/1257108|title=For a better Florida House|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2014|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Dudley narrowly emerged victorious, winning 51% of the vote to Farkas's 44% and Weidner's 5%.

While serving in the legislature, Dudley authored legislation that would repeal the ability of utility companies "to charge customers for future power plants," which has allowed [[Duke Energy]] to charge its customers more than a billion dollars for a nuclear plant that they decided to cancel, and legislation that would allow "renewable and alternative energy providers to exist alongside large utility companies." However, during the legislative session, his legislation was not considered, so he called for constitutional amendments to be placed on the ballot that would repeal the customer fee and encourage renewable energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wfsu.org/post/fla-lawmaker-wants-alternative-energy-nuclear-fee-repeal-ballot|title=Fla.

Dudley was mentioned as a potential candidate to run against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congressman]] [[David Jolly]] in the [[Florida's 13th congressional district|13th congressional district]], but he ultimately declined to run, instead choosing to seek re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbo.com/news/fresh-squeezed-politics/jolly-draws-no-party-rival-20140503/|title=Jolly draws no-party rival|date=May 3, 2014|accessdate=May 7, 2014|work=[[Tampa Tribune]]|first=Kate|last=Bradshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his campaign for re-election, Dudley will either face Joshua Black or Bill Young II, the son of the late former Congressman [[Bill Young]], who are running in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] primary. Black drew national attention in January 2014 when he publicly called for the hanging of President [[Barack Obama]], posting on [[Twitter]], "I'm past impeachment. It's time to arrest and hang him high." Dudley condemned Black's comments, declaring, "It's dangerous and unbecoming for someone who wants to lead to call for such violence and extremist action. Wow. I'm stunned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/florida-house-candidate-joshua-black-calls-for-hanging-of-president-obama/2161944|title=Florida House candidate Joshua Black calls for hanging of President Obama|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=May 7, 2014|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|first=Mark|last=Puente}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dzi bead''' (Tib. གཟི།; pronounced "zee"; alternative spelling: ''gzi'') is a type of stone [[bead]] of uncertain origin worn as part of a [[necklace]] and sometimes as a [[bracelet]]. In several [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]]s, including that of [[Tibet]], the bead is considered to provide positive spiritual benefit.  These beads are generally prized as protective [[amulet]]s and are sometimes ground into a powder to be used in traditional Tibetan medicine.  Beads subject to this process have small "dig marks" where a portion of the bead has been scraped or ground away to be included in the medicine.  Some dzi exhibit grinding and polishing of one or both ends, again the result of reduction for use in traditional Tibetan medicine or, in some cases, due to the bead's use as a burnishing tool in the application of gold leaf to [[thanka]] paintings or gilt bronze statuary.

The most highly prized dzi beads are those of ancient age, made of natural [[agate]]. The original source of these beads is a mystery. While the traditional, ancient-style beads are greatly preferred, new modern-made dzi are gaining popularity amongst Tibetans.

==Names==
The meaning of the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] word "dzi" [གཟི།] translates to "shine, brightness, clearness, splendor."  In Mandarin [[Chinese language|Chinese]], dzi are called "heaven's bead" or "heaven's pearl" (天珠; tiān zhū).

==Design==
Dzi beads are made from [[agate]], and may have decorative symbols composed of circles, ovals, squares, waves or zig zags, stripes, lines, diamonds, dots, and various other [[archetypal]] and symbolic patterns. Colors mainly range from brown to black, with the pattern usually in ivory white. Dzi beads can appear in different colours, shapes, and sizes; the surface is usually smooth and waxy, presumably resulting from wear over a long period of time.

Sometimes the natural patterns (usually "layered" swirls) of the agate can be seen underneath or behind the decorative symbols and designs, and sometimes not. [[File:Dzi.jpg|thumb|left|Cinnabar dots as seen on an ancient dzi.]]Some dzi beads exhibit what are referred to as "blood spots," which are tiny red dots in the white areas, indicative of [[iron]] content. This is a highly desirable characteristic among collectors, but relatively rare.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Another desirable effect is "[[Nāga]] skin," in which the surface of the bead exhibits tiny circular weathering marks  that resemble [[Reptile scale|scales]]. Some dzi beads are simply polished agate, with no other decoration than the natural banding of the stone.

The number of "eyes," circular designs on the stone, is considered significant. The symbolic meaning of these beads is based on the number and arrangement of the dots. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Origin==
Dzi stones made their first appearance between 2000 and 1000 BC, in ancient [[India]]: a few hundred thousand were supposedly brought back by Tibetan soldiers from [[Iran|Persia]] during a [[Raid (military)|raid]]. The malicious effect of the “evil eye” was taken very seriously by these people. Dzi were considered to counteract the evil eye. The artisans who made the dzi created amulets with “eyes” on them as a “fight fire with fire” form of protection. [[Artisans]] used agate as the base stone, and then embellished the beads lines and shapes using ancient methods that remain mysterious. Treatments may have included darkening with plant sugars and heat, bleaching and white line etching with [[natron]], and protecting certain areas with grease, clay, wax or a similar substance.  A hole was drilled before the bead was decorated as drilling caused most breakage during the production process, and holes were also useful for stringing and dipping numerous beads as a step in coloration.  The earliest holes were conical and done with solid drill bits drilling from both ends and, hopefully, meeting near the center of the bead.  Very small drill tips of chipped flint were used without abrasives and numerous other materials, regardless of hardness, when used with abrasives.  Neolithic era beads were also drilled with hollow, tubular abrasion driven bits of reed and, later, during the Chalcolithic, copper.  These drilled a hole with a core of agate inside the tubular drill.  Tubular bit holes were parallel walled rather than conical, but also done from both ends.  Both methods required arduous work done with a [[bow drill]], with time and effort being determined by hardness of abrasive, from ground sand (quartz) to corundum. 

Although the geographic origin of dzi beads is uncertain, it is accepted that they are now called ''"Tibetan beads,"'' just like ''"Tibetan coral,"'' which also came to [[Tibet]] from elsewhere. Tibetans cherish these beads and consider them hereditary gems. In this way they have survived thousands of years, being worn by hundreds of individual people. Dzi are found primarily in [[Tibet]], but also in neighbouring [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Ladakh]] and [[Sikkim]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}Although Dzi type agate beads were made in the Indus Valley during the Harappan period and at various locations rich in agate deposits in India, such as in Khambhat, since their Neolithic periods, the earliest archaeologically controlled find of an agate bead with Dzi style decoration of straight and curved lines and circular eye found has been from a Saka culture excavation (Uigarak) in Kazakhstan, dated 7th - 5th C. BCE.   These were said to be imports from India, reflecting long distance trade with the more nomadic Saka or Scythian tribes.

Sometimes shepherds and farmers find dzi beads in the soil or in the grasslands. Because of this, some Tibetans traditionally believe or believed that dzi are naturally formed, not man-made{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}.

Since knowledge of the bead is derived from several differing [[oral traditions]], the beads have provoked controversy regarding their source, their method of manufacture and even their precise definition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} In [[Culture of Tibet|Tibetan culture]] these beads are believed to attract local protectors, [[dharmapala]]s or [[deities]] or maybe beneficial ghosts, ancestors or even [[bodhisattvas]]. Because of this, dzi beads are always treated with respect.&lt;ref&gt;Pattison, Eliot. [2004] (2004). Beautiful Ghost. St Martin Press. {{ISBN|0-312-27759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Using it as a source, though I have heard similar things in actual Chinese culture--&gt;

==New dzi==
{{OR|date=June 2018}}
{{NPOV|date=June 2018}}
It has been reported that  modern era dzi style beads were made in Idar Oberstein, Germany at least as early as the 19th C.  The German agate-cutters at Idar-Oberstein plied their trade since the Roman Period.  They brought the coloring of agates to a science and the cutting and drilling to the mechanical level of perfection for which Germans are known.

Due to the questionable origin of most hand made dzi beads and the high demand for them, there has been relatively recent reproduction reported in [[Asia]]. The most convincing replica of ancient dzi beads came from Taiwan during the 1990s. China has also produced some good-quality dzi beads over the last three years.{{When|date=December 2010}} However, the number of modern dzi that would be accepted as beautiful by the Tibetan community is very small, making these beads highly desirable. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  From photos of contemporary Tibetans decked out in ceremonial garb, including numerous dzi beads, their taste and choice is more toward new, shiny and big than small and muted by the patination of age, and it is perhaps because of superficial and naive attraction to the unblemished, considered by many as "Pure" dzi, that they have allowed most of their truly ancient - vagaries and accidents of time, nature, and culture effected - heirlooms to be bought and/or exchanged for replicas.  When one reads of the still current amuletic "charging" of newer dzi beads by Lamas to make them "pure" and give them supernatural power to replace that lost by taking small chips, "digs," from a bead to be ingested as an ingredient in a curative potion, it is not difficult to understand how they fail to appreciate the "scarred" beauty of age and experience and even see it as a ''useful'' defacement, but a defacement nonetheless.  Superstitious ritual and belief integral to creating these scars are, then, equally so in causing the loss in their desirability.  This is distinctly similar to other tribal art wherein cultural belief and ritual are essential to empowering artistic creation.  In the opinion of this writer, the "pure" dzi are the empty canvas, the marble block, and the markings of natural and cultural experience create the one of a kind masterpieces.  

A nice dzi should be made of good quality agate with the cutting, drilling and decorating taking many days. Modern methods and technology such as lasers, modern sugars and chemicals, and [[vacuum chamber]]s can produce very good results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beadbugle.com/html/etched_beads_and_dzi_beads.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516075924/http://www.beadbugle.com/html/etched_beads_and_dzi_beads.html |archivedate=2006-05-16 |df= }} beadbugle&lt;/ref&gt; The waxy appearance is still desirable but is sometimes lacking. Some especially well-made new dzi are accepted by Tibetans because it is safe to wear them in public since they look like ancient dzi. Some{{Who|date=March 2011}} claim the new dzi function with the same efficacy as the old ones; others believe the protective energies of ancient dzi can move into a new dzi, if the stone is of the same quality or better and the two beads are kept together or when binding rituals are performed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Dzi are also popular in [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]]. Genuine ancient dzi are too expensive for most [[Tibetans]]; those who have not owned dzi for generations can no longer afford to buy them. Some of the new dzi have become highly collectible resulting in much higher prices. As was true in ancient days, only a handful of artisans know how to make superior beads today. Less than a dozen people are manufacturing truly high-quality and beautiful beads; not much is known about who they are or where their workshops are.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

With a few exceptions, new beads are not considered to have the mystic associations of the ancient beads, but it is considered possible to give new dzi similar powers with some time and effort: 1) by taking them to be blessed by a [[lama]] or [[guru]]; 2) taking them on [[pilgrimage]]s to holy places such as [[stupa]]s and [[shrines]]; and 3) reciting [[mantras]], as well as taking religious vows with them. An advantage of new dzi beads is that they do not carry any of the bad [[karma]] of previous owners. It is considered possible to rid a stone of bad energy by submerging it in saltwater for several hours, and then fanning [[incense]] over it. The dzi should be treated with respect from that time on. Sun basking and herbal [[smudging]] are also said to purify the beads. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100713055915/http://www.fpmt.org/teachers/zopa/advice/pdf/aromanov01.pdf   Spirit aroma offering] and recitation of [[Cintamani (jewel)|Cintamani]] [[dharani]] are considered helpful in charging the bead as well.

==Imitation dzi ==
Imitation dzi are created from materials other than [[agate]] or [[chalcedony]]. They can be made of glass, resin, lampwork, wood, bone, plastic, metal, or non-traditional etched stones. Imitation dzi have a long history, some dating back a couple of hundred years. The older mock dzi have some collectible value. Some of the resin mock dzi have a filling of [[lead]] to add weight. 

Some people would also call the modern machine-carved and machine-drilled, highly polished new dzi "mock dzi." Almost invariably mass-produced, these are available for less than two dollars, and are often sold by the strand. The etching on these cheap beads has been done very quickly, and the decorations do not penetrate into the inner core of the bead. These are usually targeted for sale to mainland Chinese customers as lucky [[feng shui]] [[charm bracelet|charms]].

==Value==
Market value for ancient beads can easily reach into hundreds of thousands of US dollars - especially for beads with more "eyes." Tiny red cinnabar spots caused by iron inclusion in the agate also increase the value. New etched agate dzi are also highly prized as long as they are well made, contain the traditional patterns, and are made from genuine agate without "dragon skin" or "dragon veins," with a clean, clear look and luster and nicely simulated abrasion signs at the drill holes (these abrasions should slope upward, simulating thousands of years of thread abrasion). New dzi prices range from about ten to two thousand US Dollars, depending on quality and luster. Because of the high value placed on them, Tibetans would typically only part with an authentic dzi bead under very extreme circumstances, such as theft, confiscation by banks or government, or even murder. As a result, many Tibetans have started wearing reproduction dzi in public, out of fear of theft.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Similar to dzi beads are the so-called chung dzi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientbead.com/Etched_beads.html|title=Ancient Etched Beads|website=www.ancientbead.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been imported to Tibet since ancient times.

Some are carnelians or black agate with thin white etching patterns resembling the back of a turtle, which is an ancient pattern that dates back to the era of the [[Harappa]]n Indus culture.  Ancient Roman agate beads as well as etched [[Bactria]]n, [[Middle East]]ern, [[China|Chinese]], [[Afghanistan|Afghan]], [[Yemen]]i,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientbead.com/sulemani_agate_beads.html|title=Sulemani Babagoria agate beads|website=www.ancientbead.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]]n agate and carnelian beads made their way into [[Tibet]]. All these are considered chung dzi (in Tibetan, "chung" means ordinary or common). Chung dzi are believed to have similar properties to real "eyed" dzi; they are less valuable, but they are highly prized by Tibetans and also considered a variety of dzi.

Another similar type of bead is called Luk Mik ("goat’s eye") - it is a naturally formed "one-eyed" coin-shaped&lt;ref name="persee.fr"/&gt; [[agate]] (pictured). Luk Mik are the preferred dzi for travelling in Tibet.

The antique [[Pyu]] and [[Phumtek]] beads of [[Burma]] are also similar in some ways to dzi: they share some of the dzi bead patterns, but instead of agate, the Phumtek are generally made from petrified opalized palm wood, while Pyu beads are often made of red or orange carnelian with some thin white alkali-etched lines.

[[File:Eifelverein Wegweiser.jpg|thumb|upright|A waysign erected by the Eifel Club on a path in [[Eschweiler]]]]
The '''Eifel Club''' ({{lang-de|Eifelverein}}) is one of the largest [[hiking|rambling]] clubs in [[Germany]] with a membership of 28.000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eifelverein.de/go/vereinsinfos.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is the "maintenance of local customs, the protection and care of monuments to which it is particularly committed".&lt;ref&gt;§ 3, para. 1 of its statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eifel Club was founded on 22 May 1888 in the event hall at [[Bad Bertrich]] by Adolf Dronke and, in 2013, it celebrated its 125th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volksfreund.de/nachrichten/region/pruem/aktuell/Heute-in-der-Pruemer-Zeitung-Pruem-Eifelverein-feiert-125-Geburtstag;art8111,3537265 ''Prüm: Eifelverein feiert 125. Geburtstag''] volksfreund.de, Internet release by the [[Trierischer Volksfreund]], 25 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Kaufmann, after whom one of the main footpaths through the Eifel (the ''Karl Kaufmann Way'' between Brühl and Trier) is named, was its chairman for many years, from 1904 to 1938. Since 2011, its president has been local politician, Mathilde Weinandy.

Among its areas of activity are [[hiking|rambling]], the training of hiking guides, [[nature conservation]], the conservation of local culture and youth work. In addition to various books, [[hiking map]]s and route guides, it publishes the "Eifel Yearbook" and, at irregular intervals, roughly five times a year, the members' magazine ''Die Eifel''. The Eifel Club, together with the History and Ancient History Society of Mayen and the surrounding area, the town of [[Mayen]] and the county of [[Mayen-Koblenz]] supports the Eifel Museum in the castle of [[Genovevaburg]] in Mayen. It also runs the youth hostel of "Schilsbachtal" by the [[Rur Reservoir]] Schwammenauel in [[Simmerath]]-[[Woffelsbach]]. Since 1899, the club has owned the [[Manderscheid Castles#Lower ward|lower ward]] of the castle at [[Manderscheid, Bitburg-Prüm|Manderscheid]], the ruins of which it has since carefully renovated and also made available for events.

The Eifel Club is the German sponsor of the European Agreement for the Eifel and Ardennes (EVEA), to which Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany have belonged since 1955. France was also a founder member but left in 1998. From 1983 to 1993 the Eifel Club organised the Euregio Star Walk at the [[tripoint]] of [[Vaals]], where the borders of the Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands meet.

The head office of the club, which has 160 local branches, is in the town of [[Düren]].

The '''Filipino Malaysians''' consists of people of full or partial [[Filipino people|Filipino]] descent who were born in or immigrated to [[Malaysia]]. Filipino in Malaysia comprise migrants and residents from the [[Philippines]] and their descendants living in [[Malaysia]]. Because of the short distance between the two nations, many Filipinos mainly from the [[Mindanao]] islands have migrated to the Malaysian state of [[Sabah]] to escape from the [[Moro conflict in the Philippines|war in the Southern Philippines]], [[Poverty in the Philippines|poverty]] and in search for better lives. 325,089 Filipinos live in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="no"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090206-187868/No-foreign-workers-layoffs-in-Malaysia |title=No foreign workers' layoffs in Malaysia |last=Uy |first=Vernoica |date=6 February 2009 |publisher=Global Enquirer |accessdate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209101514/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090206-187868/No-foreign-workers-layoffs-in-Malaysia |archivedate=9 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ops"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ops.gov.ph/namsummit2003/backgrounder.htm |title=Filipino workers in Malaysia |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |location=Philippines |year=2003 |accessdate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423065955/http://www.ops.gov.ph/namsummit2003/backgrounder.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are illegal residents while there are a smaller number of migrant workers and fewer permanent residents.&lt;ref name="no"/&gt;

== History ==
Most of the Filipinos especially the [[Bajau people|Bajau]] had lived around the state of Sabah even since before the colonial period, while the [[Tausūg people|Suluk]] had lived on the eastern part of [[Sabah]] from [[Kudat]] to [[Tawau]] as these areas was once under the influence of the [[Sultanate of Sulu]]. Other Filipinos [[Kababayan]] such as [[Hiligaynon people|Ilonggo]], [[Waray people|Waray]], [[Zamboangueño]] (living in Semporna since prior to the creation of Malaysia), [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] and [[Bicolanos]] then come to [[North Borneo]] (present-day Sabah) in 1920s and 1930s to work under the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] and various private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/09/28/kababayan-community-holds-first-gathering-in-sabah/|title=Kababayan community holds first gathering in Sabah|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=28 September 2015|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of the Filipinos in Malaysia are [[Moro people|Moros]].

==Illegal immigration and crime issues==
{{See also|Refugees of the Philippines|Illegal immigrants in Malaysia|Cross border attacks in Sabah}}
The majority of undocumented Filipinos live in the Malaysian state of Sabah,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000313|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185538/http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000313|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 March 2016|title=Undocumented Filipino migrants in Malaysia to be assisted|date=1 February 2005|publisher=[[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|DOLE]] News|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most of them coming from the Mindanao islands. They are frequently targeted by the Malaysian immigration for repatriation. In 2002, the first major crackdown on [[illegal immigration]] occurred, with around 64,000 Filipinos being repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippines.hvu.nl/facts7.htm|title=Filipino's working abroad |year=2002|publisher=Hogeschool Utecht|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 4,000 to 6,000 Filipinos are deported each year for immigration offences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trafficking.org.ph/v5/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1014&amp;Itemid=56|title=330 Filipinos home after being deported from Sabah |last=Jacinto|first=Al|date=17 October 2005|publisher=Manila Times|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippines government]] says that there is a large number of Filipinos detained in various immigration centres of Malaysia awaiting [[deportation]].

==Notable people==
&lt;small&gt;Almost all figures in the list of the notable people Filipino descent in Malaysia are of mixed descent, particularly with the natives of Sabah. Mixed-marriage is a pattern which is shared with most of Filipino descent in Malaysia (excluding to the recently arrived migrants), after settling in the Malaysian soil after generations, assimilation process and the common Islamic background.&lt;/small&gt;

(22064a-c).jpg|thumb|upright=2|A late 18th-century parody of the genpuku (coming-of-age ceremony) of a minister, with most of the celebrants represented by courtesans.]]
'''Genpuku''' (元服&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;), a Japanese coming-of-age ceremony modeled after an early [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] Chinese custom, dates back to Japan's classical [[Nara period|Nara Period]] (710–794&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; This ceremony marked the transition from child to adult status and the assumption of adult responsibilities. The age of participation varied throughout history and depended on factors such as sex, political climate, and social status. Most participants were aristocratic children between the ages of 10 and 20, and most descriptions of genpuku focus on the male ceremony rather that the female ceremony due to the exclusion of women from politically important court positions and warrior status. Important changes in clothing and hairstyle typically denoted this transition, for both men and women. Youth and children were often synonymous, and a period of adolescence was not often present throughout the periods in which traditional genpuku flourished. The etymology of the word, which is atypical, reflects the major points of genpuku ceremonial format; in this case ''gen'' (元&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;) means "head" and ''fuku'' (服&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;) means "wearing". The ceremony is also known as '''kakan''' (加冠&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;), '''uikōburi''' (初冠&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;), '''kanrei''' (冠礼&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;), '''shufuku''' (首服&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;), and '''hatsu-motoyui''' (初元結&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;).

== General ceremonial format ==
Genpuku was traditionally considered a Major [[Rite]], an important ritual affecting life course in which a child exchanged their childhood status for an adult status, and continues from the Nara (710–794&amp;nbsp;AD) into the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]] (1603–1868). The ceremony was usually backed by an older society member of political importance, and included the exchange of a childhood name for a new adult name (烏帽子名 ''eboshi-na''), the adoption of adult hairstyles and clothing, and the assumption of adult responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Red Thread: Buddhist Approaches to Sexuality|last = Faure|first = Bernard|publisher = Princeton UP|year = 1998|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 251–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genpuku was undergone by both males and females, but was differentiated by ceremonial dress, with men receiving signifying headgear such as a ceremonial court cap (kanmuri) or samurai helmet and women receiving, instead, a pleated skirt (mogi 裳着&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Dog Shogun: The Personality and Policies of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi|last = Bodart-Bailey|first = Beatrice M.|publisher = U of Hawai'i|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Honolulu|pages = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population, and members of the population, participating in genpuku depended largely upon both which historical time period the ceremony took place in and what kind of government was in place at the time. Specific ceremonial formats are built around specific constructions of class, rank, and time period.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Child roles as preparation for adult roles ==
Since aristocratic children between the ages of 10 and 20 took part in genpuku in order to assume adult status and responsibilities, the role of the aristocratic child was to prepare for adult life. For both male and female children, studies in the [[Heian period|Heian Period]] began between ages 3 and 4, usually under the supervision of a wet nurse and perhaps her husband.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Children of these ages were taught about key court ceremonies, Buddhist doctrine, and proper ethics. At the age of seven they moved on to more formal learning, specifically studying the skills needed to navigate court life and to succeed in court positions. Skills included, but were by no means limited to, handwriting and calligraphy, and were mainly an education requirement for male children; however, the education of girls was important as well. The ultimate goal of children, whether they were male or female, was to successfully carry on their families tradition and reputation. Proper education for girls tied to successful or advantageous marriage, or their future ability to maintain a wealthy patron within the court.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Nara and Heian Periods (710–1192) ==
[[File:藤原冬嗣.jpg|thumb|A politician and court noble during the Heian Period seen wearing traditional court cap and garb.]]
The earliest official record of genpuku in Japan dates back to the Nara period (710–794&amp;nbsp;AD), and the ceremony itself is based on an earlier Chinese custom in the Tang Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;De Vos, George (1973). ''Socialization for Achievement: Essays on the Cultural Psychology of the Japanese''. University of California Press. pp. 312-320.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the Nara, the ceremony flourished throughout the aristocratic [[Heian period|Heian Period]] (794–1185&amp;nbsp;AD), the last classical period in which Japan was governed by an aristocratic court.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Tale of Flowering Fortunes: Annals of Japanese Aristocratic Life in the Heian Period|last = McCullough|first = William &amp; Helen|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 1980|isbn = 9780804710398|location = |pages = 372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children during Heian were not recognized as officially gendered before genpuku, and were said to have remained near the gods as "children of the kami".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As children of the gods, those who had not undergone genpuku were often seen as youthful mediums and were some of the primary performers of ritual exorcisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, clothing and attire of childhood were ungendered and it was not uncommon for male children to wear makeup often as ''wakashū.'' In the period between early childhood and genpuku, boys were classified as ''[[wakashū]]''.
[[File:Junihitoe.jpg|thumb|A young woman models a Junihitoe, a 12-layered formal court dress worn by women during the Heian period, during a demonstration of traditional Japanese culture.]]
During these periods, primarily male members of the aristocracy between the ages of seven and fifteen engaged in genpuku.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ceremony was generally a precursor to obtaining court cap (kanmuri) and rank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Parents chose when to hold their children's genpuku based on a number of factors, including the arrival of a suitable opportunity, the child's readiness for court service, the presence of one or more influential court backers, and the parents' ability to finance the ceremony.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rewriting Medieval Japanese Women: Politics, Personality, and Literary Production in the Life of Nun Abutsu|last = [[Christina Laffin|Laffin]]|first = [[Christina Laffin|Christina]]|publisher = University of Hawai'i Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Honolulu|pages = 7–13, 52, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once it was deemed an appropriate time for a child to undergo genpuku, a variety of preparations were made for the upcoming ceremony. The child had to acquire a "capping parent", usually a person of influence, who would help the child don the ritual clothing of adulthood, most significantly a ceremonial court hat (kanmuri).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Both the capping parent and the biological parents made preparations for the ceremony, but the capping parent was more active in making arrangements.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The genpuku ceremony itself almost always took place in the evening on a predetermined "auspicious day," either at the residence of a Kakan (dignitary) or at the Shishinden (Kyoto Imperial Palace).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When the capping ceremony was held for the son of a Counselor or Consultant, the capping parent was most often a Kakan and the ceremony took place at a Kakan's residence. When the ceremony was held for an Emperor or Crown prince, the current Emperor would sometimes cap the initiate within the Shishinden.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The capping parent was joined by another important ceremonial participant, either the Nokan (if an Emperor was undergoing the ceremony) or a Rihatsu, who "loosened the childhood coiffure, cut the ends of the hair, bound the head with a fillet, and otherwise prepared the boy to receive the cap".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the capping, the child retreated to a private room to exchange his ungendered wide-sleeved childhood robes for adult male robes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The transition from child to adult was complete, and feasting followed closely thereafter.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Genpuku and adult status were accompanied by marriage eligibility, gendering, a removal from the male "erotic gaze" within court, the abandon of makeup use for males, and the opportunity to obtain court rank.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Girls engaged in genpuku as well, although the particular ceremonial rituals were more commonly referred to as mogi.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For women, as for men, the ceremony revolved around the presentation of adult clothing; however, women were presented with a pleated skirt, not a court cap.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Girls participating in mogi coming-of-age ceremonies traditionally blackened their teeth, shaved their eyebrows, and applied makeup.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, their long unbound hair was tied on top of their head in an adult hairstyle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Age of the samurai (1185–1868) ==
[[File:Samurai on horseback.png|thumb|Samurai in traditional helmet and garb.]]
In 1185&amp;nbsp;AD the aristocratic court government of classical Japan was replaced by a warrior-administration ushering in the Age of the [[Samurai]]. Just as the sons of aristocracy underwent the ceremony of genpuku to signify their adulthood, so did the sons of warrior nobility. The central feature of genpuku throughout this time period was the placing of a samurai helmet, rather than court cap, by a high status warrior. Adult samurai received their swords and armor at this time. After going through genpuku, youths were expected to do adult labor, and samurai-class men acquired full warrior status and were expected to fight in open battle. In addition, youths gained the right to marry, and to officiate at shrine ceremonies. The ceremony acted to bind youth to the previously mentioned high status warrior. Often this practice was used to confirm and solidify the social status of samurai families. For example, a samurai family of lower status might, through the ceremony of genpuku, become tied to a higher status family. The lower status son would then act as a retainer to the higher status warrior to whom he was tied.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After genpuku, warrior sons were accepted as full adults and welcomed to a career in the warrior-administration.

The average age of genpuku varied over time. For example, throughout the Tokugawa period (1603-1868), the age at which children underwent genpuku depended upon whether there was unrest. Full-fledged warriors were expected to take part in battle, so during the unsettled first years of the Tokugawa period, parents delayed genpuku until their sons were full-grown, at around 20 years old. However, as the country became more peaceful, a transition period resembling adolescence emerged. Young boys underwent genpuku and trained to be warriors under an older warrior, but did not engage in war.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; War acted as a sort of consummation following genpuku, solidifying societal acknowledgement of full adult warrior status. As the long peace continued, the appropriate age to transition from child to adult was lowered in response to dynastic pressures to marry and produce heirs. Boys could not marry until they came of age, so the "adolescent phase" vanished. By the 1700s the average coming of age of samurai-class boys was at 15 to 17, and in the early to mid-1800's it dropped to an average of 13 to 15.

=== Muromachi Period (1338–1573) ===
In the Muromachi Period, a period set within the Age of the Samurai, genpuku gradually spread from the samurai class to include men and women of lower ranks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Within the less wealthy, genpuku was used as a way of acknowledging an entrance into occupational roles, often in the form of apprenticeship. Boys of farming families and the artisan class came of age at 15 to 17, an age that had more to do with their ability to do adult work and take on adult social responsibilities than with their readiness for marriage or war.[1] As a result of the new meanings tied to the ceremony and work, the once solid transitions between childhood and adulthood were lost within the artisan and merchant classes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Adulthood was put off in order that youth could acquire more or new skills related to their future occupations, resulting in the re-emergence of a period resembling adolescence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Seijin shiki – a present-day equivalent ==
[[File:Four beauties.jpg|thumb|Women celebrate, seijin shiki, the modern day equivalent of genpuku.]]
In modern Japan, these ceremonies have been replaced by annual coming-of-age ceremonies for 20-year-olds of both sexes called [[Coming of Age Day|seijin shiki]], or by a ceremony held in school for students who have turned 15 years of age, called a ''risshi-shiki'' (立志式), literally "standing hope ceremony," in which children stand in front of the school and declare their goals for the future. The modern day equivalent to genpuku became popular in the face of post-war hardship and regrowth. After the second World War and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan faced considerable and widespread despondency. Young people are often seen as the hope of the future, and in an attempt to restore hope to Japan and its youth, the town of Warabi, just north of Tokyo, held a Youth Festival. The festival was successful and [[Coming-of-Age Day]] became an official holiday in 1948, "to realise the passage from youth to adulthood, and to celebrate and encourage young people embarking on their adult lives".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Hitokuchi Memo - Coming-of-Age |url=http://www.jpf.org.au/onlinearticles/hitokuchimemo/summer08_comingofage.html |website=www.jpf.org.au |accessdate=2015-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001503/http://www.jpf.org.au/onlinearticles/hitokuchimemo/summer08_comingofage.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note==

In premodern Japan age 15, 16, 17, etc. [[East Asian age reckoning|corresponded]] roughly with modern Japanese and Western ages 14, 15, 16, etc. The average age of genpuku was therefore 15 to 18 in premodern Japanese reckoning, and 14 to 17 in modern reckoning.

There are number of derivations for the title. One theory derives the name Gounder from [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''Kaamindan'', meaning noble protector of the country. It was later modified as ''Kavundan'' or Gounder.&lt;ref name="Madhavan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2516/stories/20080815251611400.htm|title=Steeped in history|last=Madhvan|first=Karthik|date=2 August 2008|work=Frontline|publisher=The Hindu Group|accessdate=22 January 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erupting in June 2008, the '''Grand Regency Scandal''' concerns the sale of the Grand Regency Hotel in Downtown [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], from the [[Central Bank of Kenya]] to an unspecified group of [[Libya]]n investors called "Libya Arab African Investment Company".&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 30 June 2008: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7481140.stm  Probe into Kenya hotel sell-off]&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was directed by Finance Minister [[Amos Kimunya]], leading to passage of near-unanimous censure of Kimunya by the [[Kenyan Parliament]] on 1 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Business Daily, 2 July 2008: [http://allafrica.com/stories/200807021069.html  Kenya: MPs Censure Kimunya Over Sale of Grand Regency Hotel]&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2008 Kimunya submitted his resignation, and called for an investigation to clear his name.

The controversy involves the no-bid nature of the sale, the secrecy under which it was negotiated, the identity of the buyers, and the price of the luxury hotel- reportedly 2.9 billion Kenyan Shillings (approx. US $44 million), around one-third of previous appraisals of the property's value in the neighbourhood of 7 billion Kenyan Shillings (approx, US $114 million). The value of the hotel is disputed by Kimunya. Lands Minister [[James Orengo]] blew the whistle on the sale, charging his fellow cabinet minister, Kimunya, with corruption.

==Background==

The Grand Regency hotel played a minor part in the [[Goldenberg Scandal]], one of the largest corruption scandals uncovered in Kenya (See article: [[Corruption in Kenya]].) Goldenberg involved the trans-shipment of large quantities of gold through Kenya, with a 35% subsidy paid to the Goldenberg company by the Government of Kenya. Much of the gold was smuggled out of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], site of a civil war. It is estimated the earlier scandal cost the country around 10% of one years' GDP, and many of the country's current leaders have been implicated.&lt;ref&gt;Nairobi Chronicle, 25 April 2008: [http://nairobichronicle.wordpress.com/2008/04/25/goldenberg-ghost-haunting-kenya-government/  Goldenberg ghost haunting Kenya Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kamlesh Pattni]], a central figure in the Goldenberg investigations and a founder of the Goldenberg company, reportedly used proceeds from the Goldenberg scandal to build the Grand Regency. In addition to the questionable source of the funds, Pattni acquired the lands from the Central Bank of Kenya in highly suspicious circumstances. Under a law passed in 2002 offering amnesty to those who return proceeds of corruption, Pattni negotiated immunity from prosecution for his role in Goldenberg in exchange for the transfer of the Grand Regency to the Central Bank of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;East Africa Standard, 29 June 2008 http://www.eastandard.net/news/?id=1143989317&amp;cid=4 Grand Regency: What does Kibaki know?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Fallout==

The scandal is the first major test of the [[Grand Coalition government]] following the resolution of the [[2007-2008 Kenyan crisis]]. The Grand Coalition includes Kimunya's [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|Party of National Unity]] (PNU) and their rivals, the [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM).

The political dimensions to the scandal are still unfolding. Kimunya has been identified as a potential successor to President [[Mwai Kibaki]] of PNU, while Orengo is a member of ODM. When first alerted of the sale, Orengo ordered his ministry to block the transfer of the land grant, but members of the Secret Police arrived at the ministry and reportedly threatened Orengo's employees into completing the transfer. Other members of PNU, including presidential aspirant [[Martha Karua]], joined Orengo and ODM in calling for full disclosure of the details of the sale, and Kimunya's resignation or dismissal, though Karua later backed off the call for dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, 7 July 2008 http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=2&amp;newsid=126811 Karua denies calling for Kimunya ouster&lt;/ref&gt; The sole member of Parliament to vote against the motion of censure was PNU-allied vice-president [[Kalonzo Musyoka]], whose own presidential ambitions stands to improve with the divisions within the Kikuyu ethnic block of PNU, giving him a motive to support Kimunya.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, 6 July 2008: [http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=126766  Knives Out in the Kitchen Cabinet]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July, a parliamentary committee investigating the sale issued a preliminary report recommending the suspension of the sale. The committee, headed by PNU-affiliated attorney general [[Amos Wako]], called for the resignation or dismissal of Kimunya, as well as National Intelligence Services, Maj-Gen [[Michael Gichangi]], Central Bank governor [[Njuguna Ndung'u]] and the secretary to the board of directors at the CBK.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, 4 July 2008: [http://allafrica.com/stories/200807040080.html  Kenya: Raila Team Okays Probe Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Parliament refused to consider any bills relating to the Finance Ministry, pending Kimunya's ouster. This included the National Budget.

==Commission==
On 25 November 2008, an official inquiry cleared Kimunya of any wrongdoing. The commission's report was not made public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=nw20081125082409437C484002 Kenya hotel saga: FM off the hook]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
In response to a query by [[Joseph Lekuton]], on 16 December 2008, [[Orwa Ojode]] the Assistant Minister for Provincial Administration and Internal Security confirmed to [[National Assembly of Kenya|parliament]] that the commission had cost the [[Kenya]] Government Kshs 51,224,990.&lt;ref name="Kenya National Assembly Official Record (Hansard)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kenya National Assembly Official Record (Hansard)|url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=6pEheyUSVnkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=16 December 2008|page=4108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On 23 January 2009, Kimunya was reappointed to the cabinet by President [[Mwai Kibaki]] as Minister of Trade.

Western magar are descriptive terms invented by academic linguists and anthropologists for a nationality in the Middle Hills of mid-western Nepal inhabiting highlands extending through eastern ''Rukum'' and northern ''Salyan'', ''Rolpa'' and ''Pyuthan'' Districts in ''Rapti''Zone as well as ''Dhaulagiri'' and ''Bheri'' Zones. They speak a complex of Tibeto-Burman distinct language called magar Pang.But there is no any confusion that magar Pang,magar kaike and magar dhut are same languages they have derived from [[Pali language]].

== History ==

Due to their oral mythology and distinctive Shamanistic practices, Western Magar are thought to have originally migrated from Siberia according to [[Shamanism|shamanic tradition]] but some Magar writers have written that they originated in Rukum district. There is no obvious proof of where they come from.

Oral histories handed down from generations to generations say that Kham people migrated from Norther icy [[Himalayan Region|himalayan region]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s which lies to the southern part of China after the Kham civilization got lost and submerged in the icy glaciers in and around 200 AD. Later on the Kham kings ruled from present Karnali region or ancient Nepal region in the far west. However, after Khas kings from Kumaon and Garwal continued to attack upon Kham kings of Humla and Jumla area in around 400 AD. 

The Kham kings are reported to have fought against brute and uncivilized Khas aggressors for 100s years. But Kham's last kings were defeated when king Khudu was the king. He had fought fiercely against Garra army but could not protect his forth and was deposed. Khas kingdom flourished in the Jumla region which started their rule after which they claimed this region as Khasan.

The Magars divided in 12 kings called 12 Magrant were divided into 12 and 18 clans after which they claimed their family titles. All 12 and 18 clans belonged to the same titled Magars who usually spoke one Magar language and lived around Gandak region. It must be clear that both 12 and 18 Magars spoke one and same Dhut language which is not understood in Rolpa, Rukum, and Karnali region by Kham people despite being known as either, Kham Magar, Magar Kham etc.

== Western Magar ==
Western Magar inhabit highlands {{convert|3000|-|4000|m|ft}} above [[sea level]], some {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the [[Dhaulagiri]] range, forming a triple divide between the Karnali-Bheri system to the west, the Gandaki system to the east, and the smaller (west) Rapti and Babai river systems that separate the two larger systems south of this point. Since the uppermost tributaries of the Karnali and Gandaki rise beyond the highest Himalaya ranges, trade routes linking India and Tibet developed along these rivers, whereas high ridges along the Rapti's northern watershed and then the Dhaulagiri massif beyond were rigorous obstacles. Similarly, Hindu people in Hindu Muslim conflicts brahaman peoples settled out around these highlands with the western magars by following the Mahabharat Range to the south or Dhorpatan valley to the north which—by Himalayan standards—offers exceptionally easy east-west passage. The western magar highlands may also have been left as a buffer between the easternmost Baise kingdom, Salyan, and the westernmost Chaubisi kingdom, Pyuthan. For the Hindu brahaman, the intervening highlands, unsuited for rice cultivation, were hardly worth contesting.

Looking back to the historical pedigree, Kham people are considered to be existing in this Himalyan belt from the time of 3000 years ago, much longer before the birth of [[Buddha]] as they believed in shamanism, while Magars are historically mentioned after 1100 ADs by various foreign researchers.

Kham civilization is said to have given "Pal" title to many of its inhabitants. As a matter of fact, Pal kings were the early rulers of Nepal during which Kham were given the title of Pals at the end of their names. Kham people were fabricated to be Magars later on when various regimes through political upheavals initiated political titles to their Vassals and mixed and merged the ethnic titles of their subjects as per their needs.

== Underdevelopment ==

[[Image:Hashish-shop-Kathmandu-1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Legal hashish shop, Kathmandu, 1973]]

After unification of Nepal coming Shaha king, official neglect, underdevelopment and poverty essentially continued through the 19th and 20th centuries. The main export was manpower as mercenaries to the British and Indian armies, or whatever other employment opportunities could be found for largely uneducated and unskilled labor. Western magar also practice ''transhumance'' by grazing cattle, sheep and goats in summer pastures in subalpine and alpine pastures to the north, working their way down to winter pastures in the ''Dang-Deukhuri'' valleys. Despite unending toil, food shortages have become a growing problem that still persists. Food deficits were historically addressed by grain imports bought dearly with distant work at low wages.

As some corrupted development brought schools, electricity, motor roads, hospitals and some range of consumer goods to specific surrounding areas, few benefits trickled up into the highlands and contrasts became even more invidious. Development introduced motor transport, which diminished porterage employment. Cultivating hemp and processing it into ''charas'' (hashish) lost standing as an income generator after 1976 when international pressure persuaded the national government to outlaw these recreational drugs and close government stores where those so inclined could freely purchase what was illegal in most of the world. But Hindu government directly indirectly encouraged the drugs.

== Western magar participation in Nepalese Civil War ==
Despite adversity,magar people retained a robust oral history and a sense of past greatness, which created grievances and made them receptive to the ''Maobadi'' (Maoist) movement that opposed the ''Shah regime'' in the 1996-2006 ''Nepalese Civil War'' and even the multiparty democracy that the Shahs toyed with. The Rolpa and Rukum districts in the center of the magars homelands became known as the ''Maoist heartland'' and western magars were prominent as footsoldiers of its guerrilla forces.

== Kham Festivals ==
Bhume Naach / Bal puja is one of the ancient cultural festivals celebrated by the Kham tribes of Rolpa and Rukum. Although they describe themselves as belonging to "Magar" community, their language, culture, historical legends differ. Some of the anthropological and sociological conclusions indicate towards separate ethnic entity of the Kham people who speak Kham language in this region. This community currently is passing through identity crisis as they are engaged in dispute for separate ethnic identity or to retain the same mixed identity of Magars.

The main celebration takes place during the first week of June.
Kham people dance very slowly in Jholeni and Bhume dance while Magars dance a fast dance in Kaura dance. Currently Kham people worship their ancestors through bon shamanism while Magars have adopted Buddhism as their religion to express their cultural rites.
Kham are also politically elevated in Nepali politics while Magars are elevated in Police, Army and Armed Police or in civil servants.

'''Lawrence S. Krasner''' (born 1961) is an American lawyer, former civil rights attorney and public defender serving as the 26th and current [[District Attorney of Philadelphia]] since 2018.&lt;ref name="new yorker campaign to end"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/larry-krasners-campaign-to-end-mass-incarceration|title=Larry Krasner’s Campaign to End Mass Incarceration|work=The New Yorker|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As DA of Philadelphia, Krasner became prominent for spearheading [[Criminal justice reform in the United States|criminal justice reform]].

==Early life and education==
Krasner was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="krasnerforda.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krasnerforda.com/meet-larry|title=Meet Larry|website=Larry Krasner for Philadelphia District Attorney|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, the son of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] immigrants, wrote [[crime fiction]], and his mother was an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/city/Longtime-civil-rights-attorney-Larry-Krasner-wants-to-reform-DAs-office.html|title=Civil rights attorney Larry Krasner: DA's Office is 'off the rails'|last=Terruso|first=Julia|date=May 12, 2017|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|access-date=May 20, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family eventually moved to the Philadelphia area while he was still in school.&lt;ref name="krasnerforda.com"/&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2018}}

Krasner attended the [[University of Chicago]], graduating in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://magazine.uchicago.edu/9904/html/news80.htm Class Notes], ''University of Chicago Magazine'', Volume 91, Number 4, April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[Stanford Law School]], graduating in 1987.&lt;ref name="krasnerforda.com"/&gt;

==Career==
After graduation he moved back to Philadelphia to work for the [[Federal public defender#United States|Federal Public Defender]]’s Office.&lt;ref name="krasnerforda.com"/&gt; In 1993, Krasner opened his own law firm.&lt;ref name="new yorker campaign to end"/&gt;

Krasner has worked as a [[criminal defense lawyer]] in Philadelphia for 30 years,&lt;ref name="intercept"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/05/16/meet-philadelphias-progressive-candidate-for-da-an-interview-with-larry-krasner/|title=Meet Philadelphia’s Progressive Candidate for DA: An Interview With Larry Krasner|first=Alice|last=Speri|website=The Intercept|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new yorker campaign to end" /&gt; specializing in [[civil rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/city/Longtime-civil-rights-attorney-Larry-Krasner-wants-to-reform-DAs-office.html|title=Civil rights attorney Larry Krasner: DA's Office is 'off the rails'|publisher=|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently represented protestors pro bono.&lt;ref name="intercept"/&gt; His representation for members of movements like [[Black Lives Matter]] and [[Occupy Wall Street|Occupy Philadelphia]] led many to call him an "anti-establishment" candidate.&lt;ref name="philly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/2017-primary-election-roundup-Philadelphia-Pennsylvania.html|title=2017 Pennsylvania Primary Election Roundup: Who won and lost|publisher=|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Krasner-win-is-a-brand-new-revolution-for-Philly.html|title=This wasn't just a primary victory.

==Philadelphia District Attorney==
=== Election ===
There was no incumbent D.A. in the race as sitting Philadelphia D.A. [[R. Seth Williams]] announced that he would not run for reelection in February 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Greg Salisbury, [http://www.cityandstatepa.com/content/philly-da-seth-williams-won%E2%80%99t-run-re-election Philly DA Seth Williams won't run for re-election], ''City &amp; State'' (February 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; and pleaded guilty to federal [[bribery]] charges in June 2017, resigning from office. (The acting D.A., Kathleen Martin, chose not to run.)&lt;ref&gt;Jon Hurdle, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/us/philadelphia-district-attorney-seth-williams-bribery-guilty-plea.html Philadelphia District Attorney Pleads Guilty to Bribery and Resigns], ''New York Times'' (June 29, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; When Krasner announced his candidacy, the president of the Philadelphia police union described his candidacy as "hilarious."&lt;ref name="new yorker campaign to end" /&gt; Krasner received no major newspaper endorsements.&lt;ref name="new yorker campaign to end" /&gt;

Krasner won a crowded, seven-way Democratic primary on May 16, 2017, defeating former city and federal prosecutor Joe Khan (who placed second); former Philadelphia Managing Director Rich Negrin; former First Assistant District Attorney Tariq El-Shabazz; former prosecutor Michael Untermeyer; former prosecutor Jack O'Neill; and former Municipal Court Judge Teresa Carr Deni.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/17/528774227/enthusiastic-democrats-lead-anti-establishment-da-candidate-to-victory|title=Enthusiastic Democrats Lead Anti-Establishment DA Candidate To Victory|first=Bobby|last=Allyn|website=NPR.org|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WinsPrimary"&gt;Chris Brennan &amp; Julia Terruso, [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/city/Krasner-holds-early-lead-in-Democratic-primary-for-DA-in-Philly.html Krasner declared winner of Democratic primary for DA in Philly], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (May 17, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017PrimaryDAResults"&gt;[https://www.philadelphiavotes.com/en/resources-a-data/ballot-box-app 2017 PRIMARY DISTRICT ATTORNEY-DEM], Office of the Philadelphia City Commissioners.&lt;/ref&gt; City officials reported that voter turnout in this race spiked nearly 50 percent, compared to the last contested race for district attorney of Philadelphia, in 2009.&lt;ref name="billypenn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://billypenn.com/2017/05/17/major-increase-in-philly-voter-turnout-propels-larry-krasner-to-victory//|title=Major increase in Philly voter turnout propels Larry Krasner to victory|first=Mark|last=Dent|website=Billy Penn|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary was widely seen as the proxy election, as the winner of the primary was the presumptive victor of the general,&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt; as registered Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans in Philadelphia by almost 7-to-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyvoice.com/republicans-are-officially-least-registered-political-party-philadelphia/|title=Republicans are officially the least-registered political party in Philadelphia|date=September 20, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/09/15/philadelphia-independents-outnumber-republicans/|title=In Philly, Independents and Third-Party Voters Now Outnumber Republicans|date=September 15, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November general election, Krasner defeated Republican Beth Grossman, a former assistant district attorney, by a 3–1 margin.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Brennan &amp; Aubrey Whelan, [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/city/larry-krasner-wins-race-for-philly-da-20171107.html Larry Krasner wins race for Philly DA], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (November 7, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
In his first week in office, Krasner fired 31 prosecutors from the District Attorney's Office, including both junior and career supervisory staff. Up to one-third of the homicide prosecutors in the office were dismissed, and the total number of those fired represented as many as a 10% reduction in the number of Philadelphia assistant district attorneys.&lt;ref&gt; Chris Palmer, Julie Shaw &amp; Mensah M. Dean, [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/larry-krasner-philly-da-firing-prosecutors-20180105.html Krasner dismisses 31 from Philly DA's Office in dramatic first-week shakeup], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (January 5, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Briggs &amp; Max Marin, [http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news/leaked-list-shows-krasner-firings-targeted-top-staff-porngate-prosecutors/article_960fda64-f271-11e7-b901-2f37b4f5508e.html Leaked list shows Krasner firings targeted top staff, "Porngate" prosecutors], ''Philadelphia Weekly'' (January 5, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Krasner announced that law enforcement would no longer pursue criminal charges against those caught with marijuana possession.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.phillymag.com/news/2018/02/16/krasner-big-pharma-marijuana-possession/|title=Larry Krasner Sues Big Pharma, Drops All Marijuana Possession Charges|date=February 16, 2018|work=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=February 17, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Krasner instructed prosecutors to stop seeking cash bail for those 'accused of some misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/philadelphia-larry-krasner-cash-bail-reform-20180221.html|title=Philly DA Larry Krasner won't seek cash bail in certain crimes|work=Philly.com|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krasner said that it was unfair to keep people in detention simply because they could not afford bail.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also announced that the DA's office had filed a lawsuit against a number of pharmaceutical companies for their role in the city's [[opioid epidemic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Krasner instructed prosecutors to stop charging sex workers who had fewer than three crime convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/03/20/larry-krasner-philadelphia-da/|title=Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner Promised a Criminal Justice Revolution. He’s Exceeding Expectations.|last=King|first=Shaun|date=March 20, 2018|website=The Intercept|language=en-US|access-date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, it was reported that Krasner's staffers were working on creating a sentence review unit–the first of its kind in the country–to review past cases and sentences, and seek re-sentencing in cases where individuals were given unduly harsh punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/03/20/the-das-who-want-to-set-the-guilty-free|title=The DAs Who Want to Set the Guilty Free|work=The Marshall Project|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2018, it was reported that Krasner instructed prosecutors to: "Offer shorter prison sentences in plea deals. Decline certain classes of criminal charges. And explain, on the record, why taxpayers should fork over thousands of dollars per year to incarcerate people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/philadelphia-district-attorney-larry-krasner-plea-deals-shorter-sentences-cost-of-mass-incarceration-20180315.html|title=In latest edict, Philly DA Larry Krasner tells prosecutors to seek lighter sentences, estimate costs of incarceration|work=Philly.com|access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that: "Fiscal responsibility is a justice issue, and it is an urgent justice issue. A dollar spent on incarceration should be worth it. Otherwise, that dollar may be better spent on addiction treatment, on public education, on policing and on other types of activity that make us all safer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whyy.org/segments/philly-da-wants-prison-costs-included-as-judge-calculates-offenders-debt-to-society/|title=Philly DA wants prison costs included as judge calculates offender’s debt to society|work=whyy.org|access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2018, it was reported that some judges had rejected the reduced sentences which Krasner's prosecutors had sought for juveniles which had previously been sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/krasner-juvenile-lifer-judge-rejecting-deals-20180406.html|title=Philly judges block DA Krasner's deals for juvenile lifers|work=Philly.com|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, it was reported that Krasner had requested a comprehensive list of police officers who had lied while on duty, used excessive force, racially profiled, or violated civil rights. According to the [[The Philadelphia Inquirer|''Philadelphia Inquirer'']], "The exercise, unprecedented in scope in recent city history, is designed to help prosecutors flag officers with credibility issues early in a case and possibly prevent their testimony".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/philly-da-larry-krasner-seeking-to-develop-comprehensive-list-of-tainted-cops-20180604.html|title=Philly DA Larry Krasner seeking to develop comprehensive list of tainted cops|work=Philly.com|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marital rape in United States law''', also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. It is a form of [[partner rape]], of [[domestic violence]], and of [[sexual abuse]]. Today, marital rape is illegal in all 50 [[US states]].

The legal history of marital rape laws in the [[United States]] is a long and complex one, that spans over several decades. The criminalization of marital rape in the United States started in the mid-1970s and by 1993 marital rape became a crime in all 50 states, under at least one section of the sexual offense codes. During the 1990s, most states differentiated between the way marital rape and non-marital rape were treated. The laws have continued to change and evolve, with most states reforming their legislation in the 21st century, but differences remain in some states, in particular in South Carolina.

==History to 1993==
The views which contributed to rape laws not being applicable in marriage can be traced, at least partially, to 17th century [[English common law]], which was imported to the British American colonies. The 17th-century English jurist, [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (1609-1676), stated the position of the common law in ''[[Historia Placitorum Coronæ|The History of the Pleas of the Crown]] (posthumously, 1736)'' that a "husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind to her husband which she cannot retract". The ruling, although no legal record of which is found earlier than Hale, likely relied on even earlier standards. In a case of [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Lord Audley's]] (1488-1544), for instance, he cites the jurist [[Bracton]] (c. 1210- c. 1268) in support of this rule, said to derived from laws of King [[Æthelstan]] (r. 927-939) where upon the law holds that even "were the party of no chaste life, but a whore, yet there may be ravishment: but it is a good plea to say she was his concubine".&lt;ref&gt;Geis, Gilbert.  "Rape in Marriage: Law and Law Reform in England, the United States, and Sweden,"  Adelaide Law Review, 1978; 6(2):285.&lt;/ref&gt; This would continue to be accepted as a statement of the law in [[England and Wales]] until it was overturned by the [[House of Lords]] in the case of ''R. v. R'' in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html ''R. v. R'' &amp;#91;1992&amp;#93; 1 AC 599.]&lt;/ref&gt;  where it was described as an anachronistic and offensive legal fiction.

The strong historical influence of [[Christianity]] in the US may have also played a role: the [[Bible]] at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a "conjugal debt" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to [[sex outside marriage]] which is considered a [[sin]]) and states that "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except with consent (...)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians%207:3-7:5&amp;version=NKJV Biblegateway.com]&lt;/ref&gt; - and this is interpreted by some conservative religious figures as rejecting the possibility of marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html ADN.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203959/http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, prior to the mid-1970s marital rape was exempted from ordinary rape laws. The exemption is also found in the 1962 [[Model Penal Code]], which stated that "A male who has sexual intercourse with a '''female not his wife''' is guilty of rape if: (...)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/model_penal_code_sel_sec2.pdf Wps-prenhall.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205803/http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/model_penal_code_sel_sec2.pdf |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Oregon v. Rideout]] case in December 1978, a jury acquitted John Rideout of raping his wife. This led many American states to allow prosecution for marital and cohabitation rape.&lt;ref name="Woodworth-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Woodworth |first=Whitney |title=Rape and Marriage: A look back at the Rideout case |url=http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/crime/2016/08/13/rape-and-marriage-look-back-rideout-case/88460204/ |date=13 August 2016 |website=Statesman Journal |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, courts have struck down the marital exemption as unconstitutional. In the 1984 [[New York Court of Appeals]] case of ''People v. Liberta'', judge [[Sol Wachtler]] stated that "a marriage license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape his wife with impunity. A married woman has the same right to control her own body as does an unmarried woman".&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.law.miami.edu/zfenton/documents/Peoplev.Liberta.pdf ''People v. Liberta'' 64 N.Y.2d 152, 474 N.E.2d 567, 485 N.Y.S.2d 207(1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Alabama]], the marital exemptions from the sodomy law (''Williams v. State'' (1986)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.ua.edu/colquitt/crimmain/crimcase/wms.htm Law.ua.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202750/http://www.law.ua.edu/colquitt/crimmain/crimcase/wms.htm |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and from the rape law (''Merton v. State'' (1986)&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/alabama/court-of-appeals-criminal/1986/500-so-2d-1301-0.html ''Merton v. State'' 500 So.2d 1301 (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;) were found unconstitutional.

By 1993, all states had withdrawn the marital rape exemptions, the last states to do so being [[Oklahoma]] and [[North Carolina]]&lt;ref name="ncvc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32701 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime - Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (both in 1993) or the exemption had been declared judicially to be unconstitutional.

==Legislative evolution since 1993==
Although marital rape exemptions had been withdrawn in all states by 1993 or been declared judicially to be unconstitutional, in only 17 states was marital rape treated the same as non-marital rape. In the other states there continued to be significant differences in the way marital and non-marital rape were treated, such as less severe penalties, or excluding situations where no violence is used, or shorter reporting periods.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Raquel Kennedy, [http://www.taasa.org/library/pdfs/TAASALibrary104.pdf "Marital Rape"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006080602/http://www.taasa.org/library/pdfs/TAASALibrary104.pdf |date=2011-10-06 }} on the site of the Applied Research Forum, National Electronic Network on [[Violence against women|Violence Against Women]].

During the 1990s many states differentiated between three categories of victims:&lt;ref name="Hawaii.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=villanovalwps Law.bepress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195932/http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=villanovalwps |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Unmarried persons, who had full protection by sexual offenses laws,
*Married persons who were in an abnormal marriage (e.g. separated, one spouse had filed for divorce etc.), who were often treated in an intermediate way, although many states treated them either as unmarried persons or as married cohabiting persons, and
*Married persons cohabiting (spouses living together under ordinary circumstances), many state laws were initially very restrictive, criminalizing only the "worst"  forms of domestic sexual violence (e.g. requiring violence, a higher level of threat, injury etc.; and often punishing the crime less severely).

In the 1990s and beyond, [[feminists]], women's and other organizations have continued to lobby for the amendment of marital rape laws to ensure marital rape is regarded and treated like any other rape, though [[Rape in the United States|rape laws in the United States]] are not uniform, and the laws have changed numerous times, but differences remain in some states.

[[South Carolina]], for example, remains the only state where the force or violence used or threatened must be of a higher level (force or violence must be of a "high and aggravated nature" - see section below [[Marital rape (United States law)#Current State laws|Current State laws]]).

A similar law existed in [[Tennessee]] until 2005, when it was repealed. The law stated that a person could be guilty of the rape of a spouse at a time they are living together only if that person either "was armed with a weapon or any article used or fashioned in a manner to lead the alleged victim to reasonably believe it to be a weapon" or "caused serious bodily injury to the alleged victim". This meant that, in practice, most cases of marital rape could not be prosecuted, since few rapes involve such extreme circumstances. The law was finally repealed in 2005, allowing for marital rape to be treated like any other type of rape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshealthnews.wordpress.com/2008/11/05/why-reproductive-rights-advocates-need-to-start-paying-attention-to-tennessee/ Womenshealthnews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=%20SB0556&amp;GA=104 Wapp.capitol.tn.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/ Lexisnexis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill to repeal the old law has been introduced more than ten times before it succeeded.

Until 2013, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] had an exemption preventing a spouse from being prosecuted with third-degree-rape against the other spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/05/02/washington-closes-troubling-marital-rape-loophole-to-the-relief-of-wives|title=Washington Closes Troubling Marital Rape Loophole, to the Relief of Wives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington removed its exemptions for first-degree rape and second-degree rape in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcsap.org/sites/wcsap.huang.radicaldesigns.org/files/uploads/addressing_public_policy/Marital_Rape_PP_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but the exemption for third-degree rape was removed 30 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=1108&amp;year=2013|title=Washington State Legislature|website=app.leg.wa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study found that "twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have abolished marital immunity for sexual offenses [...] twenty-six states retain marital immunity in one form or another".&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=wps&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2003, several states have reformed their laws (see above).

==Current state laws==
Some states continue to treat marital and non-marital rape differently. The relevant laws are detailed below.

In [[Ohio]], a rape that happens in marriage when the spouses are living together can only be charged under subsection A(2) of ''2907.02 Rape'', which states that: "No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force." By contrast, a person who is not married to the accused or who is married but living separate and apart can rely on many laws which deal with various forms of coercion. It is notable that subsection A(1)(a)
of ''2907.02 Rape'' that deals with drugging someone "surreptitiously or by force, threat of force, or deception" to coerce them into sex does not apply in marriage (except in case of separation). The whole article ''2907.03 Sexual battery'', that deals with various forms of coercion (for instance it states in subsection in A (1) that "The offender [commits a crime when he] knowingly coerces the other person to submit by any means that would prevent resistance by a person of ordinary resolution") does not apply at all to married people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2907.02 Codes.ohio.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2907.03 Codes.ohio.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legiscan.com/OH/bill/HB234/2015|title=Ohio HB234 - 2015-2016 - 131st General Assembly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced to remove these exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auroraadvocate.com/latest+headlines/2015/05/26/ohio-legislators-propose-removing-statute-of-limitations-on-rape-convictions|title=Ohio legislators propose removing statute of limitations on rape convictions|website=Aurora Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Maryland]] law states that, if the spouses are living together, a prosecution can take place only if the accused "uses force or threat of force and the act is without the consent of the spouse."  If the spouses are separated they are treated as if they were strangers (See Section § 3-318)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Maryland, Criminal Law, Sec. 3–318|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcr&amp;section=3-318&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2018RS&amp;tab=subject5|website=General Assembly of Maryland|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar situation exists in [[Mississippi]]. A person can be convicted of sexual battery of a spouse when they are living together only if he engages in "forcible penetration against the victim's will".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/97/003/0099.htm Mscode.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016003207/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/97/003/0099.htm |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This excludes, among others, situations where the victim is "rendered incapable of knowing or controlling his or her conduct, or incapable of resisting an act due to the influence of any drug, narcotic, anesthetic, or other substance administered to that person without his or her consent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/97/003/0097.htm Mscode.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017053505/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/97/003/0097.htm |date=2012-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nevada]] law appears to require force or threat of force. Article 200.373 states that: "It is no defense to a charge of sexual assault that the perpetrator was, at the time of the assault, married to the victim, if the assault was committed by force or by the threat of force."&lt;ref name="leg.state.nv.us"&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-200.html#NRS200Sec366 Leg.state.nv.us]&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to imply that if force or threat of thereof were not used, marriage can be a defense. The general definition of sexual assault uses the wording "against the will of the victim" or "under conditions in which the perpetrator knows or should know that the victim is mentally or physically incapable of resisting or understanding the nature of his or her conduct".&lt;ref name="leg.state.nv.us"/&gt;

In [[Oklahoma]], rape by a spouse can only be charged under subsection (B) of ''Section 1111 - Rape Defined'' which states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=69602 Oscn.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;B. Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a male or female who is the spouse of the perpetrator if force or violence is used or threatened, accompanied by apparent power of execution to the victim or to another person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For instance, a person in Oklahoma can not charge her/his spouse for rape if she/he is compelled to submit due to drugs "administered by or with the privity of the accused as a means of forcing the victim to submit", or when she/he is unconscious, as these situations are dealt under subsection (A) of Section 1111 which define rape as intercourse "with a male or female who is not the spouse of the perpetrator ".

In [[Virginia]], the main difference lies in punishment. Under certain circumstances, if the victim and the attorney for the Commonwealth agree, the perpetrator can undergo a therapy program, which if completed successfully, replaces any punishment. This can happen if "the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and be in the best interest of the complaining witness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-61 Leg1.state.va.us]&lt;/ref&gt; While the victim has to agree to this option, this can expose the victim to intimidation and threats from the perpetrator, or to social pressure to remain in the relationship.

In [[Rhode Island]], Article § 11-37-2 'First degree sexual assault', has four subsections; while subsections 2, 3 and 4 apply to spouses, subsection 1 does not; it reads: "The accused, ''not being the spouse'', knows or has reason to know that the victim is mentally incapacitated, mentally disabled, or physically helpless."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-37/11-37-2.HTM Webserver.rilin.state.ri.us]&lt;/ref&gt; This has the result of excluding from prosecution, among other situations, incidents where the victim was drugged by the perpetrator ("Mentally incapacitated" is defined by legislation as: "a person who is rendered temporarily incapable of appraising or controlling his or her conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, anesthetic, or other substance ''administered to that person without his or her consent'', or who is mentally unable to communicate unwillingness to engage in the act".&lt;ref&gt;[http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-37/11-37-1.HTM Webserver.rilin.state.ri.us]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In [[Minnesota]] sexual violence occurring between spouses at the time they cohabit or between unmarried partners can be prosecuted only if there was force or threat of thereof, due to exemptions created by  Article 609.349 'Voluntary relationships'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.349 Revisor.mn.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; which stipulates that certain sexual offenses do not apply to spouses (unless they are separated), and neither do they apply to unmarried cohabitants. These are offenses that deal with situations where the lack of consent is due to the incapacity of consent of the victim, including where the victim was drugged by the perpetrator. These situations which are excluded from prosecution are where the victim was "mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless". The term "mentally incapacitated" is defined as a person who "under the influence of alcohol, a narcotic, anesthetic, or any other substance, ''administered to that person without the person's agreement'', lacks the judgment to give a reasoned consent to sexual contact or sexual penetration". (see Article 609.341 for definitions).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.341 Revisor.mn.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michigan]], Section 750.520l excludes situations where the criminality comes solely due to the spouse being "mentally incapable, or mentally incapacitated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%282cvl0feqxr35ea552rmon055%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-750-520l Legislature.mi.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Section 750.520a Definitions reads: '"Mentally incapacitated" means that a person is rendered temporarily incapable of appraising or controlling his or her conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, anesthetic, or other substance administered to that person ''without his or her consent'', or due to any other act committed upon that person ''without his or her consent''.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%282cvl0feqxr35ea552rmon055%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-750-520a Legislature.mi.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Connecticut]] has a specific crime dealing with forced sex with a spouse and this doesn't apply only to spouses but also to unmarried cohabitants. The law is more narrow than the other sex laws and it has a shorter penalty. It is called ''Sec. 53a-70b. Sexual assault in spousal or cohabiting relationship'' and it reads:&lt;ref name="cga.ct.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_952.htm#sec_53a-70b|title=Chapter 952 - Penal Code: Offenses|website=www.cga.ct.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No spouse or cohabitor shall compel the other spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other spouse or cohabitor, or by the threat of the use of force against such other spouse or cohabitor which reasonably causes such other spouse or cohabitor to fear physical injury.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The spousal rape law of Connecticut makes reference to force used or threatened against the "other spouse or cohabitor" while the 'ordinary' sexual assault law deals with force used or threatened against the "other person ''or against a third person''".&lt;ref name="cga.ct.gov"/&gt;

[[South Carolina]] represents the most extreme situation. Not only is marital rape punished less severely and the victims have only 30 days to report, but the law requires a higher level of violence to be used. The law, titled "Spousal sexual battery" reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/south-carolina/sc-code/south_carolina_code_16-3-615 Lawserver.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(A) Sexual battery, as defined in Section 16-3-651(h), when accomplished through use of aggravated force, defined as the use or the threat of use of a weapon or the use or threat of use of physical force or physical violence of a high and aggravated nature, by one spouse against the other spouse if they are living together, constitutes the felony of spousal sexual battery and, upon conviction, a person must be imprisoned not more than ten years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Marriageable age and the age of sexual consent==
{{Main|Age of marriage in the United States}}
Although in most states the general [[marriageable age]] is 18, in most of these states a marriage of a person under 18 is allowed with parental and/or court consent. This often creates a conflict between the [[age of consent]] law and the marriageable age, with most [[statutory rape]] laws creating exceptions for minors engaged in a sexual relationship with their lawful spouse - although such minors would otherwise not be able to legally consent to sex. In  [[Iowa]], for instance, subsection (2) of article 709.4 Sexual abuse in third degree, excludes sexual acts committed by adults with children as young as 12, provided the parties are "cohabiting as husband and wife".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/2016/709.4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
This does not refer only to legal marriages, but also to informal cohabitation. (Iowa is one of few states which recognizes [[common law marriage]]) In 2012, a man who got his 13-year-old live-in-girlfriend pregnant tried to rely on this law. The man, who was of Mexican origin, argued that his relation could be considered as similar to marriage under cultural norms as they exist in his Mexican culture. The court rejected this argument, ruling that the exemption could be used only if the couple "objectively cohabited in the status of husband and wife, whether common law or otherwise", not if they merely believed they did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statecasefiles.justia.com/documents/iowa/court-of-appeals/2-660-11-1305.pdf?ts=1346943878 Statecasefiles.justia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The issues of [[child marriage]] and [[forced marriage]] in the US have come to increased scrutiny in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/child-marriage-chart-reveals-girls-can-still-get-married-at-12-in-some-parts-of-the-us-as-lawmakers-a6921246.html|title=You can still get married at 12 in some parts of the US|date=9 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tahirih.org/news/child-marriage-happens-in-the-u-s-too/|title=Child Marriage in America: Current Laws Are Failing to Protect Vulnerable Children and Teens «  Tahirih Justice Center|website=www.tahirih.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matsu dialect''' ([[Eastern Min]]: {{sans-serif|Mā-cū-huâ}} / {{lang|cdo|馬祖話}}) is the local dialect of [[Matsu Islands]], [[Taiwan]]. Native speakers also call it '''Bàng-huâ''' (平話), meaning the language spoken in everyday life. It is recognised one of the statutory languages for public transport announcements in [[Lienchiang County]], ROC.&lt;ref name="大眾運輸工具播音語言平等保障法"/&gt;

It is a subdialect{{what|date=August 2016}} of [[Fuzhou dialect]], [[Eastern Min]]. Matsu dialect is quite similar to [[Changle dialect]], another subdialect of Fuzhou dialect.

Many rimes come in pairs: in the table above, the one to the left represents a close rime (緊韻), while the other represents an open rime (鬆韻). The close/open rimes are closely related with the tones (''[[#The relationship between tone and rime|see below]]'').

===The relationship between tone and rime===
In Matsu dialect, level tone (平聲), rising tone (上聲) and light entering (陽入) should read in close rimes (緊韻); departing tone and dark entering should read in open rimes (鬆韻). 

For example, "{{sans-serif|a̤}}" have two pronunciations, /{{IPA link|ɛ}}/ in close rime and /{{IPA link|a}}/ in open rime; "{{sans-serif|a̤h}}" have two pronunciations, /{{IPA|eʔ}}/ in close rime and /{{IPA|ɛʔ}}/ in open rime. so we get the table:

{| class="wikitable"

| dark departing
| light departing

Close rime tone "{{sans-serif|ă̤}}" should be pronounced as {{IPA|/ɛ˥˥/}} instead of {{IPA|/a˥˥/}}; and open rime tone "{{sans-serif|â̤}}" should be pronounced as {{IPA|/a˩˧˩/}} instead of {{IPA|/ɛ˩˧˩/}}.

===Sandhi and assimilation===
====Tone sandhi====
Matsu dialect has extremely extensive [[tone sandhi]] rules: in an utterance, only the last syllable pronounced is not affected by the rules. The two-syllable tonal sandhi rules are shown in the table below (the rows give the first syllable's original citation tone, while the columns give the citation tone of the second syllable):

{|class=wikitable
|
| bgcolor="#88AAFF"|'''dark level'''&lt;br&gt;55
| bgcolor="#88AAFF"|'''light level'''&lt;br&gt;51
| bgcolor="#88AAFF"|'''light entering'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt;
| bgcolor="#88AAFF"|'''rising'''&lt;br&gt;33
| bgcolor="#88AAFF"|'''dark departing'''&lt;br&gt;312
| bgcolor="#88AAFF"|'''light departing'''&lt;br&gt;131
| bgcolor="#88AAFF"|'''dark entering'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;13&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''dark level'''&lt;br&gt;55
| colspan="3"| &lt;center&gt;rising (33)&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan="4"| &lt;center&gt;light level (51)&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''dark departing'''&lt;br&gt;312
| colspan="3"| &lt;center&gt;rising (33)&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan="4"| &lt;center&gt;light level (51)&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''light departing'''&lt;br&gt;131
| colspan="3"| &lt;center&gt;rising (33)&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan="4"| &lt;center&gt;light level (51)&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''dark entering B'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;13&lt;/u&gt;
| colspan="3"| &lt;center&gt;rising (33)&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan="4"| &lt;center&gt;light level (51)&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''rising'''&lt;br&gt;33
| colspan="3"| half dark departing (31)
| 13&lt;br /&gt;''(dark entering lost its entering coda)''
| colspan="3"| dark level (55)
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''dark entering A'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;13&lt;/u&gt;
| colspan="3"| 31 + {{IPA|/-ʔ/}}&lt;br /&gt;''(half dark departing added a entering coda "{{IPA|/-ʔ/}}")''
| dark entering (&lt;u&gt;13&lt;/u&gt;)
| colspan="3"| light entering (&lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt;)
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''light level'''&lt;br&gt;51
| rising (33)
| colspan="2"| half dark departing (31)
| rising (33)
| colspan="3"| half dark departing (31)
|-
| bgcolor="#9CFF88"|'''light entering'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt;
| colspan="3"| rising (33)&lt;br /&gt;''or'' rising + {{IPA|/-ʔ/}}
| colspan="4"| light level (51),&lt;br /&gt;''or'' light entering (&lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt;)
|-
|}

In the table above, "dark entering A" means dark entering coda ended with {{IPA|/-k̚/}}, "dark entering B" means ended with {{IPA|/-ʔ/}}. In mordern spoken language, it's hard to distinguish with each other in individual syllable, but we can find their differences in tone sandhi.

Like [[Fuzhou dialect]], the tonal sandhi rules of more than two syllables display further complexities.

====Perseverative assimilation====
The two-syllable initial [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] rules are shown in the table below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! bgcolor="#ABCDEF" | The Coda of the Former Syllable
! bgcolor="#ABCDEF" | The Initial Assimilation of the Latter Syllable
|-
| Null coda
|
*{{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/pʰ/}} change to {{IPA|/β/}};
*{{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} change to {{IPA|/l/}};
*{{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/tsʰ/}} change to {{IPA|/ʒ/}};
*{{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/kʰ/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} change to null initial;
*{{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} remain unchanged.
|-

*{{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} change to {{IPA|/n/}};
*{{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/tsʰ/}} change to {{IPA|/ʒ/}};
*{{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/kʰ/}}, {{IPA|/h/}} and null initial change to {{IPA|/ŋ/}};
*{{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} remain unchanged.
|-
| entering coda ({{IPA|/-ʔ/}}, {{IPA|/-k̚/}})
| remain unchanged.
|-
|}

====Anticipatory assimilation====
In Matsu dialect, if rime type of the former syllable is changed while [[#Tone sandhi|tone sandhi]] occurred, the rime of the former syllable should be changed to adapt [[#The relationship between tone and rime|the rule of close/open rimes]].

For example, "{{lang|zh-tw|技}}" {{IPA|/kɛi˧˩˨/}} is a syllable which has dark departing tone, it's an open rime; "{{lang|zh-tw|師}}" {{IPA|/sy˥˥/}} has a dark level tone. When combined together as the phrase "{{lang|zh-tw|技師}}" (technician),  "{{lang|zh-tw|技}}" changes its tonal value to rising tone. Rising tone is a close rime tone, therefore the pronunciation as a whole is {{IPA|/ki˧˧ ly˥˥/}}.

[[Image:Armoury-flickr09.jpg|266px|thumb|Monomakh's Cap in the foreground and Kazan Cap in the background]]
[[Image:Russian regalia.jpg|thumb|270px|Russian regalia used prior to the Great Imperial Crown. The crown is styled after the Monomakh Cap, and was made for [[Michael of Russia|Tsar Michael Fyodorovich]] by Kremlin masters in 1627. The [[wikt:orb|orb]] and [[sceptre]] are of Western-European origin{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and may have been given to [[Boris Godunov|Tsar Boris Godunov]] in 1604.]] 

'''Monomakh's Cap''' ({{lang-ru|шапка Мономаха|translit=shapka Monomakha}}), also called the '''Golden Cap''' ({{lang-ru|шапка Золотая|links=no|translit=shapka Zolotaya}}), is a chief relic of the [[Russia]]n Grand Princes and Tsars. It is a symbol-crown of the [[Russia]]n [[autocracy]], and is the oldest of the crowns currently exhibited at the [[Kremlin Armoury]]. Monomakh's Cap is an early 14th-century [[gold]] [[filigree]] skullcap composed of eight sectors, elaborately ornamented with a scrolled gold overlay, inlaid with [[precious stone]]s ([[ruby]] and [[emerald]]) and pearls, and trimmed with [[sable]]. The cap is surmounted by a simple gold cross with pearls at each of the extremities.  It is not to be confused with the [[Monomachus Crown]] in [[Budapest]].

==Origin==
The main hypothesis is of old-Moscow origin. One of the others is it Central Asian origin (from [[Ethnology|ethnological]] or cultural point of view) has led some modern scholars to view the crown as a gift from [[Uzbeg Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]] to his brother-in-law, [[Ivan Kalita]] of [[Moscow]] during the period of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Tatar yoke]] in Russia.&lt;ref name=Vernadsky&gt;{{cite book| author=Vernadsky, George. | title=History of Russia| location= New Haven | publisher= Yale University Press | year = 1949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris Uspensky]], in particular, argues that the Tatar headgear was originally used in coronation ceremonies to signify the Muscovite ruler's subordination to the khan.&lt;ref name="uspensky"&gt;[[Boris Uspensky|Uspensky, Boris]]. ''Assorted Works'', vol. 1. Moscow, 1996. Pages 89-90, 107-111.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sergey Solovyov]] "after the death of Ivan Kalita all Russian princes traveled to the Horde... and the Khan announced the eldest son of Kalita, Simeon, the Grand Prince of Vladimir".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sergey Solovyov|Solovyov, Sergey]]. ''"History of Russia from the Ancient times"''. Works in 18 volumes. Book II. Volume 3-4. Moscow, 1988. -page 240&lt;/ref&gt; Also Solovyov writes that the first who introduced the [[coronation of the Russian monarch]] was [[Ivan III]] and it took place in 1498. At some point in the 15th or 16th century the crown was surmounted by a cross. {{cn|date=August 2015}}

After Russia overcame the period of feudal fragmentation and [[Ivan III]] of Moscow and [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] asserted [[Third Rome|his position as successor to the Roman emperors]], there arose a legend that the cap had been presented by the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine IX Monomachus]] to his grandson [[Vladimir Monomakh]], the founder of the city of Vladimir and patrilineal ancestor of Ivan III. The legend was elaborated in ''[[The Tale of the Princes of Vladimir]]'' and served as one of the grounds for the "[[Third Rome|Moscow as the Third Rome]]" political theory. Accordingly, the crown became known as "Monomakh's Cap", the term first recorded in a Russian document from 1518. However the fact  that [[Constantine IX Monomachus]] died 50 years before the coronation of Vladimir Monomakh makes the statement really a legend. The first version of the orient origin of the Cap (Uzbeg Khan) was arisen by [[George Vernadsky]]. Vernadsky was pointing to an interesting fact that according to [[Paul Pelliot]] Özbäg can be interpreted as a freeman (maître de sa personne). {{cn|date=August 2015}}

Professor Kramarovsky who was specifically interested in the origin of the cap remarks that according to the technology of the headwear production the origin of the cap is either out of the Volga cities or Crimea where the school of Golden Horde [[filigree]] has developed. According to [[Aleksandr Andreevich Spitsyn]] possibly the cap was initially topped with the similar cross of the [[Jani Beg]] crown, however the German ambassador of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]], [[Sigismund von Herberstein]] (notorious for his [[Notes on Muscovite Affairs]]) does not support that fact. {{cn|date=August 2015}}

After [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] had himself crowned the first Russian Tsar with this headgear, the Polish king asked him to explain the meaning of his new title. To that Ivan replied that whoever is crowned with Monomakh's Cap is traditionally called a tsar, because it was a gift from a tsar (i.e., Constantine IX) who had sent the Metropolitan of [[Ephesus]] to Kiev to crown Vladimir Monomakh with this cap.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sergey Solovyov|Solovyov, Sergey]]. ''History of Russia From the Most Ancient Times'', in 15 volumes. Moscow, 1959-66. Vol. 3, page 516.&lt;/ref&gt; Ivan was presumably not aware that at the time of [[Constantine IX Monomachus]]' death, [[Vladimir Monomakh]] was only two years old and he was not the Kievan sovereign yet. 

The Monomakh Cap was last used in the dual coronation of [[Ivan V]] and [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in 1682, though it was carried in the coronation procession thereafter. When Peter assumed the title of [[emperor]], a new western-style crown was fashioned, but was not used in a coronation until that of [[Catherine I]].&lt;ref name="Massie"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_P3nYBYn3UC&amp;pg=PA61|page=61|title=Peter the Great: His Life and World|first=Robert K.|last=Massie|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|year=2012|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8580">'''Night of Decadence''', commonly referred to as '''NOD''', is a party held every year around [[Halloween]] at [[Wiess College]] at [[Rice University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/1999-10-28/news/nod-so-naughty/|title=NOD So Naughty|publisher=[[Houston Press]]|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was first held in 1972 and quickly became a legendary event at Rice and in [[Houston]], drawing young alumni and students from other universities in addition to Rice students. It was also named to the Top 10 College Parties in America by ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonpress.com/2001-01-11/news/spin-control/3 http://www.houstonpress.com/2001-01-11/news/spin-control/3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
NOD was founded by 4 Wiess College men.  In the early '70s, each college at Rice had an event to raise money to fund the college's parties for the year.  At that time, the drinking age was 18 and the colleges sponsored on-campus parties with alcohol.  Wiess had the least amount of funds.  The Wiess men were tasked with coming up with a fundraiser party.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Year 1: "Night of Decadence" - The general idea was to buy as much booze as they could, pour it into trashcans, and drink.  The concoction was primarily Everclear, cheap wine, and fruit.  (It's probably not hard to believe these were the same men who painted themselves orange to streak Rice-UT baseball, started campus-wide streaks to Mecom Fountain, voted a refrigerator Homecoming Queen, and could not take girls back to Wiess due to general uncouth behavior of Wiess men.) The first year no one from any other college attended.  There were about 30 Wiess men who "attended."  Even so, the college did manage to break even.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Year 2: "Night of Decadence II" - The same no-theme theme continued.  But, a few non-Wiess students attended, even a few women.  The college made a little money the second year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Year 3: "Return of Night of Decadence" - The word was finally getting out.  By the third year, a much larger crowd attended and a large profit was made.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Year 4: "Beyond Night of Decadence" - The year the giant phallus was introduced!  This was also the first time NOD was truly a toga party.  Everyone on campus showed up and it was the major party of the year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Overview ==
The Houston Press suggested the college began adopting a theme for each year's party in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/1999-10-28/news/nod-so-naughty/|title=NOD So Naughty|publisher=[[Houston Press]]|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is wrong.  According to the founders, togas and minimal clothing was there at the beginning.  It has been suggested that in the 1970s and 1980s, many of the themes were historical and/or apocalyptic in nature (e.g. [[Decline of the Roman Empire|The Fall of Rome]], [[Caligula]], [[Armageddon]], [[Animal Farm]], the [[Trojan War]]).  Again, according to the founders, that is incorrect, at least for the first years.  The founders were not going for historical or apocalyptic: The founders made a conscious decision to name the year's NOD with a nod to a movie title.  By the 1990s the themes were generally sexual puns, often based on movie titles (''e.g.'', James Bondage, Lust in Space).

Instead of traditional costumes, students dress as degenerately (or as minimally) as possible. Pregnant nuns and drag dress are some of the tamer outfits. Although there are always several people creatively attired in [[Saran Wrap]] or fishnet stockings and pasties, a typical costume is boxer shorts for men, and bra and panties for women. Because of its overtly sexual context, NOD eventually became a polarizing event on the Rice campus. The university administration has several times tried to shut down the party because of its ability to promote a culture of sexual assault and excessive alcohol abuse. Alternative events on campus include the rapidly growing Evening of Elegance (recently started in 2014), Night of Innocence (offered since at least the 1980s), and, in previous years, Night of Praise and NODgeball. NOD had long been one of the most popular parties on campus, though the decorations have become more conservative in recent years. Each year over one thousand people are usually expected to attend NOD. Recently, however, the party has struggled to break even and is on the point of actually losing money.

Regardless of the stated theme, the decorations for NOD were overtly sexual. For many years NOD's trademark was "Sparky", a giant [[phallus]] built of [[papier-mâché]] and suspended from the ceiling of the Commons. (Sparky's also became the nickname of Wiess's basement game room.) Often Sparky was aligned with a corresponding anatomical prop at the other end of the room; one year a motor was added to move Sparky back and forth during the party. In some years a second Sparky was constructed with internal tubing that delivered Everclear punch from an upstairs mixing area to a suitably shaped serving trough below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/1999-10-28/news/nod-so-naughty/|title=NOD So Naughty|publisher=[[Houston Press]]|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant safety efforts were instituted starting in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ricethresher.org/a-history-of-decadence-1.2670307#.UE6h3LJlR9s&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8157">The '''Safe Boating Campaign''' is a year-round campaign focused on spreading the message of [[boating]] safety, encouraging boater education, and helping to save lives. It kicks off each year the full week before [[Memorial Day]] Weekend with [[United States Federal Observances|National Safe Boating Week]], with focused efforts during the peak boating season of May – September. Promoting [[Personal flotation device|life jacket]] wear by every boater is the leading goal of the Campaign.&lt;ref name="safeboatingcampaign.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=NSBC celebrates 50 years |website=North American Safe Boating Campaign |url=http://www.safeboatingcampaign.com/sca/sca-nsbc50.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2009-07-29 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715223438/http://www.safeboatingcampaign.com/sca/sca-nsbc50.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;“H.R.2150”.

Created in 1958 as National Safe Boating Week, the official entrance of Canada in 2000 transformed the event into a larger, international campaign known as North American Safe Boating Campaign. The Campaign is a core program of the [[National Safe Boating Council]].&lt;ref name="atlanticmaritimeacademy.com"&gt;“National Safe Boating Week – Why?”. Atlantic Maritime Academy. http://www.atlanticmaritimeacademy.com/bringingithomesafely09.html. Retrieved 2009-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Wear It! Campaign”. North American Safe Boating Campaign. http://www.safeboatingcampaign.com. Retrieved 2009-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The North American Boating Campaign was originally known as “Safe Boating Week,” observed by the [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]] as a Courtesy Examination weekend in Amesburg, Massachusetts in June 1952. This tradition continued until 1957 when an official [[United States Federal Observances|National Safe Boating Week]] observation took place sponsored by the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary in various parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;“About the Auxiliary”. U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. http://www.cgaux.org/. Retrieved 2009-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] prepared a Resolution, and on June 4, 1958, [[Dwight Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed PL 85-445, to establish National Safe Boating Week as the first week starting on the first Sunday in June.&lt;ref name="atlanticmaritimeacademy.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Public Law 85-445”. The Library of Congress. https://www.loc.gov/index.html. Retrieved 2009-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Safe Boating Week Committee, now known as the National Safe Boating Council, organized the event by coordinating efforts among the various boating safety groups.&lt;ref&gt;“Proclamation 6570 – National Safe Boating Week, 1993”. The American Presidency Project. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=62435. Retrieved 2009-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the date for National Safe Boating Week was finally changed to the full week (Saturday – Friday) before [[Memorial Day]] Weekend each year. This allowed the message of safe boating to reach more boaters before the season and enforce the message for a longer amount of time each year.&lt;ref name="safeboatingcampaign.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt; The official entrance of [[Canada]] in 2000 transformed National Safe Boating Week into a larger, international event with partnerships with the Canadian Safe Boating Council and Canadian Coast Guard. National Safe Boating Week now serves as the kick off for the North American Safe Boating Campaign, a year-round campaign that is focused during the summer months of May – September.&lt;ref&gt;“Wear It! Campaign”. North American Safe Boating Campaign. http://www.safeboatingcampaign.com. Retrieved 2009-07-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Campaign provides the public with education and information about safe boating.  Through [[News release|press releases]], [[public service announcements]], informational campaign mailers, and other efforts, the Campaign is able to reach a wide range of individuals with boating safety materials. This information is intended to enhance and supplement groups, associations and organizations boating safety campaigns across the United States and Canada during National Safe Boating Week.&lt;ref name="safeboatingcampaign-faq"&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQs |website=North American Safe Boating Campaign |url=http://www.safeboatingcampaign.com/faqs.htm |access-date=2009-07-30 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913214431/http://www.safeboatingcampaign.com/faqs.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, the Campaign has strengthened and worked to gain more national attention across the U.S. In 2006, “Wear It!” became the official slogan of the campaign.&lt;ref name="safeboatingcampaign.com"/&gt; Routine and consistent life jacket wear during all water activities can make the difference between life and death. According to the U.S. Coast Guard:&lt;ref&gt;“Statistics”. U.S. Coast Guard. http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/stats.htm. Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 90 percent of drowning victims in recreational boating accidents were not wearing a life jacket in 2007.
* Drowning is the reported cause of death in two-thirds of all boating fatalities.

In 2007, The Delta region in [[Sacramento, California]] was chosen to be the first targeted area in the U.S. for campaign efforts. As a result, life jacket wear rate increased from a baseline measurement of 6.2 percent to 12.2 percent in this area due to the intense marketing of a focused “Wear It!” campaign and the efforts of the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Safe Boating Council, [[BoatUS|Boat U.S. Foundation]], and the [[California Department of Boating and Waterways]].&lt;ref&gt;“About the Campaign – Delta Campaign’’. Wear It California. http://www.wearitcalifornia.com/ca-delta.htm. Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Wear It Marketing Campaign Designed to Increase Life Jacket Wear Rates Achieves Positive Results”. North American Safe Boating Campaign.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Safe Boating Council decided to continue this targeted approach in 2008, adding Tennessee to its efforts in addition to a general campaign across the country.&lt;ref&gt;“About the Campaign – Welcome”. Wear It Tennessee. http://www.wearittennessee.com/. Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a third state was included – “Wear It Michigan!” began its own campaign using its law enforcement personnel to educate about the boating safety message.&lt;ref&gt;“Welcome – About the Campaign”. Wear It Michigan. http://www.wearitmichigan.com/mi-welcome.htm. Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partner Organizations==
The National Safe Boating Council is joined by partner organizations in supporting the Campaign such as Boat U.S. Foundation, National Association of State Boating Law Administrators, Canadian Safe Boating Council, [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], U.S. Coast Guard, [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary|U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]], and [[United States Power Squadrons|U.S. Power Squadrons]].&lt;ref&gt;“Wear It Contacts – Campaign Partners”. North American Safe Boating Campaign. http://www.safeboatingcampaign.com/partners.htm. Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos==
Over time, the campaign logo has changed to reflect a newer, more comfortable life jacket in conjunction with the current trends of boating. Although the logo and slogan have changed over the years – the message has always been clear – by boating safely and wearing your life jacket, boating can be a fun and safe activity.&lt;ref name="safeboatingcampaign.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="safeboatingcampaign-faq"/&gt;

; Notes:
* The phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is mostly found in Southern Occitan (written {{angbr|(i)sh}} in [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]], {{angbr|ch}} in [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], and {{angbr|(i)ss}} in [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]]).
* The distinction between {{IPA|/v/}} {{angbr|v}} and {{IPA|/b/}} {{angbr|b}} is general in Provençal, [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]], [[Auvergnat dialect|Auvergnat]] and [[Limousin dialect|Limousin]]. However, in Languedocien and Gascon, the phonemes {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are neutralized as {{IPA|/b/}} (thus {{IPA|/v/}} has disappeared).
* In [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]]:
** the phonemes {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} indicate three kinds of sounds, depending on what surrounds them:
*** a voiced [[plosive]] sound {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ]}} by default
*** devoiced to {{IPA|[p, t, k]}} phrase-finally or before a voiceless sound
*** a voiced [[fricative consonant|fricative]] {{IPA|[β, ð, ɣ]}} when both preceded and followed by voiced continuants (i.e., vowels or {{IPA|[r, l, z]}}) within the same phrase.
** the phonemes {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/dz/}} and the sequences {{IPA|/p+s/, /k+s/}} are neutralized as {{IPA|/ts/}} (thus {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/p+s/}} and {{IPA|/k+s/}} have disappeared).
* In [[Auvergnat dialect|Auvergnat]] and [[Limousin dialect|Limousin]], and locally in other dialects,
** the phonemes {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} are neutralized as {{IPA|/ts/}} (thus {{IPA|/tʃ/}} has disappeared).
** the phonemes {{IPA|/dz/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} are neutralized as {{IPA|/dz/}} (thus {{IPA|/dʒ/}} has disappeared).
* In [[Auvergnat dialect|Auvergnat]], most of the consonants, except {{IPA|/r/}}, can have a [[palatal consonant|palatalized]] sound before ''i'' and ''u''. Consequently, the consonant phonemes have two kinds of sounds, one being not palatal (by default) and the other being palatal (before ''i'' and ''u''): {{IPA|/p/}} → {{IPA|[p, pj]}}; {{IPA|/b/}} → {{IPA|[b, bj]}}; {{IPA|/t/}} → {{IPA|[t, tj]}}; {{IPA|/d/}} → {{IPA|[d, dj]}}; {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPA|[k, kj]}}; {{IPA|/ɡ/}} → {{IPA|[ɡ, ɡj]}}; {{IPA|/f/}} → {{IPA|[f, fj]}}; {{IPA|/v/}} → {{IPA|[v, vj]}}; {{IPA|/s/}} → {{IPA|[s, ʃ]}}; {{IPA|/z/}} → {{IPA|[z, ʒ]}}; {{IPA|/ts/}} → {{IPA|[ts, tʃ]}}; {{IPA|/dz/}} → {{IPA|[dz, dʒ]}}; {{IPA|/m/}} → {{IPA|[m, mj]}}; {{IPA|/n/}} → {{IPA|[n, nj]}}; {{IPA|/l/}} → {{IPA|[l, lj]}}.
* In one part (and only one part) of [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]],{{which|date=June 2015}} a transphonologization has occurred:
** The old phonemes {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}} have now become {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}.
** The old phonemes {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}} have now become {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.
* In the [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] in general, and partially in other dialects, the phonemes {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/ʎ/}} are neutralized as {{IPA|/j/}} (thus {{IPA|/ʎ/}} has disappeared).
* The original [[rhotic consonant]]s, {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (tapped) and {{IPA|/r/}} (trilled), have shown important evolutions:
** In Provençal and partially in other dialects, there is now an opposition between {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (tapped) and {{IPA|/ʀ/}} ([[uvular consonant|uvular]]) (whereas {{IPA|/r/}} has disappeared). This feature is shared with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In the cases when the opposition is impossible between the two phonemes, the default realization is {{IPA|/ʀ/}} (it was {{IPA|/r/}} in the original pattern).
** In most of Limousin, Auvergne, Vivarais and [[Niçard]], the phonemes {{IPA|/ɾ/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are neutralized as {{IPA|/r/}} (or even {{IPA|/ʀ/}}).

=== Gascon consonants ===
* Gascon shares some traits with [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]]:
** The phonemes {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} have the same realization as described above for Languedocien.
** The phonemes {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} of the general pattern are neutralized as {{IPA|/b/}}. It seems possible, however, that the phoneme {{IPA|/v/}} never existed in Gascon.
* Gascon and Southern Languedocien do not have the [[semivowel]] {{IPA|/ɥ/}} (Gascon has {{IPA|/ɥ/}},{{contradict-inline}} SL has {{IPA|/β/}}) and have the same distribution for the phonemes {{IPA|/dʒ/}} {{angbr|tg, tj}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} {{angbr|j, g}}.
* In one part of Gascon,{{which|date=June 2015}} the [[palatal consonant|palatal]] affricates {{IPA|/tʃ/}} {{IPA|/dʒ/}} become [[plosive]] palatal consonants: {{IPA|/c/, /ɟ/}}.

Note:
* The grapheme {{angbr|a}}, when in final position and after the word's stress, is pronounced {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in general (locally: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ə/}}).
* The grapheme {{angbr|á}} is pronounced {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in general (locally: {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}).

=== General ablaut ===
In an unstressed position, some vowels cannot be realized and become more closed vowels:
* The stressed vowel {{IPA|/ɛ/}} {{angbr|è}} becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/e/}} {{angbr|e}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''t&lt;u&gt;è&lt;/u&gt;rra'' {{IPA|/ˈtɛrrɔ/}} → ''terr&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ssa'' {{IPA|/teˈrrasɔ/}}.
* The stressed vowel {{IPA|/ɔ/}} {{angbr|ò}} becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/u/}} {{angbr|o}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''c&lt;u&gt;ò&lt;/u&gt;de'' {{IPA|/ˈkɔde/}} → ''codific&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/kudifiˈka/}}.
* In some local dialects, especially in the [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]] variety of [[Guyenne]], the stressed vowel {{IPA|/a/}} {{angbr|a}} becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/ɔ/}} {{angbr|a}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''b&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;la'' {{IPA|/ˈbalɔ/}} → ''bal&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;n'' {{IPA|/bɔˈlu/}}.
** Also in Guyenne, the vowel {{angbr|a}}, when stressed, is pronounced {{IPA|/ɔ/}} when followed by a nasal consonant such as {{IPA|/n, m, ɲ/}} {{angbr|n, m, nh}} or a final {{angbr|n}} that is silent: ''mont&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;nha, p&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;n'' {{IPA|/munˈtɔɲɔ, ˈpɔ/}} (instead of {{IPA|/munˈtaɲɔ, ˈpa/}}).
* In [[Limousin dialect|Limousin]], [[Auvergnat dialect|Auvernhat]], [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]] and in most of [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] (though not in [[Niçard]]), the stressed diphthong {{IPA|/aw/}} {{angbr|au}} becomes the unstressed diphthong {{IPA|/ɔw/}} {{angbr|au}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''s&lt;u&gt;au&lt;/u&gt;ta'' {{IPA|/ˈsawtɔ/}} → ''saut&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/sɔwˈta/}}.
* In Limousin, Auvernhat, Vivaro-Alpine and in most of Provençal (though not in Niçard), the stressed diphthong {{IPA|/aj/}} {{angbr|ai}} becomes the unstressed diphthong {{IPA|/ej/}} {{angbr|ai}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''l&lt;u&gt;ai&lt;/u&gt;ssa'' {{IPA|/ˈlajsɔ/}} → ''laiss&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/lejˈsa/}}.

=== Vowel changes in Auvergnat ===
One typical characteristic of Auvergnat (also a feature of some neighbouring dialects of [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]]) is the transformation of the following phonemes:
* The old phoneme {{IPA|/ɛ/}} has become {{IPA|/e/}}.
* The old phoneme {{IPA|/e/}} has become {{IPA|/ə/}} or {{IPA|/ɪ/}}.

In an unstressed position, some vowels cannot be realized and become more closed vowels:
* The stressed vowel {{IPA|/e/}} {{angbr|è}} becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/ə (ɪ)/}} {{angbr|e}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''t&lt;u&gt;è&lt;/u&gt;rra'' {{IPA|/ˈterɔ/}} → ''terr&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ssa'' {{IPA|/təˈrasɔ/}}.
* The stressed vowel {{IPA|/ɔ/}} {{angbr|ò}} becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/u/}} {{angbr|o}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''c&lt;u&gt;ò&lt;/u&gt;de'' {{IPA|/ˈkɔdə/}} → ''codific&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/kudifiˈka/}}.
* In the northern part of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], the stressed vowel {{IPA|/a/}} {{angbr|a}} (unrounded) becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/ɒ/}} {{angbr|a}} (rounded). For instance (stress underlined): ''b&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;la'' {{IPA|/ˈbalɔ/}} → ''bal&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;n'' {{IPA|/bɒˈlu/}}.
* The stressed diphthong {{IPA|/aw/}} {{angbr|au}} becomes the unstressed diphthong {{IPA|/ɔw (u, œ)/}} {{angbr|au}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''s&lt;u&gt;au&lt;/u&gt;ta'' {{IPA|/ˈsawtɔ/}} → ''saut&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/sɔwˈta/}}.
* The stressed diphthong {{IPA|/aj/}} {{angbr|ai}} becomes the unstressed diphthong {{IPA|/ej (i)/}} {{angbr|ai}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''l&lt;u&gt;ai&lt;/u&gt;ssa'' {{IPA|/ˈlajsɔ/}} → ''laiss&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/lejˈsa/}}.

=== Vowel changes in Limousin ===
A strong characteristic of Limousin (also a feature of some neighbouring dialects of [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]]) is the neutralization of the phonemes {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in one single phoneme {{IPA|/e/}}, that can have various degrees of opening.

In words of popular formation, the sequences {{angbr|as, es, is, òs, os, us, ues}} {{IPA|[as, es, is, ɔs, us, ys, œs]}}, when at the end of a syllable, first became {{IPA|[ah, eh, ih, ɔh, uh, yh, œh]}} and have now become long vowels, {{IPA|[aː, (ej), iː, ɔː, uː, yː, œː]}}, which tends to create new phonemes with a relevant opposition between short vowels and long vowels. The same phenomenon exists in one part of [[Vivarais]],{{which|date=June 2015}} and also occurred in [[Phonological history of French|the transition from Old to Middle French]].

In an unstressed position, some vowels cannot be realized and become more closed vowels:
* The stressed vowel {{IPA|/ɔ/}} {{angbr|ò}} becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/u/}} {{angbr|o}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''c&lt;u&gt;ò&lt;/u&gt;de'' {{IPA|/ˈkɔde/}} → ''codific&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/kudifiˈka/}}.
* The stressed vowel {{IPA|/a/}} {{angbr|a}} (unrounded) becomes the unstressed vowel {{IPA|/ɒ/}} {{angbr|a}} (rounded). For instance (stress underlined): ''b&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;la'' {{IPA|/ˈbalɔ/}} → ''bal&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;n'' {{IPA|/bɒˈlu/}}.
* The stressed diphthong {{IPA|/aw/}} {{angbr|au}} becomes the unstressed diphthong {{IPA|/ɔw/}} {{angbr|au}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''s&lt;u&gt;au&lt;/u&gt;ta'' {{IPA|/ˈsawtɔ/}} → ''saut&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/sɔwˈta/}}.
* The stressed diphthong {{IPA|/aj/}} {{angbr|ai}} becomes the unstressed diphthong {{IPA|/ej/}} {{angbr|ai}}. For instance (stress underlined): ''l&lt;u&gt;ai&lt;/u&gt;ssa'' {{IPA|/ˈlajsɔ/}} → ''laiss&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;r'' {{IPA|/lejˈsa/}}.

* In [[Limousin dialect|Limousin]] and [[Auvergnat dialect|Auvergnat]], final consonants, except for {{angbr|nh}} and {{angbr|m}}, are generally muted when not directly followed by a word with a vocalic initial: ''filh'' {{IPA|[fi]}}, ''potz'' {{IPA|[pu]}}, ''fach'' {{IPA|[fa]}}, ''limon'' {{IPA|[liˈmu]}} but ''estelum'' {{IPA|[ejteˈlun]}}, ''estanh'' {{IPA|[ejˈtan]}}, ''un fach ancian'' {{IPA|[yn fats ɔnˈsja]}}.
* In Limousin and Auvergnat, when a [[diphthong]] starts in {{angbr|o}} or {{angbr|u}}, it is always a [[rising diphthong]]: ''boisson'' {{IPA|[bwiˈsu]}} (Auvergnat) and {{IPA|[bwejˈsu]}} (Limousin) versus {{IPA|[bujˈsu]}} (Languedocien) or {{IPA|[bujˈsun]}} ([[Provençal dialect|Provençal]]).
* In all dialects but [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]], final {{angbr|l}} is heavily [[Velarization|velarized]] ("[[dark l]]") and therefore usually spelled {{angbr|u}}: ''especial'' {{IPA|[espeˈsjaɫ]}} / ''especiau'' {{IPA|[espeˈsjaw]}} but ''especiala'' {{IPA|[espeˈsjalɔ]}} in the feminine (except in [[Gascon language|Gascon]] where it stays as ''especiau'').

== Word stress ==
Word stress has limited mobility. It can only fall on:
* the last syllable ([[oxytone]]s or ''mots aguts'' 'acute words')
* the penultimate syllable ([[paroxytone]]s or ''mots plans'' 'plain words').
* However, in [[Niçard]], and less commonly in the Cisaupenc dialect of the [[Occitan Valleys]], the stress can also fall on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable ([[proparoxytone]]s or ''mots esdrúchols'' 'slip words'). These proparoxytones are equivalent to paroxytones in all other dialects. For instance (stress underlined):

== Historical development ==
As a [[Romance language]], Occitan developed from [[Vulgar Latin]]. [[Old Occitan]] (around the eighth through the fourteenth centuries) had a similar pronunciation to present-day Occitan; the major differences were:
* Before the 13th century, {{angbr|c}} had softened before [[front vowel]]s to {{IPA|[t͡s]}},&lt;ref name="Grandgent4"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grandgent|1905|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; not yet to {{IPA|[s]}}.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Timothy James, Rigg, A. G. and Klausner, David N. 1996. ''Singing Early Music: The Pronunciation of European Languages in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, Volume 1'', p. 104: {{quote|The confusion of spellings, such as ''se'' for ''ce'', ''voluntat'' for ''volontat'', indicate the accomplishment of a phonetic evolution (here {{IPA|[t͡s]}} &gt; {{IPA|[s]}} and atonic {{IPA|[o]}} &gt; {{IPA|[u]}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the early [[Middle Ages]], {{angbr|z}} between vowels represented the affricate {{IPAblink|d͡z}},&lt;ref name="Grandgent4" /&gt; not yet {{IPA|/z/}}.
* In early Old Occitan, {{angbr|z}} represented {{IPA|[t͡s]}} in final position.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Timothy James, Rigg, A. G. and Klausner, David N. 1996. ''Singing Early Music: The Pronunciation of European Languages in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, Volume 1'', p. 110: {{quote|Although ''z'' originally denoted the voiced affricate {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, it simplified to {{IPA|[z]}}, as {{IPA|[t͡s]}} simplified to {{IPA|[s]}}, but at an earlier date. The spellings ''s'' and ''z'' alternate even in the earlier troubadours, indicating the pronunciation {{IPA|[z]}} in such words as ''cortesia''/''cortezia'', ''rosa''/''roza'', ''gilosa''/''giloza''. In final position ''-z'' is pronounced {{IPA|[t͡s]}}, also spelled ''-tz'': ''toz''/''totz'', ''maritz'', ''amanz'', ''parlatz'', ''tertz''. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the late Middle Ages, the letter {{angbr|a}} went from {{IPA|[a]}} to {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in unaccented position and in stressed syllables followed by a nasal consonant.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Timothy James, Rigg, A. G. and Klausner, David N. 1996. ''Singing Early Music: The Pronunciation of European Languages in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, Volume 1'', p. 104: {{quote|When we note that tonic ''-a'' followed by unstable ''n'' does not rhyme with regular tonic ''-a'', we have confirmation of two ''a''-phonemes, the normal {{IPA|[a]}} (anterior ''a'') and the posterior {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, as well as confirmation that Old Occitan does not nasalize vowels followed by nasal consonants, as Old French does.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When not part of a diphthong, the vowel spelled {{angbr|o}} was probably pronounced as {{IPAblink|ʊ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Anglade|1921|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; not yet {{IPA|[u]}}.
* Between vowels, the letter {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|j}} represented, for most speech in [[Occitania]], {{IPAblink|j}}. However, this could become {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, especially down south:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Anglade|1921|p=22}}: {{quote|Les manuscrits ne distinguaient pas ''i'' intervocalique de ''j'': on hésite donc sur la prononciation des mots suivants: ''veraia'', ''aia'', ''raia'', ''saia'', etc. Lienig, se fondant sur le témoignage et sur la graphie des ''Leys [d'Amor]'', admet comme vraisemblable une prononciation de ''i'' voyelle ou semi-consonne dans le Nord de l'Occitanie, et de ''j'' dans le Sud. La prononciation ''-aja'' (comme dans fr. ''âge'') serait rare dans les rimes des [[troubadour]]s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it later became {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}}, which, in turn, would locally depalatalize to {{IPAblink|d͡z}} in Middle Occitan.
* In words where {{IPA|/ɾ/}} was preceded by a diphthong whose second element was {{IPA|[j]}}, it was sometimes [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] to {{IPA|[rʲ]}}.&lt;ref name="Grandgent5"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grandgent|1905|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In earlier times, some dialects used {{IPAblink|ç}} instead of the more common {{IPAblink|ʃ}}: despite their similarity, this often led to contrasting spellings ({{angbr|laishar}} or {{angbr|laischar}} {{IPA|[lajˈʃaɾ]}} vs. {{angbr|laichar}} {{IPA|[lajˈçaɾ]}}; {{angbr|fois}} or {{angbr|foish}} {{IPA|[fʊjʃ]}} vs. {{angbr|foih}} {{IPA|[fʊiç]}}) before it became {{IPA|[s]}} commonly across the language ({{angbr|laissar}} {{IPA|[lajˈsaɾ]}}, {{angbr|Fois}} {{IPA|[fujs]}}).&lt;ref name="Grandgent5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Société pour l'Étude des Langues Romanes, ''Revue des langues romanes'', 1877, p. 17: {{quote|...plusieurs dialectes de l'ancienne langue, y compris le limousin, comme le prouvent des textes de Limoges et de Périgueux, changeaient souvent l'''s'' dure suivant ''i'', particulièrement ''i'' engagé dans une diphthongue, en une consonne probablement identique au ''ch'' français, et qu'on figurait ''sch'', ''sh'' ou ''ch''. Sur ''sh'', voyez un passage des ''Leys d'amors'', I, 62, qui prouve clairement que cette combinaison n'avait pas la valeur d'une ''s'' simple. Les trois notations, ou seulement deux d'entre elles, sont quelquefois employées concurremment dans les mêmes textes, ce qui démontre leur équivalence. Ainsi les Coutumes de Limoges ont ''ayschí'', ''punischen'', mais plus souvent, par ''ch'', ''laychen'', ''poicha'', etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the pre-literary period of early [[Old Occitan]] {{IPA|/u/}} had not been fronted to {{IPA|[y]}}, although strong doubts exist as to when the change actually happened.&lt;ref name="Grandgent4" /&gt;
* When between vowels, {{IPA|/d/}} lenited to {{IPAblink|ð}}, though this is still true for only [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]] dialects; elsewhere, it eventually turned to {{IPA|[z]}} or was deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grandgent|1905|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Gascon, there was one voiced labial phoneme that was {{IPA|[b]}} in the beginning of a word and {{IPA|[β]}} between vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grandgent|1905|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This still happens today and has spread to the neighbouring Languedocien dialect.
* The phoneme {{angbr|lh}} was exclusively pronounced {{IPA|[ʎ]}} (it is now {{IPA|[j]}} in intervocalic or final position in some dialects).&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Timothy James, Rigg, A. G. and Klausner, David N. 1996. ''Singing Early Music: The Pronunciation of European Languages in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, Volume 1'', p. 105: {{quote|The Italian notation ''gl'' and the Catalanized ''ll'', both indicating {{IPA|[ʎ]}}, give evidence of the palatalized pronunciation of Occitan ''lh''. Likewise, the transcription of Occitan words in non-Latin alphabets such as Hebrew or Greek may confirm their pronunciation with more precision.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''percent for art''' refers to a program, often a [[city ordinance]], where a fee, usually some percentage of the project cost, is placed on large scale development projects in order to fund and install [[public art]].  The details of such programs vary from area to area. Percent for art programs are used to fund [[public art]] where private or specialized funding of public art is unavailable. Similar programs, such as "[[art in public places]]", attempt to achieve similar goals by requiring that public art be part of a project, yet they often allow developers to pay in-lieu fees to a public art fund as an alternative.

==History==

=== Europe ===
In [[Finland]] the percent for art principle was first introduced as an official government policy in connection with the construction of the Finnish Parliament building in the early 1930s, though it was not implemented until 1939. In 1956 the government extended the principle to all public buildings, and during the 1960s individual municipalities also drew up their own schemes. In 1981 the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities, an advocate for all Finnish municipalities and regions, recommended extending the principle to all aspects of the urban environment. In 1991 the City of Helsinki became the first city to adopt the policy for all building projects, which led to a vast growth in urban art, even within suburban areas. in 2015 the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture funded a handbook available to the sponsors of public art work under the title "The Handbook of the Percent For Art Principle in Finland", which is also published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prosenttiperiaate.fi/wp-content/uploads/The_Handbook_of_the_Percent_for_Art_Principle_in_Finland_For_Commissioners.pdf|title=The Handbook of the Percent For Art Principle in Finland|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland (country)|Ireland]], one percent of the cost of all public works can be allocated to commissioning a work of art. The scheme was introduced in 1978, and extended to all government departments in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicart.ie/main/commissioning/funding/per-cent-for-art/|title=Per Cent for Art Scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=publicart.ie|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicart.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF_Folder/Public_Art_Per_Cent_for_Art.pdf|title=PUBLIC ART: PER CENT FOR ART SCHEME GENERAL NATIONAL GUIDELINES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=publicart.ie|format=PDF|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
From 1934 to 1943, the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] followed a policy requiring one percent of the cost of federal buildings to be applied toward art and decoration.  In 1959, [[Philadelphia]] adopted the first such municipal ordinance in the United States.&lt;ref name="Abernethy1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd M. Abernethy|title=Benton Spruance, the Artist and the Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ1OhyLKEMIC&amp;pg=PA119|year=1988|publisher=Associated University Presses|isbn=978-0-87982-517-1|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other jurisdictions followed suit, including  [[Baltimore]] in 1964, [[San Francisco]] and [[Hawaii]] in 1967, and [[Seattle]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Stein, [http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=10645 "Seattle's 1 Percent for Art Program"], ''[[HistoryLink]]'', October 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FinkelpearlAcconci2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Finkelpearl|author2=Vito Acconci|title=Dialogues in Public Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T51F3wYglToC&amp;pg=PT34|date=January 2001|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-56148-8|pages=20–21 &amp; passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger L.

More than half of the states now maintain percent-for-art programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaa-arts.org/Research/Key-Topics/Public-Art/State-Percent-for-Art-Programs.php "State Percent for Art Programs"], National Association of State Arts Agencies (accessed 2015-07-03).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the federal level, since 1963 the [[General Services Administration]] has maintained the Art in Architecture Program, which allocates one-half of one percent of construction cost for art projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104456 "Art in Architecture Program"], [[General Services Administration]] (accessed 2015-07-03).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pingelapese language''' is a [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian]] language native to [[Pingelap]], an [[atoll]] belonging to the state of Pohnpei in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. This atoll is the homeland to the Pingelapese people, consisting of a three-square mile range of uninhabited small coral islets, Daekae and Sukora, and the inhabited islet, Pingelap. These islands partially make up the [[Caroline Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=EnduringVoices|title=Pingelapese language identity and status|date=2013-10-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAYDyEO9LJg|accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For various reasons, including natural disasters and emigration consequent to European and U.S. influence, the current overall population of the Pingelapese people remains relatively small. There are at least 2,000 Pingelapese people worldwide. 

Although the official language of the Pohnpei State is English, 200 of the 250 Pingelap atoll residents and 1,200 Pohnpei residents speak Pingelapese. The Pingelapese language is still used today during face-to-face communication amongst speakers of all ages and it maintains its classification as a vigorous language. Although the help of linguists like Leilani Welley-Biza sharing knowledge from her elders, significant cultural/historical connections bound to the Pingelapese language can be more thoroughly documented and preserved&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|publisher=Ann Arbor|year=2012|isbn=9781267817211|location=|pages=10|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, to be passed down between generations, it is the Doahkaesa and King of Pingelap, His Majesty Dr. Berysin D. Salomon, and His Majesty's chosen traditional leaders, through the Pingelapese customary rite, has the full extent of the traditional language and the cultural/historical heritage of the people of Pingelap.

== Family and origin ==
Pingelapese is a Micronesian member of the Austronesian language family. It is closely related to other languages within the Chuukic-Pohnpeic branch, sharing 83% lexical similarity with Mokilese and sharing 79% lexical similarity with Pohnpeian. Approximately 5,000 years ago, the Micronesian peoples voyaged eastward from Taiwan, and eventually made it to Micronesia about 3,000 years later. Morton et al. estimated that the Micronesian peoples have resided on Pingelap for 1,000 years, nearly 800 years before any European contact were to be recorded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=need to add catalog citation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular Pohnpeian legends passed down in oral history have created an endless controversy over the origins of the Pingelapese people, or any outer island of Pohnpei for that matter, suggesting possible origins from the people of Kosrae in the Legend of Nahwehlap, or a differing ancestry claimed to be linked to the people of Yap in the Legend of Yap. The Legend of Yap states the discovery of the ''island of Pikelap'', now known worldwide as the island of Pingelap, by two Yapese brothers who sailed from Yap in search of a new life beyond the shores of Yap as opposed to many island folklores of mystical island creation by mythological creatures or a demi-god being who, after being delivered out of his mother's womb, stood up strong and ran, skipped infancy and childhood, and instantly became a man. Other versions of oral history taken in account by locals who have no traditional historical background as opposed to those with traditional historical background make it difficult to decipher approximately when the one known Kosraean term found in the Pingelapese language, which is ''Doahkaesa,'' was introduced to the Pingelapese vocabulary. According to the Pingelapese traditional oral history, ''Ouwa'' is the Pikelapese term for King while ''Doahkaesa'' is the Kosraean term for King.

In the Pingelapese traditional oral history, formerly held by the Nahno of Pingelap - a traditional title given by the first Ouwa whose one purpose is to keep the Pikelapese oral history and pass on the traditional oral history to the Ouwa and his descendants as decreed by Pingelapese traditional law, it describes the origins of Pingelap's lineage to the people of Yap and the discovery of Pikelap by these two Yapese siblings. The older brother was said to have returned to Kosrae to marry a Kosraean woman whom he had met and fell in love with before their voyage and discovery of the island of Pikelap. It also describes a time when descendants of Kosrae became local residents of Pingelap which ultimately linked their influence and reign over the people of Pingelap which resulted in the integration of language similarities between the two islands. It describes a history between Pingelap and Pohnpei through the conquest of Nan Madol and the integration and language similarities between the two islands. It also describes that while voyaging to Pohnpei for the conquest of Nan Madol, the prominent legendary warrior known as Isoh Kelekel, or known by Pohnpeians as Isokelekel, met with their rivaling neighbors, the people of Mwoakilloa, to recruit warriors to fight in the conquest of Nan Madol resulting in the recruitment of one such Mwokillese warrior named "Nahparadak" which is now a Pohnpeian traditional title called "''Nahnparadak''" given only to a Mwokillese man greatly respected by Pohnpeian's in Madolenihmw's traditional ranks. Historically, Pingelapese named their children based on a special feature or foreseen ability or destiny upon birth. For example, Doahkaesa Iengiringir was named Iengiringir for having large feet that made the grounds tremble whenever he walked. Iengiringir is loosely translated in the English language as "rumble or tremble" relating to the low rumble of the ocean waves crashing in the horizon.

Although many Pohnpeian and Kosraean islanders may disagree with the Pingelap traditional oral history, one way of finding one's origins where there is very little to no evidence that may support any theory of origin is to look into the language of the group(s) of people in question. Many people believe that the current Pohnpeian language is the main language of the main island and its outer atolls. To what extent is arguably unknown because many still argue today despite the many attempts conducted by foreign researchers who were researching the origin of language in the less-likely of areas and with people who had no rich historical, cultural, and traditional background and the language of the islands in question to begin with. For example, the Pohnpeian word ''maing'' is taken from the German word ''mein'' during the German occupation of Pohnpei. Loosely translated, ''Maing'' in the English dictionary is ''Sir/Madam.'' Pohnpeians integrated the German word ''mein'' into their language and used it, specifically, for a person of high traditional or political rank or of great respect. During this era, the Germans took the traditional Pohnpeian rite of having one paramount chief or king of the island and divided the island into 5 municipalities and erected 5 rulers to each border area, which is similar to the Kingdom of Belgium's ''Markies/Marquis'' in Belgium, Germany. Pohnpeian's integrated the German word and made it their own and today calls each village chief ''Nahnmwarki.'' During the Japanese era, the Japanese introduced electricity to the island and called it using the Japanese word ''denki''. The Japanese tried to teach the locals of what electricity is while using the Japanese language, and the locals mistook the meaning of the Japanese word denki as light bulb. As a result, the Pohnpeian word for "light bulb" is "''denki''". Before the era of the 5 Nahnmwarki's of the main island of Pohnpei, there was only one Paramount King of the newly conquered Pohnpei, and before that the Saudeleur Dynasty.

Pohnpeian's are well known for using a name of a place to identify a food or object completely foreign to the island or an area referring to the persons native land before settling themselves in Pohnpei. For the example of a foreign object: a very large and thick steel pot is called ''kwatilain'' in Pohnpeian. According to Pohnpeian oral history, these larger than normal pot's was introduced to Pohnpeian's from a military personnel who came from the military post in Kwajalein during the US occupation of Micronesia after the 2nd World War and since then has been incorporated into the Pohnpeian language to describe the largest steel pot found in almost many Pohnpeian family kitchen or local cook houses. For the example of a foreign food: Pohnpeian's named many fruits and other foods from where they came from - ''Uht en Ruhk'', ''Karer en Kusai'', ''Sakau en Kusai'', ''Uht en Pihsih'', ''Mei en Sahmwoa'', ''Uht en Iap'', ''Mengat en Seipahn'', oh ''Uht en Menihle'' is loosely translated in English to ''Banana from Chuuk'', ''Lime from Kosrae'', ''Sakau (Kava) from Kosrae'', ''Banana from Fiji'', ''Breadfruit from Samao'', ''Banana from Yap'', ''Banana from Saipan'', and ''Banana from Manila''. For the example of renaming an area for which the settler originally came from: In Pohnpei, there is only one community within a municipality that is also, surprisingly, called ''Sakarakapw.'' ''Sakarakapw'' is one of four villages in Pingelap. In the Pingelapese oral traditional history, Saelaepas, who is a prominent legendary warrior in the conquest of Nan Madol, is a native of Sakarapw. This community is found in Madolenihmw - the once presumed-capital of the once ruthless ruler of Pohnpei living in Nan Madol - Saudeleuer. Today, this community's traditional leader is given the Pohnpeian traditional title called "Selepat."

Many Pohnpeian islanders will impose the theory that Pingelapese came from Pohnpei therefore everything about Pingelap easily suggests the Pohnpeian language, cultural, and traditional integration. But some facts may prove their theories otherwise. One such fact is that there are no Pohnpeian canoes strong enough to withstand long voyages out at sea much less having the navigation and sailing skills to sail their canoes against the eastern ocean currents from which Pingelap is located nor are there any Pohnpeian folklore that speaks of any Pohnpeian sea voyages anywhere at any time or any known canoe-building skill passed down by the descendants of Pohnpei. Another fact is that, to this very day, the Yapese people are the only ones that are known to have honed the skill to build these traditional long voyaging canoes, and the skills and techniques to navigate and sail anywhere in the Pacific and possibly the world. Pingelapese canoe-builders also carry a similar trait where today they teach the Pingelapese younger generation on how to build shoreline canoes and long-voyage canoes capable of sailing to Pohnpei therefore linking possible lineage between the Pikelapese and the Yapese. Pikelap, as described in their traditional oral history, most likely was discovered by Yapese navigators voyaging beyond Yap. Another fact is that if Pohnpei or Kosrae was a "great influence" and portrayed "great dominance" to the Pingelapese heritage and language, why is it that these two "dominant" islands never share the same lunar calendar created by the ancestors of Pikelap? It is evident, through this article or any online or local searches of all known folklores ranging from the main island of Pohnpei to the outer islands to as far as Yap, that the Pikelapese people were intelligent enough to come up with their own unique lunar calendar and using Pingelapese words, to which many local Pohnpeians or Kosraeans have no claim of understanding a single word, correlating to the months and days of the lunar calendar, while other islands in Micronesia have none to show for nor any folklore hinting any evidence to a calendar in existence to this day. Even after years of typical mainland discrimination towards outer islanders, in general, and multiple cultural influences from the Spanish era to now the US era, Pingelap still retains their language, lunar calendar, and traditional historical heritage even though popular mainland theories are overwhelmingly supported with no evidence other than tales or folklores of giant sea, land, or flying creatures that play a huge factor in any and all important events that may or may not have occurred. The last, but certainly not the least, interesting fact is that the Yapese traditional kinship is patrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micsem.org/pubs/conferences/reflectionweek/frames/yapfamcngfr.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The only other patrilineal kinship in all of the Federated States of Micronesia is practiced in the Kingdom of Pingelap to this very day.

== History ==
Ever since the introduction of Democracy into the Micronesian regions, the Pingelapese people were grouped together with the remaining outer islands of Pohnpei to politically create the State of Pohnpei. The other cultural influences that are evident throughout Pingelapese history is the Spanish era portrayed in the Pingelapese dance called "Din Dihn" which is loosely translated in English to "Tin Tin". The dance reflects the introduction of a durable and foreign material called Tin by the Spaniards. After the Spaniards were the Japanese and the bilateral relationship created between both groups are still evident to this day at World War II sites found at the southern parts of Pingelap.

Foreign influence has altered the stability of the Pingelapese community, encouraging those native to the region to leave their homeland and move to other more populated areas or to the U.S. (incentivizing emigration under contract in the Federated States of Micronesia to work and study elsewhere, and enlist as military personnel to the United States military corp for a better living standard). More promising financial opportunities for the Pingelapese people, meant prioritizing the education of foreign languages over their homeland language.

Typhoons have frequently devastated the Pingelapese population. As a consequence of the Pingelapese population decreasing to a handful of typhoon survivors, inbreeding occurred among multiple Pingelapese generations, and genetic disorders such as achromatopsia (color blindness) now affect almost 1 in every 20 Pingelapese descendant today.

With the introduction of Christianity and the Church, the Pingelapese community has engaged themselves into the roles of the church and now portray a strong presence and has become a critical part of today's Pingelapese lifestyle since its establishment in the 19th century. Christmas is considered the biggest annual event to be participated in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Calendar system ==
The Pingelapese language has their own calendar system which corresponds with the [[lunar calendar]]. There are 12 months associated with this calendar&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pingelap Non-Sacred Knowledge|last=Stenson|first=Solomon|publisher=Historic Preservation Fund Grant Department of Land and Natural Resources|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=15–16|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date system ==
Each date of the month has a specific name. In proceeding order:

E Sukoru (1st) - also known as the new moon

E Ling (2nd)

E Sehm (3rd)

Masepeng (4th)

Masalim (5th)

Mesawon (6th)

In the Pingelapese culture, Monday marks the first day of the week. The names for the days of the week come from the Pingelapese non specific object numeral set. This number follows the prefix "niy-" to become the word designated for the day of the week. For example, the Pingelapese word for Monday is "niyaehd". The words for the other days of the months are as follows: niyari (Tuesday), niyesil (Wednesday), niyaepang (Thursday), and niyalim (Friday).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers is Kosraean and Ponaepeic|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numerals ==
The Pingelapese language incorporates at least five sets of numeral classifiers. These classifiers combine numbers and nouns. The nouns must have some sort of relation to the object for example, how it is shaped or how it is used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each of these set designates a different set of words to represent the numeral one through nine.

There is a set of words designated for deceiving long nouns, such as trees or roads. These numerals are:

1 - aepas

2 - risepas

3 - silipas

4 - pahpas

5 - luhpas

6 - woanaepas

7 - isipas

8 - waelaepas

9 - duaepas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Canberra, A.C.T.|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=Australia|pages=9, 10|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another set of words used to count animate things, such as: men, fish or birds. This words are as follows:

1 - aemen

2 - riaemaen

3 - silimaen

4 - pahmaen

5 - luhmaen

6 - woanaemaen

7 - isimaen

8 - waelaemaen

9 - duaemaen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A third set is designated for small or partial objects and these are as follows:

1 - ekis

2 - risekis

3 - silikis

4 - pahkis

5 - lumikis

6 - woanikis

7 - isikis

8 - waelikis

9 - duoau.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For all other nouns (couples, stream, land), there is another set of words to represent the numbers one through nine.

1 - eu

2 - riau

3 - silu

4 - pahu

5 - limau

6 - wonou

7 - isu

8 - waelu

9 - duoau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one final set of number names. This set is used to count things that are not specific. This list includes:

1 - aehd

2 - ari

3 - esil

4 - aepoang

5 - alim

6 - awoahn

7 - aeis

8 - aewael

9 - add

10 - eisik.

For numbers greater that nine, there is only one word for each numeral. they no longer vary depending on what they are being used to count. The Pingepalese words for numbers greater than 9 are as follows:

10 - eisaek

20 - rieisaek

30 - silihsaek

40 - pahisaek

50 - limeisaek

60 - woneisaek

70 - isihsaek

80 - waelihsaek

90 - tueisaek

100 - epwiki

200 - repwiki

300 - silipwiki

400 - pahpwiki

500 - limepwiki

600 - wonepwiki

700 - isipwiki

800 - waelipwiki

900 - duepwiki

1,000 - kid

10,000 - naen

100,000 - lop

1,000,000 - rar

10,000,000 - dep

100,000,000 - sap

1,000,000,000 - lik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=Canberra|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When reading a number in Pingelapse, start with the biggest number first and read the smaller numbers in succession.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this would be as follows: the number 1,769 would be spoken as "kid isipwiki woneisaek duoau".

== Sentence structure ==

The Pingelapese language has four major types of sentences. These four are transitive sentences, intransitive sentences, existential sentences, and equational sentences.

'''Transitive sentences'''

The first type of sentence, transitive, use transitive verbs. Transitive verbs have two main characteristics. The first characteristic is that it must be an action verb expressing an activity that can physically be done. For example, drink, sit, or drive. The second characteristic is that there must be a direct object, meaning someone or something has to be the recipient of the action verb. For example, Susan drank the water. Two participants must be involved to have a transitive sentence. There is also a fixed word order; Subject-Transitive verb-Object. For example, Susan (subject) filled (transitive verb) the cup (object). If the verb is active in a transitive sentence, the subject's semantic role is the agent. The object's semantic role would be the Patient. (Payne 2006:105-107) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Intransitive sentences'''

The second sentence structure used in Pingelapese would be intransitive verb sentences. An intransitive verb has no object attached to it. For example, Richard winked. In Pingelapese must be a stative verb or an active verb. A stative verb is when the person or object is affected by said verb. An active verb occurs if the action is performed by the subject. There is a specific word order for intransitive sentences too. This word is order Subject-Verb. Referring back to the previous example, Richard (subject) winked (verb). &amp;nbsp;There are also cases when the word order used is Verb-Subject for intransitive sentence structure, however not all intransitive verbs can use the Verb-Subject word order. Verb-Subject word order is only available in Pingelapese when referencing unaccusative verbs or by discourse pragmatics. Intransitive sentences also known as "existential" have a postverbal subject the majority of the time. Intransitive verbs only have one solid grammatical relation which is the subject of the sentence. When the verb is active the entity is doing the action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Existential sentences'''

Existential sentences are the third type of sentence structure used. Normally existential sentences that have a post-verbal subject are used in the beginning of a story to introduce new characters or objects that have not been referenced before. These verbs are not used when the character is already known. If a character is already known, the verb would be used in the preverbal position This form has a dominant post-verbal subject order. Post-verbal subjects allow new characters to be introduced or new and unknown events to happen. Existential sentences make a claim that something either exists or it does not. There are not many verbs of existential origin in Pingelapese. These include “minae” (to exist), “soh” (to not exist), “dir” (to exist in large numbers), and “daeri” (to be finished). All four of these verbs use a postverbal subject. &amp;nbsp;These words are generally used when introducing characters of a story. .&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Verbal equational sentences'''

In most Micronesian languages, a verb may not be required. Some sentences, called equational sentences, use one noun phrase to identify or locate another noun phrase, without the need of a verbal element. One of the nouns is used to indicate location and the other noun is used for identification. There is also an auxiliary verb located in between the two nouns. Pingelapese has a similar sentence type, although instead of a verbless construction it employs a verbal construction. ''e/ae'' are used in Pingelapese as auxiliary verbs, which are verbs that are used to supplement other verbs. These auxiliary verbs can be used independently to equate two noun phrases. They can also be used to indicate a question. ''e'' is used when the speaker is certain of his statement and ''ae'' is used when the speaker is uncertain of his statement. Example sentences are shown below.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''Calvin daekah Brenda e soaun-padahk-pwi''

‘Calvin and Brenda are teachers.”

''Calvin daekah Brenda ae soaun-padahk-pwi''

‘Calvin and Brenda are teachers?”

=== Direct questions ===

Direct questions are mostly asked with a question word, but when a question word is excluded from the sentence, a question is distinguished by a non-falling final intonation (remains steady or slightly spiked intonation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponaepeic|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=Canberra, Aus|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question words are as follows: "ish" means "who", "dah" means "what", "ngahd" means "when".

== Morphology ==
Similar to other languages, words in Pingelapese can take different forms to add to or even change their meanings. Verbal suffixes are morphemes added at the end of a word to change its form. Pingelapese uses many verbal suffixes, but few verbal prefixes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prefixes are those that are added at the front. For example, the Pingelapese suffix –''kin'' means ‘with’ or ‘at.’ It is added at the end of a verb.

''ius'' = to use --&gt; ''ius-kin'' = to use with

''mwahu'' = to be good --&gt; ''mwahu-kin'' = to be good at

''sa''- is an example of a verbal prefix. It is added to the beginning of a word and means ‘not.’ The following sentence is an example of how ''-sa'' is used.

''pwung'' = to be correct --&gt; ''sa-pwung'' = to be incorrect

There are also directional suffixes that when added to the root word give the listener a better idea of where the subject is headed. The verb ''alu'' means to walk. A directional suffix can be used to give more detail.

-''da'' = ‘up’ --&gt; ''aluh-da'' = to walk up

-''di'' = ‘down’ --&gt; ''aluh-di'' = to walk down

-''eng'' = ‘away from speaker and listener’ --&gt; ''aluh-eng'' = to walk away

Pingelapese also uses reduplication. This can be either partial or total reduplication when speaking with durative meaning. Triplification is also used. Generally a part of a verb or a whole verb is repeated to communicate continuative meaning. The only other two languages in Micronesia that use triplification are Tibetan, Chintang, Batwana, and Thao.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Directional suffixes are not limited to motion verbs. When added to non-motion verbs, their meanings are a figurative one. The following table gives some examples of directional suffixes and their possible meanings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

=== Reduplication and triplication ===

The Pingelapese language uses reduplication and triplication. Reduplication is used to show that a verb is being acted continuously. An example of this would be ("to bark" means "wou") and ("barking" Means "wouwou"). Triplication shows that the action is "still" happening. Using the same example ("wou-wou-wou" would mean "still barking").

Oftentimes with reduplication and triplication produce consonant clusters. There are two outcomes for the way the language handles these consonant clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponaepei|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=Cannabera|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first being, if the consonants are homorganic, the first would be left out and the next vowel is lengthened. An example of this would be the verb "to swim". In Pingepalese, the word for the verb "to swim" would be "pap", but the word for continuously swimming would be "pahpap", while "still swimming" would be "pahpahpap". If the consonants are not homorganic with each other, a vowel is inserted in between the two consonants to break them up. For example, the verb meaning "to dance" is "wen". The continuous action of "dancing" would be conveyed as "wenewen", while "still dancing would be "wenewenewen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponaepeic|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of reduplication comes in the same phoneme count as the aforementioned examples, three. The second most common occurrence of reduplication and triplication are in the replication of the first four phonemes. A few four phoneme reduplication examples are as follows: "kusupaek" (the coming of surf over reef in low tide) would be reduplicated as "kusukusupaek" and "kerir" (to love in secret) would be reduplicated as "kerikerir".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic|last=Good|first=Elaine|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=1989|isbn=0858833905|location=|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography ==
Many native speakers of Pingelapese have little practice reading and writing in their language. On the atoll and in other areas, Pingelapese speakers speak Pingelapese at home and at church. English and Pohnpeian are the main languages of education and administrative communication. Because of this, Pingelapese people have proficiency reading and writing in English and Pohnpeian, but few people are able to read or write Pingelapese, leaving it to be a predominantly spoken language.

There is a significant literacy challenge when it comes to learning Pingelapese. There are few study materials available to elementary school student to teach them Pingelapese, and therefore it is common for students to learn only English and Pohnpeian. Children often have a difficult time learning how to read and write both Pingelapese and Pohnpeian, often incorrectly correlating sounds and letters.

The difficulty of learning how to read and write in Pingelapese may also be due to an inadequate alphabet suited to the language. This along with the lack of training in the language makes many people reluctant to write in Pingelapese.

Unlike many other Micronesian languages, the Pingelapese people were never able to form a proper orthography committee board. The purpose of this board is to develop an official and agreed upon writing system. This has left the Pingelapese language with different spellings of its documents and records. For example, the name has been spelt as both Pingilap and Pingelap.

It has been reported that around fifty years ago there was an early orthography taught at the Pingelap elementary atoll. It is not known to many people, but elderly Pingelapese people have confirmed it. It is not actively used or taught in schools despite efforts to revive it. The loss of this orthography could have been due to emigration out of the Pingelap and into Pohnpei, increasing the use of the Pohnpeian alphabet. Most people who speak Pingelapese use Pohnpeic orthography for administrative and educational purposes and early orthography for history and legends of Pingelap. There are great differences between early orthography and Pohneic orthography when it comes to phonemic distinction. Some of these differences can alter the meaning of some words in Pingelapese. Some other differences are the number of vowels. Pingelapese has eight and Pohnpeian orthography has only six. This means that the distinction of some of the vowels in Pingelapese are underrepresented in Pohnpeic. These changes cause drastic ambiguity that context cannot fix, such as tense change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
The degree of language used differs between communities. All of the Pingelap communities have experienced language shift.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Pingelapse language consists of a total of thirty five phonemes. There are 11 consonants and 14 vowels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The consonants include p, pʷ, t, k, s, m, mʷ, n, ŋ, l, r.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pingelapese has ten syllables and eight vowel phonemes. This is the first recorded Pohnpeic language that has an eight-vowel system. Multiple young and elderly Pingelapese speakers in the Mwalok and Pingelap atoll can confirm this recent discovery of the eighth vowel. This is also the first Pohnpeic system that has a more symmetrical vowel system with [-round] [-back] vowels in four heights and [+round] [+back] vowels in four heights.

One of the consistent rules throughout Micronesia is vowel-shortening.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Low vowel dissimilation is a phonological process in which there are two low vowels in successive syllables, the first of which is raised. It is seen in various Micronesian languages as well as Ere, Southern Paamese, and in the Southern Vanuatu subgroup. Pingelapese is the first Pohnpeic language that demonstrates this process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Stand alone auxiliary verbs are also a constant in Pingelapese. These verbs are created by taking the ''ae, aen, e, and e'' from the pronoun auxiliary complex and will leave the person/number morphemes out.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Pronouns ==
Subject pronouns are personal pronouns that are used as the subject of a verb. In Pingelapese, subject pronouns originated from either proto-Micronesian subject agreement set or an independent pronoun set. Unlike English, Pingelapese subject pronouns can come in singular, dual, and plural forms, indicating the number of listeners the speaker is addressing. The following table gives some examples of subject pronouns in their singular, dual, and plural forms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Pingelapese also has auxiliary verbs and pronouns together. This is a concept known as pronoun-auxiliary complex. This is a concept strictly known in Pingelapese and no other Micronesian languages.

His eponymously named practice – ''R. Seifert and Partners'' (later the ''R. Seifert Co-Partnership'') was at its most prolific in the 1960s and 1970s, responsible for many major office buildings in Central London as well as large [[urban renewal|urban regeneration]] projects in other major British cities.

==Biography==
Seifert was born to a Swiss family and came to London when young. He attended the [[Central Foundation Boys' School]]&lt;ref name=cfbs&gt;{{cite web | title=Alumni | publisher=Central Foundation Boys' School | year=2013 | url=http://www.centralfoundationboys.co.uk/about/old-boys#top | accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently obtained a scholarship to the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]], graduating in 1933.&lt;ref name=guardianobit /&gt; Seifert served in the [[Royal Engineers]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Rubinstein2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Rubinstein|title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_T_HCg17ufIC&amp;pg=PA890|date=22 February 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-30466-6|pages=890–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seifert and his company were responsible for more London buildings than Sir [[Christopher Wren]] and designed more than 500 office blocks across the UK and Europe.&lt;ref name=guardianobit /&gt;

Following his retirement in 1984, his son John Seifert who had worked with his father for 15 years, took over the practice, which survived in various forms until 2010. John Seifert now practices under the name Sigma Architects in the UK and Seifert Architects LLC abroad – continuing the legacy of hotel and commercial developments begun by his father.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The '''Sasak''' people live mainly on the island of [[Lombok]], [[Indonesia]], numbering around 3.6 million (85% of Lombok's population). They are related to the Balinese in language and ancestry, although the Sasak are predominantly Muslim while the Balinese are Hindu. Sasak people who practice pre-Islamic beliefs are also known as '''Sasak Boda''' in reference to the name of the Sasak people's original religion, Bodha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erni Budiwanti|title=Islam Sasak: Wetu Telu versus Waktu Lima|year=2000|publisher=PT LKiS Pelangi Aksara|isbn=97-989-6651-1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
There is a possibility that the origin of the name ''Sasak'' came from the word ''sak-sak'', which means "boat". In the [[Nagarakretagama]], the word ''Sasak'' is mentioned together as one with [[Lombok Island]], namely ''Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi''. According to local tradition, it is believed that the word ''Sasak'' came from ''sa'-saq'' which means "the one". Followed by the word ''Lombok'' which originates from the word ''Lomboq'', meaning "straight". Hence by combining the words together ''Sa'-saq Lombok'', it means "something that's straight". Other translations also includes "a straight road".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/370636/perang-topat-perang-damai |title=Perang Topat, Perang Damai |publisher=Liputan6 |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi'' is taken from the [[Nagarakretagama]] (Desawarnana) literature, a scripture written by [[Mpu Prapanca]] that records the power and rule of the [[Majapahit]] kingdom. The word ''Lombok'' in [[Kawi language]] means "straight" or "honest", ''Mirah'' means "gem", ''Sasak'' means "statement", and ''Adhi'' means "something that's good" or "utmost". Therefore ''Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi'' means "honesty is the gem that states out goodness".

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Groep dansers uit Sasak TMnr 10004747.jpg|thumb|Sasak dancers.]]
Little is known about Sasak history except that Lombok was placed under direct rule of the [[Majapahit]] prime Minister, patih [[Gajah Mada]]. The Sasaks were forced to convert to [[Islam]] between the late 16th century to early 17th century under the influence of Pangeran Prapen (Sunan Prapen), the son of Raden Paku ([[Sunan Giri]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|editor=Martijn Theodoor Houtsma|title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936, Volume 5|year=1993|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-09791-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Harnish &amp; Anne Rasmussen|title=Divine Inspirations: Music and Islam in Indonesia|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-979309-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Sunan Giri]] himself and the Muslim Makassarese, frequently mixing basic Islamic beliefs with Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, thus creating the [[Wetu Telu]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaj Arhem &amp; Guido Sprenger|title=Animism in Southeast Asia|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-317-33662-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombok was conquered by the [[Gelgel, Indonesia|Gelgel]] Balinese kingdom in the early 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Cribb|title=Historical Atlas of Indonesia|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-136-78057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing a large population of Balinese to [[Lombok]]. The Balinese population of Lombok today is about 300,000, 10–15% of Lombok's population. The Balinese have also strongly influenced the [[Wetu Telu]] religion of Lombok.&lt;ref name="EOB"/&gt;

== Language ==

The [[Sasak language]] is closely related to the languages of [[Bali]] and [[Sumbawa]], and to most other languages of Western Indonesia more distantly. There are also a number of Sasak dialect in various regions such as Kuto-Kute (North Sasak), Meno-Mene (Central Sasak), Mriak-Mriku (Central South Sasak), Ngeno-Ngene (Central East Sasak, Central West Sasak), Ngeto-Ngete (Northeast Sasak) and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/sas |title=Sasak |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:sasak1.jpg|thumb|Sasak children in a Sasak village (ca. 1997).]]
Most of the Sasaks today are adherents of the Lima Waktu version of [[Islam]]. Lima Waktu or Five Times signifies the five daily prayers which Muslims are required to do.

The term Lima Waktu is used to distinguish them from the Sasaks who are practitioners of Wetu Telu or Three Symbols who only pray three times a day. Orthodox Islamic teachers generally instruct adherents to pray five times a day.

Large numbers of people adhering to the Wetu Telu faith can be still found throughout the island, especially in the village of [[Bayan, Lombok|Bayan]], where the religion originated. Large [[Wetu Telu]] communities can be still found in [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]], [[Pujung]], [[Sengkol]], [[Rambitan]], [[Sade, Lombok|Sade]], [[Tetebatu]], [[Bumbung]], [[Sembalun]], [[Senaru]], [[Loyok]] and [[Pasugulan]]. A small minority of Sasaks called the Bodha (estimated population: 8,000) are mainly found in the village of Bentek and on the slopes of [[Mount Rinjani|Gunung Rinjani]]. They are totally untouched by Islamic influence and worship animistic gods, incorporating some Hindu and Buddhist influences in their rituals and religious vocabulary. This group of Sasak, due in part to the name of their tribe, are recognized as [[Buddhist]]s by the Indonesian government.

The Bodha have the same magico-religious officials and institutions as the Wetu Telu (with the exception of course of the Kiyai, the Wetu Telu religious official dealing with all aspects of the Wetu Telu religion which mixes Islam and animism). The Bodhas recognize the existence of five main gods, the highest of which is Batara Guru, followed by Batara Sakti and Batara Jeneng with their wives Idadari Sakti and Idadari Jeneng, though they also believe in spirits and ghosts. The Bodha religion is also to some extent influenced by both [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] concepts. Of late, they have come under the influence of mainstream Buddhism from Buddhist missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.webshots.com/album/528286640msCUen Webshots pics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sechura language''', also known as '''Sek''', is an extinct language spoken in the [[Piura Region]] of [[Peru]], near the port of [[Sechura]]. It appears to have become extinct by the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Andean"&gt;{{cite book

Sechura is too poorly known to be definitively classified. Kaufman notes that a connection between Sechura and the [[Catacaoan languages]] is likely and is supported by lexical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Shirini''', which literally means “sweets” in [[Persian language]] ("shirin" = sweet) and its [[Dari language|Dari]] variant spoken in [[Afghanistan]], is the [[euphemism]] commonly used for bribes. 

In Afghanistan under the [[Karzai administration]], the rampant culture of corruption and especially [[Political corruption#Graft|graft]] from low-level police officers, who receive low salaries and are said to take bribes to subsist, to the highest level of government officials, became a major source of general discontent and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]]. Many interactions with authorities require ''shirini'' – like getting a new driver's license or paying a water or electricity bill.

This discontent drove a wedge between the government and the Afghan people, who under this administration grew more and more resentful of the established politics. It would turn people toward the [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Taliban]], which were perceived as relatively ''"clean"''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Naresuanbattlelephnt.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Jan. 1593 single combat, using [[war elephant]]s, between [[Siam]]ese King [[Naresuan]] and the [[Taungoo Dynasty|Burmese]] crown prince [[Mingyi Swa]] – still celebrated in Thai history (statue in [[Samut Prakan]] Province, [[Thailand]]).]]

'''Single combat''' is a [[duel]] between two single warriors which takes place in the context of a [[battle]] between two armies. Often, it is [[champion warfare]], with the two considered the [[champion]]s of their respective sides. Instances of single combat are known from [[Classical Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. The champions were often combatants who represented larger, spectator groups. Such representative contests and stories thereof are known worldwide.

Typically, it takes place in the [[no-man's-land]] between the opposing armies, with other warriors watching and themselves refraining from fighting until one of the two single combatants has won.

But single combat could also take place within a larger [[battle]].
Both [[ancient warfare|ancient]] and [[medieval warfare]] did not always rely on the [[Line (formation)|line]] or [[phalanx formation]]. The ''[[Iliad]]'' notably describes the battles of the Trojan war as a series of single encounters on the field, and the medieval code of [[chivalry]], partly inspired by this, encouraged the single combat between individual [[knight]]s on the battlefield, in which the loser was not usually killed but taken captive for [[ransom]].
This tradition ended in the 14th century due to the use of the [[English longbow|longbow]] and the [[pike square]] against mounted knights ([[Battle of Crécy]], [[Battle of Laupen]]), and the tradition of single combat was continued away from the battlefield, with the ''[[pas d'armes]]'' and the early modern [[duel]].

==Antiquity==
{{further information|Spolia opima}}

An important episode in "[[The Tale of Sinuhe]]", one of the most well-known works of [[Ancient Egyptian literature]], concerns the protagonist – an Egyptian exile in Upper [[Retjenu]] ([[Canaan]]) – defeating a powerful opponent in single combat.

Duels between individual warriors are depicted in the ''[[Iliad]]'', including those between [[Menelaus]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and later between [[Achilles]] and [[Hector]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also includes a few accounts of single combat, the most famous being [[David]] versus [[Goliath]].

Single combat is mentioned quite frequently in the history of [[ancient Rome]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Romulus]] defeated Acro, king of Caenina for the [[spolia opima]]; the [[Horatii]]'s defeat of the [[Alba Longa]]n Curiatii in the 7th century BC is reported by [[Livy]] to have settled a war in Rome's favor and subjected Alba Longa to Rome; [[Aulus Cornelius Cossus]] defeated [[Lars Tolumnius]], king of the [[Veientes]] in single combat and took the spolia opima. In the 5th century BC; [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] took the ''[[spolia opima]]'' from [[Viridomarus]], king of the [[Gaesatae]], at the [[Battle of Clastidium]] (222&amp;nbsp;BC); and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30&amp;nbsp;BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus]] from Deldo, king of the [[Bastarnae]] (29&amp;nbsp;BC).

Depictions of single combat also appear in the Hindu epics of the [[Mahābhārata]] and the [[Ramayana]]. Single combats are often preludes to battles in the Chinese epic ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and are featured prominently throughout the epic.

==Middle Ages==
In ''[[The Cattle Raid of Cooley]]'', a famous episode of [[Irish mythology]], all the warriors of [[Ulster]] but [[Cúchulainn]] are made sick by a curse and unable to fight the invading army of Queen Maeb, leaving Cúchulainn to fight a whole series of single combats by himself until they recover. The [[Welsh Mythology|Welsh mythological tale]], the [[Math fab Mathonwy (Branch)|Fourth Branch]] of the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Mabinogi]], depicts a single combat between the [[Kingdom of Dyfed|southern]] prince [[Pryderi]] and the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|northern]] magician Gwydion, to determine the victor of a war between the two kingdoms.

Many battles depicted in the medieval [[Chanson de Roland]] consist of a series of single combats, as are battles depicted in various tales of the ''[[Arabian Nights]]''. [[Guy of Warwick]], the legendary English [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]] hero, is depicted as defeating in single combat the [[Viking]] giant [[Colbrand (giant)|Colbrand]]; the story is set in the time of [[Athelstan of England]], but actually reflects the society of the late Middle Ages.

An important episode in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s legendary ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]''  is the single combat between prince [[Nennius of Britain]] and [[Julius Caesar]].

Single combat was also a prelude to battles in pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arabia]] and early [[Islamic]] battles. For example, the [[Battle of Badr]], one of the most important in the [[early history of Islam]], was opened by three champions of the Islamic side (Ali, Ubaydah, and Hamzah) stepping forward, engaging and defeating three of the then-Pagan [[Mecca]]ns, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |title=Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659 |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210042129/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |archivedate=2011-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result of the three single combats was considered to have substantially contributed to the Muslim victory in the overall battle which followed. Duels were also part of other battles at the time of [[Muhammad]], such as the [[battle of Uhud]], [[battle of the Trench]] and the [[battle of Khaybar]].

Single combats were characteristic of the [[Samurai]] fighting tradition and known as ''Ikki-uchi''. As each samurai commanded his unit of retainers, successfully challenging and defeating the opposing samurai by a single combat can force the entire unit to retreat minimizing casualties and changing the course of battle. Those seeking a suitable opponent, frequently used [[Nanori]] to issue a challenge by announcing his name and bravery as well as ridiculing opponents to boost morale of his side as well as enrage the opponent to force the combat. As this is a high-risk-low-return strategy for the winning side, already defeated side, or ill-matched opponent (difference of personal standing or martial reputation) it was acceptable to decline or elude the single combat. An example of single-combat with the tragic result for the victor is told in [[Heike Monogatari]] as [[Kumagai Naozane]] defeated [[Taira no Atsumori]] at the [[Battle of Ichi-no-Tani]]. It could be banned by the overall commander as needed and notably during [[Mongol invasions of Japan]], particularly during the second invasion in 1281, samurai fought as massed mounted archer/warrior with the annihilation of enemy as the goal. This tradition declines and disappears during the [[Sengoku period]] as each side prepared trained armies in thousands or even tens of thousands making the single combat have a limited, if any, effect on the outcome of the battle.

In Russia, single combat is known as  ''bash na bash'' (an old Russian expression meaning "one-on-one"), substituting a fight between champions for a full-scale battle was a traditional way to avoid the bloodshed of an internecine war. The leaders of the opposing ''[[druzhina]]s'' or other armed groups either rode towards the centre of the battlefield or sent messengers to negotiate whether the two most skilled fighters or the leaders themselves would engage in single combat, usually to the death. The outcome of the champions' fight would then be taken as a sign of which side the higher powers favoured, and could have political consequences similar to the result of a full battle.

The oldest written account of such a fight is found in [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor's]]' ''[[Primary Chronicle]]''; it describes a duel between a [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan]] champion and the Pechenegs' best fighter. The most well-known fight, however, was that between Prince [[Mstislav of Chernigov|Mstislav the Brave]] of [[Tmutarakan]] and the [[Circassians|Kasog]] Prince [[Rededia]] in 1022, in which Mstislav killed Rededia with his bare hands. According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', Mstislav's victory allowed him to take tribute from the Kasogs and to have a church built; he also took Rededia's wife and two sons and had them baptised into Christianity, upon which he had his daughter married to Rededia's son according to the tradition of the times. Although Rededia had been killed, he was honoured by Mstislav, and his family joined the ranks of the [[Russian nobility]].

The semi-legendary [[The Tale of the Destruction of Riazan|Tale of the Destruction of Riazan]] includes an extensive account of the  combat between the Russian hero [[Eupaty Kolovrat]] and the Tatar warrior Hostovrul. Kolovrat splits his opponent in half with his sword and wins the duel. However, Kolovrat is then attacked and killed from a distance by Tatar stone throwers. The Mongol ruler [[Batu Khan]], impressed with his bravery, honours his body.

[[File:Peresv b.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Alexander Peresvet fights Chelubey. By [[Victor Vasnetsov]] (1914)]]
Sometimes however, such single combat would merely initiate a battle rather than prevent it. The most famous example of this was the duel between Russian monk [[Alexander Peresvet]] and the [[Golden Horde]] champion Chelubey or Temir-Murza at the beginning of the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380. The champions killed each other in the first run, though according to Russian [[legend]], Peresvet did not fall from the [[saddle]], while Temir-murza did.

In [[Kerala]], India, duelling between warriors was used to settle conflicts between local rulers.
The prime martial caste of Kerala, [[Nair]]s, and some prominent [[Ezhava]] families made up the [[Chekavar]]s (which literally means "those who are prepared to die" in the   [[Malayalam]] language). Some prominent warriors who took part in such ''ankam'' (duels) were [[Thacholi Othenan]], [[Unniarcha]], [[Aromal Chekavar]], whose legends are described in the ''Vadukkan Pattukal'' (Northern Ballads). The [[Mamankam]] Festival held by the [[Zamorin]] ruler in the kingdom of modern-day [[Kozhikode]], was a ritual which glorified the martial traditions of warrior families in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]. The ritual ended after the Zamorin was overthrown. The Kerala practice was discontinued in the 19th century under the [[British Raj]].

In personal combat, fought on the backs of [[war elephants]], during a war between [[Burma]] and [[Siam]], Siamese King [[Naresuan]] slew Burmese Crown Prince [[Mingyi Swa]] in 1593.

==Modern examples==

Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown]] is reputed in his earlier career as a mercenary in Eastern Europe to have defeated, killed and beheaded Turkish commanders in three single combats, for which he was [[knight]]ed by the [[Transylvania]]n Prince [[Sigismund Báthory]] and given a horse and [[coat of Arms]] showing three Turks' heads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29smith.htm Not Just Another John Smith], usnews.com, January 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Dramatist [[Ben Jonson]], in conversations with the poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden|William Drummond]], recounted that when serving in the [[Low Countries]] as a volunteer with the regiments of [[Francis Vere]], he had defeated an opponent in single combat "in view of both armies" and stripped him of his weapons.&lt;ref name=Hawthornden&gt;{{cite book|last=Drummond|first=William|title=Heads of a conversation betwixt the famous poet Ben Johnson and William Drummond of Hawthornden, January 1619|year=1619|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubHPBcMk2OMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22William+Drummond%22+jonson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, single combats have become iconic&amp;nbsp;– though often apocryphal&amp;nbsp;– elements of [[Dogfight|aerial dogfights]], with the idea, if not the practice, of single combat in the skies particularly prevalent during the [[World War I|First World War]] with the air forces' emphasis on a sort of individualism and chivalry. [[Manfred von Richthofen]], the infamous "Red Baron", is recorded as writing "If I am alone with an opponent ... only a jammed gun or an engine problem can prevent me from shooting him down."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|author1=Tucker, S.|author2=Wood, L.M.|author3=Murphy, J.D.|date=1999|publisher=Garland Pub.|isbn=9780815333517|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gv3GEyB19wIC|page=11|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1979 book ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'', journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] argues that the [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] [[astronaut]]s were treated as single-combat warriors versus the Soviet [[cosmonauts]] during the [[Space Race]] as part of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Tom|title=The Right Stuff|date=1979|publisher=Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=9780374250324|pages=120–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science fiction==

Science fiction writer [[Fredric Brown]] wrote the story "[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]" in which a human space fleet prepares for battle with an invading alien fleet when a superior "elder race" intervenes, plucking a single human and a single malevolent alien to fight to engage in single combat as the champions of their respective species.

'''Snow's Court''' is an alley of historic dwellings located in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood in [[Washington D.C.]]

==Origin and early history (1850-1880)==
Formerly known as "Snow's Alley," this historical dwelling was founded on Lot 1 of Square 28 within Foggy Bottom's primarily [[industrial district]] in the year 1858 - the lot itself being situated between 24th and 25th streets and I and K streets (NW; intersecting with New Hampshire Avenue) as indicated by the empty lot in the bottom right hand corner of the square as indicated in Boschke's map of Washington City in 1857.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borchert|first=James|title=Alley Life in Washington: Family, Community, Religion and Folklife in the City, 1850- 1970|year=1982|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Map of Washington City 1857.jpg|thumb|Zoomed in section of Albert Boshke's Map of Washington City depicting the location of Snow's Court (Square 28). The streets displayed are 25th, 24th, 23rd, H, I, K, and L.]]

Snow's Court was originally constructed by C.A. Snow, a private landowner and long-time resident of Foggy Bottom, as well as the publisher of one of Washington, D.C.'s foremost news publications, The [[National Intelligencer]].&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Snow subdivided his lot into several, smaller installations as exampled in G.M. Hopkins's map of Snow's Court in 1887. [[File:Hopkins map 1887.jpg|thumb|Zoomed in section of Hopkin's Plat Map of Washington, DC, 1887, depicting the location of Snow's property in Square 28 (Lot 1).]] These include construction of a [[greenhouse]] (relatively larger in comparison than standard alley home plot) and an additional four [[Framing (construction)|frame-houses]] from which he derived a source of profit by renting these subdivided plots to a contingent of four [[Irish American|Irish immigrants]], one of whom Snow was reported to have personally employed at the greenhouse to tend to its upkeep while Snow himself most likely followed the common trend of residing off-site from his development.

==Social life==
At its founding, Snow's Court was a predominately [[Irish people|Irish]] alley, but during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] it became a barracks for disabled soldiers in the Union Army kicking out all the Irishmen.&lt;ref name = "test" /&gt;   After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], an influx of [[Freedman|freed African Americans]] came to city looking for housing. With few low-income options, they flocked to the alleys, including Snow's Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|title=Boyd's City Directory|year=1892|publisher=W.H. Boyd|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatic increase in population led to severe overcrowding issues which exacerbated other problems such as [[Sanitation|unsanitary living situations]] and the spread of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newcomb|first=Simon|title=The Reminiscences of an Astronomer|year=1903|publisher=The Riverside Press|location=Cambridge|pages=610–611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's Court had a history of high crime rates and a reputation for being a dangerous neighborhood. Residents were perceived as being cruel towards outsiders, but with a deep connection to each other. It was considered a close-knit neighborhood where members were reliant on one another for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borchert|first=James|title=Urban Neighborhoods and Community: Informal Group Life, 1850-1970|journal=The Journal of Interdisciplinary History|date=Spring 1981|volume=11|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their defensive attitude made it difficult for people to move in, but once a person became part of the alley they were involved in the community for a lifetime. Snow's Court, like other alleys, obviously had its problems. These included overcrowding, low socioeconomic status among residents, and high rates of disease.

==Living conditions==
By the end of 1870, Snows Court had over 300 inhabitants, far more than the dwellings were originally equipped to handle. In the early 1870s, The Board of Health considered the dwellings uninhabitable. In the Second Annual Report of the Board of Health, there were over 1,500 nuisances in alley dwellings in 1873.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Third Annual Report of the Board of Health|year=1872|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nuisances included overcrowding, no drainage, leaking roofs, low grade building structures, insufficient sheltering conditions, and disease [[epidemic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borchert|first=James|title=The Rise and Fall of Washington's Inhabited Alleys: 1852-1972|publisher=Historical Society of Washington, D.C.|issn=0897-9049|jstor=40067777|pages=267–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the results of this preliminary investigation the objections to our alleys may be summarized as follows:
* (1) The existence of blind alleys or [[cul-de-sac]]s shutting off small communities from the outside world and which are calculated not only to promote sickness, but also immorality and crime. 
* (2) The undue prevalence of immorality and crime, since it may be taken for granted that the majority of alley tenants suffer positive deterioration from witnessing the uncurbed vice around them. 
* (3) High rents in proportion to the income of the families, especially in consideration of the accommodations offered and the actual value of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kober|first=George|title=The History and Development of the Housing Movement in the City of Washington, D.C.|year=1897–1927|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Health officials also explained that the [[Shanty town|shanties]] and uninhabitable homes were overcrowded with families who were too poor to afford any better living conditions. Because the alleys were mostly filled with poor blacks during this time, [[Improved sanitation|sanitation in them was not addressed and fixed]] until years later through demolition. Before their demolition, officials explained the immediate need for action in the alleys, whether they directly impacted the citizens of Washington or not. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;…I would that I could make my language convincing to every citizen of Washington who values his health and that of his family, so convincingly that he would not rest until every squalid shanty and its aggregation of poisonous filth be wiped out of existence, the alleys, all of every width, [[sewerage|sewered]] and have a sufficient number of proper [[Trap (plumbing)|traps]], be paved with substantial concrete pavements, [[Fire hydrant|water plugs]] at convenient points, and every morning of the year be flushed thoroughly, and such exact regulations enforced as will prevent the deposit of anything obnoxious therein. Out of sight, therefore out of mind, must not any longer be said of these alleys, and I cannot leave this subject which I know is vital to the cause in which we labor, without urging again that the Board initiate such action as will secure the desired object....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=First Annual Report of the Board of Health|year=1872|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Board of Health stated that the environment gave no incentive for progress, learning, or success, and instead it provided a breeding ground for deadly diseases and horrendous crimes. The Board of Health also explained that sanitization should be a big issue and that these [[slum]]s should be cleaned up to help the community not destroy it. "...[L]ift them out of these reeking slums, and provide for their living where the free air and sunlight will elevate their lives, and give them health in a place of filth, crowd, poison, and contagion." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Snow's Court today==
Snow's Court is now considered prime real estate for the Foggy Bottom neighborhood and many of the homes are owned by middle to upper-middle class whites.  This is a complete change in direction from the dilapidated slum it once was.  The shift can be attributed to the set of reforms put in place by individuals particularly invested in the cleaning up of these breeding grounds for disease and crime.  These individuals included President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who both sought out to discontinue the development of alley dwellings as part of the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, Alley Life ..., p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  James Borchert documents the steady decline in alley dwelling in his maps detailing the number of residents in alleys around D.C. in 1927 and 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, Alley Life ..., pp. 49 and 53&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking at the maps you can see that in 1927 there were over 50 dwellings remaining in Snow's Court, but by 1970, only 20-29 remained.

Upon entering Snow's Court, perhaps the most prominent remnants of the site are the brick alley dwelling structures established during both governmental and private investors' renovation of the area during the Civil War used to house military personnel, as well as several other multi-story dwellings that were built on the surrounding lots between 1880-1910 after their owners were issued permits to construct new dwellings on Square 28.

When observing Sasche's "Bird's Eye View" map of the city of Washington in 1884, the structures present in this depiction are still present today, including the residences on Lots 24 and 25, which initially consisted of 13 two-story brick dwellings constructed the year of this map's production.

Although not many of the present structures are reflected by Sasche's diagram, it is historically accurate, as those two lots, in addition to the frame buildings dotted along the exterior of C.A. Snow's, were among the only to be granted a permit for construction as housing residences at this time (other more significant construction within the alley took place after this year represented). Such frame houses had in time been replaced with brick structures. In terms of preserved architecture, there are a few larger dwelling facilities that did not appear to have been in continued use, but were not razed as were condemned buildings in other squares (perhaps out of [[Historic preservation|historical preservation]], as some buildings were affixed with plaques detailing their significance). [[File:Site of the Founding Meeting of the Foggy Bottom Association in Snows Court, Washington DC.jpg|thumb|Site of the Founding Meeting of the Foggy Bottom Association in Snows Court, Washington D.C. (June 1959)]]

There were, however, large [[apartment]] complexes within the square on the opposite side that very well could have replaced these buildings for sanitary health purposes and space efficiency. [[File:City Hall Apartment Complex, Snows Court, Washington DC.jpg|thumb|City Hall Apartment Complex, Snows Court, Washington D.C.]] There are also many buildings that have been re-plastered in certain places – filling damaged locations that compromised structural integrity with newer material (brick, or boarded with a hard polymer) and cement that can be quite obviously discerned when juxtaposed with older, worn brick from initial construction on building facades. [[File:Back of Nameless Building in Snows Court, Washington DC.jpg|thumb|Shows replastered apartment style building from the site's initial construction.]]

While some of the larger complexes were not in use, many of the smaller, individual residences built during the Civil War were still in current usage by Foggy Bottom citizens as modern-day dwellings that have preserved the architecture from their initial construction.

Although the allure of convenience to industry in the surrounding area has decreased in relevance with the advent of affordable [[Public transport|public transit]] and automobiles (in addition to garage space also available in the alley), Snow's Court still remains consistent in  fulfilling its intended purpose to serve as homes for citizens of Foggy Bottom.

==By country==

===Canada===
In [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]] and [[Winnipeg]]  they are known as squeegee kids and they are mostly tolerated, since they are considered to be working for money, rather than begging.  In [[Montreal]] they are often called squeegee punks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A comedy of infractions |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1998/062598/news7.html |work=[[Montreal Mirror]] |author=Jacquie Charlton |accessdate = 2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to their appearance, or simply squeegees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Squeegee |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg0XQRDRi-M&amp;feature=related |work=[[YouTube]] |language=French |accessdate = 2007-09-25}} Video of squeegee punks in the streets of Montreal.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the [[Ontario]] government passed the [[Safe Streets Act]], outlawing squeegee kids and aggressive public begging. The Government of British Columbia have adopted a word for word version of Ontario Safe Street Act. Squeegee kids have become scarce in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, BC curbsides, as police frequently stop them and check their identities for outstanding arrest warrants.

In 2011, Deputy Mayor of Toronto [[Doug Holyday]] told the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' that there was the will in council to step up action against panhandlers, including squeegee kids;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Sue-Ann|title=Buddy can you spare a crime|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/01/buddy-can-you-spare-a-crime|accessdate=7 June 2011|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=1 June 2011|location=Toronto ON}}&lt;/ref&gt; the proposition was mocked by some media, given the previous efforts, and the suggestion that the homeless would have to pay fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGrath|first=John Michael|title=Doug Holyday wants to fight panhandling—also, party—like it’s 1999|url=http://www.torontolife.com/daily/informer/the-old-normal/2011/06/03/doug-holyday-wants-to-fight-panhandling%E2%80%94also-party%E2%80%94like-it%E2%80%99s-1999/|accessdate=7 June 2011|newspaper=Toronto Life|date=3 June 2011|location=Toronto ON|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606041155/http://www.torontolife.com/daily/informer/the-old-normal/2011/06/03/doug-holyday-wants-to-fight-panhandling%E2%80%94also-party%E2%80%94like-it%E2%80%99s-1999/|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[London]]ers, and perhaps others, extend the appellation to include those who roam in the midst of stopped traffic to not only wash windscreens, but also hawk items such as roses and newspapers. For this reason, they are sometimes called squeegee merchants.

===United States===
In [[New York City]] in the 1980s, the usual procedure would involve groups of squeegee men surrounding cars stopped in traffic. Although some merely provided a service, in other cases the windshield-washing would be carried out without asking, often perfunctorily, and with subsequent demands for payment, sometimes with added threats of smashing the car's windshield if their demands were not met. Upon his election, mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] famously sought to remove squeegee men from the streets&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Drum, ''America's Real Criminal Element: Lead'' January/February 2013 Issue, "[https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline]", visited 8 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his quality-of-life campaign, claiming that their near-ubiquitous presence created an environment of disorder that encouraged more serious crime to flourish. Squeegee men disappeared from city streets during Giuliani's mayoralty and did not reappear in significant numbers.

In his book ''[[Leadership (book)|Leadership]]'', Giuliani explained that his method of removing the squeegee men from the street involved arresting them. Patrolmen who first made the arrests saw that the squeegee men were released immediately, because according to the New York penal code at the time, cleaning someone's windshield was not illegal. Giuliani told the officers that if they saw any more squeegee men they should simply arrest them for [[jaywalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giuliani's Legacy: Taking Credit For Things He Didn't Do |url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/commentary/91.barrett.shtml |work=[[Gotham Gazette]] |author=Wayne Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''substance use disorder''' ('''SUD'''), also known as a '''drug use disorder''', is a condition in which the use of one or more substances leads to a clinically significant impairment or distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nami.org/Content/ContentGroups/Policy/Issues_Spotlights/DSM5/Substance_Use_Disorder_Paper_4_13_2010.pdf | title=NAMI Comments on the APA’s Dr aft Revision of the DSM-V Substance Use Disorders | publisher=National Alliance on Mental Illness | accessdate=2 November 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122085833/http://www.nami.org/content/contentgroups/policy/issues_spotlights/dsm5/substance_use_disorder_paper_4_13_2010.pdf | archivedate=22 January 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- A more recent source would be preferable--&gt; Although the term ''substance'' can refer to any physical matter, 'substance' in this context is limited to [[psychoactive drug]]s.

==Definitions==
{{addiction glossary|reverse citation order=yes}}
Substance abuse may lead to addiction, substance dependence, or both.  Medically, physiologic dependence requires the development of [[physiological tolerance|tolerance]] leading to [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms.  Both abuse and dependence are distinct from [[Substance dependence|addiction]] which involves a [[compulsive behavior|compulsion]] to continue using the substance despite the negative consequences, and may or may not involve [[chemical dependency]]. Dependence often implies abuse, but abuse frequently occurs without dependence, particularly when an individual first begins to abuse a substance.  Dependence involves [[physiological]] processes while substance abuse reflects a complex interaction between the individual, the abused substance and society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mclean.harvard.edu/research/adarc/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Substance abuse is sometimes used as a synonym for [[drug abuse]], [[drug addiction]], and [[chemical dependency]], but actually refers to the use of substances in a manner outside sociocultural conventions.  All use of [[controlled drug]]s and all use of other drugs in a manner not dictated by convention (e.g. according to physician's orders or societal norms) is abuse according to this definition; however there is no universally accepted definition of substance abuse.

The physical harm for twenty drugs was compared in an article in the Lancet (see diagram, above right){{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Physical harm was assigned a value from 0 to 3 for acute harm, chronic harm and intravenous harm. Shown is the mean physical harm. Not shown, but also evaluated, was the social harm.

Substance use may be better understood as occurring on a spectrum from beneficial to problematic use. This conceptualization moves away from the ill-defined binary antonyms of "use" vs. "abuse" (see diagram, lower right) towards a more nuanced, public health-based understanding of substance use.

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV TR) describes [[physical dependence]], [[drug abuse|abuse]] of, and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] from [[drugs]] and other [[substance abuse|substances]]. It does not use the word 'addiction' at all. It has instead a section about [[substance dependence]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Substance dependence When an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, [[substance dependence]] may be diagnosed. Compulsive and repetitive use may result in tolerance to the effect of the drug and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. This, along with [[Substance abuse|Substance Abuse]] are considered Substance Use Disorders..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/subdep.htm DSM-IV &amp; DSM-IV-TR:Substance Dependence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024534/http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/subdep.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

The DSM definition of addiction can be boiled down to compulsive use of a substance (or engagement in an activity) despite ongoing negative consequences.  The medical community makes a distinction between physical dependence (characterized by symptoms of physical [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms, like [[tremor]]s and sweating) and psychological dependence (emotional-motivational withdrawal symptoms). Physical dependence is simply needing a substance to function.  Humans are all physically dependent upon oxygen, food and water.  A drug can cause physical dependence and not psychological dependence (for example, some blood pressure medications, which can produce fatal withdrawal symptoms if not tapered) and some can cause psychological dependence without physical dependence (the withdrawal symptoms associated with [[cocaine]] are all psychological, there is no associated vomiting or diarrhea as there is with opiate withdrawal).

There are several different screening tools that have been validated for use with adolescents [[CRAFFT Screening Test|such as the CRAFFT]] and adults [[CAGE questionnaire|such as the CAGE]].

===Addiction===
[[Addiction]] is a disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences. Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process – one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus – is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction. The two properties that characterize all addictive stimuli are that they are reinforcing (i.e., they increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them) and intrinsically rewarding (i.e., they are perceived as being inherently positive, desirable, and pleasurable).

=== Physical dependency ===
[[Physical dependence]] on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic physical [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms when the substance is suddenly discontinued. [[Opiates]], [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[barbiturate]]s,  [[alcohol]] and [[nicotine]] induce physical dependence. On the other hand, some categories of substances share this property and are still not considered addictive: [[cortisone]], [[beta blocker]]s and most [[antidepressant]]s are examples.

Some substances induce physical dependence or [[physiological tolerance]] - but not addiction&amp;nbsp;— for example many [[laxative]]s, which are not psychoactive; nasal [[decongestant]]s, which can cause rebound congestion if used for more than a few days in a row; and some antidepressants, most notably [[venlafaxine]], [[paroxetine]] and [[sertraline]], as they have quite short [[Half-life|half-lives]], so stopping them abruptly causes a more rapid change in the neurotransmitter balance in the brain than many other antidepressants.  Many non-addictive prescription drugs should not be suddenly stopped, so a doctor should be consulted before abruptly discontinuing them.

The speed with which a given individual becomes addicted to various substances varies with the substance, the frequency of use, the means of ingestion, the intensity of pleasure or euphoria, and the individual's genetic and psychological susceptibility. Some people may exhibit alcoholic tendencies from the moment of first intoxication, while most people can drink socially without ever becoming addicted. Opioid dependent individuals have different responses to even low doses of opioids than the majority of people, although this may be due to a variety of other factors, as opioid use heavily stimulates pleasure-inducing neurotransmitters in the brain. Nonetheless, because of these variations, in addition to the adoption and twin studies that have been well replicated, much of the medical community is satisfied that addiction is in part genetically moderated. That is, one's genetic makeup may regulate how susceptible one is to a substance and how easily one may become attached to a pleasurable routine.

[[Eating disorder]]s are complicated pathological mental illnesses and thus are not the same as addictions described in this article. Eating disorders, which some argue are not addictions at all, are driven by a multitude of factors, most of which are highly different from the factors behind addictions described in this article. It has been reported, however, that patients with eating disorders can successfully be treated with the same non-pharmacological protocols used in patients with chemical addiction disorders.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, M Keller, GC Colapietro, SM Melemis, N Leskovac,  T Timcisko. Comparison of alternative treatment techniques in bulimia: The chemical dependency approach. ''Psychological Reports''. 82(2):451-458, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambling is another potentially addictive behavior with some biological overlap. Conversely gambling urges have emerged with the administration of [[Pramipexole|Mirapex]] (pramipexole), a dopamine [[agonist]].&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. Drugs of Abuse--Second Edition. Los Angeles, Practice Management Information Corporation, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The obsolete term physical addiction is deprecated, because of its connotations. In modern pain management with opioids physical dependence is nearly universal. High-quality, long-term studies are needed to better delineate the risks and benefits of chronic opiate use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} 

===Psychological dependency===

Psychological dependency on a substance is defined by the appearance of emotional-motivational [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms (e.g., anxiety, [[irritability]], [[anhedonia]], [[depression (mood)|depressed mood]], restlessness, etc.) when the substance is suddenly discontinued.  Psychological dependence is not unique to substances; for example, [[separation anxiety]] occurs in young children when they lack exposure to individuals to whom they're emotionally attached.

== Causes ==

===Risk factors===
As demonstrated by the chart below, numerous studies have examined factors which mediate substance abuse or dependence. In these examples, the predictor variables lead to the mediator which in turn leads to the outcome, which is always substance abuse or dependence. For example, research has found that being raised in a single-parent home can lead to increased exposure to stress and that increased exposure to stress, not being raised in a single-parent home, leads to substance abuse or dependence.&lt;ref name="pmid16393197"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrett AE, Turner RJ |title=Family structure and substance use problems in adolescence and early adulthood: examining explanations for the relationship |journal=Addiction |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=109–20 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16393197 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01296.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are some, but by no means all, of the possible mediators of substance abuse.

As demonstrated by the chart below, numerous studies have examined factors which moderate substance abuse or dependence. In these examples, the moderator variable impacts the level to which the strength of the relationship varies between a given predictor variable and the outcome of substance abuse or dependence. For example, there is a significant relationship between psychobehavioral risk factors, such as tolerance of deviance, rebelliousness, achievement, perceived drug risk, familism, family church attendance and other factors, and substance abuse and dependence. That relationship is moderated by familism which means that the strength of the relationship is increased or decreased based on the level of familism present in a given individual.&lt;ref name="pmid16173675"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brook JS, Pahl K |title=The protective role of ethnic and racial identity and aspects of an Africentric orientation against drug use among African American young adults |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=166 |issue=3 |pages=329–45 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16173675 |pmc=1315285 |doi= 10.3200/GNTP.166.3.329-345|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mediators and moderators can be found in several empirical studies. For example, Pilgrim et al.’s hypothesized mediation model posited that school success and time spent with friends mediated the relationship between parental involvement and risk-taking behavior with substance use (2006).&lt;ref name="pmid16572302"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pilgrim CC, Schulenberg JE, O'Malley PM, Bachman JG, Johnston LD |title=Mediators and moderators of parental involvement on substance use: a national study of adolescents |journal=Prev Sci |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=75–89 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16572302 |doi=10.1007/s11121-005-0019-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the relationship between parental involvement and risk-taking behavior is explained via the interaction with third variables, school success and time spent with friends. In this example, increased parental involvement led to increased school success and decreased time with friends, both of which were associated with decreased drug use. Another example of mediation involved risk-taking behaviors. As risk-taking behaviors increased, school success decreased and time with friends increased, both of which were associated with increased drug use. 
A second example of a mediating variable is depression. In a study by Lo and Cheng (2007),&lt;ref name="pmid17366254"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lo CC, Cheng TC |title=The impact of childhood maltreatment on young adults' substance abuse |journal=Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=139–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17366254 |doi=10.1080/00952990601091119 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; depression was found to mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and subsequent substance abuse in adulthood. In other words, childhood physical abuse is associated with increased depression, which in turn, in associated with increased drug and alcohol use in young adulthood. More specifically, depression helps to explain how childhood abuse is related to subsequent substance abuse in young adulthood.

A third example of a mediating variable is an increase of externalizing symptoms. King and Chassin (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King KM, Chassin L |title=Adolescent stressors, psychopathology, and young adult substance dependence: a prospective study |journal=J Stud Alcohol Drugs |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=629–38 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18781237 |pmc=2575393}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted research examining the relationship between stressful life events and drug dependence in young adulthood. Their findings identified problematic externalizing behavior on subsequent substance dependency. In other words, stressful life events are associated with externalizing symptoms, such as aggression or hostility, which can lead to peer alienation or acceptance by socially deviant peers, which could lead to increased drug use. The relationship between stressful life events and subsequent drug dependence however exists via the presence of the mediation effects of externalizing behaviors.

An example of a moderating variable is level of cognitive distortion. An individual with high levels of cognitive distortion might react adversely to potentially innocuous events, and may have increased difficulty reacting to them in an adaptive manner (Shoal &amp; Giancola, 2005).&lt;ref name="pmid16366766"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoal GD, Giancola PR |title=The relation between social problems and substance use in adolescent boys: an investigation of potential moderators |journal=Exp Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=357–66 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16366766 |doi=10.1037/1064-1297.13.4.357 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Shoal and Giancola investigated the moderating effects of cognitive distortion on adolescent substance use. Individuals with low levels of cognitive distortion may be more apt to choose more adaptive methods of coping with social problems, thereby potentially reducing the risk of drug use. Individuals with high levels of cognitive distortions, because of their increased misperceptions and misattributions, are at increased risk for social difficulties. Individuals may be more likely to react aggressively or inappropriately, potentially alienating themselves from their peers, thereby putting them at greater risk for delinquent behaviors, including substance use and abuse. In this study, social problems are a significant risk factor for drug use when moderated by high levels of cognitive distortions.

===Dependence===

Upregulation of the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) [[signal transduction]] pathway by [[cAMP response element binding protein]] (CREB), a gene [[transcription factor]], in the [[nucleus accumbens]] is a common mechanism of [[psychological dependence]] among several classes of drugs of abuse.&lt;ref name="pmid26740398"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestler EJ | title = Reflections on: "A general role for adaptations in G-Proteins and the cyclic AMP system in mediating the chronic actions of morphine and cocaine on neuronal function" | journal = Brain Res. | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2015 | pmid = 26740398 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2015.12.039 | quote =  Specifically, opiates in several CNS regions including NAc, and cocaine more selectively in NAc induce expression of certain adenylyl cyclase isoforms and PKA subunits via the transcription factor, CREB, and these transcriptional adaptations serve a homeostatic function to oppose drug action. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt; Upregulation of the same pathway in the [[locus coeruleus]] is also a mechanism responsible for certain aspects of opioid-induced [[physical dependence]].&lt;ref name="pmid26740398" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;

Increased [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) signaling in the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) has been shown to mediate opiate-induced withdrawal symptoms via downregulation of [[insulin receptor substrate 2]] (IRS2), [[protein kinase B]] (AKT), and [[mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2]] (mTORC2).&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1732–34 |doi=10.1126/science.1168501 |title=Ventral Tegmental Area BDNF Induces an Opiate-Dependent-Like Reward State in Naive Rats |year=2009 |last1=Vargas-Perez |first1=H. |last2=Ting-A-Kee |first2=R. |last3=Walton |first3=C.

Early treatment of acute withdrawal often includes medical [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]], which can include doses of [[anxiolytic]]s or narcotics to reduce symptoms of withdrawal. An experimental drug, [[ibogaine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alper KR, Lotsof HS, Kaplan CD |title=The ibogaine medical subculture |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=9–24 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18029124 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2007.08.034 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also proposed to treat withdrawal and craving.

[[Neurofeedback]] therapy has shown statistically significant improvements in numerous researches [http://www.neurofeedback-scotland.com/alpha.html] conducted on alcoholic as well as mixed substance abuse population. In chronic opiate addiction, a surrogate drug such as [[methadone]] is sometimes offered as a form of [[opiate replacement therapy]]. But treatment approaches universal focus on the individual's ultimate choice to pursue an alternate course of action.

===Tailoring treatment===
Therapists often classify patients with chemical dependencies as either interested or not interested in changing.

Treatments usually involve planning for specific ways to avoid the addictive stimulus, and therapeutic interventions intended to help a client learn healthier ways to find satisfaction. Clinical leaders in recent years have attempted to tailor intervention approaches to specific influences that affect addictive behavior, using therapeutic interviews in an effort to discover factors that led a person to embrace unhealthy, addictive sources of pleasure or relief from pain.

From the [[applied behavior analysis]] literature and the [[behavioral psychology]] literature, several evidenced-based intervention programs have emerged (1) behavioral marital therapy (2) community reinforcement approach (3) cue exposure therapy and (4) contingency management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = O'Donohue| first = W| authorlink = |author2=K.E.

About 10.6% of Americans with substance use disorder seek treatment, and 40-60% of those people relapse within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = McLellan|first = A. T.|last2 = Lewis|first2 = D.

== Legality ==
Most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug-like substances under the control of licensing systems. Typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates, [[substituted amphetamines]], [[cannabinoids]], [[cocaine]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[hallucinogen]]s ([[tryptamines]], [[LSD]], [[phencyclidine]], and [[psilocybin]]) and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs, and unlicensed production, supply or possession may be a criminal offense.

Usually, however, drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness. The substances covered often have very different addictive properties. Some are highly prone to cause physical dependency, whilst others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever.

Also, although the legislation may be justifiable on moral grounds to some, it can make addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual. Reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure as illegally produced substances may have contaminants. Withdrawal from the substances or associated contaminants can cause additional health issues and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment. Criminal elements that can be involved in the profitable trade of such substances can also cause physical harm to users.

== Opposition to common views ==
[[Thomas Szasz]] denies that addiction is a psychiatric problem. In many of his works, he argues that addiction is a choice, and that a drug addict is one who simply prefers a socially taboo substance rather than, say, a low risk lifestyle.  In ''Our Right to Drugs'', Szasz cites the biography of [[Malcolm X]] to corroborate his economic views towards addiction: Malcolm claimed that quitting cigarettes was harder than shaking his [[heroin]] addiction.  Szasz postulates that humans always have a choice, and it is foolish to call someone an "addict" just because they prefer a [[drug]] induced [[happiness|euphoria]] to a more popular and socially welcome lifestyle.

Professor John Booth Davies at the [[University of Strathclyde]] has argued in his book ''The Myth of Addiction'' that "people take drugs because they want to and because it makes sense for them to do so given the choices available" as opposed to the view that "they are compelled to by the pharmacology of the drugs they take."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies| first = John Booth| title = The Myth of Addiction| publisher = Psychology Press Ltd (2nd rev edition)| date = 1998-01-18| location = | pages = | url = http://www.druglibrary.org/special/davies/mythprologue.htm| doi =  | isbn = 978-90-5702-237-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He uses an adaptation of [[attribution theory]] (what he calls the theory of functional attributions) to argue that the statement "I am addicted to drugs" is functional, rather than veridical. [[Stanton Peele]] has put forward similar views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10719">The '''Telecom corruption scandal''' is a 2012 [[Corruption in Uzbekistan|corruption]] case involving the daughter of President [[Islam Karimov]] of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Gulnara Karimova]], accepting bribes from several foreign telecom companies in exchange for contracts to do business within Uzbekistan. Revelations showed that Karimova was paid bribes through a series of shell companies by a series of firms seeking to negotiate with her directly. In addition, it was discovered that more industries had paid bribes for access to Uzbekistan than simply telecom firms.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;&lt;ref name=feed/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Gulnora I. Karimova - World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2009.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Gulnara Karimova]]
A [[Switzerland|Swiss]] criminal investigation begun in 2012 was directed at first against four Uzbek citizens who had connections to Karimova. Two of them were arrested that year and freed on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Swiss open money-laundering probe of Uzbek figure| work =Daily Mail| date =Mar 12, 2014| url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2579090/Swiss-open-money-laundering-probe-Uzbek-figure.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, a Swedish TV documentary stated that a Swedish telecom group, [[TeliaSonera]], in exchange for licenses and frequencies in Uzbekistan, had paid $320 million to a [[Gibraltar]]-based shell company, Takilant, that was reportedly linked to Karimova. TeliaSonera denied the charges.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;{{cite web| last =Keena| first =Colm| title = US wants to seize allegedly corrupt funds in Irish banks| work =Irish Times| date =Jul 1, 2015| url =http://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/us-wants-to-seize-allegedly-corrupt-funds-in-irish-banks-1.2268660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelations==
In January 2013, [[Sweden|Swedish]] investigators released new documents apparently showing that TeliaSonera had tried to negotiate directly with Karimova.&lt;ref name=feed&gt;{{cite web| last =Boehler| first =Patrick| title =Where Corruption in King: 2012 Rankings| work =Newsfeed| date =Dec 5, 2012| url =http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/06/where-corruption-is-king-2012-rankings/slide/uzbekistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, US and Dutch authorities began investigating her.&lt;ref name=dagbl&gt;{{cite web| title =Presidentdatteren mistenkes for å ha fått Vimpelcom-penger - nå kan hun være på frifot| work =Dagbladet| url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2015/11/08/nyheter/vimpelcom/telenor/41828162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the chief executive of TeliaSonera was forced resign after serious failures of [[due diligence]] were uncovered. In May, the Swedish media made documents public that suggested Karimova had aggressively dictated the terms of the TeliaSonera contract and threatened it with obstruction by several Uzbek government ministries if it did not agree to make illegal payments. Related money-laundering investigations in Switzerland and Sweden continued throughout the year, and hundreds of millions of dollars in accounts connected to the case being frozen by authorities.&lt;ref name=freed&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbekistan| work =Freedom House| url =https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/uzbekistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, Swedish criminal proceedings were underway.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

It was reported in March 2014 that Swiss authorities had begun a money-laundering investigation into Karimova and corruption in Uzbekistan, and prosecutors in [[Bern]] said that the evidence had led their investigation into Sweden and [[France]] and that they had “seized assets in excess of 800 million Swiss francs ($912 million).”&lt;ref name=isr/&gt;&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

It was also revealed in 2014 that the US Justice Department and [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] were investigating Vimpelcom Ltd., based in [[Amsterdam]]; the [[Russia]]n firm Mobile TeleSystems PJSC; and Sweden’s TeliaSonera AB. These three firms had funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to firms controlled by Karimova. An August 2015 report stated that US prosecutors were asking authorities in [[Ireland]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], Sweden, and Switzerland to seize assets of about $1 billion in connection with their investigation into corruption by the three above-mentioned global telecoms and other firms liked to Karimova. US authorities believed Karimova was the principal of a “$1 billion fortune scattered across the continent.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Patterson| first =Scott| title =U.S. Seeks to Seize $1 Billion in Telecom Probe| work =Wall Street Journal| date =Aug 13, 2015| url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-seeks-to-seize-1-billion-in-telecom-probe-1439497898}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, it was reported that Karimova was possibly on the run. Reports stated that she had been seen at a restaurant in Tashkent.&lt;ref name=dagbl/&gt;

It was reported in January 2015 that although executives at the Norwegian telecom firm Telenor, which owns one-third of Vimpelcom, claimed that they had uncovered no signs of corruption, a newly released document indicated that Telenor had knowledge about millions in bribes.&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;{{cite web| last =Kates| first =Glenn| title ='Whistle-Blower' Details Alleged Corruption By Western Telecoms In Uzbekistan| work =Radio Free Europe| date =Jan 17, 2015| url =http://www.rferl.org/content/telenor-uzbekistan-corruption-gulnara-vimpelcom-takilant/26799342.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
On March 20, 2015, the [[US Department of Justice]] (DOJ) "asked Sweden to freeze $30 million in funds held by a [[Stockholm]]-based bank", as part of its activities ending the corruption scheme.&lt;ref name=content/&gt; of Karimova and Talikant. At the time, Karimova was reportedly under house arrest in connection with a corruption investigation. Meanwhile, investigations were underway in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, France and the [[Netherlands]] focusing on shell companies allegedly used by the three multinational telecoms “to pay bribes and gain access to the lucrative Uzbek mobile phone market.”&lt;ref name=content/&gt; The DOJ probe uncovered the fact that all three firms had “paid bribes to Uzbek officials to obtain mobile telecommunications business in Uzbekistan and that funds involved in the scheme were laundered through shell companies and financial accounts around the world, including accounts held in Sweden, to conceal the true nature of these illegal payments.”&lt;ref name=content/&gt; European investigators revealed that Takilant was run by Gayane Avakyan, a former Karimova aide.&lt;ref name=content&gt;{{cite web| last =Eckel| first =Mike| title =US Asks Sweden to Freeze $30M Linked to Uzbek Corruption Case| work =Voice of America| date =Apr 1, 2015| url =http://www.voanews.com/content/us-uzbekistan-telecom-corruption/2702600.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Swiss newspaper ''Le Temps'', “500 million francs of the seized funds involved TeliaSonera, a major telephone company and mobile network operator in Sweden and [[Finland]], and the rest involved Karimova’s personal assets.”&lt;ref name=isr/&gt;&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

A July 1, 2015, report stated that US authorities were seeking to seize $300 million in bank accounts in Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium, alleging that the funds were the proceeds of corrupt payments in Uzbekistan by MTS and Vimpelcom, presumably to Karimova, between 2004 and 2011.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Lillis| first =Joanna| title =Uzbekistan: US Seeks Recovery of Millions from Corruption ‘Conspiracy’| work =Eurasia Net| date =Jul 1, 2015| url =http://www.eurasianet.org/node/74101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2015 [[Radio Free Europe]]/[[Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL) report stated that Uzbek authorities had arrested nine suspects in connection with their probe of Karimova's corruption activities. Among those taken into custody were two top executives at a [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant in Uzbekistan, which Karimova formerly owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbekistan: More Karimova Associates Arrested in Corruption Probe| work =OCCRP| date =Aug 24, 2015| url =https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/4324-uzbekistan-more-karimova-associates-arrested-in-corruption-probe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2015, it was reported that TeliaSonera was “deeply shaken”&lt;ref name=eurasia/&gt; by the corruption scandal in Uzbekistan, and that it would be pulling out of all of central Asia as a result of “heavy investor and public pressure.” It was revealed that the US Department of Justice, along with Swedish prosecutors, had initiated investigations into corruption allegations at TeliaSonera.&lt;ref name=eurasia&gt;{{cite web| title =TeliaSonera set for Eurasia exodus in wake of corruption claims| work =Financial Times| url =http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/846663e0-5d19-11e5-97e9-7f0bf5e7177b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Norway's government demanded the resignation of Telenor chairman Svein Aaser on account of the Uzbekistan corruption scandal.&lt;ref name=rferl/&gt;

==Reactions==
Reportedly, Karimova “ran afoul of her father,”&lt;ref name=spieg&gt;{{cite web| last =Follath| first =Erich| title =Tashkent's Shakespearean Drama: Scandal Shakes Uzbekistan's | work =Spiegel| date =3 Apr 2015| url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/scandal-envelops-family-of-uzbekistan-dictator-karimov-a-1026885.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who refused to comment on the accusations against her. Previously, in 2013, Karimova accused Uzbek security services on [[Twitter]] of harassing her and deceiving her father about her.&lt;ref name=isr&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbek first daughter, a prisoner in her home, probed for corruption| work =Times of Israel| date =Mar 27, 2014| url =http://www.timesofisrael.com/uzbek-first-daughter-a-prisoner-in-her-home-probed-for-corruption/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her sister, Lola, rejected her, however. In return, Karimova accused Lola, Uzbekistan's [[UNESCO]] ambassador, who lives in a $40 million mansion in [[Geneva]], of hiding secret stashes of dollars somewhere in the presidential president.&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; In early 2014, Gulnara claimed her sister had sent goons to physically harm her because she wished to go to [[Israel]] for medical care. Gulnara smuggled out a letter informing the media of her arrest, claiming the "reason for the [[Pinochet]]-style persecution is that I dared to speak up about things that millions are quiet about."&lt;ref name=isr/&gt; Karimova was put under house arrest in February 2014. She stated that she and her 16-year-old daughter were prohibited from visiting the president. She claimed to have been the target of police violence and asserted that she had been refused medical and psychological treatment.&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt;

'''Toba Qom''' is a [[Guaicuruan language]] spoken in [[South America]] by the [[Toba (tribe)|Toba people]]. The language is known by a variety of names including '''Toba''', '''Qom''' or '''Kom''', '''Chaco Sur''', and '''Toba Sur'''. In [[Argentina]] it is most widely dispersed in the eastern regions of the provinces of [[Formosa Province|Formosa]] and [[Chaco Province|Chaco]] where the majority of the approximately 19,810 (2000 WCD) speakers reside. The language is distinct from [[Toba-Pilagá]] and [[Paraguay]]an [[Toba-Maskoy]]. There are also 146 Toba speakers in [[Bolivia]] where it is known as Qom and in [[Paraguay]] where it is also known as Qob or Toba-Qom.

In 2010, the province of Chaco in Argentina declared Qom as one of four provincial official languages alongside Spanish and the indigenous [[Moqoit language|Moqoit]] and [[Wichí language|Wichí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Argentine law|jur=CC|l=6604|bo=9092|date=28 de julio de 2010}}, [http://www2.legislaturachaco.gov.ar:8000/legisdev/ResumenDocumento.aspx?docId=L.6604&amp;tipo=Ley Link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060002/http://www2.legislaturachaco.gov.ar:8000/legisdev/ResumenDocumento.aspx?docId=L.6604&amp;tipo=Ley |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Undercurrents''' is an alternative video news network which began with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] distribution of [[videotapes]] shot by volunteers. It has since expanded to include a web presence, [[media training]] for volunteers, and a [[film festival]], [[BeyondTV]].

==History==
Undercurrents is an alternative news agency which came into being in 1994 with a VHS videocassette of news which the founders (Jamie Hartzell, Paul O'Connor, Zoe Broughton,and [[Thomas Harding (publisher)|Thomas Harding]]) felt were not being addressed by the mainstream media. One of the issues covered was the introduction of the [[Criminal Justice Bill]], whose varied measures included attempts to curtail large gatherings both of travelers and [[rave]]s and make direct action protest a criminal offence. A second video compilation was released before the end of the year. Bands such as [[The Levellers (band)|the Levellers]] included Undercurrents references on their CD sleeves. Radiohead have donated funds and Comedian Mark Thomas allowed undercurrents to produce and distribute his first DVD to raise funds.Undercurrents was amongst the first groups which coined the phrase 'video activism'- the use of camcorders for social change. A co-founder, Thomas Harding, wrote the video activist handbook published by Pluto Press. Undercurrents now distribute films via DVD and in 2009 they launched visionOntv - a Peer to Peer TV channel over internet.

Many of the video activists who worked at Undercurrents went on to work at [[Oxford Channel]] including Roddy Mansfield, Jason Torrance, Thomas Harding and Debora Harding. But they found that local TV was not the way forward&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jul/24/newmedia.mondaymediasection1&lt;/ref&gt; and Undercurrents continued to distribute via DVD and community screenings. In 2009 they launched [http://www.theSolCinema.org The Sol Cinema] a micro touring cinema powered by lithium batteries and designed by Jo Furlong. Undercurrents has won a number of awards including [http://www.undercurrents.org Digital Hero awards 2011], as well as film festivals in Germany, Tokyo, France, USA, UK and Czech republic.

==Status==
Undercurrents subsequently became a non-profit company and a [[registered charity]]. They have moved their office from [[London]], to [[Oxford]] and are now based in [[Environment Centre (Swansea)|The Environment Centre]] in [[Swansea]].

==Court Cases==
Some of their footage of [[political protests]] has been used in court cases, including footage of [[Genoa G8 summit]], and a police raid on indymedia work spaces.

==Current projects==
In 2006 Undercurrents was chosen as the Guardians campaign of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/apr/11/ethicalliving.lifeandhealth|title=Campaign of the week: Undercurrents - film-makers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that undercurrents 'most successful piece is probably Evolving Minds, a film by Melissa Gunasena about dealing with mental health problems'. In 2007 Undercurrents released EcoVillage Pioneers- a documentary exploring sustainable low impact communities around the world.

Many of their latest videos are hosted on YouTube. Undercurrents have also embarked upon a new project for distributing activist video.

Undercurrents are currently producing video podcasts about environmental issues such as Climate change. Online Video series include Surfing and climate change, Bushcraft and sustainable housing. In 2010 Undercurrents produced a step by step guide to building a house using [http://www.undercurrents.org/benlaw.html Roundwood Timber Framing] with Ben Law. In 2014 Undercurrents will be producing a project on low cost housing.
