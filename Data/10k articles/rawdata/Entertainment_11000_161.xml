[[File:Otto Eberstadt.jpg|Otto Eberstadt|thumb]]
[[File:Globe and Traveller 1843.jpg|''The Globe and Traveller'', Wednesday evening 21 June 1843|thumb]]

'''Allissa Vasilevich''' and '''Otto Eberstadt''' were performers in the Cooke Circus Troupe from 1839 to 1843, Otto Eberstadt a [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] and Allissa a [[contortionist]]. In 1840 the pair were wed and developed their performances together. 

Otto and Allissa were amidst a time when the circuses were pushing the boundaries of performance. The London [[Vauxhall Gardens]] boasted balloon ascents from 1830 to 1840.  These kinds of feats were pressuring those within the circuses and traveling show environments to explore new and exciting ways to bring the audiences back to the round. Side shows provided the audiences with curious fascination or “human oddities” dwarves, giants, bearded ladies, Siamese twins and other unusual acts of which included contortionists and [[strongman (circus)|strongmen]].

One of Allissa's and Otto's acts was titled "The Russian Doll", a performance in which Otto presented a life scaled, three tiered [[Russian doll]] on stage and juggled the set to have finally revealed his wife contorted within the smallest of the dolls.
 
After the success of this performance the pair were keen to develop their skills further. Amongst the Mander and Mitchenson archives; according to the Globe and Traveller evening newspaper an article was found, stating that in 1843 Otto and Allissa had devised a performance titled "The Tin Canister Extravaganza" in which Allissa would contort into a tin can whilst Otto would continue the performance by sealing the can with a lead solder provided by a Mr. Bryan Donking of the Donking Hall and Gamble Cannery in [[Bermondsey]], South-East London. A terrible accident regarding a sharp implement used to break the lead seal left Allissa stuck within the canister.

The '''American International Toy Fair''' (stylized as '''TOY FAIR''') is an annual toy industry [[trade show]] held in mid-February in New York City's [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] and at toy showrooms around the city. The event is open to the toy trade only – toy industry professionals, retailers, and press representatives. It is owned and managed by the [[Toy Industry Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toy-tia.org/template.cfm Toy Industry Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209031416/http://www.toy-tia.org/Template.cfm |date=February 9, 2006 }} main site&lt;/ref&gt; Toy Fair's promoters describe it as the largest toy trade show in the Western hemisphere.

==History==
Toy Fair began in February 1903. The first event featured less than ten toy companies with [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel]] [[toy train|trains]] among the featured products.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Angela [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/10/business/fi-toyfair10 It's Not All Child's Play at Toy Fair] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (February 10, 2003). Retrieved September 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As the event expanded, more space was needed which led to toy companies occupying 200 Fifth Avenue, a [[Fifth Avenue Hotel|former hotel site]], in 1910. By 1925, it was renamed the [[Toy Center|International Toy Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Peter [http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/23/toy-fair-2004-day-one-batman-harry-potter-justice-league TOY FAIR 2004 DAY ONE: BATMAN, HARRY POTTER &amp; JUSTICE LEAGUE] [[IGN]] (February 14, 2004). Retrieved September 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 110th annual Toy Fair, held February 10–13, 2013, attracted more than 1,500 manufacturers, distributors, importers, and sales agents from 30 countries in over {{convert|300000|sqft|m2}} of exhibit space. Nearly 9,500 buyers from 5,000 retail outlets attended. Overall, there were an estimated 30,000 attendees from 92 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyassociation.org/PressRoom2/News/2013_News/American_International_Toy_Fair___February_10-13__2013___Welcomes_Surge_in_Global_Visitors.aspx#.UeLz1lNOnbQ American International Toy Fair – February 10–13, 2013 – Welcomes Surge in Global Visitors]. Toyassociation.org (February 19, 2013). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
[[Image:TIA 2006ToyFair Toy center dscn6859.jpg|right|thumb|240px|200 Fifth Avenue]]
The Javits exhibits feature demonstrations and displays in an open trade show setting, while the toy district showrooms allow buyers to consult with sales representatives from the major toy manufacturers in a quieter setting. These showrooms can be found at

* 200 Fifth Avenue between 23rd &amp; 24th Streets
* 1107 Broadway at 24th Street
* 230 Fifth Avenue between 26th &amp; 27th Streets
* 1115 Broadway at 25th Street

Each building (they are interconnected by upper story walkways) contains relatively small showrooms from many manufacturers. Products featured include current lines as well as samples of products not yet introduced, or products under development. Many manufacturers will stage receptions or events prior to the fair itself for invited buyers, media representatives, or dignitaries.

==Attendance==

Universal Uclick was formed in July 2009 following the merger of [[Universal Press Syndicate]] with the digital entertainment company [[Uclick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2009/07/08/universal-press-syndicate-and-uclick-merge/ "Universal Press Syndicate and Uclick Merge". Gardner, Alan. The Daily Cartoonist, July 8, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 24, 2011, Universal Uclick signed a deal with [[United Media]] to handle syndication of the latter company's 150 comic strip and news features (under the banners [[United Feature Syndicate]] and the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]]) beginning in June 1 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-uclick-to-provide-syndicate-services-for-united-media-116811443.html Universal Uclick to Provide Syndicate Services for United Media], PR Newswire, February 24, 2011. &lt;!--accessed February 24, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Magazine/united-media-outsources-content-to-universal-uclick-64912-.aspx United Media Outsources Content to Universal Uclick] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Editor &amp; Publisher, April 29, 2011. &lt;!--accessed April 29, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this, Universal Uclick became one of the largest print syndicators in the United States, as United Media — along with [[King Features Syndicate]] and [[Creators Syndicate]] — was one of the company's main competitors in the industry.

'''''Assassin's Creed II''''' is a 2009 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]].&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; It is the second major installment in the [[Assassin's Creed|''Assassin's Creed'' series]], a sequel to 2007's ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'', and the first chapter in the ''Ezio trilogy''. The game was first released on the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in November 2009, and was later made available on [[Microsoft Windows]] in March 2010 and [[OS X]] in October 2010. Several minor game related features could be redeemed on [[Uplay]] and three [[downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion packs]] were released on [[Xbox Live]].

The plot is set in a [[historical fiction|fictional history]] setting and follows the centuries-old struggle between the [[Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templars]], who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and follows [[Desmond Miles]] as he relives the [[Genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memories]] of his ancestor [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]]. The main narrative takes place at the height of the [[Renaissance]] in [[Italy]] during the 15th and early 16th century. Players can explore [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Forlì]] as they guide Ezio on a quest for vengeance against those responsible for betraying his family. The primary focus is to utilize the player's combat and stealth abilities, as Desmond begins to uncover the mysteries left behind by an ancient race known as the First Civilization in the hope of ending the conflict between the [[Assassins]] and Templars.

Using a newly updated [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil]] game engine, ''Assassin's Creed II'' began development shortly after the release of ''Assassin's Creed''. The game received critical acclaim from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], with praise directed towards its Renaissance setting, narrative, characters, map design and visuals, as well as improvements from its predecessor. It was the biggest selling game of 2009–2010 and has sold more than 9 million copies. It is considered to be [[List of video games considered the best|one of the best games ever made]], and it popularized the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise. The [[Personal computer|PC]] version was met with some criticism in relation to the [[digital rights management]] system and, thus had the [[always-online DRM]] permanently removed. The game spawned a follow-up, ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'' and its direct sequel, ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''. Remastered versions of all three games were released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on November 15, 2016 as part of ''The Ezio Collection''.

==Gameplay==
Players directly control the on-screen character through a third-person perspective and can control the camera, allowing for a 360° view of their surroundings. The game takes place in an [[open world]] environment with [[nonlinear gameplay]], allowing the player to roam freely within several regions of late fifteenth-century Italy such as [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Monteriggioni]], [[Forlì]], [[San Gimignano]], [[Rome]] ([[Vatican City|The Vatican]] only) and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] countryside. The Animus 2.0, a new version of the machine of the same name present in ''Assassin's Creed'', provides in-game context for changes and additions to several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters and services that the player encounters. The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the character to recover only from minor injuries.&lt;ref name="gi-ac2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Assassin's Creed II It cost $20 |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Magazine/Insider/Articles/Article/200905/A09.0414.1437.20481.htm |format=Fee required |pages=36–45 |work=[[Game Informer]] |date=2009-04-16}}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; More grievous injuries require visiting a street-side [[physician|doctor]] or use of medicine (which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies).

The player may now swim in water, and Eagle Vision—the ability to identify specific people and landmarks—can now be used in third-person view and while moving.&lt;ref name="gi-ac2"/&gt; A young [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is present in the game, aiding the player by creating new weapons from translated "Codex pages" that Altaïr, the original game's main character, left behind for future Assassins' analysis and insight.&lt;ref name="gi-ac2" /&gt; Within the game, the player will be able to use Leonardo's [[Ornithopter|flying machine]] (based on real-life plans by Leonardo) during one mission. The player also has the ability to control a carriage in one level, and can row [[gondolas]], as well as ride horses at any point in the game where they are readily available between towns and cities.&lt;ref name="gi-ac2" /&gt; The setting of the various places the player may go to have been made more detailed and in-depth; civilians sometimes cough or sneeze. Additionally, the player can hire different groups of [[non-player characters|NPCs]], such as [[mercenaries]], [[courtesans]], or [[thieves]]; these groups can be used to fight, distract, or lure guards, respectively. A day and night cycle has been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time, in addition to setting missions and events at certain times of the day.&lt;ref name="gi-ac2" /&gt;

There are many ways to interact with NPCs. Money thrown to the ground, or a corpse carried and then deposited on the ground, may also serve as a distraction for both guards and peasants. There are also several different types of enemies, some more agile or stronger than others, and some of which will actively search hiding places where Ezio was last seen.

[[File:Assassin's Creed II gondola screen.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Ezio stealing a [[gondola]] from a small pier]]

The combat system is more complex than that of its predecessor, with the ability to [[disarm]] opponents using counter-attacks while unarmed. If the player steals an enemy's weapon, it is possible to follow up with an attack that instantly kills the enemy.&lt;ref name="gi-ac2" /&gt; Da Vinci provides the player with specialized weaponry, such as the dual hidden blades, poison blade and the miniature [[wheellock]] firearm, which are all based on schematics found in Altaïr's Codex pages. Generic swords, [[cutlasses]], [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, axes and daggers can all be purchased from vendors in each city. The player can also pick up any weapon on the ground or use improvised weapons, such as brooms or halves of a spear. These weapons are used just like normal blunt weapons. In addition, players are able to purchase artwork for their villa, obtain new [[armor]] as the game progresses, and even [[dye]] Ezio's clothing with a number of different colors. Other equipment includes larger [[Bag|pouches]] to carry more [[throwing knives]] and medicine. Six additional weapons can be unlocked by connecting a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] with ''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]'' to the PS3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ferry |url=http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2009/06/03/assassins-creed-2-cheats-guide.htm |title=Assassins Creed 2 cheats guide (PSP to PS3 linkup) |publisher=VideoGamesBlogger |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2009-11-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091119060711/http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2009/06/03/assassins-creed-2-cheats-guide.htm| archivedate= 19 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auditore family's countryside villa, located in [[Monteriggioni]], acts as Ezio's headquarters: the surrounding property can be upgraded, drawing income for the player's use. There are several outlets for using currency, with vendors selling items such as medicine, poison, weapons, repairs, upgrades, paintings, and clothing dyes. When these shops are renovated, Ezio receives discounts at the shops on the goods they sell. Purchasing weaponry, armour sets and artwork also contributes to increasing the villa's overall worth, in turn generating more income for Monteriggioni.

There is now a broader array of methods for hiding or blending in the area. One can dive underwater to break guards' line of sight, and blending may be performed with any group of people, rather than only a specific type (as in the first ''Assassin's Creed'').&lt;ref name="gi-ac2" /&gt; The game features a notoriety system, with guards more alert to Ezio's presence depending on his behavior, location, and current mission. This infamy can be reduced through [[bribery]], removing [[wanted poster]]s, or assassinating corrupt officials.&lt;ref name="gi-ac2" /&gt;

The missions in the game now have an expanded variety, with different structuring. For example, a mission may have the objective to escort someone, but may change to a chase and assassination. Investigation is less explicit, and instead missions may follow people and/or a narrative. There are roughly 200 missions in the game; about half are part of the main storyline, while the rest are side quests which need not be completed in order to finish the game's main storyline. Cities also contain hidden locations such as [[catacombs]] and caves (the design of which have been compared by the developers to the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series, where the objective is to navigate the area). Exploring these locations eventually rewards the player with an Assassin's Seal; the collection of all six Seals allows the player to unlock the Armor of Altaïr, in a concealed section of the Villa.

Like ''Assassin's Creed'', characters based on historical figures are present in the game, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Caterina Sforza]], [[Bartolomeo d'Alviano]], the [[Medici family]], the [[Pazzi family]], the [[Barbarigo family]] and [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref name="hardnews-090409"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screwattack.com/videos/Hard-News-040909 |title=Hard News 04/09/09 |work=[[ScrewAttack]] |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2009-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226013840/http://screwattack.com/videos/Hard-News-040909 |archivedate=2009-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Plot===
[[File:FireLanceAndGrenade10thCenturyDunhuang.jpg|thumb|left|In the "Truth puzzles", certain historic paintings are used, such as the [[History of the firearm|first depiction of a firearm]].]]
After the events of ''Assassin's Creed'', test subject [[Desmond Miles]] is rescued from confinement by undercover Assassin [[Lucy Stillman]] and taken to a remote safe house, where he meets her team, consisting of historian and analyst Shaun Hastings and technician Rebecca Crane. Using design plans stolen by Lucy, they have constructed their own version of the Animus, dubbed "Baby", which they intend to use to train Desmond as an Assassin through the so-called "Bleeding Effect", which allows the user to learn all their ancestor's skills instantly. Desmond is assigned to investigate the memories of his ancestor [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], starting with his birth to a wealthy Florentine family in the late 15th century.

{{Imageframe|width=200|content=[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|100px]][[File:Pope Alexander Vi.jpg|100px]]|caption=''Assassin's Creed II''{{'}}s plot includes the fictional depictions of historical characters including [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and Rodrigo Borgia, later known as [[Pope Alexander VI]].|align=right}}
The story then skips forward several years, with Ezio growing into a charismatic but reckless young man in the time of the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. After his father and brothers are hanged after being framed for treason by a corrupt magistrate, Ezio kills him and flees to his ancestral home of [[Monteriggioni]] with his mother and sister. There, his uncle Mario explains that both he and his late father served an ancient order known as the Assassins, and agrees to train Ezio in stealth and combat. With his new abilities, Ezio embarks on a quest to kill the men responsible for arranging his father's death, including politicians, bankers, mercenaries, and merchants aligned to the [[Pazzi]] and [[Barbarigo family|Barbarigo]] families. The search takes him to cities such as [[Florence]], [[San Gimignano]], [[Forlì]], and [[Venice]]. During his journey, Ezio also makes a number of new allies, including philosopher [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the latter of whom provides him with new equipment based on information left by Altair's [[Codex]]. While in Venice, he learns the identity of the Templar grandmaster known as "the Spaniard": [[Pope Alexander VI|Rodrigo Borgia]], who has been planning to secure all of Italy for the Order by unifying the most influential families behind his leadership. Dressed as a soldier, he confronts Rodrigo while helping him transport an Apple of Eden to [[Rome]]. Armed with the papal staff—which turns out to be a Piece of Eden—Rodrigo reveals his intention to unlock the "Vault", a chamber he believes to contain a power greater than any the world has ever known. He manages to escape, leaving the Apple in Ezio's possession. As a reward for service, Mario has him formally inducted into the Assassins.

Around this time, Desmond uncovers a random memory left over from his time at Abstergo, in which Altair is shown impregnating Maria Thorpe, a Templar he encountered in the previous game. He also finds a series of [[glyphs]] similar to the drawings he found in his cell, which, when deciphered, reveal a vision of two human slaves stealing an Apple. The video ends with the ASCII codes (in binary) for "EDEN" (01000101 01000100 01000101 01001110). The team theorizes that the two humans may be Adam and Eve, the first man and woman.

With several sections of memory too corrupted to access (later made available as [[Downloadable content|DLC]] Sequences), the team sends Desmond to the final memory, set in 1499. With Rodrigo now secure in his position as [[Pope Alexander VI]], Ezio infiltrates [[Vatican City]] during Mass and beats him in a fistfight. Rather than kill his nemesis, he lets him live with the knowledge that he has failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Assassin's Creed II|developer=[[Ubisoft Montreal]]|quote=''[As Rodrigo and Ezio fight for the last time in the Vault...]'' Ezio Auditore: What do you even want with the Vault, Rodrigo!? / Rodrigo Borgia: Don't you know what lies within!?

Inside, he is contacted by a strange woman named [[Minerva]]. Aware that Desmond is listening, she explains how her people, the "First Civilization", created humanity to serve them, but were subsequently destroyed by an unknown catastrophe. The survivors joined forces with their former servants, building a network of vaults to both preserve their technology and culture and serve as a preventative measure against a future disaster. Before vanishing, she tells Desmond that only he has the power to fulfill this "prophecy", leaving both him and Ezio confused as to what she means.

Shortly thereafter, Abstergo agents led by Vidic enter the hideout, forcing the team to abandon everything except the Animus. As they head to a new location, Lucy informs Desmond that the Assassins have detected strange occurrences in the [[Earth's magnetic field]]; a [[solar flare]] scheduled to pass the planet in a few months would likely trigger the same event that ended the First Civilization. Desmond prepares to reenter the Animus, beginning the story of ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''.

==Development==
Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot officially confirmed that ''Assassin's Creed II'' was in development on November 26, 2008, during the company's financial performance report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5099485/ubisoft-makin-money-teasin-assassins-creed-2 |title=Ubisoft Makin' Money, Teasin' ''Assassin's Creed 2'' |date=November 26, 2008 |author=McWherton, Michael |work=Kotaku.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by [[Michael Pachter]] speculating in [[GameTrailers]]' "Bonus Round" that game would change its setting to the events of the [[French Revolution]], which turned out to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5099454/rumor-assassins-creed-2-goes-back-to-the-future |title=Rumor: ''Assassin's Creed 2'' Goes Back To The Future |work=Kotaku.com |date=November 26, 2008 |author=McWhertor, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced at the ''Assassin's Creed'' panel at Comic Con 2009 that a mini-series of three episodes, ''[[Assassin's Creed: Lineage]]'', would be released showing the events leading up to the game and the history of Ezio and his father Giovanni.

It was also revealed that the humorist [[Danny Wallace (humourist)|Danny Wallace]] would be voicing a new character in ''Assassin's Creed II'': Shaun Hastings, a sarcastic historian assisting Desmond. The character's face would also be modeled after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVcR_5Y294M|title=Assassin's Creed 2 Danny Wallace interview #1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Kristen Bell]] returned for the character of [[Lucy Stillman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201133/fullcredits#cast|title=Assassin's Creed 2 Full Cast and Crew |work=imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was originally due to be released at the same time on all three platforms, but Ubisoft announced on September 24, 2009 that the PC version would be delayed to the first quarter of 2010 in order to have "a bit more time for the dev team to deliver the best quality game."&lt;ref name="delayPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/4339003186 |title=Assassin's Creed 2 PC has moved to the first quarter of 2010.

On December 1, 2009, Ubisoft announced the first of several [[downloadable content]] (DLC) expansions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of ''Assassin's Creed II''. The first, titled ''The Battle of Forlì'', continues the story of [[Caterina Sforza]], and was released on January 28, 2010. It also includes a special memory that allows users to pilot [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Ornithopter|flying machine]] over [[Forlì]]. The second expansion, titled ''Bonfire of the Vanities'', concerns the [[Bonfire of the Vanities|mass burning of sinful objects]] in Florence and was released on February 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/16/assassins-creed-2-bonfire-of-the-vanities-dlc-comes-feb-18/|title=Assassin's Creed 2 'Bonfire of the Vanities' DLC comes Feb. 18|author=David Hinkle|publisher=Joystiq|date=2010-02-16|accessdate=2010-02-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100217224346/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/16/assassins-creed-2-bonfire-of-the-vanities-dlc-comes-feb-18/| archivedate= 17 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were both initially planned to be included as part of the main game, but were later cut due to time constraints;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=30 December 2009 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/12/22/assassins-creed-ii-dlc-was-cut-from-main-game-due-to-time-const/ |title=Assassin's Creed II DLC was cut from main game due to time constraints |author=McElroy, Justin |date=December 22, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225202025/http://www.joystiq.com/2009/12/22/assassins-creed-ii-dlc-was-cut-from-main-game-due-to-time-const/ |archivedate=25 December 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; this issue was written into the game's story as the Animus corrupting several memory sequences. Both the retail and digital releases of the Deluxe PC version include these DLC packages as part of the main storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terminalgamer.com/2010/01/25/assassins-creed-2-coming-to-pc/ |title=Assassin's Creed 2 Coming To PC |publisher=Terminalgamer.com |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uplay content===
Ubisoft's [[Uplay]] system enables further in-game enhancements which can be redeemed by points that are given when playing the game. The available awards are an ''Assassin's Creed II'' theme or wallpaper for PC and PlayStation 3, 5 additional throwing knives, Altaïr outfit and the Uplay exclusive Auditore Family Crypt map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/assassin-s-creed-2-comes-with-a-crazy-thing-named-uplay--155431.phtml|title=Assassin's Creed 2 comes with a crazy thing named 'Uplay'|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|author=Unknown|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Battle of Forlì''===
The two [[downloadable content]] packs feature the corrupted memory sequences, which Rebecca is able to repair with a computer patch. Sequence 12, "[[Forlì]] Under Attack" (released as ''The Battle of Forlì'') is set in 1488, just after Ezio has recovered the Apple of Eden. Machiavelli, Mario Auditore, Ezio and da Vinci meet to discuss what to do to protect the Apple, and it is decided that it will be sent to Romagna, to be defended by Caterina Sforza. When Ezio arrives however, he finds that the city is under attack from the Orsi Brothers, who have been hired by Borgia to take a map featuring the locations of the Codex pages, made by Sforza's late husband. In an attempt to force Sforza to hand over the map, the brothers kidnap her children. Ezio leaves the Apple in Sforza's protection; he rescues her children and kills one Orsi brother. When he returns, he discovers that Checco, the other brother, used the distraction to steal the Apple. Ezio gives chase, and kills Checco. As he stands over Checco's body, Checco stabs Ezio. Ezio falls to the floor bleeding, and before he passes out, he sees a man missing a finger and wearing monastic robes take the Apple.

Ezio wakes up with Sforza at his side. He sets out to reclaim the Apple, and Sforza gives him the map of the Codex page locations. He travels to a monastery in the wetlands, where he is sent to Forlì's monastery. He attempts to speak to the abbot, but the abbot recognizes him as the Assassin who killed Stefano de Bagnone (one of the Pazzi conspirators) and flees. When Ezio catches him, the abbot names the monk who stole the Apple as [[Girolamo Savonarola]].

The Pack also includes a bonus memory in which Ezio can pilot Leonardo's Flying Machine over the Forlì area. Unlike regular memories, the player is able to play this memory an unlimited number of times.

===''Bonfire of the Vanities''===
Sequence 13 begins in 1497, two years prior to Sequence 14 and nine years after Sequence 12, after the events of [[Assassin's Creed II: Discovery]]. Ezio has tracked Savonarola to Florence, where the player can now explore the southern district of the city. After meeting with Machiavelli, Ezio devises that bringing unrest to the city will force Savonarola to come out and settle the unrest. In order to bring about this unrest, Ezio assassinates nine of Savonarola's lieutenants who preach within the city. The people become angry and a mob forms outside the plaza, where Savonarola preaches to the mob to disperse. He exposes the Apple to bewitch the mob, but Ezio quickly throws a knife at the Piece of Eden and Savonarola drops it. The mob proceeds to take the monk away, but a Templar [[courier]] quickly rushes in to retrieve the Apple; Ezio rushes after the guard and reclaims it. Afterward, the mob takes Savonarola to the [[Piazza della Signoria]] to burn him at the stake, but Ezio, believing no one deserves such a painful fate, jumps onto a wooden platform, leaps at Savanarola, and stabs the monk with his hidden blade to spare him the pain. Ezio stands before the confused crowd and declares that all should follow their own path, as he was taught by his mentors.

===''Templar Lair''===
These three dungeons, platforming puzzles, similar to the game's Assassin's Tombs but without special rewards other than treasure, were originally included in the ''Assassin's Creed II: Black Edition'' (European and Australian release), with one included in the  ''White Edition'' and two in the North American ''Master Assassin's Edition''. Ubisoft subsequently offered them as DLC via PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.  They have since been included in ''Assassin's Creed II: Deluxe Edition'' and ''Game of the Year Edition''.

===Bonus skin===
This costume (dye) is unlocked by entering a code obtained after buying the ''Assassin's Creed II'' 3D mobile game from the Verizon App Store. Also this bonus skin is included in the ''Game of the Year Edition'', "The Complete Edition" and ''Digital Deluxe Edition''.

==Music==
The score to ''Assassin's Creed II'' was composed by [[Jesper Kyd]]. It was recorded at [[Capitol Records]] with a 35-piece string ensemble and 13-person choir, with featured vocals by [[Universal Hall Pass|Melissa Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/Interviews/interview_jesper_kyd_2010.htm|title=Composer Jesper Kyd – Interview at Tracksounds|website=www.tracksounds.com|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A soundtrack was released via download on November 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jesper Kyd|title=Assassin's Creed 2|url=https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Original-Game-Soundtrack/dp/B002TURE9E|accessdate=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 tracks of the soundtrack were also released on the game disc available with the special pre-order Black edition of ''Assassin's Creed II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/11/assassins-creed-ii-black-edition-revealed|title=Assassin's Creed II: Black Edition Revealed|last=Reilly|first=Jim|date=2009-06-11|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the marketing, "Genesis" by [[Justice (French band)|Justice]] was used in the "Visions of Venice" trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sep 3, 2009 |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/visions-of-assassins-creed/55400 |title=Assassin's Creed II Video Game, Visions Of Venice Trailer &amp;#124; Video Clip &amp;#124; Game Trailers &amp; Videos |publisher=GameTrailers.com |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
===Promotion===
On October 20, 2009, Ubisoft announced a series of short films, to be broadcast via [[YouTube]], that would provide additional back story and the introduction of some of the characters found in the game. The shorts, collectively called ''[[Assassin's Creed: Lineage]]'', came in three parts and were developed by Ubisoft's Hybride Technologies, who previously worked on the films ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.  The series focused on Ezio's father, Giovanni Auditore, and contained live-action and computer-generated imagery. The first of the films was released on October 27, 2009, with the remaining two released on November 13, 2009.

On November 12, 2009, Ubisoft released ''Assassin's Creed II'' themed virtual items on [[PlayStation Home]] to promote the release of the game, as well as the game ''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]'' for PSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/11/11/this-week-in-playstation-home-assassins-creed-final-fantasy-xiii-fullmetal-alchemist-and-aes-lawman/|title=This Week in PlayStation Home: Assassin's Creed, Final Fantasy XIII, Fullmetal Alchemist and A&amp;E's Lawman|date=2009-11-11|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|accessdate=2009-11-11|author=Locust_Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Assassin's Creed II'' virtual items and an Ezio costume were also released on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] for the Xbox 360's [[Avatar (Xbox 360)|avatars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/11/12/dj-hero-and-assassins-creed-2-avatar-items-added-to-marketpl/|title=DJ Hero and Assassin's Creed 2 Avatar items added to Marketplace|date=November 12, 2009|last=McElroy|first=Griffin|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19, 2009, more ''Assassin's Creed II'' virtual items were released in PlayStation Home, along with a costume for Ezio, which was released on November 26, 2009, in which the player could obtain and roam PlayStation Home in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/11/18/special-thanksgiving-event-in-playstation-home-uncharted-2-among-thieves-fortune-hunter-edition-contest/|title=Special Thanksgiving Event in PlayStation Home + UNCHARTED 2: Among Thieves Fortune Hunter Edition Contest|date=2009-11-18|publisher=SCE|accessdate=2009-11-18|author=Locust_Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 2009, more 15th century Italian renaissance themed items were released in Home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/12/02/this-week-in-playstation-home-iron-fist-assassin%e2%80%99s-creed-ii-special-holiday-items/|title=This Week in PlayStation Home: Iron Fist, Assassin's Creed II + Special Holiday Items|date=2009-12-02|publisher=SCE|accessdate=2009-12-02|author=Locust_Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Assassin's Creed II'' is the first game to be linked to Ubisoft's [[Uplay]] feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/uplay-launches-assassin%C3%ADs-creed-ii |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905002559/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/uplay-launches-assassin%C3%ADs-creed-ii |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=Uplay launches with Assassin's Creed II |date=2009-11-18 |publisher=Edge |accessdate=2009-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Progression through the game allows Uplay members to acquire points that can be redeemed for bonuses for use in the game, including a new crypt to explore and an Altaïr costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/acii-launches-uplay-rewards-system|title=ACII launches Uplay rewards system |date=2009-11-18|publisher=Eurogamer|accessdate=2009-11-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091121063759/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/acii-launches-uplay-rewards-system| archivedate= 21 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel based on the game, ''Assassin's Creed: Renaissance'' (by [[Oliver Bowden]]), was published by [[Penguin Books]] in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141046303,00.html?strSrchSql=creed/Assassin's_Creed_Oliver_Bowden |title=Assassin's Creed Renaissance by Oliver Bowdin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editions===
There are several different limited editions of ''Assassin's Creed II''. The ''Black Edition'' contains an Ezio figurine garbed in a black outfit and was released in Europe and Australia. Included also are three bonus areas and missions, an art book, a DVD with part of the game's soundtrack, one premium PS3/Xbox 360 theme, behind the scenes videos, and 2 desktop wallpapers. The ''White Edition'' contains one bonus area/mission and an Ezio figurine in his white outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/07/your-assassins-creed-2-limited-edition-choice-is-black-and-white/ |title=Your Assassin's Creed 2 Limited Edition Choice Is Black And White |publisher=Kotaku Australia |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Master Assassin's Edition'' is the North American limited edition, which contains an Ezio figurine, two bonus areas, an art book and a Blu-ray with music and behind the scenes videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Polybren |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6214772.html |title=Assassin's Creed II limited edition detailed&amp;nbsp;— GameSpot News Blog&amp;nbsp;— Gaming News and Videos |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2009-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108140451/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6214772.html |archivedate=2009-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After much complaining from ''Assassin's Creed II'' fans that they were unable to complete the game due to the need to complete the three Templar Lairs (only available on the ''White'' or ''Black Editions'') to earn 100% synchronisation, Ubisoft released ''Assassin's Creed II: The Complete Edition''. Included in the package are download codes for the two [[downloadable content|DLCs]], ''Battle of Forlì'' and ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' and the three Templar Lairs. Later ''Assassin's Creed II: The Game of the Year Edition'' was released, containing the extra content incorporated on the game disc. Both versions also have the Bonus Skin, however, it needs to be unlocked through the game code.

Eventually ''Assassin's Creed II: Digital Deluxe Edition'' was also released, containing the three bonus areas &amp; missions and the downloadable content ''Battle of Forlì'' and ''Bonfire of the Vanities''. This Edition, however, is only available via Digital Download. Assassin's Creed II: Digital Deluxe Edition as of now is available only on the PlayStation 3 through PSN and PC through Steam. It also has the Bonus Dye for Ezio's outfit, albeit it is unlocked from the very beginning of the game and available for free at Monteriggioni.

The PC version of the Retail Edition or the Digital Deluxe Edition now requires a one-time online activation, after which the game, its activation key, and the Uplay Account will be bound together and the game can be played offline, even with the Uplay Launcher forced to run in Offline Mode in the Settings Menu. Even in Offline mode, users can log in into Uplay, provided they have already logged in online with a legitimate e-mail account when they started using the software for the first time.

Users already owning the Retail Edition through Steam can upgrade to the Deluxe Edition.

Upon release, ''Assassin's Creed II'' received critical acclaim. Review aggregator site [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of 91 and the Xbox 360 version a 90, making it the highest-rated game in the franchise on the site.

In an exclusive review by ''Official Xbox Magazine'', ''Assassin's Creed II'' scored 9/10.&lt;ref name="metacritic360"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/assassins-creed-ii |title=Assassin's Creed II (xbox360) reviews at Metacritic.com |work=Metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its second review was a perfect score from the ''Official PlayStation Magazine US'', while the ''Official PlayStation Magazine UK'' scored the game a 9/10.&lt;ref name="metacriticps3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/assassins-creed-ii |work=Metacritic.com |title=Assassin's Creed II (ps3) reviews at Metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German magazine ''Computer Bild Spiele'' reported that the game's publishers offered to provide a pre-release copy of the game if the magazine would guarantee a review score of "very good". The magazine rejected the request and instead opted to delay their review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Aktuelle Ausgabe 12/2009 | url=http://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cbs-Heft-Aktuelle-Ausgabe-Heftinhalt-888222.html | language=German | publisher=Computer Bild Spiele | accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Mag Claims Ubi Demanded Positive Review On Assassin's Creed II |url=http://kotaku.com/5399879/german-mag-claims-ubi-demanded-positive-review-on-assassins-creed-ii-%5Bupdate%5D |last=Good |first=Owen |publisher=Kotaku |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2009-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112124922/http://kotaku.com/5399879/german-mag-claims-ubi-demanded-positive-review-on-assassins-creed-ii-%5Bupdate%5D |archivedate=12 November 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameSpot which reviewed the PC version of the game, said despite the game being "fun and beautiful" it was hard to justify the higher price point. It was also mentioned that the game was hindered by Ubisoft's DRM and the game "deserved better. For that matter, PC gamers deserved better too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Assassin's Creed II Review for PC | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/assassinscreed2/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%253bread-review | last=VanOrd | first=Kevin | publisher=Gamespot | date=2010-03-08 | accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=GameSpot Video: Assassin's Creed II Video Review | url=http://gamespot.com/pc/action/assassinscreed2/video/6253157/assassins-creed-ii-video-review | last=VanOrd | first=Kevin | publisher=Gamespot | date=2010-03-08 | accessdate=2010-03-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317002731/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/assassinscreed2/video/6253157/assassins-creed-ii-video-review| archivedate= 17 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to pre-official sales estimates, Ubisoft announced that ''Assassin's Creed II'' sold 1.6 million copies worldwide during its first week of sale, representing a 32 percent increase over the first week retail performance of the original ''Assassin's Creed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Reilly, Jim | date=November 24, 2009 | title=Assassin's Creed II First Week Sales Impressive | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/104/1049364p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2009-11-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091127052904/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/104/1049364p1.html| archivedate= 27 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 10, 2010, the game has sold 9 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/247161/assassins-creed-ii-sales-hit-9-million/ News: Assassin's Creed II sales hit 9 million – ComputerAndVideoGames.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Spike Video Game Awards|2009 Spike Video Game Awards]], ''Assassin's Creed II'' was named Best Action Adventure Game, and IGN named it as the Action Game of the Year for Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Game of the Year. Game Informer also named it as Xbox 360 Game of the Year. It also received Game of the Year from ''[[GamePro]]'', [[Eurogamer]] and ''[[The New York Times]]''. ''Assassin's Creed II'' has been nominated for the "Outstanding Achievement in Animation", "Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction", "Outstanding Achievement in Visual Engineering", "Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering", "Outstanding Achievement in Original Story", "Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition", "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design", "Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction", "Adventure Game of the Year" and "Overall Game of the Year" [[Interactive Achievement Award]]s from the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interactive.org/images/pdfs/13th_Annual_IAA_Finalists.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5n2krqxvY?url=http://www.interactive.org/images/pdfs/13th_Annual_IAA_Finalists.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-25 |title=13th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards Finalists |publisher=[[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2010-01-24 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also nominated for several [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] including "Best Game Design", "Best Visual Art", "Best Technology", and "Game of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uncharted-2-flower-assassins-creed-ii-lead-finalists-for-the-tenth-annual-game-developers-choice-awards-82054972.html | title = Uncharted 2, Flower, Assassin's Creed II Lead Finalists for the Tenth Annual Game Developers Choice Awards | publisher = PR Newswire | date = 2010-01-19 | accessdate = 2010-01-24 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100122044259/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uncharted-2-flower-assassins-creed-ii-lead-finalists-for-the-tenth-annual-game-developers-choice-awards-82054972.html| archivedate= 22 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DRM-related criticism===
The PC version of the game utilizes Ubisoft's [[Uplay]] platform, which includes a [[digital rights management]] (DRM) system that initially required all users to remain connected to the Internet while playing. In the initial retail version, any progress made subsequent to the last checkpoint was lost if the Internet connection was severed. Ubisoft stated that if the disconnection was temporary, the game would pause. In addition, the company argued that there were numerous checkpoints spread throughout ''Assassin's Creed II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Polybren |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/02/ubisoft-details-drm.ars |title=Official explanation of controversial Assassin's Creed 2 DRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was also criticized by overseas members of the U.S. Armed Forces, who could not play the game while in locations with sporadic and expensive connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuchera |first=Ben |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/02/the-victims-of-pc-gaming-drm-one-soldiers-story.ars |title=The victims of PC gaming DRM: one soldier's story |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2010-02-23 |accessdate=2010-08-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715164705/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/02/the-victims-of-pc-gaming-drm-one-soldiers-story.ars| archivedate= 15 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft has since published a patch to finally remove the DRM: the PC version of the Retail Edition or the Digital Deluxe Edition now requires a one-time online activation, after which the game, its activation key, and the Uplay Account will be bound together and the game can be played offline, even with the Uplay Launcher logged in offline. The game can then be activated many times on the existing or new machine and still be played offline.&lt;ref name="ign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/05/ubisoft-officially-ditches-always-on-pc-drm|title=Ubisoft Officially Ditches Always-On PC DRM|work=IGN|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the release of the Windows version, Ubisoft claimed that a cracked version of the game had not been created, and was confirmed by at least one website. During the following weekend, the DRM servers for ''[[Silent Hunter 5]]'' and ''Assassin's Creed II'' were, according to Ubisoft, affected by a [[denial-of-service attack]]. Ubisoft later stated that "95 per cent of players were not affected, but a small group of players attempting to open a game session did receive denial of service errors."&lt;ref name="UbisoftAttack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ubisoft-drm-was-attacked-at-weekend |title=Ubisoft DRM was "attacked" at weekend |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2010-03-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100813134656/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ubisoft-drm-was-attacked-at-weekend| archivedate= 13 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PC Gamer Blog: Ubisoft would consider an offline mode for their DRM once it's cracked"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/237724/blog/ubisoft-would-consider-an-offline-mode-for-their-drm-once-its-cracked/?site=pcg |title=Ubisoft "would consider" an offline mode for their DRM once it's cracked |publisher=Computerandvideogames.com |date=2010-03-04 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ubisoft/status/10184920360 |title=Twitter / Ubisoft: "Some gamers are experiencing trouble signing in.

Following the series of server outages, Ubisoft offered owners of the Windows version all DLC from the ''Assassin's Creed II Black Edition'' (despite already having the Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities DLC incorporated into the story mode from the beginning by default), or a free copy of ''[[Heroes Over Europe]]'', ''[[Tom Clancy's EndWar]]'', ''[[Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X]]'', or [[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|''Prince of Persia'' (2008)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incgamers.com/News/21662/ubi-confirms-free-stuff-for-assassins-creed-2-pc-owners |title=Ubi Confirms Free Stuff For Assassin's Creed 2 PC Owners |publisher=Incgamers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DRM was modified in December 2010. By that time the game no longer required a constant Internet connection while playing. Instead, the player had to be connected to the Internet every time the game was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/12/31/constant-net-connection-no-longer-required-for-ubisoft-games/ Constant net connection no longer required for Ubisoft games | PC Gamer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Ubisoft announced that they would patch the game to remove internet access as a requirement to play, and would not require internet access for DRM henceforth. It worked on the PC version. The PC version of the Retail Edition or the Digital Deluxe Edition now requires a one-time online activation, after which the game, its activation key, and the Uplay Account will be bound together and the game can be played offline, even with the Uplay Launcher forced to run in Offline Mode in the Settings Menu . The game can then be activated infinitely on the existing or a new machine if the game is ever reinstalled for some reason, and it can still be played offline. The same rule for Assassin's Creed II on PC now applies to any Ubisoft game on the PC that once required a persistent online connection.&lt;ref name="ign.com"/&gt; However none of these changes affected the Mac OS X version of the game which still requires a constant Internet connection and players still lose progress if the Internet connection is disrupted.

Discussions about details of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' were already present before the release of ''Assassin's Creed II'', with the game staff's notion of possibly having a female descendant in England during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sebastien Puel |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/12032-ubisoft-contemplates-female-assassins-creed-hero/|title=Ubisoft Contemplates Female Assassin's Creed Hero|publisher=Neoseeker.com |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2009-11-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015155916/http://www.neoseeker.com/news/12032-ubisoft-contemplates-female-assassins-creed-hero/| archivedate= 15 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, co-writer [[Corey May]] has stated that the series will never take place during that period, as a major goal was to take players to settings normally unvisited in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May |first=Corey |url=http://blogs.ign.com/UbiAssassinsCreed/2009/10/22/131037/ |title=History |publisher=UbiAssassinsCreed |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2009-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224230232/http://blogs.ign.com/UbiAssassinsCreed/2009/10/22/131037/ |archivedate=2009-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft's Philippe Bergeron stated that potential settings could include [[England in the Middle Ages]], during the era of [[King Arthur]], and [[feudal Japan]], the latter of which had been a "personal favorite" of many in the staff. However, on March 1, 2012, the setting for ''Assassin's Creed III'' was revealed to be colonial [[Boston]] during the [[American Revolution]], starring a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] protagonist named [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Ratonhnaké:ton|Ratonhnaké:ton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Philippe Bergeron |url=http://www.gadgetreview.com/2009/10/gaming-rumor-assassins-creed-3-to-be-set-in-feudal-japan.html |title=Assassin's Creed III to be set in Feudal Japan?|publisher=Gadgetreview.com |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2009-11-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091127060619/http://www.gadgetreview.com/2009/10/gaming-rumor-assassins-creed-3-to-be-set-in-feudal-japan.html| archivedate= 27 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game was released at the end of October 2012.

Two ''Assassin's Creed'' games were released concurrently with ''Assassin's Creed II'': ''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed II: Discovery]]''.

The game's primary antagonist is [[Cesare Borgia]], [[Pope Alexander VI|Rodrigo Borgia]]'s son.

'''''Australia Prepared''''' is a 1916 Australian documentary film to show the country's preparation for World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1596060 |title="AUSTRALIA PREPARED.". |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=18 July 1916 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article74674695 |title=AUSTRALIA PREPARED. |newspaper=[[The Ballarat Courier]] |location=Vic. |date=18 July 1916 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |page=4 Edition: DAILY. |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inspired by the British propaganda film ''Britain Prepared'' (1915) and was commissioned by Senator [[George Pearce]]. Filming took several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article121339458 |title=AUSTRALIA PREPARED. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Sydney |date=9 July 1916 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |page=28 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many Australian silent movies, a copy of it survives.

[[File:When Father Papered The Parlour.jpg|thumb|right|A 1910 front page for "[[When Father Papered the Parlour]]" music score featuring Williams]]
'''Richard Isaac Banks''' (March 3, 1878 – March 13, 1915), who changed his name to '''Billy Williams''' after leaving his birthplace of [[Australia]], was a popular [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall]] entertainer of his era. (see B.Rust: Music Hall On Record, Gramophone 1979 p.&amp;nbsp;282 et seq.) Over 500 recordings sold in their thousands long after his early death in 1915.

Born in [[Melbourne]], Williams tried a number of jobs before embarking on an entertainment career which led him to come to [[England]] in 1899. He became a popular entertainer in the music halls singing what were known as chorus-songs&amp;nbsp;– he also appeared in [[pantomime]].

==Career==
It was in 1906 that Williams made his first recordings and from that date he recorded prolifically on [[cylinder recording|cylinder]] and [[gramophone record|disc]].

In 1910, he returned for an extended tour of his native Australia where he was greeted with wild enthusiasm.  Returning to England later in that year, he continued his business relationship with songwriter [[Fred Godfrey]]. The two had what might be described as a "song factory" and worked in partnership (although it is believed that Godfrey did all of the song writing).

The year 1912 seemed to be the zenith of Williams' career&amp;nbsp;– he appeared in the first [[Royal Command Performance]] of that year and achieved glowing reviews in the national press. Sadly this fame was not to last as Williams became ill in late 1914 and died in Hove near Brighton in March 1915, the proximate cause being ''septic prostatitis'' and consequent complications after an operation for that condition, but rumoured ultimately to be connected with "previous social excesses." (Myerscough, book to CD set, 2001)
==Personal life and death ==
He is buried in  Mill Lane Cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Burials.htm#billywilliams|title=Music Hall and Variety Artistes Burial Places: Billy Williams|accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoreham-by-Sea]], West Sussex, England. His headstone is in a family plot and read:
{{quote|text=In Ever Loving Memory of William Holt Williams - "Billy Williams" whom God called 13 March 1915 aged 37 years. ''Farewell Fair Heart until we Meet Again'' - WIFE. Also of RICHARD SHAW father of the above whom God called 6 August 1914 aged 63 years.}}

Billy was also the brother of Richard and Rowley Banks, two of Australia's earliest professional golfers, who were also foundation members of the Australian Professional Golfers Association, founded in 1911.

Williams had married Amy Robinson in 1901 and she survived her husband by some 61 years.

Billy and Amy Williams produced four living children: Reginald, William, Margaret and Cathleen, who after his death, moved with Amy to Australia to live out their lives.

Williams is survived by his grandson Richard John Williams and great grandson Richard Guy Williams who both reside in Sydney, Australia.

'''''Brat Pack''''' is the title of a [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by [[Rick Veitch]] (self-published under the company name [[King Hell Press]]). It is a dark satire on [[superhero]] [[sidekick]]s, influenced partly by the fans' decision to kill off [[Batman]]'s sidekick [[Jason Todd]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]," ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #426-429 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; but also built on other long-standing rumors and undercurrents in the history of the superhero genre, prominently [[commercialism]], [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], violence, and the [[fascist]] tendencies inherent in superheroes.

== Publication history ==
''Brat Pack'' was released as a limited series in 1990–1991.

== Plot ==
The series opens with the villainous Dr Blasphemy calling in to a radio show, where local residents of Slumburg, Pennsylvania (the setting of the story) are venting about their dislike for the teenage super-hero/sidekick Chippy. The pink leather clad sidekick of the gay super-hero Midnight Mink is widely reviled, which leads to Dr Blasphemy challenging the host of the radio program to hold a call-in radio poll. The goal being that, if more people vote for Chippy and his fellow super-hero sidekicks to die, Dr Blasphemy will carry out the will of the people and murder them. Most of the general public, thinking the caller claiming to the villain, call in to vote for the murder of the sidekicks. Once the poll closes, Dr Blasphemy thanks the callers and announces he will carry out their will that evening. 

While Blasphemy is holding court on the radiowaves, Chippy is meeting with a local priest where he talks about the cruelty of adult heroes he and his friends sidekick for. Leaving the confessional chamber, a young altar boy named Tony notices the teen hero leave and realizes that his priest knows the heroes. Father Berkeley ignores Tony's request to meet Chippy, stating that being a teenage sidekick is a taxing job. 

That evening, Chippy meets up with his fellow sidekicks (Kid Viscious, Luna, and Wild Boy); all of which bully and take turns causing physical harm to the young hero out of a belief of him being a sissy. However, their tormenting of Chippy is interrupted by the arrival of Dr Blasphemy. As he taunts the heroes, there is a sudden explosion, killing three of the heroes and horribly disfiguring Chippy (protected by an accelerated healing power given to him by Midnight Mink). Horribly maimed, Chippy opts to go into hiding as he proclaims himself free from Midnight Mink and the life of a sidekick. 

Midnight Mink, the racist Judge Jury, the misandrist Moon Mistress, and the drug addict King Rad meet to discuss the deaths of their sidekicks. The four heroes (known collectively as Black October) have merchandised themselves out to various corporations for vulgar profit; however their contracts state they must have teen sidekicks. They confront Father Berkeley, ordering him to procure four youths from the local community for the four to take on as the new Chippy, Luna, Kid Viscious, and Wild Boy. After they leave, Tony appears having heard everything and offers himself up to become the new Chippy. 

The series then focuses on the new Luna, Wild Boy, and Kid Viscious as well as Tony's transition into becoming a super-hero: 

Luna II is a spoiled sweet teenage girl named Annie who refuses to have sex with her fellow male classmates, is heavily involved in her local church group, and dotes on her single father. Moon Maiden murders her father and arranges to have her adopted by Moon Maiden. 

Kid Viscious II is a lonely rich kid named Richard raised by a widow, who spends her time traveling the globe with her much younger mother. Richard spends his time alone, with only his family's Asian housekeeper and her daughter, to keep him company. Judge Jury murders Richard's mother and frames her boyfriend for the crime, then forces Kid Viscious (who he tortures in order to break him mentally, while pumping him full of steroids and other drugs that cause him to become violent and aggressive 24-7) to murder his housekeeper's daughter when he realizes that he has feelings for the girl. 

Wild Boy II is a Hispanic skateboarder named Carlos, whose parents run a successful local grocery store. Unlike the other members of Black October, King Rad simply allows a fire caused by arsonists to go unchecked, killing Wild Boy II's parents and siblings that way rather than murdering them himself. Carlos is then made to indulge in harsh drugs against his will by King Rad, but ultimately starts using them willingly after a search and rescue mission goes wrong and Carlos is unable to save a young boy from being torn in two. 

Tony is raised by a single father, who spends most of his days drunk and forcing Tony to fend for himself for food and basic needs. Midnight Mink murders Tony's father in a staged robbery, then "adopts" Tony. 

As the series progress, the four heroes systematically break their young charges mentally and physically through extensive physical abuse (Judge Jury), drug addiction (King Rad), and psychological manipulation (Midnight Mink and Moon Mistress). While they do so, they discuss the missing fifth member of the group: Overman. 

A being of pure energy, Overman personally trained Moon Maiden as a hero, was best friends and lovers with Midnight Mink, and who brought the wildcards Judge Jury and King Rad into his orbit to stop a war between the two and Overman and his friends, to allow them to become the sole protectors of Slumburg. 

However, Overman became jaded with humans and ultimately left the Earth. However, before he left, Overman discovered that Midnight Mink had contracted AIDS and performed a blood transfusion. The transfusion cured Midnight Mink of AIDS, but also granted him (and anyone who is exposed to his blood in transfusion form) super-human endurance to pain and injury, along with the ability (over time) to heal from any wounds inflicted upon them. When Tony proves himself a worthy replacement as Chippy  after several battles, Midnight Mink performs a blood transfusion granting him the same power.

By the end, all four teen heroes are irrevocably broken mentally just like their predecessors: Richard is now a steroid addicted bully, Carlos a drug addict, Annie a completely jaded, teenage slut who performs a coat hanger abortion on herself after having sex with Richard and Carlos. Meanwhile Tony finds himself repeatedly visiting Father Berkeley, as he reveals that all three of his fellow sidekicks hate and despise him due to the fact that Midnight Mink, does not overtly abuse and mock Tony like the other heroes do. He further states that he has become irrevocably jaded with the life of a hero and the sociopathic tendencies of Midnight Mink and the other members of Black October. Midnight Mink interrupts the confession, as he reveals the full control he has over Tony by having him leave the priest to return home with him. Midnight Mink then tells Father Berkeley that the only reason he doesn't kill him/allows his various sidekicks to vent their anguish and suffering to him, is that Midnight Mink gets off on knowing that the priest can do nothing to save his sidekicks or any of the sidekicks, from the hell that is their lives as super-heroes. 

===Original Ending===
The original five issue mini-series had the following ending that is only available in Brat Pack #5.

After leaving Father Berkeley's confessional, the opening scene from the first issue plays out again with the other sidekicks attacking Tony. However, there is a loud scream from the church as the heroes storm in and find Dr Blasphemy waiting for them with a large coffin: he orders the heroes to open it (after flinging the dying remains of the original Chippy at Tony) and reveals it full of contracts and legal documents for merchandise, comics, tv shows, and movies. 

Dr Blasphemy reveals that the kids are pawns of corporate America: they require the psychopathic heroes have teen sidekicks to make them appear wholesome and fatherly/motherly to the masses and then reveals that their partners murdered their parents, so they could ensure that they did not have to split the money from the merchandise deals. Chippy inspects one document and discovers a clause in it that chills the already jaded young man to the bone: when the sidekicks become legal age (18), the heroes must then start splitting the proceeds from their lucrative merchandise/media deals with their sidekicks. Chippy then realizes that Midnight Mink, Judge Jury, King Rad, and Moon Mistress were responsible for the bomb blast that killed their sidekicks, all of whom were on the verge of turning 18 years old. However, before they can do anything a bomb is dropped on the church by a plane flown by Midnight Mink and Black October. 

Storming the bombed out remains the church, Father Berkeley (about to hang himself in the bell tower), finds a bag and a note telling him to open it. Inside, he finds Dr Blasphemy's hood which he puts on as he hangs himself. The Black October go to the bell tower and find him hanging, but quickly realize that he's doesn't have the full costume of their enemy. Suddenly the electrical storm reaches its peak as Over Man returns at long last. The hero murders his former friends and teammates by trapping them under the church bell which he melts on top of them, as King Rad tries desperately to reach out to his faithful butler (who also served as a servant for Black October) for help. Final shot shows the church in ruins as the radio station from the start of the story, declaring a state of emergency and everyone to stay indoors until the lightning storm is over.

===Trade Paperback Ending===

When the series was released as a trade paperback, Veitch redid the entire ending from scratch for the series. 

After Midnight Mink's confrontation with Father Berkeley, Tony encounters the original Chippy outside the church; his injuries too severe for his healin factor to fix, he finally dies but gives Chippy his mask before he passes. Meanwhile, after being told that Midnight Mink allows his sidekicks to confess the abuse they endure at the hands of the heroes because he knows the priest can do nothing to save the young teens from the abuse, Father Berkeley pulls out a gun and shoots Mink. Chippy responds by rescuing the hero and overseeing his recovery; going so far as to perform a blood transfusion, so his own healing factor can help speed up Mink's healing process. 

Afterwards, the sidekicks are forced to attend a convention where they sign autographs and meet their fans. An overtly angry fan of the original Chippy mortally wounds Tony, revealing his healing factor power to the other teen sidekicks. Once he has healed up, they lure him to the alley behind the church where, like their predecessors, they take turns tormenting and brutalizing Chippy to force him to give up the secret of his healing powers. The torture is interrupted when Dr Blasphemy appears and lures the teens inside. A coffin is then presented to them, claiming to hold death and a secret. While Richard, Annie, and Carlo all proclaim that they hope it is their mentors, Tony realizes the truth. He reveals that the coffin is a bomb and quickly disarms it before opening it up to show the explosives inside. Annie, Carlos, and Richard realize they know their heroes have access to bomb-making equipment and realize that their mentors want to kill them, just like they killed the previous sidekicks they replaced. Bleeding from the beating, Tony grabs a nearby sacrament cup and fills it with his blood, so they can share in his healing factor. He then states the truth: the original sidekicks were murdered simply because Blood October and its members could do it. Pointing out how utterly corrupt and evil they were, Tony warns that they need to either flee town or prepare for a final showdown with their mentors. At which point, from his plane, Midnight Minx drops a bomb on the church. 

The rest of the ending plays out as it did in the original book: Black October go into the church, where they find Father Berkeley having hung himself while wearing a Dr Blasphemy mask. Overman then appears to kill his former teammates, but due to the blood they consumed, the teen sidekicks watch with glee as they reveal that Overman is upset with the utter corruption and evil of his former friends as he executes them for their crimes. However, before the comic ends with the shot of the ruined church and the radio calling for citizens to stay indoors, it is revealed that Dr Blasphemy was Fredo, butler and major domo for King Rad and Black October.

== Reception ==
''Brat Pack'' is Rick Veitch/King Hell's top-selling title, with the fourth edition selling out in late 2007.&lt;ref name="download"&gt;Veitch, Rick. [http://www.rickveitch.com/2009/03/02/brat-pack-free-download/ "BRAT PACK: Free Download!"] RickVeitch.com (March 2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Veitch released a fifth edition in 2009.&lt;ref name="download" /&gt; Comics reporter [[Heidi MacDonald]] considers ''Brat Pack'' the third part of "the troika of immortal works dissecting the superhero genre, with the other two being ''[[The Dark Knight Returns|Dark Knight]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''. Indeed, for those brave readers looking for a follow-up to ''Watchmen'', ''Brat Pack'' could be just the thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MacDonal |first=Heidi |authorlink=Heidi MacDonald |url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2008/10/07/rick-veitch-%C2%BB-brat-pack-news/ |title=BRAT PACK back |work=The Beat |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=October 7, 2008 |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==
[[Neil Gaiman]], from his introduction to the trade paperback:
{{cquote|Rick Veitch thinks dirty, grotesque, and completely unfair thoughts about costumed crimefighters. He remembers [[Green Arrow]]'s ward [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], and [[Wonder Woman]]'s protégé [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]], [[Captain America]]'s sidekick [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]], and the 1940s [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Sandman]]'s assistant [[Sandy the Golden Boy]]. He remembers them and the hundreds of others like them. Innocent kids out there swinging from tall buildings with their vigilante mentors so the kids reading would have someone to identify with, so the heroes could have someone to explain the plot to.&lt;ref name="Gaiman"&gt;Gaiman, Neil. "Introduction," ''Brat Pack'' (King Hell, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Burkinabe film list}}
The '''cinema of Burkina Faso''' is one of the more significant in [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;Spaas, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; with a history that spans several decades and includes the production of many award-winning films.

==History==
The cinema of [[Burkina Faso]] is an important part of the history of the post-colonial [[West Africa]]n and [[Africa]]n film industry.&lt;ref&gt;Spaas, pp. 232-246&lt;/ref&gt; Burkina's contribution to [[African cinema]] started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969 and gained government support and permanent structures in 1972. It is the largest film exhibition venue in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than half a million attendees, and takes place in odd numbered years in March. Burkina is also one of the countries producing the most feature films in Africa. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes. For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in [[Ouagadougou]], rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President [[Thomas Sankara]] In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagaoudougou. Between 1977 and 1987 Burkina Faso housed a regional film school, Institut d'Education Cinématographique de Ouagadougou (INAFEC), which was instigated by FEPACI and funded in part by UNESCO. But eighty percent of its funding came from the government of Burkina Faso; no other African country participated in its funding and few sent students.

==Today's cinema==
In the late 1990s, local private production companies began to proliferate and digital production became increasingly prevalent. By 2002 over twenty-five small production companies existed in the country, many pooling their resources and expertise in order to produce. The best known directors from Burkina Faso are: [[Mamadou Djim Kola]], [[Gaston Kaboré]], Kollo Daniel Sanou, Paul Zoumbara, Emmanuel Kalifa Sanon, Pierre S. Yameogo, [[Idrissa Ouedraogo]], Drissa Toure, [[Dani Kouyaté]], and Régina Fanta Nacro.&lt;ref&gt;Turégano, Teresa Hoefert, ''African Cinema and Europe: Close-Up on Burkina Faso'', Florence: European Press Academic, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Burkina also produces popular television series such as Bobodjiouf. The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate make also popular television series.

==Distribution==
[[File:BoboDioulasso-CineSanyonE.JPG|thumb|A cinema in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]]]]
Many films shot in Burkina Faso by local directors have found distribution in [[Francophone]] Europe and several have received assistance from the French Ministry of Co-operation. However, while these films have won awards in Europe and are regularly featured in African Studies courses, in Africa itself they are little known outside of academic circles.

==Festivals and schools==
Burkina Faso hosts the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]] (FESPACO) every two years in [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso's capital.

In 2005, director [[Gaston Kaboré]], who won the top prize at FESPACO in 1997 for his film ''[[Buud Yam]]'', opened a training school for new filmmakers in Ouagadougou. The school, named Imagine, was built with millions of [[CFA franc|CFA]] of Kaboré's own money and opened its doors for the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou 2005.

The '''cinema of Lebanon''', according to film critic and historian Roy Armes, is the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 26"&gt;Armes, Roy. ''Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East: a Dictionary'', page 26&lt;/ref&gt; Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s,{{sfn|Shafik|2007|p=9}} and the country has produced more than 500 films.&lt;ref&gt;Harabi, Najib. ''Knowledge Intensive Industries: Four Case Studies of Creative Industries in Arab Countries'', World Bank Project, 2009, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has been steady increase in film production since the end of the [[Lebanese Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="IDAL, Film Industry Fact Book 2015"|url=http://investinlebanon.gov.lb/Content/uploads/CorporatePageRubric/180123031720175~Film%20Industry%20factsheet%202015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of films produced each year remains relatively small in comparison to what it used to be in the 1960s, and the industry remains heavily dependent on foreign funding, mainly European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Strictly Dabkeh!

Despite that, local films have enjoyed a degree of local and international success.

==History==

===French Mandate===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The-Adventures-of-Elias-Mabrouk.png|thumb|right|A still from ''The Adventures of Elias Mabrouk'' (1929)]] --&gt;

Cinemas existed in Lebanon since the early 1920s, and a sharp increase in the number of theaters was observed between 1923-1929.&lt;ref&gt;Kassir, Samir. ''Beirut'', University of California Press; First edition (November 15, 2010), page 267&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1920s, cinemas were common in Beirut, and some were used as a place for political gatherings. For example, in 1925, the Communist Party met at the Crystal Cinema in Beirut.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=200}} Cinemas had become so popular that in 1931, students marched in a protest, demanding that prices of movie tickets be lowered.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=200}} To compete against Hollywood, France decreed that all American films that were being imported to Lebanon be dubbed into French.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=201}}

The first local film, ''The Adventures of Elias Mabruk'', was made in 1929.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg 2010"&gt;Ginsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard. ''Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema'', Scarecrow Press (March 11, 2010), page xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; It was a silent film, directed by Jordano Pidutti.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|p=12}} Pidutti was an Italian immigrant who worked as a chauffeur for the [[Sursock family]] before devoting his life to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://homemagazinelebanon.com/2016-04-07-14-47-47/item/1000-lebanese-cinema-film-makers-history-worlwide |title=CANNES 1957: THE DEBUT OF LEBANESE CINEMA |publisher=Home Magazine |date= |accessdate=31 May 2018 |deadurl=no|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first film, ''The Adventures of Elias Mabruk'' tells the story of a Lebanese emigrant who returns to Lebanon after a long absence in America in search of his family.&lt;ref&gt;Sadoul, George. ''The Cinema in the Arab Countries'', Interarab Centre of Cinema &amp; Television; First Edition in English edition, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; This tale of an emigrant's homecoming, captured nostalgic feelings in a country of emigrants and would become a recurrent theme in Lebanese cinema.&lt;ref name="Seigneurie, Ken 2011, page 96"&gt;Seigneurie, Ken.

Lebanese women, like [[Assia Dagher]] and [[Mary Queeny]], played pioneering roles in Egyptian cinema.  In Lebanon, Herta Gargour, who managed the film studio, Luminar Films, is credited with establishing filmmaking in Lebanon after the silent era.&lt;ref name="Hillauer, Rebecca 2006 page 132"&gt;Hillauer, Rebecca. ''Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers'', The American University in Cairo Press; 1 edition (February 2, 2006), page 132&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In the Ruins of Baalbeck'' (1936), which was produced by Luminar Films,&lt;ref name="Hillauer, Rebecca 2006 page 132"/&gt; was the first sound film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250250/ Bayn Hayakel Baalbek (1936) – IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a hit with audiences and profitable.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=202}} The film, which was directed by Julio De Luca and Karam Boustany, depicted the love story of a local prince who falls in love with a foreigner.&lt;ref name="Seigneurie, Ken 2011, page 96"/&gt; The film is considered the first Arab film produced entirely in an Arab country and featuring the [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard. H''istorical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema'', Scarecrow Press (March 11, 2010), page xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Al-Ariss became the first Lebanese-born to direct a film on his own when he made ''The Rose Seller'' in 1940, which was followed by ''Planet of the Desert Princess''&lt;ref name="Khatib, Lina 2008, page 22"/&gt;

Documentaries were also being made during this period, but they were heavily censored by the French.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=201}}

===Post-Independence===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IlaAyn-George-Nasser.jpg|thumb|right|''Vers L'Inconnu'', A Film by Georges Nasser]] --&gt;
After Lebanon gained its independence from France, filmmakers began to examine local themes, especially rural life and folklore.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"&gt;Armes, Roy. ''Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East: a Dictionary'', page 7&lt;/ref&gt; During the post-independence period, Lebanon witnessed an economic boom that made its capital, [[Beirut]], the financial center of the eastern Mediterranean.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=70}} Lebanon's economic success, along with the presence of 38 banks and its open, multi-cultural and liberal society, made the country an alternative production choice to Egypt, which was at the time the center of filmmaking in the Arabic-speaking world.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=71}} Additionally, "Lebanon had the region's best technical facilities" for film production.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, Shohini. ''Contemporary World Cinema: Europe, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia'', page 60&lt;/ref&gt; Fully equipped studios were set up in 1952, such as Haroun Studio owned by Michel Haroun and Al-Arz Studio&lt;ref&gt;Khatib, Lina. ''Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond'', I. B. Tauris, London 2008, page 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first half of the twentieth century, Lebanese cinema was very closely associated with Egyptian cinema.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|p=29}} In addition to exporting numerous Lebanese actors and actresses, such as Nour Al Hoda and [[Sabah (singer)|Sabah]], belly dancers like Badia Massabni and producers like [[Assia Dagher]], Lebanese distributors monopolized export of Egyptian film from 1930s – 1970s.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|p=28}}

The first Lebanese film to be featured In Selection at [[Cannes Film Festival]] was [[Georges Nasser (filmmaker)|Georges Nasser's]] ''Ila Ayn?'' in 1958.&lt;ref name="Ham, Anthony page 411"&gt;Ham, Anthony. ''Middle East'', Lonely Planet 2012, page 411&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its success abroad and having been screened at numerous film festivals, such as in Moscow and Beijing, the movie theaters in Lebanon hesitated to screen the film, and it only received a limited screening in Cinema Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://homemagazinelebanon.com/2016-04-07-14-47-47/item/1000-lebanese-cinema-film-makers-history-worlwide |title=CANNES 1957: THE DEBUT OF LEBANESE CINEMA |publisher=Home Magazine |date= |accessdate=31 May 2018 |deadurl=no|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For its sixty-year anniversary, the film was screened again in its restored print version as part of the Cannes Classics events in 2017.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite web|title="Georges Nasser, the grandfather of Lebanese cinema and director of ''Ila Ayn''?"|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/69-editions/retrospective/2017/actualites/articles/georges-nasser-the-grandfather-of-lebanese-cinema-and-director-of-ila-ayn}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Nasser's work has been more appreciated in recent years, and the filmmaker, who teaches at the [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts]] has been showered with accolades, including at the Tripoli Film Festival, which was held in his honor in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Putting Tripoli on the International Screen "|url=https://en.annahar.com/article/582594-putting-tripoli-on-the-international-screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-productions with Egypt and Syria were common in this period, which was considered the "Golden Age" of the Lebanese film industry.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"/&gt; Additionally, Lebanese producers from 1945 up to 1951 played an influential role in the first stages of production of Iraqi cinema.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|pp=27–28}}

====The Golden Age====

The film industry continued to prosper in the 1960s. After [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalized the film industry in Egypt in 1963, many private producers, distributors and directors, including [[Youssef Chahine]], moved to Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Gugler, Josef 2015, page 103"&gt;Gugler, Josef. ''Ten Arab Filmmakers: Political Dissent and Social Critique'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington 2015, page 103&lt;/ref&gt; The migration of film production to Beirut ushered a Golden Age, making Lebanon the film set for almost all Egyptian movies and establishing the Lebanese film industry as the second largest in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Just Like the Movies: Lebanon's Film Industry"|url=http://irresistible.alrifai.com/2016/03/23/just-like-the-movies-lebanons-film-industry-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beirut rivaled Cairo’s dominance of Arab filmmaking, and even briefly replaced it as the center for Arab filmmaking;&lt;ref&gt;Kiarostami, Abbas. ''The Cinema of North Africa and the Middle East'', Wallflower Press, London 2007, page 160&lt;/ref&gt; however, films produced in the sixties, for the most part, lacked a sense of national identity and were merely commercial films, targeting a pan-Arab audience.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"/&gt; For instance, Lebanese filmmaker, Mohammed Selmane made a series of Bedouin-themed films, like ''Bedouin in Paris'' (1964) and ''Bedouin in Rome'' (1965), both starring [[Samira Tewfik]] and targeting not only local but also Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Gulf audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Leamen, Oliver. Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film, Routledge London, 2001, page 375&lt;/ref&gt; Mohamed Selmane, who was trained in Egypt and returned to Lebanon to make 30 films in 25 years, was one of the most successful directors of this period.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"/&gt;

The musicals of the Rahbani Brothers that starred [[Fairuz]] were an exception to the films that lacked a national identity. The Rahbani films were centered around nostalgic themes of life in [[Mount Lebanon]] villages.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Christopher Reed. ''Popular culture and nationalism in Lebanon: the Fairouz and Rahbani Nation'', pages 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; Nostalgia was a common theme in Lebanese film since 1929.&lt;ref name="Seigneurie, Ken 2011, page 96"/&gt; While many films in the sixties were filmed in the Egyptian vernacular to cater to the large Egyptian market, the Rahbani films were filmed in the Lebanese dialect.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|pp=72–73}} ''The Seller of  Rings'' (1965), set in a [[Maronite]] village and displaying folkloristic elements, was an adaption of one of their operettas to the screen.&lt;ref name="Gugler, Josef 2015, page 103"/&gt; Another Rahbani film, ''[[Safar Barlik]]'', which was set in 1912, depicted Lebanon's struggle against the Ottoman occupation. The film became a staple rerun on Lebanese television, especially on Independence Day.&lt;ref&gt;Frishkopf, Michael. Music and Media in the Arab World, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other exceptions like the auteur films of George Nasser and Youssef Maalouf. Georges Nasser's second feature, ''The Small Stranger'' was also selected for Cannes in 1962.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt; Youssef Maalouf adapted to film [[Kahlil Gibran|Kahlil Gibran's]] novel, ''[[Broken Wings (Gibran novel)|The Broken Wings]]'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Seigneurie, Ken. ''Standing by the Ruins: Elegiac Humanism in Wartime and Postwar Lebanon'', Fordham University Press, 2011, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;  Prints of the film ''[[The Broken Wings]]'' were believed to have been destroyed during the war, but one was found after the war stored in a church, and the film, starring stage actress Nidal Al-Askhar, was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/the-broken-wings/ |title=The Broken Wings |publisher=Film Threat |date= |accessdate=4 June 2018 |archivedate=7 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon was also a filming location for international productions. For example, in 1965, [[Val Guest]]'s ''[[Where the Spies Are]]'', starring [[David Niven]] and [[Françoise Dorléac]], was filmed in Beirut.&lt;ref name="Kassir, Debevoise page 407"&gt;Kassir, Debevoise, and Fisk. ''Beirut'', page 407&lt;/ref&gt; ''Twenty-Four Hours to Kill'',&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059836/ Twenty-Four Hours to Kill (1965) – IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Mickey Rooney]], and ''[[Secret Agent Fireball]]'', starring [[Richard Harrison (actor)|Richard Harrison]], were also filmed in Beirut the same year.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; The following year in 1966, the German director, Manfred R. Köhler, filmed his film, ''[[Agent 505: Death Trap in Beirut]]''. [[George Lautner]]'s ''La grande sauterelle'' was also filmed in Beirut in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061729/ La grande sauterelle (1967) – IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rebus (film)|Rebus]]'', starring [[Ann-Margret]] was filmed on location at the [[Casino du Liban]] in 1969. While ''[[Honeybaby, Honeybaby]]'' was shot in 1974 in Beirut, the producers of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', which was partially set in Beirut, decided not to film in the Lebanese capital due to the burgeoning political problems.&lt;ref name="Kassir, Debevoise page 407"/&gt;

In 1965, [[UNESCO]] established the Arab Cinema Liaison Center&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard. H''istorical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema'', Scarecrow Press (March 11, 2010), page xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; at the National Cinema Center in Beirut as a regional hub for linking cinema activities across the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Khatib, Lina 2008, page 22"/&gt; Beirut hosted the first international film festival in the Arab world in 1971.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"/&gt; Until the mid-1970s, the film industry in Lebanon was flourishing with market appeal that extended to neighboring Arabic-speaking countries.&lt;ref name="Kuhn page 239"&gt;Kuhn, Anne and Radstone, Annette. ''The Women's Companion to International Film'', page 239&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon was producing "a string of sexually indulgent films" such as ''Cats of Hamra Street''&lt;ref&gt;Kassir, Debevoise, and Fisk. ''Beirut'', page 391&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Guitar of Love'' in 1973,{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=73}} starring [[Georgina Rizk]], the Lebanese beauty queen who won Miss Universe in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.missuniverse.com/contestant_profiles/past |title=Contestant Profiles |publisher=Miss Universe |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925075702/http://www.missuniverse.com/contestant_profiles/past |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, cinema attendance in Lebanon was the highest among Arabic-speaking countries.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 204"&gt;Armes, Roy. ''Third World film making and the West'', page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heiny Srour]] became not only the first Lebanese and Arab woman to have her film in competition at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artistikrezo.com/agenda/l-heure-de-la-liberation-a-sonne-documentaire-de-heiny-srour.html|title=L’Heure de la liberation a sonné – documentaire de Heiny Srour |publisher=Artistik Rezo |date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her documentary film ''The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived'' was actually the first film by any female filmmaker to be screened at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Rob, with Paul Cooke, Stephanie Dennison, Alex Marlow-Mann. ''The Routledge Companion to World Cinema'', Routledge; 1 edition (October 3, 2017), page 209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
Prior to the civil war, 161 films, mostly commercial melodramas, were produced in Lebanon and exported to various Arab countries, but when the civil war began, film production decreased tremendously.&lt;ref&gt;Hillauer, Rebecca. ''Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers'', The American University in Cairo Press; 1 edition (February 2, 2006), page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the war, there was an "emergence of a new wave of Lebanese filmmakers – fostering, unusually, equal numbers of women and men".&lt;ref name="Kuhn page 239"/&gt; The female filmmakers, who emerged during this period, made highly acclaimed and internationally renowned films.&lt;ref name="Leamen, Oliver 2001, page 374"&gt;Leamen, Oliver. Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film, Routledge London, 2001, page 374&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the filmmakers who emerged during this period were "[[Maroun Baghdadi]], [[Jocelyne Saab]], [[Borhane Alaouié]], [[Heiny Srour]], [[Randa Chahal Sabag]]" and Jean Chamoun.&lt;ref&gt;Westmoreland, Mark R. "Post-Orientalist Aesthetics: Experimental Film and Video in Lebanon"&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, film themes in Lebanon were concentrated around the political conflicts that the country was undergoing.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 204"/&gt; Displacement was also a recurrent theme as evident in Borhane Alaouie's ''Beirut, the Encounter'' (1981).{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=80}} Films of this period were characterized by a lack of closure, reflective of the seemingly endless war at the time.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=82}}

One of the most important directors to emerge during this period was Maroun Baghdadi. According to Lina Khatib, author of ''Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond'', Baghdadi's films were "considered the cornerstone of Lebanese cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=– Saturday |url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/the-view-from-lebanon?pageCount=2 |title=Page 2/3: The view from Lebanon |publisher=The National |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maroun Baghdadi made ''[[Little Wars (film)|Little Wars]]'' (1982) with aid provided by the American filmmaker, Francis Coppola.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Anne and Radstone, Annette. ''The Women's Companion to International Film'', page 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; The film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1704/year/1982.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Little Wars |accessdate=12 June 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also screened at New York Film Festival on 2 October 1982.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03EFD8123BF931A35753C1A964948260 |title=Movie Review: Little Wars |accessdate=15 October 2011|work=NY Times |first=Janet |last=Maslin |date=2 October 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentaries by filmmakers like Jocelyne Saab who "adopted a mainly journalistic style" also developed rapidly and successfully during this period.&lt;ref name="Kuhn page 239"/&gt; Lebanese and Palestinian documentaries produced in Lebanon during the 1970s caused a surge of documentary production across the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 26"/&gt; These documentaries contributed to the development of feature film production in the early eighties.&lt;ref name="Armes, Roy page 26"/&gt;

Many filmmakers from this era, such as Jocelyne Saab, Jean Chamoun, Randa Chahal Sabbag, and Maroun Baghdadi settled in France due to the prolonged conflict in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Armes, Roy. ''Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East: a Dictionary'', page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Beirut: The Last Home Movie]]'' is a 1987 documentary film that was directed by [[Jennifer Fox (documentary filmmaker)|Jennifer Fox]] and shot on location at the historic [[Bustros]] mansion in Beirut. The documentary, which told the story of one of Lebanon’s wealthiest families, was awarded the Excellence In Cinematography Award and won the Grand Jury Prize Documentary at the 1988 Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sundance.org/films/953 |title=Beirut: The Last Home Movie |publisher=Sundance Institute |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the war, Lebanon submitted a film for the first time for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film when ''Promise of Love'' (1978) an Armenian-language film by Sarky Mouradian was submitted to the [[List of submissions to the 51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1979 |title=The 51ST Academy Awards, 1979 |publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  |date= |accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the wave of festival films and documentaries, a series of commercial films, mostly mimicking action [[B movie]]s from Hollywood, were made in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=– Saturday |url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/the-view-from-lebanon |title=The view from Lebanon |publisher=The National |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent directors such as Youssef Charafeddine and Samir El-Ghoussaini aspired for escapism in their films to take their audiences out of the context of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Khatib, Lina. ''Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond'', IB Tauris &amp; Comapny, London 2008, page xiv,&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''The Last Passage'' (1981), ''The Decision'' (1981), and ''The Leap of Death'' (1982) were popular because they depicted a society free of war where law and order actually existed.&lt;ref name="Leamen, Oliver 2001, page 374"/&gt;  Other commercial films, like ''Ghazl Al-Banat'', incorporated the war in the narrative.&lt;ref name="Leamen, Oliver 2001, page 374"/&gt; The era of commercial film production ended with the [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli war on Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Leamen, Oliver 2001, page 374"/&gt;

===Post-War Revival===
After the war, Beirut reemerged as one of the centers of mass media production in the Arab world.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=91}} While media production was concentrated around television, there were attempts to revive the film industry in Lebanon, especially by fresh graduates of Lebanese film schools. While filmmaking schools are a rarity in the region, by the mid-1990s, six of Beirut's universities were offering degrees in cinema and television and that attracted an influx of students from Arab countries who chose to receive some or all of their media training in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marks, Laura U. "What Is That and between Arab Women and Video? The Case of Beirut"&lt;/ref&gt; Financing of film production in Lebanon in this period was mainly dependent on foreign support, both European and from the Lebanese diaspora.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The civil war was a major theme for Lebanese filmmakers since 1975, and this trend continued in the early post-war era where films continued to be affected thematically by the war.&lt;ref&gt;Khatib, Lina. ''Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond'', IB Tauris &amp; Comapny, London 2008, page xx&lt;/ref&gt; Films made after the war had a common theme of returning to the war setting and dealing with trauma common to post-conflict societies.&lt;ref name="Rastegar, Kamran 2015, page 155"&gt;Rastegar, Kamran. ''Surviving Images: Cinema, War, and Cultural Memory in the Middle East'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2015, page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Many films, such as Jocelyne Saab's experimental film, ''Once Upon a Time in Beirut'', examined the destruction that was left after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Terri and Lippard, Chris. [https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780810860902 ''Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema''], page 310&lt;/ref&gt; Maroun Baghdadi's Beyrouth ''Hors la Vie'' won the Special Jury Prize at Canned in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Andrew. ''Pop Culture Arab World!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle'', page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Other's like Jean-Claude Codsi's ''Histoire d'un retoure'' examined the issue of returning to the country after years of exile and war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Westmoreland, Mark R."Post-Orientalist Aesthetics:Experimental Film and Video in Lebanon"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Codsi's film won the jury award at the ''Festival international du film Francophone'' de Namur in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amanofhonor-thefilm.com/index.php/the-cast/89-cms/130 |title=Jean-Claude Codsi Biography |publisher=Amanofhonor-thefilm.com |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Youssef Chahine's French-produced film, ''Destiny'', was shot on location in Lebanon, including the historic mountain town of in [[Beiteddine]].

While many films produced in the 1990s were hits at international festivals, Lebanese viewers were not drawn to the mainly war-themed films. An exception was ''[[West Beirut (film)]]'' (1998), which was a local and an international hit. It was not only the first Lebanese film, but also the first Arabic-language film to have general release in America.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Andrew. ''Pop Culture Arab World!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle'', page 115&lt;/ref&gt; The film, that received worldwide attention, was the first Lebanese film that the post-war generation in Lebanon actually saw in cinemas, and it ushered a new era in Lebanese filmmaking that historian, Lina Khatib calls a renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Khatib, Lina.

The '''cinema of Mongolia''' has been strongly influenced by the [[cinema of Russia]], which differentiates it from cinematic developments in the rest of Asia.

== History ==
It is assumed that the first cinematographic performances in [[Mongolia]] happened between 1903 and 1913, as private events for the prince [[Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren]] and the [[Jebtsundamba]] in the capital [[Ulan Bator|Urga]].

After the socialist revolution, the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] decided in its fifth congress of 1925 to use movies as an instrument of mass education. From 1926 on, mobile projection facilities would regularly show [[USSR|Soviet]] films to the Mongolian people. The first permanent cinema "Ard" ({{lang|mn|ард}}, ''people'') opened in the capital (now named [[Ulaanbaatar]]) in 1934. Eventually, every [[Aimags of Mongolia|aimag]] center would have fixed cinemas, and every [[sums of Mongolia]] or [[negdel]] would have a mobile cinema. In the 1990s, many cinemas, fixed and mobile alike, closed down or reduced activities.

=== Mongol Kino ===
The national film studios, ''Mongol Kino'', were founded in 1935, with Soviet technical assistance. Their first productions were a documentary on the "47th anniversary of the 1st May" and a fictional story named A Mongol son (''Mongol Khüü'') directed by the Russian [[Ilya Trauberg]] and Mongolian Demberel Baldan. The first Mongolian-directed movie was the black-and-white short feature Norjmaa's Destiny (''Norjmaagiin Zam'') by Baldan in 1938.

From then on, the Mongolian movie production focused around heroic revolutionary propaganda and ancient popular legends, still often under Russian direction. This program was very successful with movies like Sükhbaatar (1942) and Tsogt Taij (1945). The studios of Mongol Kino also produced documentaries and current news reports.

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
After World War II, the party moved the focus on working-class heroes, reflected in movies like New Year (''Shine Jil'', 1954) by Tseveeny Zandraa. Examples of this genre are Awakening (''Serelt'', 1957) by S. Genden and [[The Rejected Girl]] (''Gologdson khüükhen'') by Dendevyn Chimid-Osor. In 1955, the first musical comedy appeared, which started a trend that continued into the 1960s. The first color movie was The Golden Yurt (''Altan Örgöö'', 1961), based on a folktale. It was produced in cooperation with the [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] [[DEFA]] studios. The music of the film, written by L. Mördorj, was played and recorded by the GDR Radio orchestra and became a classic of the Mongolian [[symphony]]. As a fairy tale film, it is rich with [[match moving]] and other [[special effects]] of [[cinematography]].

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
While the production of documentaries increased, the fictional stories turned to everyday life in the 1970s. One of the most famous movies of that time, ''The Crystal Clear Tamir River'' (''Tungalag Tamir'', 1970) by Ravjagiin Dorjpalam, based on the novel by [[Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba]], is however set during Mongolia's 1921 revolution. Other well-known productions were "The Legend of the Mother Oasis" ("Ehe Bürdiin domog"), made in 1976 by Gombojav Jigjidsuren (Гомбожавын Жигжидсүрэн) and Jamyangiin Buntar (Жамъяангийн Бунтар), and The Five Colors of the Rainbow (''Solongiin tavan öngö'') in 1979. The Leading Wrestler [[Garuda]] (''Garid Magnai'', 1983) by [[Jamyangiin Buntar]] marks a turning point, where the authors liberate themselves from the existing power structures.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===
After the introduction of the market economy, most mobile and permanent cinemas closed down. Mongolian productions had to seek partners outside of the former [[Comecon|COMECON]]. However, some young filmmakers of the transformation period, such as N. Gankhuyag, B. Uranchimeg, J. Binder, made domestic success films.

The movie "Genghis Khan, Under Power of the Eternal Sky", starring [[Enkhtaivan Agvaantseren]] was the first Mongolian-Japanese co-production. [[State of Dogs]] (''Nokhoin Oron'', 1998) was written and directed collaboratively by the Belgian Peter Brosens and the Mongolian Dorjkhandyn Turmunkh.

The director [[Byambasuren Davaa]] has had international success with the German-Mongolian co-productions [[The Story of the Weeping Camel]] (2003, nominated for an [[Academy Award]] as a foreign documentary in 2005) and [[The Cave of the Yellow Dog]] (2005).

Elsnii Nuudel ({{lang-mn|Элсний нүүдэл}}, ''movement of sand''), was a successful movie produced for the domestic market in 2007. Later known films are Iim negen durlal, Goyoliin Daashinz, etc.

The 2008 historical film [[A Pearl in the Forest]] ({{lang-mn|Мойлхон}}) by director [[Enkhtaivan Agvaantseren]] is one of the first films to openly talk about events of the 1930s and the impact of the rise of [[Soviet communism]] on Mongolia. It is also one of the first films intended to present the history of the [[Buryats]], one of the ethnic groups present in Mongolia.

[[File:CEP1710-58.jpg|thumb|Two male Hybrid III crash test dummies inside a [[Subaru Outback]].]]

A '''crash test dummy''' is a full-scale anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the [[human body]], and is usually instrumented to record [[data]] about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The Crash Test Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury of a human being in an automobile crash.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This data can include variables such as [[velocity]] of impact, crushing [[force]], bending, folding, or [[torque]] of the body, and [[deceleration]] rates during a [[collision]] for use in [[crash test]]s. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over [[US$]]400,000.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/special-reports/smarter-crash-test-dummies|title=Smart Crash Test Dummies – The Latest Car Safety Tech – RoadandTrack.com|author=Nick Kurczewski|work=Road &amp; Track|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of U.S. regulation and [[Vehicle regulation|Global Technical Regulations]] and for clear communication in safety and seating design,&lt;ref name="rpoint"&gt;{{cite web

Crash test dummies remain indispensable in the development of  and [[ergonomics]] in all types of [[vehicle]]s, from [[automobile]]s to [[aircraft]].

There are many specialized dummies used for obesity, children, rib impact, and spinal impact. THOR is a very advanced dummy because it uses sensors and has a humanlike spine and pelvis.  Special classes of dummies called Hybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or rollovers. Hybrid IIIs use dummies that directed towards a specific age, for example, a typical ten year old, six year old, three year old, and a grown man.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are certain testing procedures for Hybrid IIIs to ensure that they obtain a correct humanlike neck flexure, and to ensure that they would react to a crash in a similar way that human bodies would. Using cadavers for these topics of research is more realistic than using a dummy for physiologic reasons, but it raises many moral dilemmas.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt;

Going across a moral ethics line, automobile companies have used a human cadaver, a pig, and people who have volunteered to be tested upon impact. A pig was used specifically for steering wheel impact because they have an internal structure similar to humans, and can be easily placed correctly via sitting up right in the vehicle.&lt;ref name="live animals3"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1980|title=Live Animals in Car Crash Studies|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=acwp_arte|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|pages=214–217|last1=Heneson|first1=Nancy|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human cadavers along with animals are not personally able to give consent to research studies, although animal testing is not prevalent today.&lt;ref name="new york" /&gt;

There are studies that use specific cadavers including obese cadavers, and children cadavers. Also, studies show how cadavers have been used to modify different parts of a car such as the seatbelt&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each new car that is made provides a different structural impact which provides the conclusion that cadavers and crash test dummies will be useful for a long time.

== History ==

On August 31, 1869, [[Mary Ward (scientist)|Mary Ward]] became the first recorded victim of an [[automobile accident]]; the car involved was steam-powered ([[Karl Benz]] did not invent the gasoline-powered automobile until 1886). Ward, of [[Parsonstown, Ireland]], was thrown out of a motor vehicle and killed.&lt;ref name="OHAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offalyhistory.com/content/reading_resources/famous_people/ward_mary.htm |title=Mary Ward 1827–1869 |work=Famous Offaly People |publisher=Offaly Historical &amp; Archaeological Society |accessdate=April 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051623/http://www.offalyhistory.com/content/reading_resources/famous_people/ward_mary.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirty years later, on September 13, 1899, [[Henry Bliss (road accident victim)|Henry Bliss]] became [[North America]]'s first motor vehicle fatality when hit while stepping off a [[New York City]] [[tram|trolley]]. Since then, over 20 million people worldwide have died due to motor vehicle accidents.{{synthesis inline|date=May 2011}}

The need for a means of analyzing and mitigating the effects of motor vehicle accidents on humans was felt soon after commercial production of automobiles began in the late 1890s, and by the 1930s, when the automobile became a common part of daily life and the number of motor vehicle deaths were rising. Death rates had surpassed 15.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-miles and were continuing to climb.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 1930 cars had [[dashboard]]s of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against the interior of the automobile or through the [[windshield]]. The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, [[List of automobile manufacturers|car manufacturers]] were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Cadaver testing===
[[File:B11510P002.jpg|thumb|Cadaver used during a frontal impact test.]]
[[Detroit]]'s [[Wayne State University]] was the first to begin serious work on collecting data on the effects of high-speed collisions on the human body. In the late 1930s there was no reliable data on how the human body responds to the sudden, violent forces acting on it in an automobile accident. Furthermore, no effective tools existed to measure such responses.
[[Biomechanics]] was a field barely in its infancy. It was therefore necessary to employ two types of test subjects in order to develop initial data sets.

The first test subjects were human [[cadaver]]s. They were used to obtain fundamental information about the human body's ability to withstand the crushing and tearing forces typically experienced in a high-speed accident. To such an end, steel [[ball bearing]]s were dropped on [[human skull|skulls]], and bodies were dumped down unused [[elevator]] shafts onto steel plates. Cadavers fitted with crude [[accelerometer]]s were strapped into automobiles and subjected to head-on collisions and vehicle rollovers.

Albert King's 1995 ''Journal of Trauma'' article, "Humanitarian Benefits of Cadaver Research on Injury Prevention", clearly states the value in human lives saved as a result of cadaver research. King's calculations indicate that as a result of design changes implemented up to 1987, cadaver research since saved 8,500 lives annually.&lt;ref&gt;King, A.I., Viano, D.C., Mizeres, N., &amp; States, J. D. (1995). Humanitarian benefits of cadaver research on injury prevention. ''Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection &amp; Critical Care,'' ''38''(4) 564-569. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/toc/1995/04000&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that for every cadaver used, each year 61 people survive due to wearing [[seat belt]]s, 147 live due to [[air bag]]s, and 68 survive windshield impact.

However, work with cadavers presented almost as many problems as it resolved. Not only were there the [[morals|moral]] and [[ethics|ethical]] issues related to working with the dead, but there were also research concerns. The majority of cadavers available were older [[White people|white]] adults who had died non-violent deaths; they did not represent a [[demography|demographic]] cross-section of accident victims. Deceased accident victims could not be employed because any data that might be collected from such experimental subjects would be compromised by the cadaver's previous injuries. Since no two cadavers are the same, and since any specific part of a cadaver could only be used once, it was extremely difficult to achieve reliable comparison data. In addition, child cadavers were not only difficult to obtain, but both legal and [[public opinion]] made them effectively unusable. Moreover, as crash testing became more routine, suitable cadavers became increasingly scarce. As a result, [[biometric]] data were limited in extent and skewed toward the older males.

Very little attention has been paid to obesity and car crash studies, and it is hard to obtain an obese dummy for the experiment. Instead, human cadavers were used. Body weight is a vital factor when it comes to automobile accidents, and body mass is distributed differently in an obese person versus a non-obese person.&lt;ref name="cushion" /&gt; At the University of Michigan, obese cadavers were tested and compared to non-obese cadavers, and they found that the obese cadavers had more injuries in their lower extremities. The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a "cushioning effect." &lt;ref name="cushion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kent|first1=Richard|title=Is There Really a "Cushion Effect"?: A Biomechanical Investigation of Crash Injury Mechanisms in the Obese|date=2010|volume=18|issue=4|pages=749–753|url=http://za2uf4ps7f.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Is+There+Really+a+%22Cushion+Effect%22%3F%3A+A+Biomechanical+Investigation+of+Crash+Injury+Mechanisms+in+the+Obese&amp;rft.jtitle=Obesity&amp;rft.au=Richard+W+Kent&amp;rft.au=Jason+L+Forman&amp;rft.au=Ola+Bostrom&amp;rft.date=2010-04-01&amp;rft.pub=Blackwell+Publishing+Ltd&amp;rft.issn=1930-7381&amp;rft.eissn=1930-739X&amp;rft.volume=18&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=749&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1038%2Foby.2009.315&amp;rft.externalDocID=2724975811&amp;paramdict=en-US|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of NDTs or Neutral Density Targets were implemented inside Cadavers brains to focus on the impact and separation of the brain and skull. NDTs provided detailed observations and allowed researchers to look at a specific area of the brain after the crash stimulation. It also helped to establish and develop the FE model. To measure neck injuries for three year olds, the model FE was created. A real child's neck was interpreted and incorporated into the FE model. There are only a few FE models and they were mostly utilized through sled tests.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren N.|first=Hardy|date=2007|title=A Study of the Response of the Human Cadaver Head to Impact|pmc=2474809|journal=Stapp car crash|doi=|pmid=18278591|ref=NCBI|volume=51|pages=17–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteer testing===

Some researchers took it upon themselves to serve as crash test dummies.

Salon.com. Retrieved November 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting that it made him "a little sore", Patrick has said that the research he and his students conducted was seminal in developing [[mathematical model]]s against which further research could be compared. But while data from live testing was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests which went past a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of subject.

===Animal testing===

By the mid-1950s, the bulk of the information cadaver testing could provide had been harvested. It was also necessary to collect data on accident survivability, research for which cadavers were woefully inadequate. In concert with the shortage of cadavers, this need forced researchers to seek other models. A description by [[Mary Roach]] of the ''Eighth Stapp Car Crash and Field Demonstration Conference'' shows the direction in which research had begun to move. "We saw [[chimpanzee]]s riding rocket sleds, a [[bear]] on an impact swing...We observed a [[pig]], [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] and placed in a sitting position on the swing in the harness, crashed into a deep-dish steering wheel at about 10 mph."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/health/col/roac/1999/11/19/crash_test/index1.html I was a human crash-test dummy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125034009/http://archive.salon.com/health/col/roac/1999/11/19/crash_test/index1.html |date=November 25, 2005 }} (November 19, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

One important research objective which could not be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement on the steering column. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from [[steering wheel]] impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the early 1960s of the collapsible steering column cut the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.

The ability to sit upright was an important requirement for test animals in order that another common fatal injury among human victims, [[decapitation]], could be studied. Additionally, it was important for researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a [[dashboard]] with too little padding or padding which was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. [[Rear-view mirror]] impact is a significant occurrence in a frontal collision; how should a mirror be built so that it is both rigid enough to perform its task and yet of low injury risk if struck.

While work with cadavers had aroused some opposition, primarily from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no [[pain]], and the indignity of their situations was directly related to easing the pain of the living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]] were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marshall|first1=Tyler|title=Auto Safety Crash Testing Ignites Furor : Germany: The program uses human bodies. U.S. tests using cadavers at 3 universities are disclosed.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/news/mn-60691_1_safety-tests|accessdate=15 February 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=25 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although animal test data were still more easily obtained than cadaver data, the fact that animals were not people and the difficulty of employing adequate internal instrumentation limited their usefulness. Animal testing is no longer practiced by any of the major automobile makers; [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] discontinued live testing in 1993 and other manufacturers followed suit shortly thereafter.

In 1980, the use of animals such as bears and pigs were tested in car stimulation crashes. This led to moral dilemmas and was not the first time that animals were used in car crashes. In 1978, The University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute used baboons to be tested as a substitute for humans in car crashes. Although there was the objection of animal cruelty that arose, there was also the controversy of how they are similar to humans and can be used as a sufficient testing substitution for us.&lt;ref name="live animals" /&gt; The researchers did not end up stopping the use of baboons because of moral objections, but instead stopped because they found sufficient data.  The moral inputs from other people and organizations were inconsistent, which caused implications when deciding to ban healthy animals from research testing. The animals were put under anesthesia, so there was no pain put upon them, but the aftereffects can not justify this.&lt;ref name="live animals"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heneson|first1=Nancy|title=Live Animals in Car Crash Studies|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|date=1980|pages=214–217|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=acwp_arte|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Motors corporation used animals for testing, and also suggested that they put the animals under anesthesia and then would kill the animals after the testing is complete.&lt;ref name="new york"&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/28/us/19000-animals-killed-in-automotive-crash-tests.html|accessdate=26 March 2016|date=September 28, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was suggested that this is not the reason why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars.&lt;ref name="live animals" /&gt; Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement. In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being. The disadvantage though to using an instrumental dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as, for an example, a live animal.&lt;ref name="live animals" /&gt; Today, it is not common to see animals being tested upon for automobile accidents because of the advance in computers and technology.&lt;ref name="new york" /&gt; It is, although, difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families, especially with children. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is a competent person and one who also comprehends the research and testing procedures fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chung|first1=Christine S.|last2=Lehmann|first2=Lisa Soleymani|title=Informed Consent and the Process of Cadaver Donation|journal=Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine|date=August 2002|volume=126|pages=964–968.|url=http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-9985(2002)126%3C0964:ICATPO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=24 April 2016|doi=10.1043/0003-9985(2002)126&lt;0964:ICATPO&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dummy evolution==

===Sierra Sam and VIP-50===
[[File:sam4.jpg|thumbnail|upright|150px|Sierra Sam tested [[ejection seat]]s.]]
The information gleaned from cadaver research and animal studies had already been put to some use in the construction of human [[simulacrum|simulacra]] as early as 1949, when "Sierra Sam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contrails.iit.edu/history/Roswell/index.html|title=Collection - History - Roswell|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529182257/http://contrails.iit.edu/History/Roswell/index.html|archivedate=29 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by [[Samuel W. Alderson]] at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) and Sierra Engineering Co. to test aircraft [[ejection seat]]s, aviation helmets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA061799&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Evaluation of Sierra Engineering Co. Lightweight Helmet]&lt;/ref&gt; and pilot restraint harnesses. This testing involved the use of high acceleration to 1000&amp;nbsp;km/h (600&amp;nbsp;mph) rocket sleds, beyond the capability of human volunteers to tolerate. In the early 1950s, Alderson and Grumman produced a dummy which was used to conduct crash tests in both motor vehicles and aircraft. The original "Sierra Sam" was a 95th percentile male dummy (heavier and taller than 95% of human males).

Alderson went on to produce what it called the VIP-50 series, built specifically for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], but which was also adopted by the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. Sierra followed up with a competitor dummy, a model it called "Sierra Stan".

===Hybrid I and II===
[[File:HS117-399.jpg|thumb|left|Two uninstrumented Hybrid II 50th percentile male dummies used as ballast in a low speed collision test.]]

General Motors, who had taken over the impetus in developing a reliable and durable dummy, found neither Sierra model satisfied its needs. GM engineers decided to combine the best features of the VIP series and Sierra Stan, and so in 1971 Hybrid I was born.
Hybrid I was what is known as a "50th [[percentile]] male" dummy. That is to say, it modeled an average male in height, mass, and proportion. In cooperation with the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE), GM shared this design, and a subsequent 5th percentile female dummy, with its competitors.

Since then, considerable work has gone into creating more and more sophisticated dummies. Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation. Hybrid II became the first dummy to comply with the American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for testing of automotive lap and shoulder belts. In 1973, a 50th percentile male dummy was released, and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov |title=NHTSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertook an agreement with [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] to produce a model exceeding Hybrid II's performance in a number of specific areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/pdf/49cfr572.31.pdf NHTSA 49 CFR 572.31 Subpart E—Hybrid III Test Dummy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a great improvement over cadavers for standardized testing purposes, Hybrid I and Hybrid II were still very crude, and their use was limited to developing and testing [[seat belt]] designs. A dummy was needed which would allow researchers to explore injury-reduction strategies. It was this need that pushed GM researchers to develop the current Hybrid line, the Hybrid III family of crash test dummies.

===Hybrid III family===
[[File:Hybridlll.jpg|thumbnail|The original 50th percentile male Hybrid III's family expanded to include a 95th percentile male, 5th percentile female, and ten, six, and three-year-old child dummies.]]
{{main article|Hybrid III}}
Hybrid III, the 50th percentile male dummy which made its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, and he is now a family man. If he could stand upright, he would be 175&amp;nbsp;cm (5'9") tall and would have a [[mass]] of 77&amp;nbsp;kg (170&amp;nbsp;lb). He occupies the driver's seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org|title=New HLDI study: Texting laws don't reduce crashes |publisher=iihs.org |date=September 28, 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 65&amp;nbsp;km/h (40&amp;nbsp;mph) offset frontal crash tests. He is joined by a "big brother", the 95th percentile Hybrid III, at 188&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;ft 2 in) and 100&amp;nbsp;kg (223&amp;nbsp;lb). [[Ms.]] Hybrid III is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive 152&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 50&amp;nbsp;kg (110&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref&gt;Mello, Tara Baukus (December 5, 2000).[http://www.edmunds.com/apps/vdpcontainers/do/vdp/articleId=43819/pageNumber=1 The Female Dummy: No Brains, But A Real Lifesaver]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220103359/http://www.edmunds.com/apps/vdpcontainers/do/vdp/articleId%3D43819/pageNumber%3D1 |date=February 20, 2006 }}. Retrieved April 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The three Hybrid III child dummies represent a ten-year-old, 21&amp;nbsp;kg (47&amp;nbsp;lb) six-year-old, and a 15&amp;nbsp;kg (33&amp;nbsp;lb) three-year-old. The child models are very recent additions to the crash test dummy family; because so little hard data are available on the effects of accidents on children and such data are very difficult to obtain, these models are based in large part on [[Estimation theory|estimates]] and [[approximation]]s.  The primary benefit provided by the Hybrid III is improved neck response in forward flexion and head rotation that better simulates the human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA255544&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Hybrid II and Hybrid III Dummy Neck Properties for Computer Modeling] (February 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hybrid III dummy for three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, and does not provide the same physical outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When using data from the real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wencheng|first=Zhang|date=2008|title=Incorporation of Biomechanical Child Cadaver Neck Behaviour in a Child Model and Injury Prediction in Vehicle Frontal Crash|url=http://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/1684087861/fmt/ai/rep/SPDF?hl=&amp;cit%3Aauth=Zhang%2C+Wencheng&amp;cit%3Atitle=Incorporation+of+biomechanical+child+cadaver+neck+behaviour+in+a+...&amp;cit%3Apub=ProQuest+Dissertations+and+Theses&amp;cit%3Avol=&amp;cit%3Aiss=&amp;cit%3Apg=n%2Fa&amp;cit%3Adate=2008&amp;ic=true&amp;cit%3Aprod=ProQuest&amp;_a=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%3D%3D&amp;_s=ddkty0oDMV9mj9BgOEUwv63yBlM%3D|journal=|publisher=Heritage Branch|doi=|pmid=|access-date=18 April 2016|ref=Hybrid III}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Warrior Injury Assessment Mannequin (WIAMan) ===

WIAMan is a blast test dummy designed to assess potential skeletal injuries of soldiers exposed to under-body blast (UBB). Designed jointly by the U.S. Army and Diversified Technical Systems (DTS), the project includes an anthropomorphic test device and in-dummy data acquisition and sensor solution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2017/05/31/army-creates-crash-test-dummy-to-improve-vehicle-safety-for-soldiers/|title=Army creates crash test dummy to improve vehicle safety for soldiers|last=Kalinyak|first=Rachael|date=2017-08-07|work=Army Times|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the project started in February 2015, two generations of WIAMan prototypes have undergone a series of lab tests and blast events in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aerodefensetech.com/component/content/article/adt/features/articles/27963|title=WIAMan - Tech Briefs :: Aerospace &amp; Defense Technology|last=Group|first=Techbriefs Media|website=www.aerodefensetech.com|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the prototype’s delivery in 2018, WIAMan evaluates the effects of under-body blasts involving vehicles, and assess the risk to soldiers in ground vehicle systems. The goal of the WIAMan project is to acquire data that will improve the design of military vehicles and personal protective equipment. WIAMan and the platform created to simulate an IED explosion are undergoing continued testing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Test dummies of the past were intended for the auto industry and lacked the same response a human would have to explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=2965|title=WIAMan program celebrates milestone {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge for the Army has been to develop a crash test dummy that moves enough like a human body to get an accurate result. The Army is working to make the mannequin "biofedelic," meaning it can match human movement. At 5-feet-11-inches tall and 185 lbs., WIAMan is based on the size and movement of an average soldier.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] and its partners at [[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab]] completed biofidelity testing in 2017. The purpose of the testing was to develop a dummy capable of predicting specific injury risk to occupants in a vehicle during live-fire tests, based on human response data.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The manikin supports up to 146 channels of data acquisition, measuring different variables a soldier may experience in a vehicle blast. WIAMan includes self-contained internal power and the world’s smallest data acquisition system, called SLICE NANO architecture, eliminating the huge mass of sensor cables normally exiting dummies. The data measured within WIAMan includes forces, movements, accelerations and angular velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dtsweb.com/products/dtswiamanatd.php|title=Data Acquisition Systems &amp; Sensors for Product Testing - Diversified Technical Systems, Inc.|website=dtsweb.com|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing procedure==
[[File:B09717P006.jpg|thumb|Hybrid III undergoing calibration]]
Every Hybrid III undergoes calibration prior to a crash test. Its head is removed and is dropped from 40 centimetres to test calibrate the head instrumentation. Then the head and neck are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure. Hybrids wear [[chamois leather]] skin; the knees are struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture. Finally, the head and neck are attached to the body, which is attached to a test platform and struck violently in the chest by a heavy pendulum to ensure that the [[human rib cage|rib]]s bend and flex as they should.

When the dummy has been determined to be ready for testing, calibration marks are fastened to the side of the head to aid researchers when slow-motion [[film]]s are reviewed later. The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on either the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the [[ankle]], record between 30&amp;nbsp;000 and 35&amp;nbsp;000 data items in a typical 100–150&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond]] crash. Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's [[chest]], these data are downloaded to [[computer]] once the test is complete.

Because the Hybrid is a standardized data collection device, any part of a particular Hybrid type is interchangeable with any other. Not only can one dummy be tested several times, but if a part should fail, it can be replaced with a new part. A fully instrumented dummy is worth about [[Euro|€]]150,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crash.citroenz.biz/how-tests-r-done.html How the Test are done] (19 March 2003). Retrieved April 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positioning and restraints ===
[[File:V05265P096.jpg|thumb|10-year old Hybrid III dummy in a booster seat after a frontal [[crash test]].]]
Children in the three-year old age group are more likely to have a fatality because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Specialized dummies===
Hybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or [[rollover]]s. After head-on collisions, the most common severe injury accident is the side impact.

[[File:V06586P040.jpg|thumb|WorldSID is an advanced side impact ATD, used for EuroNCAP side impact test modes.]]

*The '''SID''' (Side Impact Dummy) family of test dummies is designed to measure rib, [[human vertebral column|spine]], and internal organ effects in side collisions. It also assesses spine and rib deceleration and compression of the chest cavity. SID is the United States government testing standard, EuroSID is used in [[Europe]] to ensure compliance with safety standards, and SID II(s) represents a 5th-percentile female. BioSID is a more sophisticated version of SID and EuroSID,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} but is not used in a regulatory capacity.  The WorldSID is a project to develop a new generation of dummy under the [[International Organization for Standardization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn68l9aQXfK1uFyST20ErcQ|title=SciTech Connect: Anthropometry for WorldSID, a World-Harmonized Midsize Male Side Impact Crash Dummy|author=S. Moss|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''BioRID''' is a dummy designed to assess the effects of a rear impact. Its primary purpose is to research [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]], and to aid designers in developing effective head and neck restraints. BioRID is more sophisticated in its spinal construction than Hybrid; 24 [[vertebra]] simulators allow BioRID to assume a much more natural seating posture, and to demonstrate the neck movement and configuration seen in rear-end collisions.

*'''CRABI''' is a child dummy used to evaluate the effectiveness of child restraint devices, including [[seat belt]]s and [[air bag]]s. There are three models of the CRABI, representing 18-month, 12-month, and 6-month-old children.
*'''FGOA''' is a [http://ircobi.org/downloads/irc15/pdf_files/57.pdf first generation obese anthropometric test device] which can be used to study the automotive safety challenges for obese occupants, who are believed to have higher risk of mortality in automobile collisions comparing to non-obese occupants.

*'''THOR''' is an advanced 50th percentile male dummy. The successor of Hybrid III, THOR has a more human-like spine and [[human pelvis|pelvis]], and its [[face]] contains a number of sensors which allow analysis of facial impacts to an accuracy currently unobtainable with other dummies. THOR's range of sensors is also greater in quantity and sensitivity than those of Hybrid III.  THOR's original manufacturer, GESAC Inc., ceased production after the slowdown of the auto industry in the late 2000s. THOR was being further developed, and two other companies were working on similar dummies; NHTSA's ultimate goal for this government-funded project was the development of a single THOR dummy, but THOR dummy development stopped. FTSS, bought by Humanetics, and DentonATD both continued to produce the THOR LX and THOR FLX.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Popular culture==
* In the 1980s the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), a division of the [[United States Department of Transportation]] launched a series of [[public service announcement]]s in [[magazine]]s and on [[television]] featuring the antics of two talking crash dummies named Vince (voiced by [[Jack Burns]]) and Larry (voiced by [[Lorenzo Music]]) who modeled [[seat belt]] safety practices through their [[slapstick]] antics, with the slogan "You Could Learn a Lot from a Dummy". Since then crash dummy characters have continued to be used in seat belt safety campaigns, especially those aimed at children.
* In the early 1990s [[Tyco Toys]] created a line of [[action figure]]s called ''[[The Incredible Crash Dummies]]'' based on the characters from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart at the touch of a button on their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, ''[[The Incredible Crash Dummies (film)|The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies]]''. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D [[computer animation]] techniques. A comic book series and a [[video game]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Game Boy]] were produced.
* In 2004 a series of "Crash Dummies" animated shorts were commissioned for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX network]]. Related toys from [[Mattel]]'s [[Hot Wheels]] brand were produced.
* The television series ''[[MythBusters]]'' employs a crash test dummy, "[[Buster (Mythbusters)|Buster]]", for dangerous experiments.
* In [[Discovery Kids]] children's educational series ''[[Crash Test Danny]]'' the title character is a living crash test dummy, played by Ben Langley, who gets crushed, blown up, and pulled apart in the name of science.

'''''Death Race''''' is a 2008 [[science fiction action film|science fiction action]]&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; film co-produced, written and directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]. It stars [[Jason Statham]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ian McShane]] and [[Joan Allen]].

Though referred to as a remake of the 1975 film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' (based on [[Ib Melchior]]'s short story "The Racer") in reviews and marketing materials, director Paul W. S. Anderson stated in the DVD commentary that he thought of the film as something of a [[prequel]].

A remake had been in development since 2002, though production was delayed by disapproval of early [[screenplay]]s, then placed in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] following a dispute between [[Paramount Pictures]] and the producer duo [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Paula Wagner]] (the latter was the producer without Cruise in the film). ''Death Race'' was acquired by [[Universal Studios]], and Anderson re-joined the project to write and direct. Filming began in [[Montreal]] in August 2007, and the completed project was released on August 22, 2008. The film received negative reviews from critics.

Three direct-to-video films in the series were then released: ''[[Death Race 2]]'' (2010), ''[[Death Race 3: Inferno]]'' (2013) and ''[[Death Race: Beyond Anarchy]]'' (2018).

== Plot ==
In 2012, the collapse of the US economy and the subsequent increase in crime rates leads to the rise of privatized prisons. One such prison is Terminal Island Penitentiary, whose warden, Claire Hennessey, earns her profits by broadcasting a modern gladiator game participated in by the prisoners. In the game "Death Race", the racers, along with their navigators, compete in a three-part race over three days on a closed track. The track is littered with pressure plates that activate either the cars' offensive weapons, defensive equipment or deadly traps. Any racer winning five races will be granted freedom.

Towards the end of one race, a masked driver nicknamed [[Frankenstein (Death Race)|Frankenstein]] is nearing the finish line, pursued by his rival Machine Gun Joe. His navigator, Case, reports that all his defensive equipment have malfunctioned. Against her protest, Frankenstein refuses to let Joe finish first. Case ejects herself out of the car just before Joe destroys it (as it crosses the finish line).

Industrial worker, ex-con and former [[NASCAR]] driver Jensen Ames struggles to support his family. When the steel mill he works at is closed, he and his fellow angry workers are attacked by the arriving [[riot police]], forcing them to fight back. He returns home to his wife and their new-born daughter, Piper. A masked assailant knocks him unconscious. Jensen wakes up with a bloodied knife in hand, his wife  dead nearby, and policemen storming into his home and arresting him. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while Piper is placed in foster care.

Six months later, Jensen is transferred to Terminal Island Prison. He immediately gets into a fight with Pachenko and his [[Aryan Brotherhood]] gang. Hennessey's right-hand man Ulrich calls Jensen to her office. She tells him that Frankenstein died from his injuries after the previous race, and offers to let Jensen go free if he impersonates Frankenstein to win one more race (as Frankenstein had already won four). Jensen accepts the offer and meets Frankenstein's maintenance crew consisting of Coach, Gunner, and Lists, who explain the main reason she needs Jensen is that the profits and audience of "Death Race" has halved since Frankenstein's "disappearance". They also inform him of his cars capabilities, his opponents, the navigators (and his), and that Hennessey has had an entire cell block of the prison kept away from everyone else as they have been building something big on her orders.

On Day 1, Jensen meets his navigator Case. Jensen's cars defensive equipment again mysteriously malfunctions. Under attack by Travis Colt, one of the other competitors, Jensen improvises and spills napalm over Colt's car, and has Case ignite it with the cigarette lighter. Colt's car is then run into by Machine Gun Joe's. Jensen is distracted and hit by Joe when Pachenko does the same hand gesture at him as the masked assailant (making Jensen realize it was Pachenko that killed his wife), coming in last place. Day 1 ends with three racers dead (Siad, Grimm, and Colt) and six remaining. After a conversation with Hennessey and another fight with Pachenko, Jensen deduces that Hennessey ordered Pachenko to frame Jensen, so she can have a replacement for Frankenstein.

On Day 2, the team go to the workshop to find the concealed section open with a gaping hole as they wonder what was in here. As the race begins, Jensen confronts Case about the malfunctions. Case admits she sabotaged Frankenstein's car to keep him from winning and leaving Death Race, in exchange for her [[pardon|release papers]], but that he was only supposed to lose and that he won the last race at the cost of his life. Jensen tricks Pachenko into crashing, then leaves his car and kills Pachenko by snapping his neck. Hennessey then unleashes the Dreadnought, a newly-built heavily armed 18-wheel tanker, to thin out the racers and boost ratings. The Dreadnought kills three more racers (Carson, Riggins, and 14K), leaving only Frankenstein and Joe alive. Jensen contacts Joe and the two work together to trigger a trap which destroys the Dreadnought, much to Hennessey's shock and anger.

Aware that he knows her angle, Hennessey asks Jensen to consider staying and racing as Frankenstein, in exchange for a life of comfort compared to attempting to put his old life back together, but he refuses. She orders Ulrich to plant a bomb under his car in case he wins, knowing that she can always find another person to impersonate Frankenstein. Knowing Hennessey has no intention of letting him go (and figuring out that no one will ever win five races, as sooner or later they all get killed), Jensen plans an escape and talks to Joe.

On the final race, Hennessey deliberately keeps Jensen from activating his weapons and allows Joe to activate his. Jensen, Case and Joe destroy and drive through a weakened wall, discovered by examining footage of the first race, and head for the bridge to the mainland. Hennessey activates the bomb, not knowing that it was removed and neutralized by Coach. As a furious Hennessey dispatches attack helicopters, the cars wreck the pursuing police cruisers, making it to the mainland and split up, and the helicopters follow Jensen's car under Hennessey's orders. Case reveals that she had already received her release papers. She wears Frankenstein's costume, and Jensen jumps out of the car before the helicopters corner her. Case is captured while Joe and Jensen escape on a freight train.

Hennessey, although furious about the losses, is happy about re-capturing "Frankenstein" and the race's success via ratings. She opens a congratulatory present, only to find the bomb she had planted on Jensen's car. Coach, the sender, detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey and Ulrich along with the media room. He then turns to the camera and, breaking the [[fourth wall]],  states "Damn, I love this game".

With Hennessey and Ulrich's deaths, the future of Death Race becomes uncertain. Six months later, Joe and Jensen, reunited with Piper, are shown working in [[Mexico]] as mechanics as they escaped across the border, and are soon reunited with Case.

==Production==
In March 2005, following the success of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004), director Paul W. S. Anderson revealed that he was directing a remake of ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' (1975) entitled ''Death Race 3000'' at [[Paramount Pictures]] based on a script by [[J. F. Lawton]]. The remake would be produced by the producer pair [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Paula Wagner]]. Anderson described the remake as a riff on the first film. "It's not a straight remake at all. The first movie was an across-America race. This will be an around-the-world race. And it's set further in the future, so the cars are even more futuristic.

Two years later, [[Roger Corman]], the producer of ''Death Race 2000'', elaborated that he had an option agreement with producer Tom Cruise, and that Cruise would portray the lead role. The director said that Cruise had not been happy with the first two screenplays and that a third one was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Calum Waddell | url=http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2513 | title=August 17: Roger Corman's DEATH RACE 3000 update | publisher=[[Fangoria]] | date= | accessdate=September 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024033455/http://fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2513 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2006, producer [[Jeremy Bolt]] reported that Anderson would direct the remake of ''Death Race 2000'' after completing ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' (2007). The producer described the remake's new tone: "We've basically taken the idea of reality television and extended it twenty years. So it's definitely a comment on society, and particularly reality television, but it is not as much a parody or a satire as the original. It's more straight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Stax | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/715/715319p1.html | title=''Castlevania'', ''Death Race'' Buzz | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=June 28, 2006 | accessdate=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following August, Paramount [[Tom Cruise#Breakup with Paramount|ended its relationship]] with [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]], and ''Death Race'' was placed in turnaround. According to reports, when the project was discovered available, [[Universal Studios]] acquired it. Cruise and Wagner resumed their roles as producers, and Anderson returned to write and direct the film.&lt;ref name="seat"&gt;{{cite news | author=Borys Kit | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i22635e34795b668127ee9d387623c7d7 | title=Statham in 'Death Race' driver's seat | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=April 23, 2007 | accessdate=September 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070815154157/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i22635e34795b668127ee9d387623c7d7 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, actor [[Jason Statham]] entered negotiations to star in ''Death Race'', with production slated to begin in late summer or early fall.&lt;ref name="seat" /&gt;  Anderson described that ''Death Race'' would take place in a prison, and that the film would be "super-violent" like its predecessor. "It has little echoes of the original – a lot of people get run down, but rather than having the points system, which had no pay off anyway, it's a pure race. It's more like ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', with the last person standing – or driving, winning," explained the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.totalfilm.com/movie_news/paul_ws_anderson_talks_death_race | title=Paul WS Anderson talks Death Race | publisher=[[Total Film]] | date=July 31, 2007 | accessdate=September 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filming on ''Death Race'' began in [[Montreal]] in August 2007.&lt;ref name="buckle"&gt;{{cite news | author=Borys Kit | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i4d705b8469ab9fb88647a7efd12f71cc | title=Buckle up: Allen joins Uni's 'Race' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=August 8, 2007 | accessdate=September 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930215906/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i4d705b8469ab9fb88647a7efd12f71cc &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deer Avenger''''' is a series of video games about a deer who hunts humans. It was developed by [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive]] and [[Hypnotix]]. It is a parody of typical hunting games, specifically ''[[Deer Hunter (video game)|Deer Hunter]]''.

==Games==
* ''Deer Avenger''
* ''Deer Avenger 2: Deer in the City''
* ''Deer Avenger 3D''
* ''Deer Avenger: Stag Party''
* ''Deer Avenger: Open Season''
* ''Deer Avenger 4: The Rednecks Strike Back''

==Bambo==
The protagonist of the game is a deer named Bambo, a [[portmanteau]] of the action hero [[John Rambo|Rambo]] and the [[Disney]] character [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]]. He is a [[bipedalism|bipedal]] deer who hunts humans in a fashion similar to typical deer hunting in order to avenge all deer hunted by humans. Bambo mounts the heads of humans he kills on a wall in his cabin. He can tote a vast array of weapons ranging from [[slingshot]]s to [[machine guns]]. He is voiced by [[Brian McCann (actor)|Brian McCann]], who frequently appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.

In the first three games, Bambo had a sleek [[physical attractiveness|physique]] with a bandana tied around his forehead, a forest green hunting vest, and an ammo [[bandolier]]. However, in the fourth game, Bambo was given a broad-shouldered, muscular physique. The cause for this change was never explained.

Bambo is very crude and crass, often farting, and yelling obscenities and stereotypical jokes at his prey. He also is very sexually inclined, and is often portrayed having sex with a [[deer|doe]].

Starting with ''Deer Avenger 3D'', polygon characters are used.

In the fourth edition of the game, as Bubba, now an angel, floats to Heaven he states will be back in ''Deer Avenger 5''. However, a fifth game has yet to be made.

''Deer Avenger: Stag Party'' is a box set containing the first two games in the series.

''Deer Avenger: Open Season'' is a compilation of the first three games in the series.

'''''The War of Genesis''''' ({{lang-ko|창세기전}}) is a [[Tactical role-playing game|SRPG]] series developed by Softmax. The series follows the history of Antaria, a fictional universe where the story is taking place. Even though the developers had stated that the third and fourth installments were spin-offs, they follow the main storyline and have many elements that are essential in understanding the stories of the later games. The Side Stories have a rather different gameplay than that of the original. In contrast to the original games' use of the SRPG type of gameplay, Rhapsody of Zephyr uses classical Japanese RPG style similar to that of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Tempest also uses different gameplay. In addition to battles, there are mini-games and simulation elements as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

''Magna Carta: Crimson Stigmata'' is a "port" of the original game to the [[PlayStation 2]]. Though the game retains multiple elements from its original counterpart, including the main character and several plot elements, other points in ''Crimson Stigmata''—notably the setting and storyline—are very different from ''The Phantom of Avalanche''.&lt;ref name="mc-tob-website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlus.com/magna_carta/|title=Magna Carta: Tears of Blood|work=atlus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Electra Teletext sample.jpg|thumb|260px|Screenshot of Electra's front page from 1985.]]
'''Electra''' was a [[teletext]] service in the [[United States]] that was in operation from the early 1980s up until 1993, when it was shut down due to a lack of funding, and discontinuation of teletext-capable television sets by the only US television manufacturer offering teletext capability at the time, [[Zenith Electronics Corporation|Zenith]].  It was owned, operated and maintained by [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]-based [[Taft Broadcasting]] (specifically at their flagship station, [[WKRC-TV]], which had debuted the service in their area first) and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]-based [[Satellite Syndicated Systems]] ([[Satellite Syndicated Systems|SSS]]), in cooperation with  cable/satellite TV station Superstation WTBS (now [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]), who carried Electra's data on their [[VBI]] (WTBS was in turn owned by [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which would purchase the [[Hanna-Barbera]] animation studio, and most shows from sister company [[Ruby-Spears]], from Taft successor Great American Broadcasting in 1991; Turner is now part of [[Time Warner]]).

Electra was America's answer to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ceefax]] or [[ORACLE (teletext)|ORACLE]] systems, providing news headlines, weather, entertainment/lifestyle info, and other information.  Electra used the [[World System Teletext]] (WST) protocol, the same protocol used by Ceefax and ORACLE, as well as by other teletext services in the rest of the [[Europe]]an continent.

Electra was one of the very few [[United States|American]] [[teletext]] services in operation. A few other services were offered by some large-market TV stations in the US throughout the 1980s, such as ''Metrotext'' from [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]] and ''KeyFax'' from [[WFLD]] in [[Chicago]].

Electra also carried another teletext service on its higher-numbered pages, a service called ''Tempo''.  Tempo mainly carried sports (and other miscellaneous) information on its pages.

At the time of Electra's closing in 1993, it was the only existing teletext service in the USA.

'''Embryo''' is a [[3D graphic|3D]] first-person [[shoot 'em up]] video game released in 1994 for [[Commodore Amiga]]. It was developed by [[Croatia]]n developer [[Beyond Arts]] and published by [[Black Legend (software publisher)|Black Legend]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/tomcat/yu/Amiga/SCANS/CUAmigaSep94_61.jpg CU Amiga WIP, September 1994 Tony Dillon]&lt;/ref&gt; The player assumes the role of a pilot who manns an advanced fighter in order to drive the aliens invading the Earth away. The game bears semblance to [[Combat flight simulator|flight simulation game]]s, but is described as pure mayhem without any emphasis on realism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/tomcat/yu/Amiga/SCANS/CUAmigaMay94_55.jpg CU Amiga, May 1994, First Impressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The aircraft can be steered with either the mouse, joystick or keyboard, whereas the player also uses buttons on the keyboard or mouse to manage weapons and flight controls. Weapons include cannons, guided and unguided missiles, energy balls and machine guns placed either frontally or sideways. The [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] displays a map, radar, speed and status reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/tomcat/yu/Amiga/SCANS/TheOneAmiga69Jun94_46.jpg The One Amiga, #69, June 1994, Work in Progress, Matt Broughton]&lt;/ref&gt; The game is also notable for allowing two-player co-op.

}}
The game received mixed to positive reviews upon release. The sound effects and music were lauded. Reviewers particularly praised its very smooth and fast gameplay, at the expense of the relatively simpler graphics. However, the high difficulty, specifically the toughness of the enemies, has been criticized.

[[Japan|Japan&lt;nowiki/&gt;ese]] [[performing arts]] company '''enra''' (stylized in lowercase Latin letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireartists.jp/artists.php?id=68293|title=Empire Entertainment: enra|website=www.empireartists.jp|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) combines [[video art]] with live performance, synchronizing human body motion with [[computer graphics]]. Established March 1, 2012, enra is composed of video artist Nobuyuki Hanabusa and eight performers: Tsuyoshi Kaseda, Maki Yokoyama, Saya Watatani, Tachun, Yusaku Mochizuki, Kazunori Ishide, Takako Morimoto, and Aoi Nonaka. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enra.jp/member|title=MEMBER|website=enra.jp|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tradition and origin ==
The [[Tokyo]]-based performing arts and production company seeks to create the ultimate union between motion graphics and live performance. The intent is to synchronize on-screen images with [[dance]] and other forms of live expression. Made up of eight individual performers, enra incorporates [[martial arts]] (especially [[wushu (sport)|wushu]]), [[rhythmic gymnastics]], [[ballet]], [[animation]] dance, [[juggling]] (especially with the [[diabolo]]), and club dance into its performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enra.jp/about|title=about|website=enra.jp|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performances by enra consist of a synchronized fusion of motion graphics (video art) and live performance (contemporary dance in a variety of genres) in front of a screen. The group regularly performs all over the world, and has received high praise not only in its native Japan, but also in [[Europe]], [[North America]], East and [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Middle East]].

In Japan, enra performed as a guest of the [[prime minister of Japan]] at the official welcoming dinner for the [[International Olympic Committee|International Olympic Committee (IOC)]] during its evaluation of the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Tokyo Olympics]] plan, an event that also served to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Tokyo Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt; http://business.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/topics/20130908/253131/?rt=nocnt &lt;/ref&gt;

''FILMS'', a [[homage (arts)|homage]] to movies, was performed by enra to open the award ceremony at the 68th [[Festival de Cannes]], where the group also walked the red carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enra.jp/biography|title=enra|website=enra.jp|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, enra kicked off its 2016 Japan tour with a public performance at Kitazawa Town Hall in [[Shimokitazawa]], [[Tokyo]].

enra walked the red carpet a second time at the Lunas del Auditorio ceremony at the [[National Auditorium]] in Mexico City in October 2016, where they performed as a special guest.

== Name origin ==
According to the [[Mainichi Shimbun]], "The group's name is derived from the [[smoke]]-like shape-shifting Japanese [[yōkai]] spirit, [[Enenra]]".【グループ名は、煙のようにさまざまな形に姿を変える日本の妖怪「煙々羅」にちなんだ。】&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160411/mog/00m/040/012000c|title=ｅｎｒａ：国内初ツアー　言葉や文化の壁超えるストーリー - 毎日新聞|website=毎日新聞|language=ja-JP|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">'''''Everyone's Child''''' is a 1995 film directed by the author [[Tsitsi Dangarembga]]. Directing this film made Dangarembga the first black [[Zimbabwe]]an woman to direct a feature film. The film was criticised for unusual accents and for unsubtle story telling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/everyone-s-child-1200447659/|title=Everyone’s Child|last=Eisner|first=Ken|date=1996-11-18|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Focusing on the growing problem of children living in hardship - especially as a result of [[AIDS]] - the film follows the abrupt journey of two children into a world of adult responsibility. Itayi and Tamari are devastated following the death of both parents, shunned by family and friends, and left with nothing. Frustrated and in despair, Itayi tries his luck in the big city, leaving Tamari at home to look after herself and her younger brothers and sisters.

'''George White''' (15 April 1891 – 11 November 1968)  was an American theatrical producer and director who also was an actor, choreographer, composer, dancer, dramatist, lyricist and screenwriter, as well as a [[Broadway theater]]-owner.

Born '''Eassy White'' in New York City (other sources claim his birth name as "George Weitz" and his birthplace as Toronto, Canada; he performed under all three names), White started his career as part of a dance team with partner Benny Ryan, performing in the [[American burlesque|burlesque circuit]]. He appeared in supporting roles in many Broadway shows, but it was his appearance in [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]'s ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' that would provide the impetus for his own career as a theatrical impresario on Broadway.&lt;ref name="American Musical"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/george-white/ "George White"], PBS, accessed October 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; White appeared in the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' of 1911 and 1915; in the latter show, he popularized the [[Turkey Trot (dance)|Turkey Trot]] dance.&lt;ref name="White Bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Bobb|title=George White|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/17637172|publisher=Find a Grave|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He launched his ''Ziegfeld Follies'' imitation, the ''George White’s Scandals'', in 1919. ''Scandals'' provided audiences with popular songs, comic sketches, [[eccentric dance]]rs and his own version of the [[Ziegfeld girls]]. Though not as grand as the ''Ziegfeld Follies'', his ''Scandals'' were quite successful. The shows, which were micromanaged by White and reflected his tastes, were fast-paced and featured a lot of dancing.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

White reached the apogee of his Broadway career with the 1926 edition of ''Scandals'', which ran for 424 performances.&lt;ref name="American Musical" /&gt; The [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]], danced by ''Ziegfeld Follies'' star [[Ann Pennington (actress)|Ann Pennington]] and [[Tom Patricola]], touched off a [[Novelty and fad dances|national dance craze]].  However, by the time he produced his last staging of ''Scandals'' in 1939, the show was derided by critics as being old-fashioned.&lt;ref name="White Bio" /&gt; In addition to his ''Scandals'' and ''George White's Music Hall Varieties'' (essentially ''Scandals'' under a different name), White also produced several book musicals and legitimate plays on Broadway.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

White also was a movie director, producer and screenwriter. He produced the movies ''[[Flying High (1931 film)|Flying HIgh]]'' (1931), ''George White's Scandals'' (1934) ''George White's 1935 Scandals'' (1935) and ''George White's Scandals'' (1945), and directed the 1934 and 1935 celluloid versions of his ''Scandals''.  He also appeared in and took screenwriting credit for the 1934 and 1935 pictures. he also received screenwriting credits for the movies ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]] (1945) and [[Duffy's Tavern (film)|Duffy's Tavern]]'' (1945).

In 1946, White was involved in a hit-and-run automobile accident in which two people died. He was sentenced to nine months in prison. Freed from jail, White tried to turn ''Scandals'' into a show that would tour the nightclub circuit. The venture failed and he went bankrupt. His attempt to open a nightclub in [[Las Vegas]] also failed.&lt;ref name="White Bio" /&gt;

White died from leukemia in 1968 in [[Hollywood, California]] and was interred in [[Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park]] in [[North Hollywood]].

'''Jack Cameron''' (born '''Jacques Kammerer''' also known as '''Jack Kammerer'''; November 22, 1883 – September 25, 1956) was an American actor, singer, and acrobatic comedian whose career spanned almost five decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jacques Kammerer: Rehoboth Man Was a Former Vaudeville Comedian |work=The Providence Journal |date=September 27, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in vaudeville, burlesque, film, radio, and television. Cameron was best known for his vaudeville performances, first as part of the Kammerer &amp; Howland musical comedy act, and later as a principal comedian on the Keith-Albee circuit. He appeared in several motion pictures and could be heard on WPRO (AM) radio as the “Singing Salesman.”&lt;ref name="Career retrospective, PJ"&gt;{{cite news |title=As of Today: Jack Cameron |work=The Providence Journal |date=May 13, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:Jack kammerer vaudeville publicity rhode island.jpg|thumb|right|Early publicity photograph taken by Smales Studio in Providence, RI. Circa 1910.]]
Kammerer was born as Jacques Kammerer on November 22, 1883, in [[Troyes|Troyes, France]]. In 1896, he immigrated to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] with his father, Joseph Kammerer, and grandmother, Victorine Kammerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Bretagne Ship Manifest |url=https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMjoiMTAyODg3MTAwODE5Ijs=/czo5OiJwYXNzZW5nZXIiOw== |website=The Statue of Liberty - Ellis Island Foundation Inc. |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Kammerer worked in a hat factory and trained as a gymnast at the Providence Boys’ Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gymnastic Exhibition |work=The Providence Journal |date=April 22, 1902|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began performing as an acrobat at [[Rocky Point Amusement Park]]’s Forest Casino in 1903. He appeared in local minstrel shows and with The Newman Comedy Four. In 1904, Kammerer married Clara Montgomery Higgs. They had three children and divorced in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=50 Divorce Cases Heard in One Day|work=The Providence Journal |date=July 6, 1911|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the divorce, the children lived with Kammerer’s grandmother, Victorine, and uncle on a dairy farm in Rehoboth, MA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fourteenth Census of the United States: 1920 - Population |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |website=United States Bureau of the Census |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kammerer &amp; Howland==
Kammerer entered Providence [[vaudeville]] as a performer of [[illustrated songs]]. In 1910, Kammerer and [[Edna Howland]], a classically trained pianist, began appearing together at the Bijou theatre as “Kammerer &amp; Howland -- Classical Comedy Singing and Talking Act”. The Bijou was specifically designed as a venue for illustrated songs, which were performed between films, and an act like Kammerer &amp; Howland would offer an upward of nine song programs per day at six days per week.&lt;ref name="Temples"&gt;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brett |first=Roger |title=Temples of Illusion: The Golden Age of Theaters in an American City |publisher=Brett Theatrical |year=1975 |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo joined Fred Homan’s Musical Stock Company at the Scenic Temple on Matthewson Street in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jewett |first=Bobby |title=”Old Scenic” Holds Gay Place in Playgoer’s Memory|work=The Providence Journal |date=January 21, 1940 |page=VI.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homan's company also included [[Eddie Dowling]]. Though it disbanded after only two years, the company was remembered fondly by Rhode Island theatregoers.&lt;ref name="Temples"/&gt;

Kammerer &amp; Howland appeared on [[Marcus Loew]]’s national circuit for the first time in 1913. They toured North America on the Loew’s circuit for four years, and were known for comedic songs, clever banter, acrobatic dancing, and for Kammerer’s impersonations of [[Ford Sterling]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Bert Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Those Versatile Entertainers: Jack Kammerer and Edna Howland |journal=Variety |date=October 1, 1915 |pages=41 |url=https://archive.org/details/variety40-1915-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kammerer &amp; Howland were billed alongside celebrated entertainers, such as [[Will Rogers]] and Marie Stoddard. In 1914, Kammerer joined the [[White Rats of America]], a labor union organized by theatre employees in an effort to destabilize the [[Vaudeville Managers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=White Rats News |journal=Variety |date=October 17, 1914 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of the decade, Kammerer &amp; Howland appeared together in [[American burlesque]]. They married and had one child, Donald L. Kammerer, born in Missouri during Kammerer and Howland’s tour with the 1919-1920 season of Pat White’s ''[[Gaiety Girls]]''. The cast included [[Joe Yule]] and Nell Carter, who welcomed their only child, [[Mickey Rooney]], while on the same tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lertzman |first=Richard |title=The Life and Times of Mickey Rooney |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2015 |page=21-31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=150110098X}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jack Kammerer and Edna Howland vaudeville publicity photo 4.jpg|thumb|left|1915 publicity photo signed: "From Kammerer &amp; Howland, Who are going to the top."]]  

''The Gaiety Girls’'' tour was the last for the duo of Kammerer &amp; Howland. Howland returned to Providence, RI, with their son shortly after his birth. In 1923, she sued Kammerer for divorce on grounds of neglect and extreme cruelty. Howland was awarded custody, as well as a provision of ten dollars per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Court Record |work=The Providence Sunday Journal |date=February 11, 1923 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jack Cameron==
In 1921, Kammerer adopted the stage name Jack Cameron. Around this time, he was offered a string of lead roles in New York City burlesques. He appeared in Sliding Billy Watson’s ''World of Frolics'', Eddie Dowling’s ''Hello Miss Radio'', and Fred Clark’s ''Let’s Go''. In 1923, Cameron was cast as a principal in [[Charles Waldron]]’s ''Bostonians''. The show earned mixed reviews, but Cameron was a stand out. Alfred Nelson, theatre critic for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', referred to Cameron as “a singer, dancer, and versatile actor of remarkable ability.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first=Alfred |title=This Week's Reviews of Vaudeville Theaters: COLUMBIA BURLESQUE |journal=The Billboard |date=February 9, 1924 |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that the audience "couldn't get enough" of Cameron’s baritone. ''Bostonians'' also marked the first artistic collaboration between Cameron and the youthful singer, Leo Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Burlesque Reviews - Bostonians |journal=Variety |date=February 14, 1924 |pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Bostonians'', Cameron was cast as the principal comedian in vaudeville producer Charles B. Maddock’s ''Tramp, Tramp, Tramp: A Song of the Road'', book by [[Ballard MacDonald]]. ''Tramp'' paired Cameron once again with Leo Lee, along with six supporting male performers. The men played singing hobos, thrown together by fate in a camp beside a railroad track. The show was a hit and toured nationally on the Keith-Albee Circuit between 1925 and 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shapiro |first1=M.H. |title=Big City Vaudeville Reviews-Tramp, Tramp, Tramp 
|work=The Billboard |date=September 19, 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron followed ''Tramp, Tramp, Tramp'' with lead roles in three other C.B. Maddock productions: ''Sidekicks'' (1927-1929), ''Style Shop'' (1930), and ''All Wet'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jack Cameron in Sidekicks |work=The Billboard |date=May 11, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jack Cameron in Tramp Tramp Tramp.jpg|thumb|right|Cameron in Tramp, Tramp, Tramp. 1925.]]

In 1929, Cameron starred alongside [[Helen Morgan]] in the [[Rouben Mamoulian]] motion picture, ''[[Applause (1929 film)|Applause]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Applause (1929) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019644/ |website=IMDB |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron’s character was true to life: he played an aging burlesque clown by the name of “Joe King.” During the opening scenes of Applause, Cameron’s comedic and acrobatic abilities are on full display, with shots of Cameron clowning-around and backflipping across the sound stage. Joe King disappears from the story after making an unsuccessful offer of marriage to Kitty Darling, played by Helen Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Film Reviews-Applause |journal=Variety |date=October 9, 1929 |pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron appeared in two subsequent motion pictures: ''The Spy'' (1929) with Tom Howard, directed by Monte Brice, and ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1936) with Mickey Rooney, directed by [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027893/ |website=IMDB |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Years==
Cameron continued to work as an entertainer throughout the 1930s and 1940s. He performed in the role of Gonzorgo in ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' for two seasons, 1930 and 1931, with the [[Aborn Opera Company]] and [[Singer's Midgets]], at the [[Imperial Theatre]] on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jack Cameron |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/jack-cameron-34335 |website=Internet Broadway Database |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, he reunited with Leo Lee, from ''Tramp'' and ''Sidekicks'', to star in a new show, ''Broadway to Withersville''. It was a flop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vaudeville Unit Reviews-Broadway to Withersville |work=Variety |date=April 10, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the 1930s, Cameron launched his “drunk” nightclub act, ''There Is a Tavern in the Town'', at the Old Fashioned Cafe in Boston, MA.&lt;ref name="Career retrospective, PJ"/&gt; Cameron could be heard on [[WPRO (AM)]] radio as the “Singing Salesman” and appeared on the WBZ television show, ''You’re On''. Cameron retired from show business in 1947.&lt;ref name="Career retrospective, PJ"/&gt; He died in Rehoboth, MA, on September 25, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jacques Kammerer: Rehoboth Man Was a Former Vaudeville Comedian |work=The Providence Journal |date=September 27, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Lundu (also spelled landu or landum) is a style of [[Afro-Brazilian]] music and dance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with its origins in the African [[Bantu people|Bantu]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] people.

==History==
The interconnectedness of [[Lusophone]] countries dates back to the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]], between Portugal, Brazil and regions of [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arenas|first=Fernando|title=Lusophone Africa: Beyond Independence|year=2011|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=1–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, the Portuguese were the primary exporters of African slaves to the Americas, and with slaves came their musical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a massive Brazilian presence in [[Angola]], enabling a cultural exchange between the two [[Portuguese colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange enabled subtle amalgamations of musical styles between [[Angola]], [[Brazil]] and other African slave trade countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a [[Creole peoples|creole]] population in [[Brazil]]  led to further cultural developments in language, religion and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorton|first=John|title=Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=183–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissemination==
Records from the inquisition of the 18th century reveal that the Europeans initially considered gandus and lundus to be witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many slave-owning Europeans in Brazil tolerated the dance in an attempt to avoid slave rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the style became attractive to Europeans in Brazil for its sexualized quality and its believed effectiveness in reversing witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[de Mattos]] was disgruntled by the blurring by dance and drums of strict racial and cultural boundaries in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=13|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, the lundu style grew in popularity among the elite population in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=20|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, Brazilian musician Manuel de Almeida Botelho immigrated to [[Lisbon]], bringing with him the [[modinha]] and lundu musical styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, lundu had become the music of choice for the Luso-Brazilian bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=20|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have even called the style the “…most characteristic late 18th century [genre] of dance and song in Portugal and Brazil”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=20|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rugendas lundu 1835.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ''Lundu'' performance in the 18th century, as depicted in a print from artist Rugendas]]

==Style==
Lundus are characterized by varying structure, the interplay of tonic and dominant [[harmony]], and strummed chords layered atop a syncopated rhythm reminiscent of traditional West African music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budasz|first=Rogério|title=Black guitar-players and early African-Iberian music in Portugal and Brazil|journal=Early Music|date=February 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1093/em/cal117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited recordings are available of traditional lundus style. Usually a flirtatious ritual of a couple dance, accompanied by a [[guitar]], or sometimes a thumb [[piano]] or [[drum]]s, Lundu is related to the Spanish [[Fandango (dance)|fandango]] and other new-world dances like the Argentine [[Zamba (artform)|Zamba]], the Peruvian [[Zamacueca]] and the Cuban [[Bolero]] - they all involve, to some degree, handkerchiefs, castanets, and holding one's arms above one's head. In the 19th century, the lundu was one of the sources of the [[Choro]], the [[Maxixe (dance)|Maxixe]] and the [[Samba]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13915">A '''magician's assistant''' is  a performer in a [[magic (illusion)|magic act]] who is not billed as the magician or principal name in the act. The role of an assistant can include holding the [[theatrical property|prop]]s that are used by a [[Magician (illusion)|magician]], shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction.&lt;ref name="johnstone"&gt;{{cite journal
 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2214353,00.html
 |title = Breaking into the magic circle

Although magician's assistants appear to play a supporting role and receive a lesser [[Billing (film)|billing]] than the magician who appears to be the source of illusions, the assistant is often the one making the mechanics of the illusions work. In the words of [[Joanie Spina]], who worked for 11 years as principal assistant, choreographer and artistic consultant to illusionist [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...I did find fault with the term "assistant" because it sounds like someone rolling props on and off stage when many of us were highly trained actors and dancers.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History and critiques==

[[File:FarlaAssistents.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Sabrina and Vanessa with illusionist [[Christian Farla]]]]
Assistants have been part of magic shows for most of the recorded [[Timeline of magic|history of magic]] as a performance art. Despite their often crucial role in magic acts they, and the work they do, have suffered from negative public perceptions. The assistant's role has often been stereotyped as consisting of menial tasks and having the primary purpose of adding a visually aesthetic element to an act. This is associated with the perception that assistants are usually female and often dressed in revealing costumes. Although there have been plenty of instances of male assistants throughout the history of magic, the glamorous female stereotype has made a particular impact because female assistants were a prominent feature of illusion shows during the 20th century, when magic began to reach huge new audiences, first through the burgeoning of live [[vaudeville]] and [[variety shows]] and then through television. The glamorous female assistant has become an iconic image that continues in modern media and literature.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="womeninboxes"&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.womeninboxes.com
 |title = ''Women in Boxes''
 |publisher = WIB, LLC
 |accessdate = 2007-04-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the glamorous female assistant iconography is the frequency with which assistants play the role of "victim" in illusions where they are tied up, apparently cut with blades, penetrated with spikes or swords or otherwise tortured or imperilled. Examples include ''[[Aztec Lady]]'', ''[[Devil's Torture Chamber]]'', ''[[Mismade Girl]]'', ''[[Radium Girl]]'', ''[[Zig Zag Girl]]'', and, perhaps most famous of all, ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]''.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The topic of assistants portrayed as victims in violent illusions was featured in "Violent magic" the final episode of the six-part [[BBC]] television documentary series ''Magic'' in 2004, see {{cite web
 |url = http://www.magicweek.co.uk/backissues_0200-0249/0230.htm
 |title =  UK Magic News
 |publisher = ''Magicweek.co.uk''
 |date = 20 November 2004
 |accessdate = 2007-04-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted illusion designer and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] has identified the advent of the sawing illusion as a turning point in magic history and a moment which, more than any other, marks the origin of the cliche of the female assistant as victim. It is generally agreed that a "sawing" type illusion was first performed publicly by [[P. T. Selbit]] in January 1921. His presentations of what he titled "''Sawing through a woman''" made an enormous impact and greatly affected public expectations of stage magic for decades afterwards. Steinmeyer has explained:&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book
 |title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible
 |first = Jim
 |last = Steinmeyer
 |publisher = William Heinemann/Random House
 |year = 2003
 |pages = 277–295
 |isbn = 0-434-01325-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]], both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions. Victorian gowns often made it unrealistic for a lady to take part in an illusion or be pressed into a tight space.&lt;ref name="hiding2"&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:DietrichKlein.jpg|thumb|Magician Dorothy Dietrich sawing celebrity assistant and comedian Robert Klein in half on TV]] One female magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]] has turned the tables and used men as assistants, sawing them in half.  

Changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of "victim" both practical and popular. Steinmeyer notes: "During the 1900s, as a shapely leg became not only acceptable on the stage but admired, it was fashionable to perform magic with a cast of attractive ladies".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

That was only part of the story, however. The trauma of war had helped to desensitize the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were also tiring of the gentler forms of magic represented by the likes of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. It took something more shocking, such as the horrific productions of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

In contrast to the publicity given to Selbit, the names of the assistants who made this influential act work have received almost no publicity. There were two premieres of the illusion. Selbit first presented it to an audience in December 1920; however, on that occasion the spectators were a small group of invited theatrical agents and promoters who Selbit hoped would book the act. The public premiere then occurred on 17 January 1921 at the [[Finsbury Park]] Empire music hall after Selbit was hired by the Moss Empire group. According to Steinmeyer, the assistant at the 1920 preview was Jan Glenrose, Selbit's main assistant at that time. The public performances featured principal assistant Betty Barker.&lt;ref name="hiding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artandartifice"&gt;{{cite book

Many of these illusions, together with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes of one sort or another. This has led to the nickname "box jumper" which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant.&lt;ref name="boxjumpers1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an assistant that can fit into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

[[Feminist]] critics have taken the above aspects of illusions and performances as evidence to support claims that magic is [[misogynist]]ic, but this view has been contested by some magicians and assistants. However, a few prominent assistants have stated that they deserve better recognition for their efforts and achievements (see "[[#Documentaries|Documentaries]]" below).&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;

Some modern magic acts have preserved the glamorous elements of the female assistant iconography while attempting to give full recognition to female performers by billing women as equal partners in acts. A notable example was the husband and wife act [[Pendragons|The Pendragons]], for which Charlotte Pendragon wore very revealing costumes and did traditional "box jumping" roles yet received equal billing with her husband. She was also honored in her own right as a top professional magician. Another example, although with more modest and conservative costuming, is [[Kristen Johnson (escape artist)|Kristen Johnson]], who receives equal billing with her husband Kevin Ridgeway when they perform together as a magic act and often stars in her own right as an [[escapology|escape artist]].

'''Marchinha''' ({{IPA-pt|maɾˈʃiɲɐ}}, also called "marchinha de carnaval", "marchinha carnavalesca" or "marcha carnavalesca) is one of several genres of music typical of [[Brazilian Carnival]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region of Brazil]]. The other main carnival genres are: [[samba-enredo]], [[frevo]], [[maracatu]] and [[Axé music]].

Marchinha is an extremely comic genre of music and the very name "marchinha" (little march) satirizes the seriousness of [[march (music)|military marches]], in both the musical and step senses, which are involved in the generalised satirization of the society that occurs during the carnival, for example the election of [[King Momo (Carnival character)|Rei Momo]] (King Momo, the king of carnival). The bands features [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]]s, [[French horn|horn]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s and [[percussion]].

The first marchinha was the composition (in 1899) of [[Chiquinha Gonzaga]] entitled "O Abre Alas", made to the [[Cordão Carnavalesco]] "Rosa de Outro".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070704161038/http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/detalhe.asp?nome=Chiquinha+Gonzaga&amp;tabela=T_FORM_A&amp;qdetalhe=art], Dicionário Cravo Albin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vidaslusofonas.pt/chiquinha_gonzaga.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020144521/http://www.vidaslusofonas.pt/chiquinha_gonzaga.htm |archivedate=2011-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchinhas are composed and played to date by the [[Carnival block|blocos carnavalescos]] every year, in the "street carnival" of Rio de Janeiro.

==History==

The first issue of ''Mathematics of Operations Research'' was published in February 1976. The founding editor was then-professor at Stanford University, [[Arthur F. Veinott Jr.]] He then served as editor-in-chief until 1980, when the position was taken over by Stephen M. Robinson, who held the position until 1986. [[Erhan Cinlar]] served from 1987 to 1992, and was followed by [[Jan Karel Lenstra]] (1993-1998). Next was [[Gérard Cornuéjols]] (1999-2003) and [[Nimrod Megiddo]] (2004-2009). Finally came Uri Rothblum (2009-2012) and the current editor-in-chief Jim Dai (2012–present).&lt;ref&gt;“Mathematics of Operations Research: Stats and History”. Informs&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal's three initial areas were [[game theory]], stochastic systems, and mathematical programming, edited by [[Robert Aumann]], [[Donald Iglehart]], and [[R. Tyrrell Rockafellar]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Front Matter." Mathematics of Operations Research 1.1 (1976): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 27 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the journal has four areas: [[continuous optimization]], [[discrete optimization]], [[stochastic models]], and game theory. They are edited by [[Marc Teboulle]], [[Jens Vygen]], [[Adam Shwartz]], and [[Bernhard von Stengel]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Front Matter." Mathematics of Operations Research 40.2 (2015): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 30 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mathematics of Operations Research'' has hosted articles written by four Nobel Prize-winning authors: Robert Aumann (Economics, 2005), Roger B. Myerson (Economics, 2007), Alvin E. Roth (Economics, 2012), and Lloyd S. Shapley (Economics 2012).&lt;ref&gt;“Mathematics of Operations Research: Stats and History”.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Migrant Help''' is a national [[Charitable organization|charity]] that has been supporting vulnerable migrants since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=Who we are – Migrant Help|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity operates from 10 offices across the [[United Kingdom]], providing advice, guidance and support to [[asylum seeker]]s, [[refugee]]s and victims of modern-day [[slavery]] and [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/about-us/where-we-work/|title=Where we work – Migrant Help|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/news_and_events/latest_news/2206_migrant_help_to_take_over_provision_of_asylum_advice_services|title=Migrant Help to take over provision of asylum advice services {{!}} Scottish Refugee Council|website=www.scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=17212|title=Services for Asylum Seekers|last=Glasgow Young Scot|first=20 Trongate|date=2015-11-03|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asylum support services include face-to-face advice both in initial accommodation centers and on an outreach basis, along with a nationwide [[telephone]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://helplines.org/helplines/migrant-help-asylum-helplines/|title=Migrant Help - Asylum Helplines - Helplines Partnership|work=Helplines Partnership|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most asylum seekers have fled war or persecution and many arrive with limited understanding of life in the UK. Migrant Help UK provides them with advice, information and support to negotiate the asylum system, access services and overcome the challenges of integration.

Migrant Help works on [[Syrian refugee crisis|Syrian Resettlement]] programmes with local authorities in [[South East England]], welcoming new families to the UK and supporting and orienting them to their new communities over an extended period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/about-us/what-we-do/syrian-resettlement/|title=Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme – Migrant Help|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity supports access to local [[Health care|healthcare]] and [[education]] services, [[English language|English]] lessons, specialist [[counselling]], managing [[budget]]s and becoming work ready.

Migrant Help also supports victims of modern-day slavery and human trafficking in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

The charity works with a number of organisations around the UK including local authorities, strategic partners and volunteer groups on community-based schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/about-us/what-we-do/specialist-support-for-victims-of-trafficking/|title=Specialist support for Victims of Human Trafficking|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clear Voice ==
'''Clear Voice''', a subsidiary trading arm of Migrant Help, is an [[Language interpretation|interpreting]] and [[translation]] service that operates with a pool of 350+ interpreters and translators country-wide in more than 90 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clearvoice.org.uk/|title=Clear Voice Interpreters for high quality interpreters in UK -|website=Clear Voice Interpreters &amp; Translation Limited|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1088631&amp;subid=0|title=Charity Details|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpreters work extensively with refugees and asylum seekers.

Clear Voice was established by Migrant Help in 2008 to provide high quality, cost effective and socially aware language services. Clear Voice specialises in the provision of telephone interpreting, face-to-face interpreting and translation services across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/clear-voice/|title=Clear Voice – Migrant Help|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All profits go back into Migrant Help to support its work with vulnerable migrants. In 2017, Clear Voice provided over 89,000 telephone and over 1400 face-to-face interpretation sessions.

== History ==
Migrant Help was set up in 1963 by Helen Ellis ([[MBE]]), a leading figure in provision of welfare support to migrants travelling through the [[Dover]] Port since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=Who we are – Migrant Help|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation, known at this time as the 'Kent Committee for the Welfare of Migrants' (KCWM), was established in response to the growing number of migrants arriving at the [[Channel Ports]].

In 1970, immigrants were given right of '[[Appeal]]' from decisions relating to their entry. The 'United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service' (UKIAS), funded by the [[Home Office]], was established to represent migrants on 'Appeal'. KCWM worked alongside the UKIAS as the organisation supporting the welfare of arriving immigrants at the [[Channel Ports]].

Helen Ellis retired in 1993 after 50 years of service to migrants. In the following year the working name '[[Migrant Helpline]]' was adopted. Also in 1994, the charity received a grant from the Home Office to deliver support services to newly arrived asylum seekers.

In 2002, Migrant Helpline was asked by the Home Office to establish and operate the first Induction Center. Here, briefings were delivered to asylum seekers about the asylum process and their rights and responsibilities. Migrant Helpline's operation expanded to London and a reception service for asylum seekers opened in [[Croydon]]. The charity was funded to manage the London accommodation center for newly arrived asylum seekers, known as 'Emergency Initial Accommodation'.

A number of projects were established in the following years including the 'Sunrise' project to help new refugees integrate into life in the UK, a 'Training and Employment' project was launched for refugees in Kent (until 2009) and Migrant Helpline was invited to provide an independent important advice service to foreign national prisoners in [[HM Prison Canterbury|Canterbury Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/news-and-press/our-news/annual-report-2015/|title=Annual Report 2015 – Migrant Help|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'European Migrant Advice' service was established in response to the increased call for support from EU migrants in the UK. This service was later extended in 2010 to meet support needs in [[Suffolk]] and [[Norfolk]].

In 2008, the 'United Kingdom Human Trafficking Center' approached the charity to provide support for victims of labour exploitation. The 'Victims of Slavery Support Service' team was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migranthelpuk.org/about-us/what-we-do/specialist-support-for-victims-of-trafficking/|title=Specialist support for Victims of Human Trafficking|work=Migrant Help|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mill River Fun Park''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] amusement park located in [[Mill River, Prince Edward Island|Mill River]], [[Prince Edward Island]].

The park was permanently closed in 2017 and all remaining attractions were demolished or sold.

==Attractions==
The Mill River Fun Park included a swimming pool, bumper boats, pirate ship, water slides, children's swimming pool, aqua rage, and other attractions.

==History==
The Mill River Fun Park was conceived by private sector investors during the 1980s based on economic development funding from the federal and provincial governments.  Following an economic downturn in the early 1990s, the property was acquired by the provincial government and has been operated by the provincial parks system, however it is not considered a [[provincial park]].

The provincial government sold the park, along with the [[Mill River Golf Course]], Rodd Mill River hotel, campground, spa, and restaurant, to [[Don McDougall (baseball)|Don McDougall]] in early 2017. McDougall subsequently closed the park and removed all attractions. The area now contains walking trails which are open to the public.

'''''Monday Morning Podcast''''' is a weekly comedy podcast hosted by comedian, actor and celebrity podcaster [[Bill Burr]]. It was independently recorded from May 2007 until October 2012, when it became a part of the [[All Things Comedy]] podcast network, which was founded by Burr and [[Al Madrigal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Monday Morning Podcast|url=http://allthingscomedy.com/channels/2/monday-morning-podcast|publisher=All Things Comedy|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2015/10/21/everyman-bill-burrs-star-rises/74321604/|title=Everyman Bill Burr's star rises|last=Baetens|first=Melody|date=October 22, 2016|website=The Detroit News|publisher=|access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During each one-hour episode, Burr speaks without reservation and off-the-cuff about his past and recent experiences, current events, going on tour, sports, and offers advice to questions submitted by listeners. He is sometimes joined by his wife, Nia, and has many other featured guests and interviews with other comedians. The podcast is distributed through [[SoundCloud]], [[iTunes]], Google Podcasts, and [[CastBox]]. As of April 2017, the podcast has over 100,000 followers on SoundCloud and each podcast usually receives between 40,000 and 70,000 plays from that source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/themonday-morning-podcast|title=theMonday Morning Podcast|website=SoundCloud|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics are not listed for iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allthingscomedy.com/about|title=The All Things Comedy Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/las-new-wave-of-indie-comedy-labels-4775121|title=L.A.'s New Wave of Indie Comedy Labels|last=Seabaugh|first=Julie|date=2014-07-03|website=L.A.

Beginning on March 12, 2015, Burr started releasing a second weekly edition, the ''Thursday Afternoon Monday Morning Podcast'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billburr.com/podcast/monday-morning-podcast-6-13-16|title=Monday Morning Podcast 6-13-16 - The Official Website of Bill Burr|date=2016-06-13|website=The Official Website of Bill Burr|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he often refers to as the ''Thursday Afternoon Just-Before-Friday Monday Morning Podcast''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">'''Movement Concept''' is a modern system of learning and teaching with traditional roots which imparts inner and outer movement in the broadest sense.

==Background==
Movement Concept was created by [[Ingo Taleb Rashid]] and derives its fundamental principles from dance and theatre methods from East and West  (e.g. [[Butoh]], [[Noh]], [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislawski Method]]), martial arts (e.g. Ninpo, [[Capoeira]]) and the ancient
tradition of [[Sufism]], the spiritual principles of which are transferred into modern body work.
The idea behind Movement Concept is to tap a person’s full potential, to use exhaustively the
diversity of the body’s capacity for movement and expression, to make these accessible and use them for stage work and, at the same time, increases our awareness of it.
An essential part of the system is “play”, in which two people apply the acquired technique and abilities in free improvisation inside a protective circle of participants.

==Three-year Ongoing Curricular Training==
Movement Concept is intended as a practical educational training system combining bodywork, performing arts and spirituality. It is meant for all people who want to deal more deeply with these topics – regardless of age, experience or previous
knowledge. It is also suitable as advanced training for performers in the areas of dance, directing and choreography.
The Movement Concept curriculum spans three years (approx. 30 days of training each year).
Before entering into training, a personal conversation with the educational director is required.
The training concludes with a written assignment and a demonstration lesson.
After successful completion of the curriculum, participants receive a diploma that certifies the qualification
to teach Movement Concept under supervision of El Haddawi.

==Some Topics==
*Magic of the Body
*Dance, Improvisation and Choreography
*The Triangle of Intention
*The Dancing Warrior
*Living Anatomy, Health and Prevention of Injuries
*A Practical Introduction to the History of Dance
*Spirituality in Dance
*Stage-fright and Presence
*The Art of Flying and Falling
*Beyond the Masks – the Versatile Actor

[[File:Parcheesi-board.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A game of ''Parcheesi'' in progress]]
'''''Parcheesi''''' is a brand-name [[United States|American]] adaptation of the [[India]]n [[Cross and circle game|cross and circle]] board game [[Pachisi]], published by [[Parker Brothers]]&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt; and [[Winning Moves]].

==Equipment==
Parcheesi is typically played with two [[dice]], four pieces per player and a board with a track around the outside, four corner spaces and four ''home paths'' leading to a central end space. The most popular Parcheesi boards in America have 68 spaces around the edge of the board, 12 of which are darkened ''safe spaces''.  Each corner of the board contains one player's ''nest'', or starting area.

==Setup==
* Each player positions their four single colored pieces in the round starting nest of the same color.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* Each player rolls a single die to determine player order. The player with the lowest roll goes first.&lt;ref name=Mohr_p69&gt;"To decide who goes first, players take turns throwing one die. The person with the lowest number begins, then play continues clockwise around the board." {{cite book |last=Mohr |first=Merilyn Simonds |authorlink= |title=The New Games Treasury |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=1997 |page=69 |isbn=1-57630-058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The order of players' turns moves to the next player on the current player's left.&lt;ref name="hasbro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/parcheesi.pdf |title=Directions for Playing Parcheesi |publisher=Parker Brothers Games Ltd |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mohr_p69 /&gt;
* Pieces move from the nest to the same colored starting space to the left of the nest, by the movement rules in the following section.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;

==Rules==

===Gameplay===
A player rolls the dice and must use the top die pip values shown to move their pieces around the board in one of the following ways:
* Only pieces not in the nest may move forward on the board.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* Pieces may only leave the nest with a roll of a five on a single die or the sum of the dice. A double five can be used to move two pieces from the nest simultaneously.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* In the case of a non-doubles roll, a player may move one or two pieces, either one piece by each of the numbers on the two dice or one piece by the total. If no move is possible, the turn is forfeited.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt; 
* When moving a single piece the total of two dice the turn is taken in increments, allowing pieces to be captured along the way. For example, if a double two is rolled and an opponent's piece lies on a cream space two spaces in front of the piece you wish to move the full four, you would move the piece two, and then two again, allowing the opponent's piece to be captured. &lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* All die rolls must be taken and may not be voluntarily forfeited by a player.&lt;ref name="milton_bradley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Parcheesi_%282001%29.pdf |title=Parcheesi instructions, 2001 |publisher=Milton-Bradley/Hasbro|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If either of two rolls must be forfeited, the player must forfeit the lower number.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* All die moves must be taken before the application of any extra rewards for sending an opponent to their nest or moving a piece to its home position.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* With a roll of doubles, the player makes four moves, one for each of the numbers on top of the two dice and one for each of the numbers on the bottoms.  The player may distribute these four moves among one, two, three, or four pieces.&lt;ref name="milton_bradley"/&gt; Note that the sum of numbers on the opposite sides of a die is always seven, so with doubles, there are a total of fourteen spaces to move.
* When the player rolls doubles, the player rolls again after moving. &lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* When a piece ends its move on the same space as an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to its nest.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* A piece may not be placed on a safe space (generally colored light blue) if it is occupied by an opponent's piece.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt; The exception is the safe space used when a piece leaves its nest &amp;mdash; a single piece occupying such a safe space is sent back to its nest when an opponent's piece leaves the nest and occupies the space.&lt;ref name="milton_bradley"/&gt;
* A blockade is formed when two pieces of a single player occupy the same space. No piece of any player may move through a blockade, including pieces of the blockade owner. Blockade pieces may not be moved forward together with the roll of a double. Another player's piece cannot land in a space occupied by a blockade, even to leave its nest.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt; Local rules may limit the number of turns that a blockade can stay in place.
* A piece is not required to enter the home row and can pass the row and start another circuit of the board voluntarily or as the result of requirement of the use of the total die roll.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* A turn ends when the next player rolls the dice with the consent of the current player. Any rewards not taken are lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Rewards of extra moves===
* The reward for sending an opponent's piece to the nest is a free move of twenty spaces that may not be split between pieces.&lt;ref name="milton_bradley"/&gt;
* The reward for landing a piece in the home space is a free move of ten spaces that may not be split between pieces.&lt;ref name="milton_bradley"/&gt;

===Winning the game===
* Moving all four pieces to the home position wins the game.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;
* Pieces may only be moved to the home position with an exact application of the total roll, the value on a single die, or the complete application of a reward.&lt;ref name="hasbro"/&gt;

A '''parlour''' or '''parlor game''' is a group [[game]] played indoors. During the [[Victorian era]] in [[Great Britain]] and in the [[United States]], these games were extremely popular among the upper and middle classes. They were often played in a [[parlour]], hence the name.

"The Victorian age was certainly the Golden Age of the parlor game."&lt;ref&gt;Beaver, Patrick (1978). ''Victorian Parlor Games'', p.14. T. Nelson. {{ISBN|9780840766083}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the upper and middle classes had more leisure time than people of previous generations.  This led to the creation of a variety of parlour games to allow these gentlemen and ladies to amuse themselves at small parties.  Boxed parlour games were very popular from around 1920 until into the 1960s, especially around Christmas. Parlour games competed for attention with the [[mass media]], particularly [[radio]], [[film|movies]], and [[television]].  Though decreased in popularity, parlour games continue to be played.  Some remain nearly identical to their Victorian ancestors; others have been transformed into [[board game]]s such as [[Balderdash]].

Many parlour games involve [[logic]] or [[word game|word-play]].  Others are more physical games, but not to the extent of a [[sport]] or [[Physical exercise|exercise]]. Some also involve dramatic skill, such as in [[charades]].  Most do not require any equipment beyond what would be available in a typical parlour. Parlour games are usually competitive, but cumulative scores are not usually kept. The length and ending time of the game is typically not set; play continues until the players decide to end the game.

Parlor games are also interchangeably used with carnival games such as, but not limited to, "ping pong toss", "dart throwing", "strong man", and "dunk water". These can be played either indoors or outdoors and is usually accompanied with a token prize (i.e. stuffed animal) upon winning.

==Other uses==
By analogy, the phrase "parlour game" has been used to accuse political opponents of the use of deliberately nebulous or confusing language when describing their positions on issues.

==Examples==

[[File:Dante Quinterno.jpg|thumb|Patoruzú (left), [[Dante Quinterno]] (center), Upa (right). This photograph is from 1937.]]
'''Patoruzú''' is a comic character created in 1928 by [[Dante Quinterno]] and is considered the most popular hero of [[Argentina|Argentine]] comics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/q/quinterno_dante.htm?lan=dutch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, Paul, "1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die", Universe, 2011, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patoruzú is a wealthy [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] ''[[cacique]]'' with great estate properties in [[Patagonia]], and possesses both superhuman physical strength and a charitable yet naive heart. He was originally only a side character in Quinterno's series "Don Gil Contento", but became so popular with readers that the comic was renamed after him.

==History==
[[File:Patoruzu2.jpg|thumb|right|Patoruzú comic: "Andanzas de Patoruzú"]]
Patoruzú first appeared on October 19, 1928, in the ''Las Aventuras de Don Gil Contento'' strip in the ''Crítica'' newspaper, under the name of ''Curugua Curuguagüigua''; ''last cacique of the giant [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]]s'', of whom ''Don Gil'' becomes tutor. The name was deemed too difficult to pronounce and was soon changed to Patoruzú, after the then-popular candy ''Pasta de Orozú''. Nevertheless, the strip was canceled by the newspaper after only a few days.

Later that year Dante Quinterno started working for ''[[La Razón (Buenos Aires)|La Razón]]'' newspaper with the strip ''Don Julián de Monte Pío'' (predecessor of another of Quinterno's popular characters: the playboy [[Isidoro Cañones]]). In September 1930, Patoruzú was again introduced into the strip when Don Julián became his tutor. Slowly, Patoruzú assumed greater importance in the strip, which on December 11, 1931, was renamed to ''Patoruzú''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/q/quinterno_dante.htm?lan=dutch&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Quinterno sold the publication rights to ''El Mundo'' newspaper, and the first compilation of the adventures of the ''cacique'' was published. The strip was also published in newspapers in other Argentine cities outside of [[Buenos Aires]].

In November 1936 the first Patoruzú monthly magazine was released &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/q/quinterno_dante.htm?lan=dutch&lt;/ref&gt; and completely sold out the same day.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The magazine was then published fortnightly, and then weekly. The magazine reached a record circulation of 300,000 copies, soon requiring a team to create its scripts and drawings, under the supervision of Quinterno.

On April 30, 1977, the 2,045th and last issue of Patoruzú was released.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Slightly adapted versions of the original have been published, as well as the comic ''Patoruzito,'' about the life of young Patoruzú.

In 1942 the 12-minute short film ''[[Upa en apuros]]'' was the first Argentine animated film produced in colour.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Characters==

===Patoruzú===
Patoruzú is the last descendant of the fictional Tehuelche ''Patoruzek'' dynasty. The source of his uncommon strength seems to be related to what he was fed as a child—soup made from the bones of an extinct giant animal—but also to the strength of all his ancestors, which he receives whenever he faces injustice.

He is extremely generous and charitable but is often deceived by greedy characters, who in the end are always properly punished. Patoruzú uses many native expressions that give his speech an aboriginal flavor; however, they derive from different tribes of Argentina and so are not consistent with each other (e.g. [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] ''gurí'', [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] ''Che'' &lt;ref&gt;http://etimologias.dechile.net/?che&lt;/ref&gt;, etc.).

===Isidoro Cañones===
An incorrigible [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] and stereotypical ''[[porteño]]'', he is supposed to be Patoruzú's tutor and look after him, but he spends most of his time trying to find new ways of getting more ''patacones'' bills out of him, to spend on parties, cars, and horses.

===Upa===
Patoruzú's teenage brother is shy and naive, yet more aware of modern ways than his older brother. He has a big belly that he uses as a weapon whenever injustice is to be fought.

===Patora===
Patora is the youngest sister; she lives in a convent in [[Patagonia]] because her obsessive desire to get married makes her fall for the first man she sees.

===La Chacha===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Chacha_Patoruzu.jpg|right|thumb|La Chacha]] --&gt;
Patoruzú's nanny and wet nurse lives on the ''estancia'' (ranch), far from any city. In spite of her age, she is vigorous and hard-working. Her [[empanada]]s are highly appreciated by the other characters.

===Ñancul===
The foreman of Patoruzú's ''estancia,'' he is often in a bad mood, but Patoruzú respects and trusts him.

===Coronel Cañones===
The Colonel, the quintessential retired military man, is the uncle and tutor of Isidoro. A very correct and respected person, he is always trying to straighten out his nephew.

===Pampero===
Pampero (''from the [[Pampa]]'' and also the name of a [[Pampero (wind)|strong southern wind]], meaning in essence that he "runs like the wind") is Patoruzú's faithful horse, one of the fastest, if not ''the'' fastest, in the world. He responds only to Patoruzú's call.

==Patoruzito==
This modern comic is set during the early years of the life of Patoruzú, with ''Isidorito'' (young Isidoro), ''Patoruzito'' (young Patoruzú) and his horse ''Pamperito'' (young Pampero).

'''Scott Hampton''' (born April 10, 1959) is an [[People of the United States|American]] [[comic book artist]]  known for his painted artwork. He is the brother of fellow-comics-creator [[Bo Hampton]].

==Early life==
Scott Hampton was born in 1959 in [[High Point, North Carolina]].{{fact|date=October 2015}}

==Career==
Hampton began his career following in the footsteps of brother and fellow comic book creator [[Bo Hampton]]. Both Scott and Bo studied under [[Will Eisner]] in 1976. Scott's first professional comics work was the three-page story "Victims" published in [[Warren Publishing]]'s ''[[Vampirella]]'' #101 in 1981. Scott's work on ''[[Silverheels]]'' from [[Pacific Comics]] in 1983 is regarded as the first continuing painted comic (of U.S. origin).

Working as a freelance [[Comic book creator|comic book artist]], Hampton has illustrated such iconic properties as [[Batman]], [[Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Hellraiser]], and [[Star Trek]] in addition to work on his creator-owned projects such as ''The Upturned Stone''.

His works include ''[[Spookhouse]]'', released in 2004 by [[IDW Publishing]], in which he adapted his favorite ghost stories into sequential form, and ''[[Batman: Gotham County Line]]'' from [[DC Comics]] in 2005. Hampton is currently working full-time on the creator-owned series ''[[Simon Dark]]'' with writer [[Steve Niles]] for DC Comics.

Hampton has illustrated cards for the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' collectible card game.

"The Upturned Stone" was optioned mid-2005 for film production by [[David Foster Productions]], but the studio lost the option and the story was recently optioned by another producer. Scott is also pursuing a passion outside of comics: film making. He completed his first short independent film "The Tontine" in April 2006. It's his loose adaptation of a 21-page comic piece that he worked on and appeared by the same name in the ''[[Hellraiser (comics)|Hellraiser]]'' comic series.  The 29 minute film was shot at the same cabin used in Eli Roth's "[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]". The complete short can be found on [[IMDB]] as well as versions of it available to view on [[Myspace]] (partial), [[Google Video]] (full), and [[YouTube]] (split into 3 parts).

==Personal life==
Hampton lives with his wife Letitia in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].{{fact|date=October 2015}}

==History==

=== Origin ===
[[File:SixFlagsTrain-4027.jpg|thumb|right|Original [[Six Flags &amp; Texas Railroad|Six Flags train]] still in operation (2007)]]
The name "Six Flags" originally referred to the [[Six flags over Texas|flags of the six different nations that have governed Texas]]: Spain, France, Mexico, the [[Republic of Texas]], the United States, and the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria W. Wolcott|title=Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters: The Struggle Over Segregated Recreation in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJbiA_sBjzYC&amp;pg=PA158|date=16 August 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0759-0|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Flags parks are still divided into different themed sections, though many of the original areas from the first three parks have been replaced.

Six Flags Theme Parks originated in 1957 with the creation of ''The Great Southwest Corporation'' by [[Angus G. Wynne]] and other investors. Construction of "Six Flags Over Texas" started in 1960, and the park opened the next year for a short (45-day) season. The park initially featured a Native American village, a [[Gondola lift|gondola]] ride, a railroad, some [[Wild West]] shows, a [[stagecoach]] ride, and "Skull Island", a pirate-themed adventure attraction. There was also an excursion, inspired by the historical [[La Salle Expeditions]] in the late 1600s, called "LaSalle's River Adventure", aboard French riverboats through a wilderness full of animated puppets.&lt;ref name=TIMELINE&gt;{{cite web

=== Growth and acquisitions ===
The original Six Flags park, [[Six Flags Over Texas]] in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] (between [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas and Fort Worth]]) was sold in 1966 to a subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], which was actively pursuing non-railroad investments in an effort to diversify its sources of income. (In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the [[New York Central Railroad]] to form [[Penn Central]] Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions. Six Flags opened [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] in 1967 and [[Six Flags St. Louis|Six Flags Over Mid-America]] in 1971, which would be the last two original parks constructed by the company.

Six Flags continued to grow by acquiring independent parks. Six Flags purchased [[AstroWorld]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in 1975, [[Six Flags Great Adventure|Great Adventure]] in [[Jackson, New Jersey]] in 1977 and [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California]] in 1979. These purchases were followed by Penn Central selling assets to [[Bally Manufacturing]] in 1982.

In 1984, the [[Six Flags Great America|Great America]] theme park in [[Gurnee, Illinois]] was acquired from the [[Marriott Corp.|Marriott]] hotel chain.

Also in 1984, as a result of its acquisition of Great America, Six Flags acquired the rights to Time Warner/[[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animated characters for use in Six Flags properties. Bally surrendered control of the chain to [[Wesray Capital Corporation]] in a 1987 leveraged buyout. [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] quickly began to gain more leverage in the company, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by [[Blackstone Group]] and Wertheim Schroder &amp; Company. Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company's name from ''Six Flags Corp''. to ''Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc''.

In 1996, Six Flags began to manage [[Six Flags Fiesta Texas|Fiesta Texas]] theme park in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] and purchased the park from [[USAA]] in 1998.

===History of Premier Parks===

Premier Parks originally operated as the Tierco Group, Inc., an Oklahoma-based [[real estate]] company. The company purchased the [[Frontier City]] theme park in Oklahoma City in 1982 for $1.2&amp;nbsp;million, although Tierco had no intention of entering the amusement park business. Company officials described Frontier City as "beat up" and "run down"; they planned to demolish it, subdivide the land, and build a shopping center. However, given an [[1980s oil glut|oil bust]] in Oklahoma, developers lost interest in converting the park into a shopping center. In 1984 Tierco hired Gary Story as general manager of Frontier City and sunk about $13&amp;nbsp;million into improving the park. As the new head of Frontier City, he quadrupled the park's attendance and revenues. Under his leadership, two rides, a ticket booth, sales office, and a petting zoo were added to the park. Food service improved.

In 1988, Tierco shifted its strategic direction to amusement parks. It sold much of its property in the late 1980s, generating capital to reinvest in Frontier City. As this reinvestment paid off, more capital became available, creating further growth. By 1991, Tierco opened White Water waterpark in [[Oklahoma City]] (the name later became [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|White Water Bay]]). The company realized the key to boosting a park's attendance was to add new and exciting rides, and make it [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]].

Tierco acquired the financially troubled [[Six Flags America|Wild World]] in [[Largo, Maryland]], in 1992 and later changed that park's name to Adventure World. With a $500,000 investment, Tierco expanded Wild World's kiddie section and remodeled its buildings to give the park a [[Tropics|tropical]] look and feel. Story was promoted to [[vice president|executive vice president]] after the purchase of Wild World. In 1994, he was promoted again to president and [[chief operating officer|chief operating officer (COO)]]. More flat rides and two roller coasters were added to that park.

Since Tierco was on its way to becoming a "premier" regional theme park operator, in 1994 it changed its name to Premier Parks, Inc. Kieran E. Burke, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), noted that the new name signified the beginning of a new era for the company.

In the second half of the 1990s, Premier picked up speed. In 1995, the company acquired these [[Funtime, Inc.]] properties: [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] near [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Zoombezi Bay|Wyandot Lake]] in [[Powell, Ohio]], [[Darien Lake]] near [[Buffalo, New York]], and [[Lake Compounce]] in [[Bristol, Connecticut]]. In 1996, Premier added to its portfolio, buying Elitch Gardens in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]], the [[Waterworld California|Waterworld USA]] waterparks in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Concord, California]], [[Six Flags New England|Riverside Park]] in [[Agawam, Massachusetts]], and [[Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom]] in [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George, New York]]. Premier immediately sold the Lake Compounce park to [[Kennywood]] in Pennsylvania.

Geauga Lake, Wyandot Lake, and Adventure World included water parks, while Frontier City was 14.8 miles away from White Water Bay that required separate admission. Riverside added one just before being sold. Premier Parks, in 1995 and 1996, added water parks to Darien Lake, Lake Compounce (immediately before the Kennywood sale), Elitch Gardens, and Great Escape.

Premier went public in 1996 and raised nearly $70 million through an initial offering at $18 per share. The company planned to use the money to expand its ten parks and acquire others. In 1997, Premier purchased [[Kentucky Kingdom]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World]] near San Francisco. A second public offering, at $29 per share, raised an additional $2 million.

Nearly 8.8&amp;nbsp;million people visited Premier's parks in 1996.

Premier added amusement park rides and roller coasters to Marine World in 1998.

===Acquisition of Six Flags by Premier Parks===

Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc. was purchased in whole on April 1, 1998 from Time Warner by Premier Parks for $1.86&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Warner Completes Sale of Stake in Six Flags for $440 Million in Cash {{!}} Time Warner Inc.|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/1998/04/01/time-warner-completes-sale-of-stake-in-six-flags-for-440-million|work=Time Warner|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier began to apply the Six Flags name to several smaller parks that the company had already owned: Darien Lake, [[Elitch Gardens Theme Park|Elitch Gardens]], [[Kentucky Kingdom]], and Adventure World.

In 1999, Premier Parks purchased [[Warner Bros. Movie World Germany]] and the yet-to-be-built [[Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid]] from [[Warner Bros.]]. As part of the acquisition Premier Parks had the opportunity to open more European theme parks with Warner Bros. Movie World branding. [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] on the [[Gold Coast, Australia]] was not part of the deal. The same transaction saw Premier Parks obtain exclusive rights for Warner Bros. licensing in Europe and Latin America, in addition to their existing rights for the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="Premier Purchases WB's European Parks Division"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Tim|title=Premier Purchases WB's European Parks Division|journal=Amusement Business|date=October 18, 1999|volume=111|issue=42|pages=1, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Premier Parks assumed the ''Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc''. name and continued re-branding its parks, including the [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] park into Six Flags Ohio and Riverside Park to Six Flags New England. Six Flags began a vigorous expansion, attempting to branch out internationally, acquiring numerous properties across the USA, plus the [[Walibi]] chain, and the historic Belgian park [[Bellewaerde]] in Europe, [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, and [[Reino Aventura]] in Mexico. Three of those parks were re-branded as Six Flags parks: Walibi Flevo became [[Six Flags Holland]], Walibi Wavre became [[Six Flags Belgium]], and Reino Aventura became [[Six Flags Mexico]].

In 2001, Six Flags acquired the former [[SeaWorld#SeaWorld Ohio sale, re-birth, and eventual transition|SeaWorld Ohio]] from [[Busch Entertainment Corporation#History|Anheuser-Busch]], merged it with the adjacent Six Flags Ohio and re-branded the combined park as ''[[Six Flags Worlds of Adventure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inc.|first1=Six Flags,|title=Six Flags, Inc.

===Asset sales and shareholder revolt===
[[File:Katrina Killed the Clown.jpg|thumb|On August 29, 2005, [[Six Flags New Orleans]] was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]]]]

In 2004, Six Flags began to close and sell properties in an effort to help alleviate the company's growing debt. On March 10, Six Flags sold its European parks, with the exception of the Movie World park in [[Madrid]], Spain, to Star Parks, a division of Palamon Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palamon.com/investment-portfolio/detail/starparks|title=investment Detail StarParks|publisher=Palamon Capital Partners, LP|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Madrid park was sold back to Time Warner and renamed "[[Parque Warner Madrid]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meza|first1=Ed|title=Six Flags sells parks in Europe|url=https://variety.com/2004/biz/news/six-flags-sells-parks-in-europe-1117901725/|work=Variety|date=15 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Six Flags determined that the investment required to keep Worlds of Adventure competitive with Cedar Point would be too great, leading to that park being sold to [[Cedar Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=L.P.|first1=Cedar Fair,|title=Cedar Fair, L.P. to Acquire Six Flags Worlds of Adventure|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cedar-fair-lp-to-acquire-six-flags-worlds-of-adventure-72027297.html|work=www.prnewswire.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sales raised $345&amp;nbsp;million in an effort to relieve Six Flags' massive debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastergallery.com/SFSale.html |title=Six Flags sells numerous parks |publisher=CoasterGallery.com |date=March 10, 2004 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064605/http://www.coastergallery.com/SFSale.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Six Flags endured even more turmoil. Some of the company's largest investors, notably [[Bill Gates]]'s [[Cascade Investments]] (which then owned about 11% of Six Flags) and [[Daniel Snyder]]'s Red Zone, LLC (which owned 12%), demanded change. On August 17, 2005, Red Zone began a [[Proxy fight|proxy battle]] to gain control of Six Flags' board of directors. On August 29, [[Six Flags New Orleans]] was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]].

On September 12, Six Flags Chief Executive Officer Kieran Burke announced that [[Six Flags AstroWorld]] would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as the park's performance, and parking issues involving the [[Houston Texans]] football team, [[Reliant Stadium]], and the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]], leveraged with the estimated value of the property which included the park. Company executives were expecting to receive upwards of $150&amp;nbsp;million for the real estate, but ended up receiving $77&amp;nbsp;million when the bare property (which cost $20&amp;nbsp;million to clear) was sold to a development corporation in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Houston Business Journal – by Jennifer Dawson |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/05/08/daily27.html?from_rss=1 |title=Local developer to acquire former AstroWorld site – Houston Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= May 11, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, Red Zone announced it had gained control of the board. Kieran Burke was removed on December 14 and replaced by [[Mark Shapiro (media executive)|Mark Shapiro]], former executive vice president of programming at [[ESPN]]. Six Flags then named former [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jack Kemp]], entertainment mogul [[Harvey Weinstein]], and [[Michael Kassan]], the former president of the [[Interpublic Group of Companies Incorporated]], to their newly revamped board of directors.

Even with the new management team, the sell-off would continue into 2006. On January 27, Six Flags announced the sale of Frontier City and White Water Bay after the 2006 operating season. At the same time, Six Flags announced it would close corporate offices in Oklahoma City, moving its headquarters to New York City. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld. In June, Six Flags announced it was considering closing or selling up to six of its parks, including Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, WaterWorld in ([[Concord, California]]), [[Wild Waves Theme Park|Wild Waves and Enchanted Village]] in [[Federal Way, Washington]], [[Six Flags Splashtown|Splashtown]] in [[Houston, Texas]] and, most notably, [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/money/9415831/detail.html?rss=den&amp;psp=money |title=Six Flags Considers Selling Elitch Gardens – Money News Story – KMGH Denver |work=[[KMGH-TV]]|publisher=[[E.W.

=== Bankruptcy ===
The company's cash flow had decreased by over $120 million annually during the Shapiro years.

The parks are [[Darien Lake]], [[Frontier City]], [[Wet'n'Wild Phoenix]], [[Wet'n'Wild SplashTown]], and [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|White Water Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investors.sixflags.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2018/05-22-2018-210951050|title=Six Flags Adds Five More Parks to US Portfolio|website=investors.sixflags.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2018, Six Flags and  [[Rockford Park District]] announced a lease agreement allowing Six Flags to operate [[Magic Waters|Magic Waters Waterpark]] beginning Spring 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/news/ct-lns-six-flags-magic-waters-rockford-st-1010-story,amp.html|title=Six Flags strikes deal to operate Magic Waters in Rockford|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2018, Six Flags announced that the future of its [[Six Flags Dubai]] theme park was "uncertain" following losses at the company and its partner DXB Entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Flags' Future in Dubai Is Now Uncertain|url=https://skift.com/2018/10/24/six-flags-future-in-dubai-is-now-uncertain/|website=Skift|language=en|date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing efforts==

===TV commercials===

In 2004, although [[DC Comics]] and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' as well as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' still had a major presence at the parks, Six Flags began a new series of [[Television commercial|commercials]] for the parks. The commercials introduced a new mascot: "[[Mr. Six (mascot)|Mr. Six]]", a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie. In many of the commercials, Mr. Six would slowly exit a multi-colored bus, only to start frenetically dancing to the [[Vengaboys]]' "[[We Like to Party (Vengaboys song)|We Like to Party]]". The commercials were an immediate hit and Mr. Six almost instantly became the de facto mascot, and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired. These ads have become widely parodied on the Internet, with faces from other Internet memes being superimposed over Mr. Six's face.

From 2008 to 2010, Six Flags' TV ads consisted of a "Fun-O-Meter" in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a man's face judges it "One Flag!" or sometimes " Oh! Two Flags!" Then roller coasters and attractions of Six Flags are shown and says "Six Flags! More Flags, More Fun!" for Six Flags parks. However, the thick accent of the Asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amny.com/business/am-sixflags0805,0,3827486.story |title='Six Flags' TV ads get thumbs down from some Asian Americans |publisher=[[AM New York]] |last=Stride |first=Megan |date=August 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Mr. Six character came back from retirement and replaced the Asian man in Six Flags' ads, still using the Fun-O-Meter. In 2011, Six Flags' TV ads got a brand-new slogan "Go Big! Go Six Flags!" for its theme parks.

=== Licensing with other brands and companies ===
Six Flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies, who have used these assets to create licensed products. One notable such example is the theme park simulation game [[Roller Coaster Tycoon 2]], which featured recreations of Six Flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the player's discretion.

Six Flags has approximately 18 known partners.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} These partners include [[Dole Food Company|Dole]], [[Armitron]], [[Mike and Ike]], [[Barcel]], [[Good Humor]], [[Nathan's Famous]], [[Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Icee]], Ortega, [[Cold Stone Creamery]], [[J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp|J&amp;J Snack Foods]], [[Red Gold]], [[Coppertone (sunscreen)|Coppertone]], [[Johnny Rockets]], [[Samsung]], [[Dasani]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] and [[Tyson Foods]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} These businesses help the park generate more income. Most importantly it provides more jobs for prospective employees. For example, Barcel USA has just expanded its partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sponsorship.com/IEGSR/2013/06/24/A-Sweet-Song--Barcel-USA-Expands-Six-Flags-Partner.aspx|title=A Sweet Song: Barcel USA Expands Six Flags Partnership|publisher=IEG|date=June 23, 2013|accessdate=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helps to import food and beverages to increase sponsorships within the United States.

In 2008, Six Flags partnered with [[Brash Entertainment]] to create a video game based on the Six Flags parks named ''Six Flags Fun Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brash Entertainment and Six Flags Partner to Admit Gamers of All Ages to Six Flags Fun Park Videogame |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080605005326/en/Brash-Entertainment-Flags-Partner-Admit-Gamers-Ages |accessdate=25 November 2018 |language=en|date=2008-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was first released on the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] in October 2008. The Wii version was delayed after Brash Entertainment went out of business and so the rights were taken over by [[Ubisoft]] and released the game on the [[Wii]] in March 2009. The game allows players to explore the themed areas and mini-games representative of a visit to a Six Flags park. In the game, players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the park's universe. After creating a unique custom character, Six Flags Fun Park patrons can win prizes, and compete with other players in 40 mini-games. Although the video game is called ''Six Flags Fun Park'', it lacks any major reference of Six Flags outside of the names of the different areas. This caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately, then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the game's development.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} When the game was released, it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board. [[IGN]] gave the Wii version a 4.5 out of 10, saying "The quests are uninteresting and the game's '40 Thrilling Games' (as touted by the box) are far from entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ballard |first1=Adam |title=Six Flags Fun Park Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/15/six-flags-fun-park-review-2 |website=IGN |accessdate=25 November 2018 |date=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing non-Warner Bros. licensed theming from attractions. They terminated licenses with [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[The Wiggles]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Evel Knievel]], and ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Brady|title=Six Flags amusement parks prepare for thematic makeovers|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/themeparks/la-trb-six-flags-retheme-20101122,0,3267615.story|accessdate=November 27, 2010|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc|Tribune Publishing]]|date=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Brady|title=Six Flags Magic Mountain renaming Terminator wooden coaster|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/themeparks/la-trb-terminator-apocalypse-magic-mountain-20101203,1,1983895.story|accessdate=December 3, 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since then there has been an expansion of licensing agreements with [[Warner Bros.]], with whom the company park has had a long-standing relationship with. The expansion lies specifically with Warner Bros. [[DC Comics]] brand, where the two teamed up to create the innovative [[Justice League: Battle for Metropolis]] as well as many other roller coasters and other rides.

On May 18, 2017, Six Flags and Riverside Group signed an agreement with [[Paws, Inc.]] to use [[Garfield]] in children's areas in Six Flags-branded theme parks in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170518005768/en/Garfield-Signature-Character-Children’s-Areas-Flags-Branded-Theme|title=Garfield Signature Character Children's Areas Flags Branded Theme|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other assets===
On June 19, 2007, Six Flags announced it had purchased 40% of [[Dick Clark Productions]], which owns rights to ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and other shows and productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.sixflags.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=61629&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1016920&amp;highlight= |title=Six Flags – Investor Relations – Financial Release |publisher=Six Flags |date=June 19, 2007 |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Jim Reid-Anderson stated that the company would sell its stake in [[Dick Clark Productions]].

'''''Soeara Berbisa''''' ({{IPA-id|suˈara bərˈbisa|}}; [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''''Suara Berbisa'''''; Indonesian for ''Venomous Voice'') is a 1941 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Produced by Ang Hock Liem for [[Union Films]] and directed by R Hu, this [[black-and-white]] film starred [[Rendra Karno|Raden Soekarno]], Ratna Djoewita, Oedjang, and Soehaena. The story, written by Djojopranoto, follows two young men who compete for the affections of a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers.

Completed between September and October 1941, ''Soeara Berbisa'' featured ''[[keroncong]]'' music and was shot partly in western Java. It was released to coincide with the [[Eid al-Fitr]] holiday, and rated for all ages. Advertisements emphasised the film's appeal to both [[Native Indonesians|Native]] and Dutch audiences, and a review in ''[[De Indische Courant]]'' was positive. Although the film&amp;nbsp;– Union's penultimate production&amp;nbsp;– was screened as late as 1949, it is now likely [[lost film|lost]].

==Plot==
The young athlete Mitra and his sweetheart Neng Mardinah are to be wed. However, a young man named Mardjohan has fallen in love with Mardinah, and to win her heart he spreads rumours about Mitra being the son of a convicted criminal. In the backlash over the rumours, Mitra abandons the city and his beloved, hoping to find peace in the countryside.

There, Mitra finds work at a factory which is, coincidentally, owned by Mardjohan. Refusing the romantic advances of a worker there, he leaves the factory. One day, he comes across Mardjohan, gravely injured following an accident. Mitra saves the man, then takes him for treatment. Mardjohan's mother, seeing Mitra, believes that he is her son who went missing when he was aged three. She finds several witnesses who testify of the resemblance, and is ultimately able to prove  her suspicions. Meanwhile, Mitra's name is cleared, and he is reunited with Mardinah.{{efn|Plot derived from the summary in ''Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film'' {{harv|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Soeara Berbisa|p=29}}.}}

The sixth production of [[Union Films]], ''Soeara Berbisa'' was produced by Ang Hock Liem and directed by R Hu, an [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] director who had worked for the company since 1940; the sound technician Boen Kin Nam served as [[assistant director]]. The screenplay was written by Djojopranoto, who replaced Union's former screenwriter [[Saeroen]] after the latter left for rival company [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]] following ''[[Wanita dan Satria]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=234, 276}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Soeara Berbisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began production by September 1941,{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941a, Studio Nieuws|p=28}} and by October it was nearly complete.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941b, Studio Nieuws|p=28}}

''Soeara Berbisa'' starred [[Rendra Karno|Raden Soekarno]] and Ratna Djoewita, and featured the acting talents of Oedjang and Soehaena. Soekarno and Soehana were new hires,{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Soeara Berbisa|p=29}} whereas Oedjang and Djoewita had previously done work for Union; the former had been acting for Union since its first production, ''[[Kedok Ketawa]]'', in 1940, and the latter had held a role in ''Wanita dan Satria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Oedjang}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ratna Djoewita}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[black-and-white]] film included several ''[[keroncong]]'' songs, and was partly shot in the [[Parahyangan|Preanger]] region of west [[Java]].{{sfn|De Indische Courant 1942, Filmnieuws}}

==Release and reception==
Union announced that ''Soeara Berbisa'' would be released to coincide with the [[Eid al-Fitr]] holiday, which began on 22 October 1941,{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Soeara Berbisa|p=29}} and advertisements for screenings in [[Medan]], in northern [[Sumatra]], date to early November 1941.{{sfn|De Sumatra Post 1941, (untitled)}} A review in the [[Surabaya]] edition of ''[[De Indische Courant]]'', however, indicates that the film had only premiered in the east Javan city on 14 January 1942.{{sfn|De Indische Courant 1942, Filmnieuws}} That newspaper gave a positive review, describing ''Soeara Berbisa'' as a tense film with humorous moments and beautiful scenery. Its review ended with a recommendation that young people and their parents see the film.{{sfn|De Indische Courant 1942, Filmnieuws}}

''Soeara Berbisa'' was open to audiences of all ages.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1942, (untitled)}} To reach educated audiences, Union claimed to have "paid attention to dialogue, arranged it as best as possible in accordance with the wants of the Indonesian people".{{efn|Original: "'' ... moelai memperhatikan dialoognja, diatoer sebaik-baiknja dengan memperhatikan kemaoean penonton bangsa Indonesia''".}}{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Soeara Berbisa|p=29}} In Dutch-language newspapers, the film was advertised as "an interesting and fascinating tale of two young men in the world of indigenous sports",{{efn|Original: "''Een interessant en boeiend verhaal over de liefde van twee jonge menschen in de Inheemsche sportwereld.''"}} which nonetheless was produced in a "civilised" manner such that it could be appreciated by European audiences.{{efn|Original: "''Een productie, beschaafd zoowel in scenario als in spel, waardoor zij ook voor Europeesche begrippen niet stuitend is.''"}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1942, (untitled)}}

==Legacy==
Union's final production, ''[[Mega Mendoeng]]'', was directed by Boen and released in early 1942. It again starred Soekarno, though this time alongside the new find Sofiati. The company was closed after the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupied the Indies]] in March 1942,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=319, 332}}; {{harvnb|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Tirai Terbentang}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of its employees never returned to the film industry. Soekarno was an exception; he continued to act until the 1970s, though he was generally credited as Rendra Karno.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=397}}

''Soeara Berbisa'' was screened as late as February 1949.{{sfn|Pelita Rakjat 1949, (untitled)}} The film is likely [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} As such, American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

'''''Solstice Chronicles: MIA''''' is a [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] sci-fi shooter video game, developed by [[Ironward]] and published by Nkidu Games inc. for [[Microsoft Windows]]. The game was released on July 26, 2017 on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodgame.hr/solstice-chronicles-mia/|title=Solstice Chronicles: MIA - GoodGame.hr|website=www.goodgame.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a spinoff of the previous game [[The Red Solstice]]. It is a [[twin-stick shooter]], inspired by games such as [[Alien Shooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adria.ign.com/solstice-chronicles-mia/10212/preview/zaigrali-smo-solstice-chronicles-mia|title=Zaigrali smo Solstice Chronicles: MIA!|date=15 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is described "In a dead colony, a corporate marine is left far behind enemy lines. With an unlikely help of an insurgent drone, he faces the battle for survival against an army of murderous, mindless mutants... and worse things".

The single-player campaign is focused on a marine called Grunt and his drone, stranden on the planet of [[Mars]]. 

==Reception==
''The Red Solstice'' received mixed reviews upon release.  The game currently holds 68% on [[Metacritic]] based on 12 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/solstice-chronicles-mia|title=Solstice Chronicles: MIA|website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewing site GameCritics praised the game stating "Solstice Chronicles: MIA is a breath of fresh air in the twin-stick shooter genre. The threat system makes it feel like nothing else out there, transforming it from just another run-and-gun into something far more strategic and complex. It’s not a complete success, but it manages to add a satisfying amount of strategy without skimping on the action, which is a feat that I’m shocked no one has managed before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamecritics.com/daniel-weissenberger/solstice-chronicles-mia-review/|title=Solstice Chronicles: MIA Review – GameCritics.com|website=gamecritics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ZTGD was less positive, criticizing the absence of co-op and the rough edges of the game, as well as the bad storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ztgd.com/solstice-chronicles-mia/review/|title=Solstice Chronicles: MIA (PC) Review|date=1 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''striptease''' is an [[erotic dance|erotic]] or exotic [[dance]] in which the performer gradually undresses, either partly or completely, in a [[seduction|seductive]] and [[Sexual arousal|sexually]] suggestive manner.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wortley (1976) ''A Pictorial History of Striptease'': 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a "[[stripper]]" or exotic dancer.

In Western countries, the venues where stripteases are performed on a regular basis are now usually called [[strip club]]s, though they may be performed in venues such as [[pub]]s (especially in the UK), theaters and [[music hall]]s. At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at a [[bachelor party|bachelor]] or [[bachelorette party]]. In addition to providing [[adult entertainment]], stripping can be a form of [[Foreplay|sexual play]] between partners. This can be done as an impromptu event or&amp;nbsp;– perhaps for a special occasion&amp;nbsp;– with elaborate planning involving [[fantasy wear]], music, special lighting, practiced dance moves, or unrehearsed dance moves.

Striptease involves a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics such as the wearing of additional [[clothes]] or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the [[breast]]s or [[genitalia]]. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude.&lt;ref name="Richard Wortley 1976"&gt;Richard Wortley (1976) ''A Pictorial History of Striptease''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifton&gt;{{cite book|title=Baby Oil and Ice: Striptease in East London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgCfPQAACAAJ|first=Lara|last=Clifton|first2=Sarah|last2=Ainslie|first3=Julie|last3=Cook|publisher=Do-Not Press|year=2002|isbn=9781899344857}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them.

Striptease and public nudity have been subject to legal and cultural prohibitions and other aesthetic considerations and [[taboo]]s. Restrictions on venues may be through venue licensing requirements and constraints and a wide variety of national and local laws. These laws vary considerably around the world, and even between different parts of the same country.

[[H. L. Mencken]] is credited with coining the word ''ecdysiast''&amp;nbsp;– from "[[ecdysis]]", meaning "to molt"&amp;nbsp;– in response to a request from striptease artist Georgia Sothern, for a "more dignified" way to refer to her profession. [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], one of the most famous striptease artists of all time, approved of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamapubs.com/Self_Help/Father_s_I_Have_Known/Microsoft_Word_-_mencken-f.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fathers I Have Known&amp;nbsp;– H.L.

==History==
[[Image:1720 Der spanische teutsche und niederlaendische Krieg p238.png|thumb|right|250px|A 1720 depiction of a striptease&lt;ref&gt;Image from ''Der spanische, teutsche, und niederländische Krieg oder: des Marquis von ... curieuser Lebens-Lauff'', vol. 2 (Franckfurt/ Leipzig, 1720), p.238&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The origins of striptease as a performance art are disputed and various dates and occasions have been given from ancient Babylonia to 20th century America. The term "striptease" was first recorded in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webster|first1=Merriam|title=First known use of striptease 1932|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/striptease}}&lt;/ref&gt; though "stripping", in the sense of women removing clothing to sexually excite men, seems to go back to at least the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

There is a stripping aspect in the ancient Sumerian myth of the descent of the goddess [[Inanna]] into the Underworld (or Kur). At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. When she returned, [[fecundity]] abounded. Some believe this myth was embodied in the [[dance of the seven veils]] of [[Salome]], who danced for [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], as mentioned in the [[New Testament]] in Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:21-22. However, although the Bible records Salome's dance, the first mention of her removing seven veils occurs in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s [[Salome (play)|play of 'Salome']], in 1893.

In ancient Greece, the lawgiver [[Solon]] established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC. Among these classes of prostitutes were the [[auletrides]]: female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men.&lt;ref name="Zaplin 1998"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNM_xibHGIsC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=Solon+greece+auletrides#v=onepage&amp;q=Solon%20greece%20auletrides&amp;f=false|title=Female offenders: critical perspectives and effective interventions |authorlink= |year=1998 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |location=  |isbn= 978-0-8342-0895-7 |edition= |last1=Zaplin |first1=Ruth |page=351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffreys 2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9U7Eqp8NigC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=uk+strip+club+revenues#v=onepage&amp;q=uk%20strip%20club%20revenues&amp;f=false|title=The industrial vagina: the political economy of the global sex trade |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=  |isbn= 978-0-415-41233-9 |edition= |last1=Jeffreys |first1=Sheila |pages=86–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bassermann 1968"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQiLAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=auletrides+strip&amp;q=auletrides#search_anchor|title=The oldest profession: a history of prostitution |authorlink= |year=1968 |publisher=Stein and Day |location=  |isbn= 978-0-450-00234-2 |edition= |last1=Baasermann |first1=Lugo |pages=7–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Rome]], dance featuring stripping was part of the entertainments ''([[ludi]])'' at the [[Floralia]], an April festival in honor of the [[Flora (mythology)|goddess Flora]].&lt;ref&gt;As described by [[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 4.133ff.; [[Juvenal]], ''Satire'' 6.250–251; [[Lactantius]], ''Divine Institutes'' 20.6; Phyllis Culham, "Women in the Roman Republic," in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 144; Christopher H. Hallett, ''The Roman Nude: Heroic Portrait Statuary 200 B.C.–A.D. 300'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], wife of 6th-century Byzantine emperor [[Justinian]] is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a courtesan and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed "as far as the laws of the day allowed". She was famous for her striptease performance of "[[Leda and the Swan]]".&lt;ref name="Evans 2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8T9TJwcs_20C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=empress+Theodora+striptease+justinian#v=onepage&amp;q=striptease&amp;f=false|title=The Empress Theodora: Partner of Justinian |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=  |isbn= 978-0-292-70270-7 |edition= |last1=Evans |first1=James Allan|page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From these accounts, it appears that the practice was hardly exceptional nor new. It was, however, actively opposed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Church]], which succeeded in obtaining statutes banning it in the following century. The degree to which these statutes were subsequently enforced is, of course, opened to question. What is certain is that no practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages.

An early version of strip-tease became popular in England at the time of the [[Restoration drama|Restoration]]. A strip tease was incorporated into the [[Restoration comedy]] ''[[The Rover (play)|The Rover]]'', written by [[Aphra Behn]] in 1677. The stripper is a man; an English country gentleman who sensually undresses and goes to bed in a love scene. (However, the scene is played for laughs; the prostitute he thinks is going to bed with him robs him, and he ends up having to crawl out of the sewer.) The concept of strip-tease was also widely known, as can be seen in the reference to it in [[Thomas Otway]]'s comedy ''[[The Soldier's Fortune]]'' (1681), where a character says: "Be sure they be lewd, drunken, ''stripping'' whores".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hendrickson (1997) ''QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''. New York, Facts on File, Inc: 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Strip-tease became standard fare in the [[brothel]]s of 18th century [[London]], where the women, called 'posture girls', would strip naked on tables for popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strip-magazine.com/shocking-history-striptease|title=The Shocking History of striptease|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816205447/http://strip-magazine.com/shocking-history-striptease|archivedate=2013-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Fontaine - Tales and Novels in verse - v2 p130.jpg|thumb|225px|left|La Fontaine plate, 1896]]
Strip-tease was also combined with music, as in the 1720 German translation of the French ''La Guerre D'Espagne'' (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707), where a [[galant]] party of high aristocrats and opera singers has resorted to a small château where they entertain themselves with hunting, play and music in a three-day turn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dancers, to please their lovers the more, dropped their clothes and danced totally naked the nicest [[Entree (ballet)|entrées]] and [[ballet]]s; one of the princes directed the delightful music, and only the lovers were allowed to watch the performances.&lt;ref&gt;The German text reads "Die Tänzerinnen, um ihren Amant desto besser zu gefallen, zohen ihre Kleider ab, und tantzten gantz nackend die schönsten Entrèen und Ballets; einer von den Printzen dirigirte dann diese entzückende Music, und stunde die Schaubühne niemand als diesen Verliebten offen.", ''Der spanische, teutsche, und niederländische Krieg oder: des Marquis von ... curieuser Lebens-Lauff'', Bd. 2 (Franckfurt/ Leipzig, 1720), S.238, recapitulated in Olaf Simons, ''Marteaus Europa oder der Roman, bevor er Literatur wurde'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001), pp.617–635.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An [[Arabs|Arabic]] custom, first noted by French colonialists and described by the French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]] may have influenced the French strip-tease. The dances of the [[Ghawazee]] in North Africa and [[Egypt]] consisted of the erotic [[dance of the bee]] performed by a woman known as [[Kuchuk Hanem]]. In this dance the performer disrobes as she searches for an imaginary bee trapped within her garments. It is likely that the women performing these dances did not do so in an indigenous context, but rather, responded to the commercial climate for this type of entertainment.&lt;ref name="Parramore 2008"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsMgC7uXLXIC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=dance+of+the+bee+performed+by+a+woman+known+as+Kuchuk+Hanem#v=onepage&amp;q=dance%20of%20the%20bee%20performed%20by%20a%20woman%20known%20as%20Kuchuk%20Hanem&amp;f=false|title=Reading the Sphinx: Ancient Egypt in Nineteenth-Century Literary Culture |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |location=  |isbn= 978-0-230-60328-8 |edition= |last1=Parramore |first1=Lynn |page=132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle Eastern]] [[belly dance]], also known as oriental dancing, was popularized in the United States after its introduction on the [[Midway (fair)|Midway]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]] by a dancer known as [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Carlton 1994"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Looking+for+Little+Egypt&amp;q=midway#search_anchor|title=Looking for Little Egypt |authorlink= |year=1994 |publisher=IDD Books |location=  |isbn= 978-0-9623998-1-7 |edition= |last1=Carlton |first1=Donna |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim the origin of the modern striptease lies in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s [[Salome (play)|play of 'Salome']], in 1893. In the [[Dance of the Seven Veils]] the female protagonist dances for [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] and slowly removes her veils until she lies naked.&lt;ref&gt;Toni Bentley (2002) ''Sisters of Salome'': 31&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilde's play and [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[Salome (opera)|operatic version of the same]], first performed in 1905, the erotic 'dance of the seven veils', became a standard routine for dancers in opera, vaudeville, film and [[American burlesque|burlesque]]. A famous early practitioner was [[Maud Allan]] who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to [[King Edward VII]].

===French tradition===
[[File:Mata Hari 15.jpg|thumb|267px|Mata Hari. The most celebrated segment of her stage act was the progressive shedding of her clothing until she wore just a jeweled [[bra]] and some ornaments over her arms and head]]
In the 1880s and 1890s, [[Paris, France|Parisian]] shows such as the [[Moulin Rouge]] and [[Folies Bergère]] were featuring attractive scantily clad women dancing and [[tableaux vivants]]. In this environment, an act in the 1890s featured a woman who slowly removed her clothes in a vain search for a [[flea]] crawling on her body. ''[[The People's Almanac]]'' credits the act as the origin of modern striptease.

In 1905, the notorious and tragic Dutch dancer [[Mata Hari]], later shot as a spy by the French authorities during World War I, was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the [[Musée Guimet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hari/5.html|website=www.crimelibrary.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210044610/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hari/5.html|archive-date=10 February 2015|title=Mata Hari is Born|author=Denise Noe|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled [[bra]] and some ornaments over her arms and head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofbiography.com/9241-Mata%20Hari/life.htm Mata Hari] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806002604/http://www.worldofbiography.com/9241-Mata%20Hari/life.htm |date=August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos, who entered dressed only in three very small shells. In the 1920s and 1930s the famous [[Josephine Baker]] danced topless in the ''danse sauvage'' at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the [[Bal Tabarin (Paris)|Tabarin]]. These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. In his 1957 book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Roland Barthes]] interpreted this Parisian striptease as a "mystifying spectacle", a "reassuring ritual" where "evil is advertised the better to impede and exorcise it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/strip.html Striptease], in ''Mythologies'' by Roland Barthes, translated by Annette Lavers. Hill and Wang, bar New York, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s "fully nude" shows were provided at such places as [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Le Crazy Horse Saloon]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wortley (1976) ''A Pictorial History of Striptease'': 29-53&lt;/ref&gt;

===American tradition===
In the United States, striptease started in [[traveling carnival]]s and [[American burlesque|burlesque]] theatres, and featured famous strippers such as [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] and [[Sally Rand]]. The [[vaudeville]] [[trapeze artist]], [[Charmion]], performed a "disrobing" act onstage as early as 1896, which was captured in the 1901 [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] film, ''Trapeze Disrobing Act''.  Another milestone for modern American striptease is the possibly legendary show at [[Minsky's Burlesque]] in April 1925: [[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]. The Minsky brothers brought burlesque to New York's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. However the burlesque theatres here were prohibited from having striptease performances in a legal ruling of 1937 leading to the later decline of these "[[grindhouse]]s" (named after the bump 'n grind entertainment on offer) into venues for cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvictory.org/newvicMain.m |title=The New Victory Cinema |publisher=Newvictory.org |date=1995-12-11 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722001058/http://www.newvictory.org/newvicMain.m |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a revival of striptease in the form of topless [[go-go dancing]]. This eventually merged with the older tradition of burlesque dancing. [[Carol Doda]] of the [[Condor Club|Condor Night Club]] in the [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] section of San Francisco is given the credit of being the first [[Toplessness|topless]] go-go dancer.&lt;ref name=club&gt;''Nudity, Noise Pay Off in Bay Area Night Clubs'', [[Los Angeles Times]], February 14, 1965, Page G5.&lt;/ref&gt; The club opened in 1964 and Doda's première topless dance occurred on the evening of June 19 of that year.&lt;ref name=hole&gt;''California Solons May Bring End To Go-Go-Girl Shows In State'', [[Panama City News]], September 15, 1969, Page 12A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hole/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22039191_ITM|title=Naked Profits.|accessdate=2007-07-30|work=[[The New Yorker]]| date=2004-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large lit sign in front of the club featured a picture of her with red lights on her [[breasts]]. The club went "bottomless" on September 3, 1969 and began the trend of explicit "[[full nudity]]" in American striptease dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/1964?cat=technology |title=1964 |accessdate=2007-07-30 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was picked up by other establishments such as [[Apartment A Go Go]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arguments Heard On Nude Dancing'', [[Los Angeles Times]], April 16, 1969, pg.

===British tradition===

In Britain in the 1930s, when [[Laura Henderson]] began presenting nude shows at the [[Windmill Theatre]], London, the British law prohibited naked girls from moving. To get around the prohibition the models appeared in stationary [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref&gt;Vivien Goldsmith, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3648187/Windmill-always-nude-but-never-rude.html "Windmill: always nude but never rude"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 24 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The Windmill girls also toured other London and provincial theatres, sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round, though strictly speaking, staying within the letter of the law by not moving of their own volition. Another example of the way the shows stayed within the law was the [[fan dance]], in which a naked dancer's body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants, until the end of her act in when she posed nude for a brief interval whilst standing still.

In 1942, [[Phyllis Dixey]] formed her own company of girls and rented the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London to put on a review called The Whitehall Follies.

By the 1950s, touring striptease acts were used to attract audiences to the dying music halls. Arthur Fox started his touring shows in 1948 and Paul Raymond started his in 1951. Paul Raymond later leased the Doric Ballroom in [[Soho]] and opened his private members club, the Raymond Revuebar in 1958. This was one of the first of the private striptease members clubs in Britain.

[[Image:Windmill-Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Windmill Theatre]] in 2009]]

In the 1960s, changes in the law brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho with "fully nude" dancing and audience participation.&lt;ref name="Murray Goldstein 2005"&gt;{{cite book|first=Murray|last=Goldstein|year=2005|title=Naked Jungle: Soho Stripped Bare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ToqAAAACAAJ|publisher=Silverback Press|isbn=9780954944407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pubs were also used as a venue, most particularly in the [[East End]] with a concentration of such venues in the district of [[Shoreditch]]. This pub striptease seems in the main to have evolved from topless go-go dancing.&lt;ref name="It Started With Theresa"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jivMPoquDfAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bill+Martland#PPA5,M1 |title=It Started With Theresa |date= March 2006|accessdate=2012-08-01|isbn=9781411651784 |last1=Martland |first1=Bill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though often a target of local authority harassment, some of these pubs survive to the present day. An interesting custom in these pubs is that the strippers walk round and collect money from the customers in a beer jug before each individual performance. This custom appears to have originated in the late 1970s when topless go-go dancers first started collecting money from the audience as the fee for going "fully nude".&lt;ref name="It Started With Theresa"/&gt; Private dances of a more raunchy nature are sometimes available in a separate area of the pub.&lt;ref name=Clifton/&gt;

===Japan===
Striptease became popular in Japan after the end of World War II. When entrepreneur Shigeo Ozaki saw [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] perform, he started his own striptease revue in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] neighborhood. During the 1950s, Japanese "strip shows" became more sexually explicit and less dance-oriented, until they were eventually simply [[sex show|live sex shows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shteir|first=Rachel|title=Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show|page=264|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-512750-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pole dancer 04.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A pole dancer]]

==Today==

Recently [[Pole dance|pole dancing]] has come to dominate the world of striptease. In the late 20th century, pole dancing was practised in exotic dance clubs in Canada. These clubs grew up to become a thriving sector of the economy. Canadian style pole dancing, [[Table dance|table dancing]] and [[Lap dance|lap dancing]], organized by multi-national corporations such as [[Spearmint Rhino]], was exported from North America to (among other countries) the United Kingdom, the nations of central Europe, Russia and Australia. In London, England a raft of such so-called "lap dancing clubs" grew up in the 1990s, featuring pole dancing on stage and private table dancing, though, despite media misrepresentation, lap-dancing in the sense of bodily contact was forbidden by law.&lt;ref&gt;Vlad Lapidos (1996) ''The Good Striptease Guide to London''. Tredegar Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Feature shows" are used to generate interest from potential customers who otherwise would not visit the establishment but know the performer from other outlets. A headlining star of a striptease show is referred to as a ''feature dancer'', and is often a performer with credits such as contest titles or appearances in adult films or magazines. The decades-old practice continued through the late 2000s (decade) to the present day with high-profile adult film performers such as [[Jenna Haze]] and [[Teagan Presley]] scheduling feature shows through the USA.

In December 2006, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] court ruled that striptease is an art form and made strip clubs exempt from [[value added tax]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6213222.stm Stripping is art, Norway decides]. December 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Burlesque===
{{Main|Neo-Burlesque}}
In the latter 1990s, a number of solo performers and dance groups emerged to create [[Neo-burlesque]], a revival of the classic [[American burlesque]] striptease of the early half of the 20th century. New Burlesque focuses on dancing, costumes and entertainment (which may include comedy and singing) and generally eschews full nudity or toplessness. Some burlesquers of the past have become instructors and mentors to New Burlesque performers such as [[:fr:The Velvet Hammer Burlesque|The Velvet Hammer Burlesque]] and [[The World Famous Pontani Sisters]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The pop group [[Pussycat Dolls]] began as a New Burlesque troupe.

[[File:ChippendalesLasVegas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Chippendales]] dancers are a famous group of male strippers.]]

==Male strippers==
{{main|Male stripper}}
Until the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Since then, male strippers have also become common. Before the 1970s, dancers of both sexes appeared largely in underground clubs or as part of a theatre experience, but the practice eventually became common enough on its own.  One of the better-known troupes of male strippers are the [[Chippendales]]. Male strippers have become a popular option to have at a [[bachelorette party]].

==Private dancing==
{{Main|Lap dance}}
A variation on striptease is private dancing, which often involves [[lap dance|lap dancing]] or contact dancing. Here the performers, in addition to stripping for tips, also offer "private dances" which involve more attention for individual audience members. Variations include private dances like [[table dance|table dancing]] where the performer dances on or by customer's table rather than the customer being seated in a couch.

==Striptease and the law==
{{Main|Legal status of striptease}}
From ancient times to the present day, striptease was considered a form of [[public nudity]] and subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on [[morality|moral]] and [[indecent exposure|decency]] grounds.  Such restrictions have been embodied in venue licensing regulations and various national and local laws, including liquor licensing restrictions.

[[File:IndigoBlueMissExoticWorld2006.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Neo-burlesque]] stripper at the [[Miss Exotic World Pageant]] in 2006, showing the use of [[pasties]] as required in some U.S. jurisdictions]]

===U.S.===
Numerous U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease. One of the more notorious local ordinances is San Diego Municipal Code 33.3610,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.sandiego.gov/municode/MuniCodeChapter03/Ch03Art03Division36.pdf |title=Ch03Art03Division36 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/probe/20050719-9999-1n19council.html|title=More bad news?

LaVelle|date=19 July 2005|newspaper=The San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included contacts in the nude entertainment industry. Among its provisions is the "six foot rule", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance while performing.

Other rules forbid "full nudity". In some parts of the USA, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by [[pasties]] by the dancer (though no such taboo applies to the exposure of male nipples).&lt;ref name="Richard Wortley 1976"/&gt; In early 2010, the city of Detroit banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&amp;id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |title=Houston topless clubs lose case, may respond to Supreme Court with pasties |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-03-29 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192107/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&amp;id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html Detroit Passes New Strip Club Rules - Detroit Local News Story - WDIV Detroit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609032414/http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html |date=June 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but kept other restrictions.

=== Britain ===
In Britain in the 1930s, when the [[Windmill Theatre]], London, began to present nude shows, British law prohibited performers moving whilst in a state of nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham, "The Cambridge guide to theatre", [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}, page 803&lt;/ref&gt;  To get around that rule, models appeared naked in stationary [[tableaux vivants]]. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. [[Fan dance]]s were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer's body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage. Changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho, with "fully nude" dancing and audience participation.&lt;ref name="Murray Goldstein 2005"/&gt; Following the introduction of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]], a local authority licence is required for venues in England and Wales (and later Scotland) where live nude entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100413151441/http:/crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimereduction057a.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100413151441/http:/crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimereduction057a.pdf|format=pdf|archive-date=13 April 2010|title=Sexual Entertainment Venues: Guidance for England and Wales|date=March 2010|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echo NewLaws 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/8212913.Tough_new_rules_on_strip_club_openings/ | title = Tough new rules on strip club openings | accessdate = 2010-06-11 | work = Echo | date = 2008-06-11 | last1 = Orbach | first1 = Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Darkside Detective''''' is a 2017 video game developed and published by Spooky Doorway. It was released on 27 July 2017.

==Plot==

Detective Francis McQueen, who leads the underfunded Darkside Division must investigate evil occurrences in Twin Lakes City.

==Development==

Creators Paul Conway and Christopher Colston originally created a short demo at a gaming convention in Galway. The demo was made in under eight hours, but received significant attention after it was posted online, promoting them to turn it into a full game. After decided to enter production on the game, they hired writer Dave McCabe and lead developer Tracey McCabe to assist in the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Dean |date=July 7, 2017 |url=http://gametyrant.com/news/interview-the-darkside-detective-will-be-a-comical-suspense |title=Interview: THE DARKSIDE DETECTIVE Will Be A Comical Suspense |publisher=Game Tyrant |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the development process, the team of five would do group read throughs to discuss issues and ideas, with McCabe then creating an interactive version of any ideas that they had using clipart to allow them to further map out how it would work within the game. Once an idea was decided on, the team would then start creating visuals, animations, interactions, sound and music based around the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|date=September 1, 2017 |url=https://www.indiegraze.com/2017/09/01/interview-the-darkside-detective-development-team/ |title=Interview: The Darkside Detective Development Team |publisher=Indie Graze |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The Darkside Detective received mostly positive reviews and has a score of 75% on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date= |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-darkside-detective |title=The Darkside Detective Metacritic Listing |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hardcore Gamer]] awarded it a score of 3.5 out of 5, saying "The Darkside Detective is a charming point and click adventure with a taste for the sillier aspects of horror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Estrada  |first=Kenny |date=July 27, 2017 |url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/07/27/review-the-darkside-detective/266210/ |title=Review: The Darkside Detective |publisher=[[Hardcore Gamer]] |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video Gamer awarded it 7 out of 10, saying "The Darkside Detective has a very distinct sense of humour that you'll either love or hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bell  |first=Alice |date=August 30, 2017|url=https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/the-darkside-detective-review |title=The Darkside Detective review |publisher=VideoGamer |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Hentschke of [[Dread Central]] praised the gameplay and atmosphere but criticising its short length, saying "If the game were 50% longer, I would be in serious danger of genuinely loving it. As it is, it’s just a fun diversion for a few hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hentschke |first=Ted |date=August 7, 2017|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/245718/darkside-detective-video-game/ |title=The Darkside Detective review |publisher=[[Dread Central]] |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Donnellan of Cultured Vultures awarded it a score of 8 out of 10, saying "Funny and offbeat, The Darkside Detective is a joyful but basic point and click game that is simply over too soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Donnellan |first=Jimmy |date=February 7, 2018

'''''The Soup''''' &lt;!--do NOT change to was--&gt;is&lt;!--per Wikipedia guidelines--&gt; an American television series that aired weekly on [[E!]] from July 1, 2004 until December 18, 2015. The program was a [[spin-off (media)|revamped]] version of ''[[Talk Soup]]'' that focused on recaps of various [[popular culture]] and television moments of the week. The show was hosted by comedian [[Joel McHale]], who provided [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] and [[satire|satirical]] commentary on the various clips. On November 18, 2015, ''The Soup'' was cancelled by E! and its last episode aired December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/18/the-soup-canceled-e-joel-mchale|title=The Soup canceled: Joel McHale to host final show on Dec. 18|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s EW.com|date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2018, ''[[The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale]]'', a [[spiritual successor]] to ''The Soup'', premiered on [[Netflix]].

==History==
''The Soup'' started on July 1, 2004 as the "What The...? Awards", but the name was changed to maintain name recognition with ''[[Talk Soup]]''.&lt;ref name="seattletimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2002011472_joelmchale22.html|title=From Mercer Island, jumping into ''The Soup''|publisher=The Seattle Times|first=Nicole|last=Brodeur|date=2004-08-23|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2013, ''The Soup'' debuted a new graphics package, including a new logo designed by Newspeak Agency.

Starting June 2, 2014, ''The Soup'' began airing live episodes. Originally only to last for one month, the program has since become a live show.

On November 18, 2015 ''The Soup'' was cancelled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] due to multiple references to "killing Baby [[Hitler]]". As the episode was pre-filmed, it later aired on November 27, likely replacing a clip show due to it being [[Black Friday (shopping)|the day after Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thesoup/photos/a.10150143094305874.332544.12637555873/10153685321840874/?type=3|title=The Soup - Timeline Photos|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The show features the host, Joel McHale, on a [[Chroma key|green-screened]] set with a screen to his right. The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. McHale introduces each clip, which is then played. He then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips.

Although the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.&lt;ref name="ew-interview"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20184375,00.html | title=The Q&amp;A: ''Soup'' Guy Joel McHale Answers Your Questions | first=Mandi | last=Bierly | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2008, a blog was started for ''The Soup'' on E!'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/132968-E_Unveils_Revamped_Web_Site.php | title=E! Unveils Revamped Web Site | first=Larry | last=Barrett | date=2008-04-22 | accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular characters===
''The Soup'' has its own cast of recurring characters. They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxipad ([[Tess Rafferty]], a supervising producer and the only female writer on ''The Soup''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zukey Staff|title=Interview: Tess Rafferty|url=http://zulkey.com/zulkey_test/2012/11/the-tess-rafferty-interview.html|accessdate=24 November 2016|work=Zukey|date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  two nerds who dress as ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting [[sound effect]] purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca ([[Chewbacca]]'s lawyer), and "[[Spaghetti Cat]]", a cat eating spaghetti from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]''. Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's [[stage manager]] and former stage manager on ''[[Talk Soup]]'', and Kelly Levy (''née'' Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, have made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying [[Courtney Stodden]]. Executive producer Edward Boyd's [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] '''Lou''' is used regularly in segment openings, most notably the "Clip of the Week", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with Joel at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week, until the intro was changed in early 2010.  The current intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer [[Anndi McAfee]] and a "reaction" by another clip, wildly out of context.

==Regular features==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Soup Set.png|250px|right|thumb|The set of ''The Soup'' with previous logo used until 2013]] --&gt;
The show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:
* "Chat Stew", which features clips from talk shows. Joel introduces the segment with either, "Let's have some chat stew, shall we?" or a reference to the previous clip being used for chat stew. Previously, the intro clip indicates a crockpot showing different talk shows in bubbles inside is shown with a rock intro, then the words CHAT STEW hit the top, cracking it. The  introduction is voiced by producer Kelly Andrews (who also does the show's introduction voice overs) saying, "So meaty." Audience members sometimes reply with a groan or "Ew." As of 2013, a new intro card shows a kettle sucking up all the TV sets that broadcast different talk shows, then regurgitates them back out. The rock intro and the "So meaty." audios are kept.
* "Chicks, Man" which focuses on female celebrity news. Joel introduces clip with, "Let's talk about chicks, man." and a slightly deep male voice repeats, "Chicks, man." while a picture of baby [[Bird|chicks]] appears on the screen.
* "Reality Show Clip Time!", which features clips from current [[reality television|reality shows]]. Joel introduces segment with, "It's reality show clip time." (or sometimes total gibberish or other stuff), and the words REALITY SHOW CLIP TIME appear on the screen over a quick rock riff.
* "Let's Take Some E!", a segment featuring clips from other programs shown on E!, jokingly described by McHale as a contractual obligation. The name of the segment (along with its intro) is a reference to the [[party drug]] [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]], which is commonly known as "E".
* The show ends with the "Clip of the Week", a clip considered to be the best clip shown on TV in the past week.  After Joel finishes joking about the next-to-last clip, he introduces this one with "...which brings us to our Clip of the Week."

===Other segments===
''The Soup'' has also featured other recurring segments:
* "What's Pissing Off [[Steve Edwards (talk show host)|Steve Edwards]] This Week?" features clips from [[KTTV]]'s ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' in which something or somebody makes Steve Edwards upset in the clip. Another episode featured a parody of the segment, "What's Exciting [[Rick Dickert]] This Week?"
* "Tales from Home Shopping" features clips from home shopping channels such as [[QVC]] or [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]].
* "Oprah's Vajayjay" features clips and or related to Oprah's discussions about the female anatomy.
* "What the Kids Are Watching", whose intro started with a boy and a girl watching TV, and ended with the sound of those children crying uncontrollably, showcases unusual and weird clips from children's shows and commercials aimed at children, such as  ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]''. Two spinoff segments have been produced based on the segment: "What the Old Folks Are Watching", which no longer airs, does the same for content geared toward older people, and "What Your Boyfriend's Looking At" features clips of shows targeting males with Kelly Andrews asking "Are you even listening to me?!" to which a man in the audience nearly always responds with, "No!"
* Segments featuring clips from international programs have also been featured, such as "Clippos Magnificos" (which features Spanish programs), "Souper Fantastic Ultra Wish Time!" (which features Japanese programs), and the "International House of Soup."
* "Cyber Smack" featured the best viral videos from the internet. This segment eventually spun-off as ''[[Web Soup]]''.
* "My Stories" shows clips from daytime soap operas, such as ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. A running gag on the show includes increasingly unrelated and random music being played with the segment's title card.
* "Miley Cyrus News" documents stories involving [[Miley Cyrus]], which always begins with producer Kelly Andrews yelling "It's Miley!" Variations include stories involving [[Britney Spears]] in which a highly modulated voice exclaims, "It's Britney, bitch!" or [[Lindsay Lohan]] news in which an overly hoarse and unenthusiastic voice states, "It's Lindsay".
* "Local Newsbreak" features embarrassing clips from local newscasts
* "Ad Nauseam" pokes fun at commercials, often with McHale misusing the product after the clip is done.
* "The Mail Nurse" showcases [[viral videos]] found on the Internet, and opens with Joel in a nurse's outfit seductively saying "It's time to check your RAM" as his nurse's cap clumsily slides off his head.  McHale often comments on how much he hates this intro.
* "Stay Out of It [[Nick Lachey]]" features clips from ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' with cast members saying "Stay out of it Nick Lachey"
* "Gay Shows" features clips from [[LGBT]]-related television shows such as ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''. The segment is introduced with a title card featuring ultra-masculine things such as monster trucks and motorcycles while a heavy rock guitar solo plays. The title card ends with a gruff male voice saying the segment's name.
* "Gay Shows: Alaska Edition" features clips from Alaskan reality shows such as ''[[Gold Rush Alaska]]''. The segment has the same introduction as "Gay Shows" except that it has pictures of bears added to the intro.
* "Take A Look At Myke Hawke" involves clips from [[Mykel Hawke]]'s shows.  Typically Joel pronounces his name "my [[human penis|cock]]" and make several [[phallic]]-themed jokes while introducing the clip.
* "Gavel Bangin'" is a segment where reality courtroom shows are mocked, especially Nancy Grace's ''Swift Justice''. The title sequence is accompanied with ''The Soup'' voiceover's sexy voice saying, "All rise."
* [[Charlie Sheen]] News: Features news topics regarding Charlie Sheen. Introduced with a clip of Sheen saying, "Everything's good, everything's good."
* "RRRrrr with [[Brian Williams]]" showcases various clips from Williams' [[NBC]] show "[[Rock Center with Brian Williams|Rock Center]]". The segment opens with an angry cat popping up suddenly, and a person imitating the cat growling.
* "Unlikely Voice of Reason" involves a clip in which a much-ridiculed character such as [[Greg Kelly]] or [[Stephanie Pratt]] says something unexpected and intelligent.
* "Clippos Magnificos" which shows clips from the melodramatic [[telenovelas]] shown on Spanish language television.The clips are introduced with an image of a [[piñata]] while [[The  Mexican Hat Dance]] plays in the background.The piñata explodes and a man with a strong [[Spanish language|Spanish]] accent says "Are you serious?". McHale will then mention the name of the show and say "which I'm pretty sure means...", then give a ridiculous, comic translation of the show's title in English.

==Recurring jokes==
The show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of [[Ryan Seacrest]]. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.

Joel has also spoofed other actors, most notably ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' leading man [[David Caruso]], who plays Lieutenant [[Horatio Caine]]. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2–3 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.

Joel also jokes about how self-centered [[Tyra Banks]] is on [[The Tyra Banks Show|her self-titled talk show]].  More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's "creepy flesh colored beard" as well as the ages of [[Larry King]] and [[Regis Philbin]] and how they are still alive.  Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses "interns" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to "shoot" Mankini, but with no effect.

The [[Spaghetti Cat]] from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.

Joel has often made fun of [[Bruno Tonioli]]'s flamboyancy while giving comments on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel ''Jazz Hands and Cold Feet''.

''The Soup'' makes jokes at the A&amp;E TV Series, ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]''. Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say "That's Right It's Steven Seagal", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal ''[[energy drink]]'' that would humorously float into frame.

Due to NFL Coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s recent appearance on ''[[Survivor: Nicaragua|Survivor]]'', Joel usually mentions his "Extenze-enhanced penis", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, "I do."

===Clips===
A number of clips have been repeatedly shown on ''The Soup''. One clip features [[Oprah Winfrey]] saying "My [[vagina|va-jay-jay]] is painin'!" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28vajayjay.html | title = What Did You Call It? | work=The New York Times | first = Stephanie | last = Rosenbloom | date = 2007-10-28 | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another clip involves [[Whitney Houston]] yelling "Kiss My Ass!" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites.&lt;ref name="ew-interview" /&gt; Still another clip that is often shown is of ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s news correspondent [[Ann Curry]] starting her report by saying, "Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of [[Kendra Wilkinson]] from ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] screaming "Marriage?! Noooooo!" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of  [[Danny Noriega]] ("I guess some people weren't likin' it!"), and more recently, [[Tatiana Del Toro]] giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include [[Gary Busey]] exclaiming "I'm going to pull your [[endocrine system]] out of your body", [[Tila Tequila]] yelling out "A pig's vagina!", [[Michelle Galdenzi]] from ''[[Scream Queens (2008 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' saying "and by record, I mean vagina.", ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' contestants [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)#Jase|Jase Wirey]] and [[List of Big Brother 10 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Michelle|Michelle Costa]] "talking" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; "[[Tetrazzini|Chicken Tetrazzini]]" clip from ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'', Spencer Pratt from ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' whispering "That's the problem", Billy Bush saying "It's Gross", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice "Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!". Recently, the [[Jeffrey Osborne]] song, "[[On the Wings of Love (Jeffrey Osborne song)|On the Wings of Love]]", has been used to mock the current season of ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]''. Vonda, a woman featured on the [[TruTv]] show ''Over the Limit'' has been featured saying, "Dunka Doo Balls." This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from ''[[Fantasia for Real]]'' featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, "Gurl Please", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of "Ma" from TruTV's ''[[Ma's Roadhouse]]'' saying "He's a douchebag," after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as [[Mel Gibson]], has come into use. Another clip of [[Ryan Seacrest]] saying, "Hell no, say what", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's ''[[The Fashion Show (U.S. TV series)|The Fashion Show]]'', has recently been featured in a clip saying, "Oh, here go Hell Come." Frequently following ''Good Day New York'' clips, McHale will ask [[Greg Kelly]] to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, "Science".

===Edited clips===
''The Soup'' will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'' and ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'') or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying "We doctored that."  However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by ''The Soup'' for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand "We did not doctor this."

===Original content===
Original skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (in reference to McHale's appearance in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''), '' [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', '' [[Made of Honor]]'', ''[[Righteous Kill]]'', ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia]]'', '' [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', '' [[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'',  (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about [[Disney Channel]] celebrities), ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'', ''[[Fast &amp; Furious]]'', and a [[Tyler Perry]] movie.

Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two "Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called "Love and Other Burning Sensations", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on ''The Soup'' (the "shows [they] just cannot quit"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).

==Reception==
''The Soup'' started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!. By 2006 it was the third highest rated show on the network.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/arts/television/29rhod.html | title = His Pointed Looks Speak Louder Than Punch Lines | work=The New York Times | first = Joe | last = Rhodes | date = 2006-10-29 | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, ''The Soup'' averaged 682,000 viewers, and about 56 percent of viewers watch a recorded version of the show. The 500th episode of ''The Soup'' recorded 909,000 viewers, with 653,000 of those in the 18—49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-soups-500th-delivers-613605 | title = TV Ratings: 500th 'The Soup' Is Its Most-Watched Episode of Year | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first = Philiana | last = Ng| date = 2013-08-23 | accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-hour finale on December 18, 2015 ended with 561,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-update-12-18-2015.html|title=SHOWBUZZDAILY’s Top 150 Friday Cable Originals &amp; Network Update: 12.18.2015|work=ShowBuzzDaily|date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2015|first=Mitch|last=Metcalf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
Since E! is owned by Comcast Entertainment Group, their now-defunct sibling networks aired tailored versions for their networks, including [[Style Network|Style]], [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], all taped in the same studio and utilizing the same crew.

===''The Dish''===
{{Main|The Dish (TV series)}}
On August 16, 2008, Style premiered ''The Dish'', hosted by [[Danielle Fishel]]. The show focused more on celebrity, magazine, and [[fashion industry]] trends, along with style and fashion-related reality programs in more detail, including ''[[Project Runway]]'' and various shows on the shopping channels, [[HGTV]] and [[DIY Network]]. It was cancelled on March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBC and Comcast was complete. It was thought{{By whom|Reason = Was this press speculation or just Internet chatter?|date=May 2015}} the cancellation was the direct result of former competitors [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] coming under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style; the two networks and their programming had been among the major comedic targets of ''The Dish''.

===''Sports Soup''===
{{Main|Sports Soup}}
On September 15, 2008, E! parent Comcast Entertainment Group announced another spin-off, this time sports-related, of the series, which aired on the group's sports network, Versus (now known as [[NBC Sports Network]] since 2012), called ''[[Sports Soup]]'' and was hosted by [[Matt Iseman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992162.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2565 | work=Variety | title=E! heats up 'Sports Soup' | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debuted on October 14, the program once aired twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Later, production was reduced to weekly at 10 pm ET on Tuesdays (or later depending on the end of ''[[NHL on Versus]]'' or other sports coverage). It was cancelled on July 15, 2010.

===''Web Soup''===
{{Main|Web Soup}}
A third version, airing on G4, titled ''Web Soup'', hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]] debuted June 7, 2009 at 9 pm ET. This version is more of a blend of the commentary and reaction portions of ''The Soup'' and two other G4 programs; ''Whacked Out Videos'' and the ''Around the Net'' viral video segment which opens ''[[Attack of the Show]]''. This show ended after its 3rd season on July 20, 2011.

===''Celebrity Soup''===
{{Main|Celebrity Soup}}
''Celebrity Soup'' was the [[List of British television programmes based on American television series|British version of the American show]] hosted by comedian [[Iain Lee]]. Unlike ''The Soup'', ''Celebrity Soup'' airs 19 episodes in a season, instead of year-round like in the United States. It had some of the same features as the original (i.e. "Chat Stew"), but also has its own running gags and features. The series had a similar set, with a window overlooking London's [[Big Ben]] instead of [[Hollywood]], as in the U.S. original.

===''The Soup Investigates''===
{{Main|The Soup Investigates}}
''The Soup Investigates'' was a spin-off of The Soup. It features most of the same crew, including Joel McHale as the host. In the spin-off, the reporters go looking for potentially funny celebrity news stories. It is a spoof of [[investigative journalism]].

The '''zombie ball''' is a classic [[magic (illusion)|magic trick]] first introduced by [[Joe Karson]] in the 1940s. It remains a staple of many shows to this day. [[Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed|''Magic's Biggest Secrets'']] called it one of the most popular tricks in the world.

==Effect==
The magician places a large metal ball on a small pedestal on a table. The ball is then covered with a large silk cloth which the magician holds above the ball. The ball then begins to lift into the air and move about under the cloth, before appearing out from under cloth to roll along the upper edge of the stretched-out cloth, or along the magician's arms. The ball may also disappear and re-appear as it moves about. The ball is finally coaxed to return to its pedestal and the cloth is removed.

==Method==	
The usual way this effect is done is with a rod that clips to the finger, and is hidden from view by the cloth. By simply moving his finger (generally his thumb), the magician can achieve an almost lifelike reaction from the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent
