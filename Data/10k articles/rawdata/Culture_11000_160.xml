'''Alfred W. Crosby Jr.''' (January 15, 1931, [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] – March 14, 2018, [[Nantucket Island]]) was Professor Emeritus of [[History]], [[Geography]], and [[American Studies]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[Harvard University]] and [[University of Helsinki]]. He was the author of such books as ''[[The Columbian Exchange]]'' (1972) and ''[[Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900|Ecological Imperialism]]'' (1986). In these works, he provided biological and geographical explanations for the question why Europeans were able to succeed with relative ease in what he referred to as the Neo-Europes of [[Australasia]], [[North America]], and southern [[South America]].

==Career==
Crosby studied at Harvard University and [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name = Saikku&gt;{{cite news

Crosby was an inter-disciplinary researcher who combined the fields of history, [[geography]], [[biology]] and [[medicine]].&lt;ref name = Saikku /&gt; Recognizing the majority of modern-day wealth is located in [[Europe]] and the Neo-Europes, Crosby set out to investigate what historical causes are behind the disparity, investigating the biological factors that contributed to the success of Europeans in their quest to conquer the world. One of the important themes of his work was how [[epidemic]]s affected the history of [[Human|mankind]]. As early as the 1970s, he was able to understand the impact of the [[1918 flu pandemic]] on world history.&lt;ref name = Saikku /&gt;

According to [[Hal Rothman]], a Professor of History at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Crosby “added biology to the process of human exploration, coming up with explanations for events as diverse as [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés’ conquest of Mexico]] and the fall of the [[Inca Empire|Inca empire]] that made vital use of the physical essence of humanity.”&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Hal. "Conceptualizing the Real." American Quarterly 54.3 (2002): 485–497. ProQuest. University of Washington, Lynnwood. November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 he created the term ''Columbian Exchange'' in his book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Alfred W. ''The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492'', Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The term has become popular among historians and journalists, such as [[Charles C. Mann]], whose 2011 book ''[[1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created]]'' expands and updates Crosby's original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosby was also interested in the [[history of science]] and [[History of technology|technology]]. He wrote several books on this subject, dealing with the history of [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], of [[projectile]] technology, and the history of the use of [[energy]]. He said himself that the study of history also made him a researcher of the future. He was very much interested in how humankind could make the future a better one.&lt;ref name = Saikku /&gt;

He has taught at [[Washington State University]], [[Yale University]], the [[Alexander Turnbull Library]] in [[New Zealand]], and twice at the [[University of Helsinki]] as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Bicentennial Professor]], most recently in 1997–98. He was appointed an [[Suomen Akatemia|academician]] by [[Finland|Finnish]] [[President of Finland|president]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]]. He retired from the chair of Professor Emeritus of History, Geography, and [[American Studies]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1999.&lt;ref name = Saikku /&gt;

Crosby’s hobbies included [[birdwatching]] and [[jazz]], on which topic he could lecture with great expertise. He was married to [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref name = Saikku /&gt;

The '''Altavista petroglyph complex''' is located near the village and beach-town of [[Chacala]], south of the Compostela Municipality, in [[Nayarit]] [[Mexico]].

The area is known as "La Pila del Rey", "Chacalán", "El Santuario", "The Petroglyphs” or "the Altavista petroglyphs", near the Jaltemba Bay, in the Pacific Ocean of Nayarit.&lt;ref name= Richard &gt;{{cite journal |last= Lawhorn |first= Richard |date= |title= Petroglyphs at Altavista |trans-title= Petroglifos en Altavista |journal= |location= |url=http://richardlawhorn.com/altavista/pila_del_rey.html |accessdate=Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region was originally home to the largely unstudied [[Tecoxquin]] (Tequectequi) native culture dating from approximately 2000 BC to 2300 BCE.&lt;ref name="Vecinal"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pro-conservacion Difusion del Patrimonio Historico Cultural de Las Varas Nayarit A.C. |last= |first= |authorlink=  |year= |publisher=Ejido de Altavista.

Aside from its cultural and archeological importance, the site remains an important religious center for the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]es who still leave offerings and perform ceremonies here.&lt;ref name="MexDes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armendáriz |first=Lorenzo |date=February 2008 |title=Viva la Riviera Nayarita |journal=Guía México Desconocido |volume=372 |pages=70–77 |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/8261-Viva-la-Riviera-Nayarita.-Sus-playas,-sus-frutos-del-mar,-su-paz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811110947/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/8261-Viva-la-Riviera-Nayarita.-Sus-playas%2C-sus-frutos-del-mar%2C-su-paz |archivedate=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prehispanic times, the Compostela municipality area was inhabited by the Mazatán peoples, tributary of Xalisco-Zacualpan Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit COMPOSTELA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162123/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |date=2011-05-17 }} Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Nayarit (Spanish) Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroglyphs==
The Tecoxquines (Aztec Group) engraved images in volcanic stone over two thousand years ago near Las Piletas. These petroglyphs perhaps were symbolic elements of everyday life, as far as health, fertility, rains, and crops. The rock carvings might have been meant as prayers or offerings to the gods responsible for these things.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

There are fifteen signs (Spanish &amp; English posted along entrance path,&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt; a brief summary is provided below:

=== Sign 1 - Altavista===
Altavista petroglyphs archaeological site, located along the sides of a creek on the slopes the Copo volcano. Covers an area of approximately 80&amp;nbsp;hectares, with a large concentration of petroglyphs. (More than 2000 engravings identified)&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

=== Sign 2 - The Tecoxquin (Throat-Cutters) ===
Original Altavista inhabitants. This native group inhabited a vast region covering the South coast of Nayarit, neighbouring coasts, and mountainous regions of Jalisco, Mexico. They were mainly farmers, fishermen, salt producers and traders of cocoa and cotton. The Tecoxquines were organized in a number of villages under the control of Teuzacualpan Chila Valley (modern city of Zacualpan). Business links allowed them to develop an intensive trade, reached Sinaloa to the north and Colima and Michoacán to the South and East.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 3 - Religious Life (Tecoxquines)===
No doubt, many religious ceremonies at this site were based on nahualism. [[Nagual|Nahualism]] or [[Shamanism]] as former religious practices whereby people communicated with their gods and spirits during altered states of consciousness. This tradition has deep roots in the region; the Nayarit word derives from the word "nahualli". The Tecoxquines used psychotropic plants and tobacco plants to achieve states of ecstasy and communicate with their gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 4 - The Last of The Tecoxquines===
[[File:Altavistapeto3.jpg|thumb|350px|Petroglyphs at Altavista Site, Compostela, Nayarit.]]
After the Spanish conquest, the Tecoxquines completely annihilated by epidemics and forced labor. Today native cities of the region still talk about "white Indians," ghosts appearing from the mountains to honor their ancient gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 5 – The Tecuales===
The Tecoxquin ancient villages, as far as the Ixtapa salt producers, were populated by Tecuales, ancestors of the current Huichol.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 6 - The Water Cycle ===
Nayarit State is characterized by heavy rainfall. Rainfall is concentrated between May and October. The Altavista mountains attract heavy rains leaving drier areas to the East (desert weather at the opposite side). Perhaps because of this abundance of water, Altavista was considered a special place.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 7 - Tomoanchan (or Tamoanchan)===
[[Tamoanchan]] is a mythical paradisiac location known to the [[Mesoamerican]] cultures of the central Mexican region in the Late Postclassical period, is a central part of the ancient Mesoamerican cosmology. Tamoanchan is the cosmic tree that connects life and supports the world. Its roots are underground in the water and fertility field. Its trunk is between human beings above ground and heavens. The Crown of the tree is in heaven, the kingdom of gods and rain. Tamoanchan was represented by the Ceiba tree.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 8 - Warfare: Trophy Heads ===
The "Guerra Florida " (flower war) was one of the main religious practices associated with the Tecoxquines. The aim was not to conquer. Rather, get warriors prisoners for ritual sacrifice, and whose heads were cut and then offered to the gods. These wars were usually produced locally, but also conducted in places as far away as the Talpa and Mascota Valleys and Mochitiltic Canyon in Jalisco.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 9 – Tlalocan===
water was thought to be underground in ancient Mesoamerica, hence the underworld was considered a fertile place. Tlalocan was the "water"paradise underground. It was inhabited by the “Chanes”, or water spirits, as well as the spirits of people drowned or whose death was water related. Tlalocan also was the site of the legendary crocodile [[Cipactli]],&lt;ref&gt;in Aztec mythology; Cipactli was a voracious, primitive and monstrous creature, half crocodile, half fish. It was always hungry, and in each joint of its 18 bodies had a mouth adorning it. Tezcatlipoca sacrificed a foot, using it as bait to attract it. It is also the first day of the sacred Aztec calendar, Tonalpohualli.&lt;/ref&gt; a "earth monster", symbolizing fertility.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 10 – The Devoted Christ ===
The first historical references of the archaeological site of Altavista date from 1612. These describe many crosses, and above all, a devout Christ that local people venerates. This is possibly a reference to the "corn man", a figure that symbolizes fertility and growth. Local farmers leave offerings of candles and gourd bowls of salt to this figure in order to obtain fertility for their coffee and tobacco crops.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 11 – The Apostle Matthew ===
During the early 17TH century, Spaniards believed that the Apostle Matthew traveled to the new world in prehispanic times to evangelize natives. This is thought to explain the crosses engraved in the Altavista rocks.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 12 – The Cross ===
For Tecoxquines, as well as for most ancient Mesoamerican, the cross actually was a mental map of the cosmos. Symbolizes five sacred directions: the four cardinal points and the center. Each is associated with certain gods, colors, and sacred kingdoms, as well as each of the four trees that formed the tamoanchan kingdoms. The idea of the universe of four corners is still present among native Mexico today, symbolized by crosses, diamonds and other similar forms.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 13 – Communication With The Gods ===
The Altavista rocks were probably associated with the mythical [[Tamoanchan]] trees connecting the underworld, earth and heaven. The prayers of the people went up through the sap of the trunks into the realm of the gods. In turn, the gifts of the gods, rain, fertility and good health returned to land the same way. For the Tecoxquines the Altavista rocks would have served the same purpose, a means of communication between the people and their gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 14 – Tecoxquin Symbolism ===
Spirals, wavy lines, and other symbols carved in the Altavista rocks probably constitute a ritual prayer language for the gods. As an agricultural culture, the Tocoxquines would have been concerned with rain, fertility of the land and the continuity of the seasonal rhythms that they relied on. While the exact meaning of symbols will never be known, spirals have been interpreted as the Sun, storm, the wind, the spiral snake, or as a symbol of the natural cycle of station rainy and dry.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 15 –Huichol Offerings===
Huichol natives occasionally visit Altavista originally lived in the Nayar mountains, recently a group moved to the Las Varas area. They present offerings and perform ceremonies for Nakahue, "our fertility grandmother" and Tatevari, "our grandfather of fire". Some Huicholes also travel to the nearby Chacala Port, where ancient petroglyphs are present and leave offerings for Tatei Aramara “our mother Ocean”.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

[[Kosovo]] has a very valuable asset of [[archaeology]] but a handicap in this field are still institutional serious researches. Anyway, from up to now researches the [[archaeology of Kosovo]]  is included in '''Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology''' as a country with a wealthy archaeological heritage. The favorable geostrategic and wealthy natural resources were ideal for the development of life since the [[prehistoric]] periods, proven by traces of the hundreds of archaeological sites discovered and identified throughout Kosovo, which proudly presents the rich and abundant archaeological heritage of our country.
By the end of 19th century came out the first scientific data for the archaeological legacy of [[Kosovo]], owing to work of the researchers: A.Evans and F.Kanitz. The entire archaeological activity of Kosovo begins after the establishment of the [[Museum of Kosovo]] in 1949.
From many world and European archaeologist is suggested that the Municipality of Ferizaj is counted among the localities that has a highly valued asset of the archaeological legacy.

==The Sarcophagus Lid of Nikadin==
''Coordinates: {{coord|42.357|N|21.169|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}''
[[File:Side view of the Sarcophagus Lid - Nikadin.jpg|thumb|Side view of the Sarcophagus Lid - Nikadin.]]
[[File:Frontal view of the Sarcophagus Lid - Nikadin.jpg|thumb|Frontal view of the Sarcophagus Lid - Nikadin.]]
Three archaeologists, an architect and a draftsman, from the research in the backyard of Xhelal Berisha, in Nikadin village not far from the center of [[Ferizaj]], have managed to finish the tracking of the foundations of a [[church (building)|church]], for which it is believed that from the [[Paleochristian|Paleochristian era]] of the 5th and 6th centuries AD. From the researches, it came out that The Sarcophagus Lid brickyard in the foundations of the church below the floor.
''The Archaeological Institute of Kosovo'' have declared that "The Sarcophagus Lid", is evaluated as a [[pagan]] element and as such, as disrespectful act of the [[Christians]], they bricked in the floor of the church. Many [[Albania]]n archaeologists have estimated as a big wealth finding the foundations of the Paleochristian churches. Also, while tracking have found bricks and tiling of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovapress.com/sq/arkiva/mungojn235-gjurmimet-arkeologjike-n235-malin-e-kish235s-148320/?old=1#sthash.ghTyLO2U.dpuf ,&lt;/ref&gt;
Although, Ferizaj is a new city (130&amp;nbsp;years old) compared to other cities of the country, it goes back through the centuries as an [[Illyria]]n settlement on genesis too old. This is recorded in archaeological maps of many countries of the world.&lt;ref name="botasot.info"&gt;http://www.botasot.info/index.php?category=15&amp;id=3994 ,&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Divinity of Varosh==
''Coordinates: {{coord|42.341|N|21.175|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}''

The identified [[Neolithic]] site of Varosh is located {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} in south-east from the city, in [[Varosh]] village. This in not archaeologically trenches, during the work on the field it was found occasional traces that remain different [[neolithic]] ceramic fragments which recorded. The majority of the revealed movable archaeology materials indicate traces of a nucleated Neolithic settlement of [[Starčevo culture|Starcevo]] and [[Vinča culture|Vinca cultures]]. In some parcels of this archaeological site during 2011, [[Geophysics|geophysical]] recordings, respectively magnetometer survey were carried out, resulting with reflection of several underneath structures that might indicate the remains of the Nelothic houses. From the findings in this locality is believed to be found at other residues of an ancient civilization. In Varosh, 500&amp;nbsp;m from the wake of the church is Urns, which since 1967 lies in the Museum of Kosovo. There is believed that is a Roman-Illyrian settlement. Mysteries were busy underground since 1984, where history professor, Ymer Berisha had found a carved stone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mkrs-ks.org/repository/docs/drafti_i_guides_-anglisht_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locality of Zllatar==
''Coordinates: {{coord|42.399|N|21.287|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}''

The result of ''Map Archaeological Project'' and in particular with the cooperation of German and Kosovar Institute, in 2008, was discovered an ancient locality in the Ferizaj municipality. The locality is situated in the Zllatar village in the north-east of Ferizaj, where today lies part of the American base "Bondsteel". By archaeological Map of Kosovo, in 2008 is said that in this village is a prehistoric settlement which belongs to the Neolithic period. "Hopefully, at some flint artifacts, we also have indications [[Mesolithic]] a period that is very rare and controversial". In this area approximately {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}}, were found in prehistoric times as flint and stone tools of ancient period. In 2008, in collaboration with the Archaeological Institute of Frankfurt, Kosovo archaeologists have recorded a surface field 70, where the result is obtained a view more graphics-magnetic anomalies and oval structures which result in a settlement of the Neolithic period all infrastructure such are; huts housing, worker, etc. During this year on March began with some excavation it was identified purpose of the space, location and explanation of elements such as extension spatial extent of the settlement, determining chronological continuity of time, the status of this residence, level development and relations with the settlements of this period, adding mobile archaeological material discovered in excavations, undertaken surveys came to light trace a residential or temporary residence in the continuation of that prehistoric which continued to be active during [[the Middle Ages]]. A valuable place among the findings of ceramics voice. From the standpoint of technique should be noted ceramic paper work typical of the Neolithic period in the region. Pottery discovered here is very fragmented and very damaged and mostly belongs to the prehistoric (Neolithic, [[Eneolithic]]) while not neglecting the fact fragmentary findings belonging to other periods as bronze, iron, and in some cases ancient and early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="kosova-sot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosova-sot.info/kulture/deshmi-stralli-per-periudhen-mezolitike|title=KosovaSot|publisher=kosova-sot.info|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mountain Church in Komogllava==
''Coordinates: {{coord|42.661|N|20.266|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}''

Based on the findings and existing trace in many parts of the village and archaeological discoveries casually made it appears that Komogllava is very old urbanized resident, with water supply and with all other antique objects of a city.
Komogllava is the place in which they stand on the surface trace of the ancient Illyrian-Dardan, toponym Mountain Church, which was passed from generation to generation, there was only a starting point for exploring in the area for traces of the distant past, while fragments from remote times, had already begun to reveal the earth.
The foundations of this church are unfolding day by day with them the other fragments that document the existence of life in this country. In this locality were found Vase, from ceramic pots, coins, jewellery, items of iron and other carbonaceous substances, but also the characteristic stone, believed to have moved from coastal areas to build the sarcophagus and other items objects of strong high.&lt;ref name="botasot.info"/&gt; Unfortunately, few of these objects are preserved today. The elderly of this country have shown that many incidentally or intentionally traveler, had passed there, and of children in exchange for a toy they received finding artifacts that had sprouted during tillage land, opening the foundations of houses or wells. It is believed that the church should meet 1st century BC, but was rebuilt in the medieval period at the time of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Locality is an ancient urbanized streets, sewage and other infrastructure.
Potters found here less resembles those found in other places, but has an analogy between fragments. Potter believe belongs Dardanian period, then the sewage pipes are very interesting, but also has material that is interesting conceive each and worth studying, indicating that Komogllava is among the few countries that has a water supply system of this period, which even today is derived, but it is not known water source.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovapress.com/sq/arkiva/mungojn235-gjurmimet-arkeologjike-n235-malin-e-kish235s-148320/?old=1#sthash.ghTyLO2U.dpuf  ,&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''boga''' or '''PVC cannon''' is a [[noisemaker]] popular during [[New Year]] celebrations in the [[Philippines]]. Use of the device has been banned by the Philippine government since 2006.&lt;ref name="Bawal2007"/&gt;

Originating from the province of [[Cavite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pinoys find another way to welcome the New Year |pages= |publisher=Manila Bulletin Online |date=2005-12-31 |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/12/31/MTNN2005123152835.html |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122045257/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/12/31/MTNN2005123152835.html |archivedate=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the device is made from a length of pipe of substantial diameter mated to a [[toy gun]]. [[Denatured alcohol]] (sometimes paint thinner or acetone) is squirted or sprayed into the pipe's [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] end and ignited by the toy gun's trigger mechanism which is connected to a [[igniter|piezo igniter]] or by putting small fire.&lt;ref name="Inq2006"&gt;{{cite news | last =Santos | first =Tina | title ='Boga' may be in, but beware of consequences | pages = | publisher =Inquirer.net | date =2006-12-27 | url =http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view_article.php?article_id=40468 | accessdate =2008-12-29 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of air and flammable fuel in the pipe's enclosed space when ignited by a spark from the trigger mechanism or by small fire causes the fuel-air mixture to [[Combustion|combust]], resulting in a loud, booming sound.

The first prototype is made from segmented tin cans connected with packaging tapes or electrical tapes and cut PET bottles (which is still used) and later design is made of [[Plastic pipework|PVC pipes]]. Other modifications of boga are introduced such as firing round projectiles which can be used as a weapon and pet bottles as breech end.

== Ban and injuries ==
The [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] has repeatedly warned against use of the noisemaker, which they deem to be dangerous as its use carries a risk of blast or burn injury. A ban was ordered on 27 December 2005 against the use of the devices for the impending New Year celebrations. Officials cited a variety of possible injuries from use of the device, mostly involving delayed explosions to the facial region resulting in [[eye injury]], among others. Post-traumatic [[conjunctivitis]] was cited as one of the noted effects.&lt;ref name="Inq2006"/&gt;

Users of the device mostly are children and teenage boys, tend to prematurely open the boga whenever it fails to fire, causing any delayed blasts to fire upon the unsuspecting user's face. Of 178 firecracker-related injuries recorded for the 2006 season (as of December 28) so far, eighteen percent were confirmed to have been caused by use of boga.&lt;ref name=2006ban&gt;{{cite news | last =Crisostomo | first =Shiela | title =Metro Police Chief Orders Ban on PVC Cannons | pages = | publisher =Newsflash.org | date =2006-12-29 | url =http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl104943.htm | accessdate =2008-12-29 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110607051836/http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl104943.htm | archivedate =2011-06-07 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, health department officials maintained the ban on the devices, reminding the public with press releases, flyers and awareness campaigns.&lt;ref name="Bawal2007"&gt;{{cite web  | title ="Bawal ang Boga", DOH says this holiday season  | url =http://www.doh.gov.ph/node/1797  | accessdate =2008-12-29  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110719074127/http://www.doh.gov.ph/node/1797  | archivedate =2011-07-19  | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inq2006"/&gt;

The PVC cannon is a prohibited weapon in the [[Australia]]n [[States of Australia|state]] of [[New South Wales]], along with other devices which are designed to propel or launch a bomb, grenade, rocket or missile by any means other than an explosive.&lt;ref&gt;WEAPONS PROHIBITION ACT 1998 (NSW) Sched 1, s.2(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Building Harlequin's Moon''''' is a science fiction novel by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Brenda Cooper]]. The novel is set in the distant future as a group of space travellers, marooned in an inhospitable [[planetary system]], attempt to [[Terraforming|terraform]] a moon and create a sufficient civilisation on it to refuel their ship so they can continue to their original destination.

==Plot introduction==
A couple of centuries from the present, [[artificial intelligence]]s and [[nanotechnology]] are in widespread use in the Solar System and in some cases have caused disasters. Some people do not trust these technologies and plan a simpler life in a distant planetary system, where they plan to terraform a planet called Ymir. Once Ymir is habitable, they will abandon use of all advanced technology. Three [[sleeper ship]]s leave the Solar System bound for Ymir, using [[suspended animation]] to keep the crew and settlers alive during the sub light-speed journey. While in transit, all communication with the Solar System ends; by implication, human civilisation has fallen. The lead ship, ''John Glenn'', is crippled by a design flaw en route, and uses all its [[antimatter]] fuel to reach the nearest star system, Apollo. It warns the other two ships, which can correct the flaw, but there is no word from them about whether they reach Ymir.

The ''John Glenn'' creates a substantial moon around the gas giant Harlequin by colliding several smaller moons together, and give it an atmosphere, seas, and the beginnings of an ecosystem. This takes 60,000 years, with almost all the passengers of the ship in hibernation during the entire time. The person in charge of creating and terraforming the new moon, Selene, is Gabriel.

Apart from a brief prologue, the novel begins as the second generation of people born on Selene approach adulthood.

==Plot summary==

Gabriel is teaching a group of moon-born teenagers about agriculture. Rachel is one of these; she passes her exams and is selected by Gabriel to become a leader of the moon-born. Andrew is another; he fails his exams because he plays a practical joke on Rachel. Gabriel takes Rachel to the ''John Glenn''. As the first moon-born to visit the ship, she arouses hostility from some of the leaders there. She learns that there are three classes amongst the space travelers: five are High Council, who rule until Ymir is reached; some dozens are Council, including Gabriel, and have extended privileges; and the remaining "Earth-born" are colonists, many of them not having been unfrozen since leaving Earth and with few rights. She also learns to use the vast repository of knowledge in the ship's library, and makes contact with the AI "Astronaut" who is kept severely restricted because the High Council doesn't trust high technology. Rachel comes to realise that when the moon-born have helped restock the ship with antimatter the ''John Glenn'' will continue on to Ymir without them, leaving them on a moon that can only sustain life for a century or two.

Gabriel decides there is no immediate need for him and Rachel to return to Selene, and that as a leader Rachel would be most useful with the longer lifespan that is conferred by the suspended animation process, and has himself and Rachel frozen for a year. Problems with [[solar flare|radiation flare]]s intervene, and without Gabriel to stand up for her, they are left frozen for twenty years. Rachel returns to Selene to find her best friend killed in an accident, her boyfriend married and with children almost her own age, and her remaining friends more than twice as old as she is. She also realizes that the moon-born are being treated as slaves, with Earth-born as overseers. The moon-born must develop the technological infrastructure to refine antimatter, but there are major risks involved in the refining which could destroy the population of Selene.

Rachel becomes a teacher of the next generation of moon-born. She teaches them what she is supposed to, but she also includes concepts from Earth history that she learns from the library and Astronaut - concepts such as democracy and [[nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]]. She has a few friends among Council, and Astronaut is able to conceal her communications with them from other Council and High Council. Andrew (a childhood enemy) plays a more active role in stirring up rebellion, but the moon-born have no power to change their role. The Council notices the passive resistance and their members begin carrying weapons. Some years later, one of the ship's boats crash lands on Selene and is abandoned there. It has sufficient [[digital electronics|electronics]] to house an AI, and Rachel's Council friends make a copy of Astronaut there, Vassal, unknown to High Council.

Ten years after Rachel was unfrozen, an accident leads to a Council member shooting one of the moon-born. Andrew leads a revolt and takes a Council member hostage. The rebellion is halted by a flare which requires everyone to shelter together, and by Rachel's heroic intervention. In the wake of the rebellion, a new understanding is reached between the moon-born and the High Council. They will work more as equals, and the refinement of the antimatter will take place at a safe distance from Selene. The travellers will leave more technology behind when they leave (including the copy of Astronaut) so Selene can survive. This is at a cost of delaying their departure significantly. Gabriel decides he will remain on Selene when ''John Glenn'' departs.

A final, short, section of the novel sums up the next two hundred years, with the antimatter refined, the flare problem on Selene permanently dealt with, and ''John Glenn'' preparing for departure. Periods of suspended animation keep Rachel and Gabriel young.

There is room for a sequel, dealing with either or both of the futures of ''John Glenn'' and Ymir, and of Selene.

==Characters in "Building Harlequin's Moon"==

'''Choir dress''' is the traditional vesture of the [[cleric]]s, [[seminary|seminarian]]s and [[religious order|religious]] of [[Christian church]]es worn for public prayer and the administration of the sacraments except when celebrating or [[Concelebration|concelebrating]] the [[Eucharist]]. It differs from the [[vestment]]s worn by the celebrants of the Eucharist, being normally made of fabrics such as wool, cotton or silk, as opposed to the fine [[brocade]]s used in vestments. It may also be worn by lay assistants such as acolytes and choirs.  It was abandoned by most of the Churches which originated in the sixteenth-century [[Reformation]].&lt;ref name="tsol1"&gt;Grisebrooke, W. Jardine. '''Vestments''' in Jones, Cheslyn, Wainright, Geoffrey &amp; Yarnold, Edward. ''The Study of Liturgy'' SPCK: 1979, p.489&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[vestments|Eucharistic vestments]] it derived originally from the formal secular dress of the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian era which survived in church usage after fashion had changed.&lt;ref name="tsol1"/&gt;

Choir dress also differs from "house dress" which is worn outside of a liturgical context (whether in the house or on the street). House dress may be either formal or informal.

==Roman Catholic choir dress==
Choir dress in the [[Catholic Church]] is worn by deacons, priests, regular prelates, bishops and cardinals when presiding at or celebrating a [[liturgy]] that is not the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], especially the [[Liturgy of the Hours]].
Before the Second Vatican Council the dress was more elaborate, and had dozens of varieties and colours. After The Second Vatican Council, it was reduced, however exceptions are sometimes granted for cathedral chapters.

The current dress is worn when attending Mass without celebrating or observing the Eucharist. It is worn by seminarians, instituted lectors and acolytes, and altar servers and choir members at Mass or other liturgical events.

The basic components of choir dress are:
* the [[cassock]], with or without [[fascia (vestment)|fascia]] (fringed sash worn around the waist),
* if the person is a brother or priest in a [[religious order]] that has its own [[religious habit|habit]] ([[Benedictines]], [[Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], etc.), the habit is worn in place of the cassock,
* the [[surplice]] (or [[rochet]] if the wearer is a [[bishop]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], or [[canon (priest)|canon]]), and
* the [[biretta]] (optional for secular priests unless their bishop requires its use, in which case it is mandatory).

For [[seminarian]]s, [[deacon]]s, and [[priest]]s the cassock is exactly the same as their normal cassock: a black cassock with black buttons, girded with a black fascia.

Priests who hold additional honors may wear a different cassock: [[Chaplain of His Holiness|Chaplains of His Holiness]] wear a black cassock with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while [[Honorary Prelate]]s and [[Protonotary apostolic|Protonotaries apostolic]] wear a [[purple]] cassock with [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] piping and buttons with a purple fascia. A black cassock with [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress (academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic. [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] may wear the [[rochet]] (if the chapter has been granted usus rochetti by papal indult) with a distinctive [[mozzetta]], the particular colors of which are determined by the [[chapter (religion)|chapter]].

Bishops wear the above-mentioned purple cassock with scarlet piping, and add a [[pectoral cross]] suspended from a [[green]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] cord, a [[mozzetta]] over the rochet, and a purple [[zucchetto]] under the biretta. A [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] wears a [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] cassock with scarlet trim, pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the rochet, with a red zucchetto. The [[Pope]]'s choir dress includes a white cassock, rochet, red silk mozetta, red brocade stole and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.

The [[cope]] and/or [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] may be worn over choir dress when a cleric presides over a [[sacrament]] (for instance, at [[matrimony]], if not celebrated during Mass), or by the cleric presiding over prayers (for instance, the priest presiding at a solemn celebration of [[Vespers]] in the Liturgy of the Hours at a seminary might wear cope and stole over choir dress, while the priests of the faculty and seminarians would wear simple choir dress of cassock and surplice).

Monks who are neither deacons nor priests also have a form of choir dress: the full monastic habit with the monastic cowl forms their formal wear for attending the Liturgy of the Hours or Mass.

Since 2006, priests of the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] have had their own choir dress, given to them by the Cardinal [[Archbishop of Florence]]. Their choir dress includes a rochet, a mozzetta, the cross of St. [[Francis de Sales]] on a blue and white ribbon, and a biretta with a blue pom. According to the Institute, "The blue stands for our complete dedication to the [[Virgin Mary|Blessed Mother]] and is traditionally the color shown on St. Francis de Sales in most paintings of him," and "The choir dress expresses the strong unity, spiritually, and identity of the Institute and adds solemnity to the [[Tridentine Mass|liturgy]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institute-christ-king.org/institute/questions/ |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern choir dress==
[[Image:Stjohn shanghai.png|thumb|right|200px|[[John (Maximovitch) of Shanghai and San Francisco|Saint John (Maximovich)]] wearing choir dress of an Orthodox bishop: [[klobuk]], [[outer riassa]], [[Panagia]], and episcopal [[mandyas]]; holding his [[paterissa]] (crozier).]]

The choir dress of clergy in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches are relatively similar. Over the inner [[cassock]] (''rasson'' or ''podrasnik''), a deep-sleeved ''[[cassock#Eastern practice (Orthodox)|exorason]]'' (''riassa''), which is often black, is worn. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], married clergy often wear grey, while monastic clergy wear black.  During the [[Easter|paschal]] season both monastic and married clergy will often wear a white inner cassock. Some Russian [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitans]] wear a white inner cassock and a blue outer when formally arriving to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]].

===Byzantine Rite===

In Eastern Orthodoxy and [[Byzantine Catholic]]ism, [[monk]]s wear a black cloak, the ''[[mandyas]]'' over the outer cassock. The mandyas completely covers the monastic below the chin and reaches to the floor. In the Greek usage, the mandyas is usually only worn when performing certain liturgical roles; in the Slavic usage, all monks and [[nun]]s of the rank of [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism|Stavrophore]] or above wear the mandyas at every service, so long as they are in their own [[monastery]]. The mandyas of an [[hegumen]] ([[abbot]]) is of black silk, that of an [[archimandrite]] or [[bishop]] is of colored silk (specific usages will differ by jurisdiction), and has four square "tablets" on it: two at the neck and two at the feet. A bishop's mandyas additionally has "rivers" on it: three horizontal stripes either of gold (Greek practice) or red and white (Slavic practice).

Monastic clergy wear different headcoverings than married clergy. Married clergy wear either a colored ''[[kamilavka|kalimaukion]]'' or ''[[skufia]]''; monastic clergy wear a black kalimaukion and [[Epanokamelavkion|veil]] (together known as the ''[[klobuk]]''). For monastics, the skufia is reserved for house dress, and the klobuk is worn in church. Russian [[archbishop]]s have a jewelled cross attached to the front of their klobuks; Russian Metropolitans wear a white klobuk with jewelled cross. Several Orthodox [[Patriarch]]s wear a rounded headcovering called a [[koukoulion]].

[[Priest]]s who have been awarded a [[pectoral cross]] wear it with their choir dress (these pectoral crosses are of several degrees: silver, gold, or jewelled). Bishops wear a ''[[panagia]]'' ([[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]]) in place of the pectoral cross. Archbishops may wear a pectoral cross and a panagia. All [[primate (bishop)|primates]] and some bishops below primatial rank have the dignity of wearing an ''[[enkolpion]]'' (icon of Christ), a pectoral cross, and a panagia.

A ruling Igumen (so long as he is inside his own monastery) and a bishop may carry his ''[[paterissa]]'' (crozier) when he is in church. However, the paterissa is never to be carried inside the sanctuary; instead, when he goes into the [[altar]], the paterissa is either handed to an [[altar server]] or left leaning against the [[iconostasis]] outside the [[Holy Doors]].

In North America and Great Britain, some Orthodox clergy have begun to wear a [[Roman collar]] ([[clergy shirt]]), though this is discouraged among the more traditional Orthodox.

In the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], married priests wear a black [[Kippah|skullcap]], or ''phiro'', while monastic priests wear the [[Great Schema|schema]], ''eskimo''. For certain [[sacrament]]al functions, a priest or bishop puts on the [[epitrachelion]] ([[Stole (vestment)|stole]]).

==Anglican choir dress or choir habit==
[[File:Canterbury Cap.jpg|thumb|An Anglican priest delivers a homily, dressed in choir habit with [[Canterbury cap]]]]
[[Image:Choirhabit.jpg|thumb|200px|An [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[priest]] in choir dress: cassock, [[surplice]] and [[tippet]]. The dark red of his [[academic hood]] can be seen on his shoulders.]]
[[Image:Bishop Trevor Williams.jpg|thumb|200px|An [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[bishop]] in choir dress: purple cassock, [[rochet]], red [[chimere]] and cuffs, [[tippet]], and pectoral cross.]]

''Choir dress'' in [[Anglicanism]] traditionally consists of cassock, surplice and scarf (or tippet).&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Tippett'' is often used as a synonym of "scarf", but historically it may also have been used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for a type of non-academic hood which extended forward down over the chest. (Cross, F.L.; Livingstone, E.A., eds. (1974). "Tippet"". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2 ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; An academic hood may also be worn and, since 1964 in the Church of England a [[cope]] may be worn at the discretion of the minister.&lt;ref&gt;Canons of 1964 and following years: B.8.3&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the basic garment was, and is, the surplice which by the fourteenth century had become the essential choir-vestment everywhere.&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;Simpson, John A. arts '''Surplice''' &amp; '''Vestments''' in ''The New International Dictionary of the Christian Church'' J.D. Douglas(ed.) Exeter:Paternoster (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; The surplice was the only vesture permitted to the clergy in the 1552 Prayer Book, except for bishops who should use a [[rochet]] (both wore cassocks as the standard undergarment).&lt;ref name="pf1"&gt;Procter &amp; Frere. ''A New History of the Book of Common Prayer'', MacMillan &amp; Cº (1902), pp.82; 362ff &amp; 110 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; The Elizabethan Prayer Book of 1559 included the so-called [[Ornaments Rubric]].  Its legal interpretation was disputed in the nineteenth century&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F.L.; Livingstone, E.A., eds. (1974). "Ornaments Rubric, The". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2 ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; it was claimed that its inclusion in the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]] commanded the pre-Reformation Eucharistic vestments (chasuble, dalmatic, tunicle, alb, amice, and maniple) that had been in use during the reign of Edward VI.&lt;ref name="pf1"/&gt;  However, the Elizabethan bishops struggled to enforce the use of the surplice,&lt;ref name="pf1"/&gt; and the use of Eucharistic vestments was discontinued until after the [[Oxford Movement]], in the middle of the nineteenth century, when it was restored in many cathedrals and parish churches.&lt;ref name="simpson"/&gt; In many low-church dioceses and parishes the choir dress continued to be the norm, even at the Eucharist. The cope nevertheless continued in use for coronations and in certain cathedrals, but this may be considered an extension of "choir dress" and was sanctioned by the canons of 1603/4.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cassock]] is almost invariably black for priests and deacons. A traditional Anglican cassock is double-breasted, being buttoned on the shoulder rather than up the front (there may be a single button sewn to the center of the chest used to fasten the academic hood if worn). Many Anglican clergy, especially (though not exclusively) those within the catholic tradition of Anglicanism, prefer to wear the Latin single-breasted cassock. The cassock is worn with a cincture, which may take the form of a cloth sash resembling a [[Fascia (vestment)|fascia]], or a simple rope girdle or leather belt. Over this is worn the [[surplice]], which is longer and fuller than that worn by Roman Catholic clergy, sometimes reaching well below the knees. Traditionally, an [[academic hood]] is worn around the shoulders and down the back, along with a black [[tippet]] or scarf worn around the nape and hanging straight down in front. The hood and tippet were once a single garment called an [[almuce]]. (The tippet is not to be confused with the [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], which is also worn in a similar manner, but is not part of choir dress, being worn at the Eucharist and other sacramental services.) Some clergy also wear [[Bands (neckwear)|Geneva bands]] (or "preaching tabs") from their collars.  Though not worn at service-time, the [[Canterbury cap]] is the traditional headgear of [[Church of England]] clergy; some prefer the biretta (see below) or [[mortar board]].  Neither is widely worn, although a square cap, with cassock, gown and tippet, was specified in English [[canon law]] as part of the "outdoor habit" or "house dress" of the clergy until the promulgation of new canons in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KzRGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Canon 74] of 1603/04 replaced by C.27&lt;/ref&gt;   At some periods of history a black gown, either academic or '[[Geneva gown|Genevan]]', was worn for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] instead of the surplice which was reserved for use at the [[Holy Communion]] - the cassock, bands, gown, academic hood and tippet still being the normal liturgical costume for ordained minister of the [[Church of Scotland]] and other [[Reformed]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches.

Chaplains in the Armed Forces wear tippets with officially sanctioned badges and any medals they have achieved. A bishop or priest may wear a tippet with the arms of the [[seminary]] from which he or she received their degree. In England some cathedral clergy wear tippets on which is embroidered the distinctive symbol or cathedral coat of arms.  Members of the [[high church]] or [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] parts of the church sometimes wear choir dress of a more Roman Catholic style, including a shorter surplice (or ''cotta''), a stole (and sometimes a [[biretta]]), excluding hood and tippet.

[[Reader (liturgy)|Readers]] when officiating often wear a blue tippet, or, in the United States, a black tippet displaying the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of the diocese. At the Eucharist, it may be more fitting for readers of Scripture to wear street clothing to emphasize the role of the laity in recent versions of the [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]. However, in some parishes readers wear the traditional vestments of the subdeacon at High Mass: alb fastened with a white cincture and a tunicle.  In other parishes they wear the cassock and surplice, as do members of the choir.

Anglican [[bishop]]s usually wear a purple cassock. Over this, instead of the surplice, they wear the [[rochet]] with red or black [[chimere]] and matching cuffs, black tippet, and sometimes an academic hood.

'''''The Coronation of the Virgin''''' is a [[tempera]] on panel [[polyptych]] by the Italian late Gothic artist [[Lorenzo Monaco]], centred on the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]]. Once in the Camaldolese monastery of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli (Florence)|Santa Maria degli Angeli]], it is now housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. It is dated February 1413 which, in the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine calendar]] (which began in March), corresponded to 1414.

==History==
The painting is mentioned in the early 15th century by Antonio Billi. 

In the late 16th century, it was replaced in the altar it occupied by a large canvas by [[Alessandro Allori]]. The ''Coronation'' was rediscovered in the 19th century, when it was housed in the Camaldolese abbey of San Pietro a Cerreto, in poor condition. In 1872 it was restored to its frame. In 1990 the painted part was found to contain the precious and (for the time) expensive use of [[lapis lazuli blue]].

==Description==
The work is in a huge gilded and carved frame, with three cusps covered placed on jutting  [[corbel]]s. The three arches are decorated with vegetable motifs; over them are three panels (whose upper frame is lost), containing the paintings, from the left, of the ''Angel of the Annunciation'', the ''Blessing Christ between Cherubims'' and the ''Annunciation''. At the side are two piers with twisting columns on the edges, with paintings of prophets. In the lower part is the [[predella]], with six small paintings of the ''Episodes of the Lives of St. Benedict and St. Bernard of Clairvaux''.

The central painting within the three arcades shows the Coronation of the Virgin set in Paradise (alluded by the blue starred belts), with two rows of saints at the sides and a large number of angels behind the throne of Jesus and the Madonna.

The composition is crowded but, like other Giottoesque paintings, lacks perspective. The gilded background is typical of Lorenzo's style.

== Early childhood care and education (ECCE) ==
{{Main article|Curricula in early childhood care and education}}

There is no single curriculum that is 'best' for all situations. Not only does geographic location depends on the type of curriculum taught, but the demographics of the population matters as well. Some curriculums are based heavy of science and technology while another is focused mainly on the arts. However, a comparison of different curricula shows certain approaches to be generally more effective than others. Comprehensive programmes addressing health, nutrition and development have proven to be the most effective in early childhood, especially in programmes directed at very young and vulnerable children.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, P. 2009. Growing global evidence. In Woodhead, M. and Oates, J. (eds). ''Effective Early Childhood Programmes''. Vol. 4 of Early Childhood in Focus. Milton Keynes, The Open University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012. ''[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002160/216038e.pdf EFA Global Monitoring Report. Policy Paper 03]''. April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a genuine commitment from agencies and individuals to work together, to plan projects collaboratively, and to involve parents and communities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=243–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanistic curriculum development ==

A [[humanistic]] curriculum is a curriculum based on [[intercultural education]] that allows for the plurality of society while striving to ensure a balance between [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and [[universal value]]s. In terms of policy, this view sees curriculum frameworks as tools to bridge broad educational goals and the processes to reach them. A humanistic curriculum development perspective holds that for curriculum frameworks to be legitimate, the process of policy dialogue to define educational goals must be participatory and inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amadio|first=M.|year=2014|title=Curriculum in the Twenty-First Century: Challenges, Tensions and Open Questions.|url=|journal=ERF Working Papers|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|volume=No. 9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this view is that curriculum policy and content must both be guided by the principles of social and [[Economic inequality|economic justice]], equality and [[environmental responsibility]] that constitute the pillars of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[graduation]] completion rate is the measure reflecting the number of [[student]]s who complete their graduation and receive a [[Academic degree|degree]] from an [[educational institution]]. The [[Dropping out|drop-out]] rate is the measure reflecting the number of students who disengage with the educational institutions they are enrolled in. Those measures are calculated by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES), the primary federal [[United States|U.S.]] entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education.

Graduation rate has been reported to be decreasing over the past decades in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dailycollegian.com/2011/01/30/graduation-rates-decrease-nationwide/ |title=Graduation rates decrease nationwide |last1=Kiss |first1=Claire Reid|last2=Fuller  |first2=Andrea  |date=January 30, 2011 |website= |publisher=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian |access-date=September 29, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the percentage of dropouts among 16-24-year-olds has shown some decreases over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011015.pdf |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2010, Introduction p.1 |last1=Snyder |first1=Thomas D. |last2=Dillow |first2=Sally A. |date=April 2011 |website= |publisher=NCES |access-date=September 29, 2018 |quote=}}   &lt;/ref&gt; The substantial growth in college enrollment among high school graduates has not been matched with a comparable expansion in [[college degree]] attainment.&lt;ref name="BLT"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1257/app.2.3.129| title = Why Have College Completion Rates Declined?

== Overview ==

=== Historical background ===

Degree completion has been decreasing since 1970. Bound, Lovenheim and Turner (2010) studied why the college completion rate declined.&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt; Their main explanations of the decreasing rate are the changes in student preparation and the collegiate resources. The authors explain that between 1970 and 1999, [[Post-secondary education|post-secondary institution]]s saw a significant increase in enrollments and, at the same time, a decrease in college completion. "Partly as a consequence of the substantial increase in the college wage premium since 1980, a much higher fraction of high school graduates enter college today than they did a quarter century ago. However, the rise in the fraction of high school graduates attending college has not been met by a proportional increase in the fraction who finish."&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt;

A study by the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] of the [[University of California]] underlines that in 1994. fewer college students were completing their college in four years than in 1984. The completion rate within four years was 36.4% in 1994, whereas it was 46.7% in the late 1960s. The degree completion when the students were allowed to graduate in six years was 58.8% in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander W. Astin, Leticia Osegura (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; "The fact that these public-private differences decline somewhat when six-year rates are used suggests that students in the public colleges and universities are taking longer to complete their degrees," says Professor [[Alexander Astin|Alexander W. Astin]], co-author of the study and Director of the [[Higher Education Research Institute]]. The current trend is of longer time spent to graduate than it was 50 years ago.

=== Main causes ===

The main causes of the decreasing [[college]] completion rate are the lower preparation level of the [[student]]s and the small allocation of resources dedicated to instruction and institutional choices, according to Bound, Lovenheim and Turner and their study on "Understanding Decrease in Completion Rates and Increase in Time to Degree".&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt; The resources allocated to institutions haven't been enough to offset the increase of new students enrollment in [[higher education]] institutions.

{{quotation | The abstract of the study "Understanding Decrease in Completion Rates and Increase in Time to Degree" by John Bound, Michael Lovenheim, Sarah Turner (2009) says:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Persistent increases in the wage premium five college graduates in recent decades have not
 been matched by gains in collegiate attainment. Indeed, the proportion of students entering college
 who receive degrees has slowed while time to completion of the baccalaureate degree has increased
 markedly among college graduates in the United States over the last three decades. Using data from
 the NLS72 and NELS:88 longitudinal surveys, we find that while enrollment rates have increased
 disproportionately among those students less well prepared for college, these students are unlikely to
 complete BA degrees resulting in an overall decline in the completion rate. In contrast, we find that
 changes in the composition of the college going population can account for essentially none of the
 observed increase in time to degree. The increase in time to degree is localized among those who
 begin postsecondary education at public colleges outside the most selective universities. We produce
 evidence that increased stratification in U.S. higher education and reductions in collegiate resources
 outside the top-tier of institutions are a primary component of the explanation for the observed
 increases in time to degree, with increases in time to degree relatively concentrated in states that have
 experienced rapid growth in the size of the college-age population and dilution in resources per student
 at many public colleges. Further, evidence of increased hours of employment among students is
 consistent with students working more to meet rising college costs thereby negatively affecting the
 length of time it takes them to complete college".&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt; }}

== Current situation ==

The [[US Census Bureau]] in 2009 reported that, nationally, 9% of 18–24 year-olds and only 27.5% of those 25 years and older had a [[bachelor's degree]] or more. [[Massachusetts]] is the state where the completion rate is the highest with 37.8% of citizens 25 years and older having a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degree]].  In [[West Virginia]], the completion rate is the lowest with only 17.1%&lt;ref&gt;US Census Bureau 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  of the population having [[bachelor's degree]]s.

In his [[2010 State of the Union Address]], [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said that he wants the United States to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. To reach this "big goal", American college graduates should increase by 50%, adding at least 8 million additional graduates. Obama said that increasing college completion rate is important to increase economic opportunities and lower social costs for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;The Progress of Education Reform 2007 : Dropout prevention (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early colleges ===
Early colleges have lower drop-outs rate than community colleges and universities.The [[early college high school]] programs provide students the opportunity to receive a high school diploma and an [[associate's degree]], or up to two years of credit toward a bachelor's degree, in four years. Students take a mixture of high school and college classes in order to obtain their high school diploma and [[associate's degree]]. Each early college high school is a public school and open to any residents in the school district. Early colleges have the advantage of allowing student an alternative to the traditional access to diplomas.

=== Community colleges ===
Community colleges have the mission to provide better access to higher education and graduation for under-served populations. Greater access and success in post-secondary education is a primary element for decreasing [[Income inequality|income inequalities]] and increasing the [[productivity]] of America's workers.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Benarke&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, 46% of all undergraduate students in the US attended [[community college]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Report from College Board's National Commission on Community College (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Long and Kurlaender studied the graduation differences between [[community college]]s and [[University|universities]] and found that community college students were 14.5% less likely to complete their degree within 9 years as opposed to students in universities.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Terry Long, Michal Kurlaender (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research studied the effect of incentive payments at community colleges and found that they increased the likelihood of low-income students enrolling in the second semester after random assignment and total number of credits earned, with program group students completing nearly 40 percent more credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_13.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Paying for Performance: The Education Impacts of a Community College Scholarship Program for Low-income Adults'', February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other recent research shows other methods of increasing graduation and persistence rates.  Century College in Minnesota implemented GPS Lifeplan to help develop goals in areas such as education, leadership, and finance.  The concepts in GPS Lifeplan are integrated in many areas of the college such as New Student Seminars and other areas of curriculum. New full-time student using GPS Lifeplan retention rates were 81% compared  to overall retention of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promising practices for community college student success|url=http://www.ccsse.org/docs/Matter_of_Degrees.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2013|author=Center for Community College Student Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universities ===
In universities, efforts are made on targeting the "at-risk" students to avoid drop outs, and creating aligned programs for better coordination between [[high school]]s and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Davis Jenkins (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Successful transfer to 4-year institutions is an issue that concerns every higher educational institution. Academic preparation in high school and solid coordination with those institutions are highly suitable for improving graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Josipa Roksa,Juan Carlos Calciagno (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policies ==

Organizations and associations such as [[Lumina Foundation for Education]] and Delta Cost Project study how to reallocate the limited resources in ways that can increase college completion rates. Studies suggest that in order to respond to this issue of low graduation rates, states should focus on long term policy rather than short-term fixes. The re-examination of how resources are allocated would help to improve the higher education system and avoid drop outs. Several studies have been conducted in order to guide policies toward better ways to manage resources and drive [[expenditure]]s.

Webber and Ehrenberg studied the overall impact and the institutional-level impact based on institutional average [[SAT scores]] and the average federal [[Pell Grant]] given to students at the institution. They found that an increase in expenditures on instruction and student services resulted in higher education rates. The reallocation of resources from instruction to student services would result in a consequent increase in graduation rates. The researchers underline that the institutions with students academically unprepared or economically disadvantaged invest in focusing more on getting student services to potentially raise their students graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A Webber, Ronald G Ehrenberg (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2011, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-President]] [[Joe Biden]] declared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/vice-president-biden-issues-call-action-boost-college-graduation-rates-nationwid|title=Vice President Biden Issues Call to Action to Boost College Graduation Rates Nationwide - U.S. Department of Education|website=www.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Right now we've got an education system that works like a funnel when we need it to work like a pipeline... We have to make the same commitment to getting folks across the graduation stage that we did to getting them into the register's office. The dreams and skills of our college graduates will pave the way to a bright economic future for our nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democrats.org/news/blog/boosting_college_graduation_rates_across_the_country|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323034130/https://www.democrats.org/news/blog/boosting_college_graduation_rates_across_the_country|title=Boosting College Graduation Rates Across the Country|publisher=Democrats.org|archivedate=March 23, 2011|date=March 22, 2011|author=Mary Hough}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A New College Completion Tool Kit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/college_completion_tool_kit.pdf | title=College Completion Tool Kit | publisher=United States Department of Education | date=March 2011 | author=Arne Duncan | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325054514/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/college_completion_tool_kit.pdf | archivedate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to help the governors and state governments develop better strategies for [[Higher education|higher-education]] promotion.
The solutions proposed by the College Completion Tool Kit urge government to set up financial [[incentive]]s to increase completion rate. The federal government advises to base funding formulas on enrollment rate but also on performance measures and outcome indicators. In order to improve institutions of higher education, states and public policies should:

* strengthen high school academic rigor
* make "college prep" the default track in high school
* create opportunities for high school students to earn [[college credit]]s
* develop and implement aggressive outreach strategies to reengage adult students who have received some college training short of certificate on degree attainment but dropped out
* restructure remedial education to meet individual student needs successfully
* restructure post-secondary education delivery to ensure that students complete their degrees in a timely manner

=== The case of Louisiana ===
The [[Lumina Foundation for Education]] proposes solutions to increase college completion rates and to meet President Obama's graduation goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/State_of_the_Union/state-of-the-union-2011-full-transcript/story?id=12759395|title=TRANSCRIPT: State of the Union 2011|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=January 27, 2011|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategies highlighted by The Lumina Foundation for Education are to increase the rate at which students complete college and to provide ways for adults in the workforce to return to college to complete degrees.&lt;ref name="A Stronger Nation"&gt;A Stronger Nation Through Higher Education - How and why Americans much achieve a "big goal" for college attainment, The Lumina Foundation for Education, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In Louisiana, the college attainment rate is 27%.&lt;ref name="A Stronger Nation"/&gt;{{rp|49}} In order to reach the "big goal", Louisiana would need to increase its annual degree production by 8.2%. The Lumina Foundation for Education advises some strategies:
* to target Louisiana residents who have completed some college without earning a degree
* to target parishes and regions in greater needs and to focus the state's effort there
Louisiana's challenge is to increase college students' success for working adults, low income students, first generation students and minority students.&lt;ref name="A Stronger Nation"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

== Controversy ==
[[File:Educational Attainment in the United States 2009.png|thumb|280px|This graph shows the educational attainment since 1940.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf | title=Educational Attainment in the United States: 2015 | last1=Ryan | first1=Camille | last2=Siebens | first2=Julie | date=March 2016 | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The graduation completion rate is contested. January 2010 was when [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] stated in their issue that this rate fails to count students who take a long time to complete their degrees.&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They qualified the rate as "an incomplete measure of institutional quality. The data describes a minority of all enrolled students, counting only full-time, first-time students who enroll in the fall and complete degrees within "150 percent of normal time"—six years for students seeking bachelor's degrees. The graduation rate excludes students who transfer to other colleges and earn degrees there. It also excludes transfer students who come in to finish college and graduate. By one estimate, the rate ignores up to 50 percent of all enrolled students".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Graduation-Rates-Fall-at/125614/|title=Graduation Rates Fall at One-Third of 4-Year Colleges|date=December 5, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13054">'''Democratization of technology''' refers to the process by which access to technology rapidly continues to become more accessible to more people. New technologies and improved user experiences have empowered those outside of the technical industry to access and use technological products and services. At an increasing scale, consumers have greater access to use and purchase technologically sophisticated products, as well as to participate meaningfully in the development of these products. Industry innovation and user demand have been associated with more affordable, user-friendly products. This is an ongoing process, beginning with the development of mass production and increasing dramatically as digitization became commonplace.

[[Thomas Friedman]] argued that the era of globalization has been characterized by the democratization of technology, democratization of finance, and democratization of information.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, T.L. (1999). The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Technology has been critical in the latter two processes, facilitating the rapid expansion of access to specialized knowledge and tools, as well as changing the way that people view and demand such access.

==History==
Scholars and social critics often cite the invention of the [[printing press]] as a major invention that changed the course of history. The force of the printing press rested not in its impact on the printing industry or inventors, but on its ability to transmit information to a broader public by way of mass production. This event is so widely recognized because of its social impact – as a democratizing force.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, J. (11 Feb. 2011). "[http://www.voxeu.org/article/information-technology-and-economic-change-impact-printing-press Information technology and economic change: The impact of the printing press]." VOX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press is often seen as the historical counterpart to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;Holbert, G.L. (2002). "Technology, Libraries and the Internet: A Comparison of the Impact of the Printing Press and World Wide Web." Electronic Journal of Academic and Special Leadership, 3(1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8014/index2.html#fn0 The Information Age and the Printing Press: Looking Backward to See Ahead]." Rand Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the development of the Internet in 1969, its use remained limited to communications between scientists and within government, although use of email and boards gained popularity among those with access. It did not become a popular means of communication until the 1990s. In 1993 the US federal government opened the Internet to commerce and the creation of [[HTML]] formed the basis for universal accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand, P. (2000). The Internet, democracy and democratization. Democratization, 7(1): 1–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major innovations===
The Internet has played a critical role in modern life as a typical feature of most Western households, and has been key in the [[democratization of knowledge]]. It not only constitutes arguably the most critical innovation in this trend thus far; it has also allowed users to gain knowledge of and access to other technologies. Users can learn of new developments more quickly, and purchase high-tech products otherwise only actively marketed to recognized experts. Some have argued that [[cloud computing]] is having a major effect by allowing users greater access through mobility and pay-as-you-use capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Mike. (12 March 2012). "[https://www.wired.com/insights/2012/03/personal-cloud-2014/ {{-'}}Personal Cloud' to Replace PC by 2014, Says Gartner]." Wired.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social media]] has also empowered and emboldened users to become contributors and critics of technological developments.&lt;ref name="Gartner"&gt;Gartner (March 12, 2012). "[http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1947315 Gartner Says the Personal Cloud Will Replace the Personal Computer as the Center of Users' Digital Lives by 2014]."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[open-source model]] allows users to participate directly in development of software, rather than indirect participation, through contributing opinions. By being shaped by the user, development is directly responsive to user demand and can be obtained for free or at a low cost.&lt;ref&gt;Jesiek, B.K. (6 Oct. 2003). "Democratizing Software: Open Source, the Hacker Ethic, and Beyond." First Monday, 8(10).&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparable trend, [[arduino]] and [[littleBits]] have made electronics more accessible to users of all backgrounds and ages. The development of 3D printers has the potential to increasingly democratize production.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://fritzing.org/media/uploads/publications/FritzingInfoBrochure-lowRes.pdf Fritzing]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

This trend is linked to the spread of knowledge of and ability to perform high-tech tasks, challenging previous conceptions of expertise.&lt;ref name="Bijker, W.E 1995"&gt;Bijker, W.E. Democratization of Technology—Who are the Experts? (1995) for Kolloquium "Expertenkultur und  Demokratie". Aachen: Thouet-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread access to technology, including lower costs, was critical to the transition to the [[new economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C.P. (30 May 1983). "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926013-1,00.html The New Economy]."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, democratization of technology was also fuelled by this economic transition, which produced demands for technological innovation and optimism in technology-driven progress.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, S.L. (1989). Science, Technology and Social Progress. Cranbury: Lehigh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, a spreading constructivist conception of technology has emphasized that the social and technical domains are critically intertwined.&lt;ref name="Bijker, W.E 1995"/&gt; Scholars have argued that technology is non-neutral, defined contextually and locally by a certain relationship with society.&lt;ref name="Feenberg, A. 1999"&gt;Feenberg, A. (1999). Questioning Technology. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415197546}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veak, T. (2000). "Whose Technology? Whose Modernity? Questioning Feenberg's Questioning Technology." Science, Technology and Human Values 25(2):226–237. {{JSTOR|690112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Feenberg]], a central thinker in the philosophy of technology, argued that democratizing technology means expanding technological design to include alternative interests and values.&lt;ref&gt;Veak, T.J. (2006). Democratizing Technology: Andrew Feenberg’s Critical Theory of Technology. New York: SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When successful in doing so, this can be a tool for increasing inclusiveness. This also suggests an important participatory role for consumers if technology is to be truly democratic. Feenberg asserts that this must be achieved by consumer intervention in a liberated design process.&lt;ref name="Feenberg, A. 1999"/&gt;

Improved access to specialized knowledge and tools has been associated with an increase in the "[[do it yourself]]" (DIY) trend.&lt;ref&gt;Grassmuck, V.R. (9 Oct. 2010). "File-Sharing as Social Practice: Do-It-Yourself Access to Knowledge and its Relation to the Formal and Informal Market.” For The 3rd Free Culture Research Conference, Free University Berlin, 8.-9. October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been associated with [[consumerization]], whereby personal or privately owned devices and software are also used for business purposes. Some have argued that this is linked to reduced dependence on traditional information technology departments.&lt;ref&gt;Niehaves, B.; Köffer, S.; Ortbach, K.; Katschewitz, S. (July 2012). "Towards an IT Consumerization Theory – A Theory and Practice Review." In: Working Papers, European Research Center for Information Systems 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astra Taylor, the author of the book ''The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the  Digital Age'', argues, "The promotion of Internet-enabled amateurism is a lazy substitute for real equality of opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8050-9356-8|location=New York, New York|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry impact===
In some ways, democratization of technology has strengthened this industry. Markets have broadened and diversified. Consumer feedback and input is available at a very low or no cost.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;Gardner, D. (12 July 2011). "[http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/72847.html Open Source and the Democratization of IT]." Linux Insider.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, related industries are experiencing decreased demand for qualified professionals as consumers are able to fill more of their demands themselves. Users of a range of types and status have access to increasingly similar technology.&lt;ref name="Gartner" /&gt; Because of the decreased costs and expertise necessary to use products and software, professionals (e.g. in the audio industry) may experience loss of work.&lt;ref&gt;Capps, R. (24 Aug. 2009) "[https://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/magazine/17-09/ff_goodenough?currentPage=all The Good Enough Revolution: When Cheap and Simple is Just Fine]."&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, technology is accessible but sufficiently complex that most users without specialized training are able to operate it without necessarily understanding how it works. Additionally, the process of consumerization has led to an influx in the number of devices in businesses and accessing private networks that IT departments cannot control or access.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; While this can lead to lowered operating costs and increased innovation, it is also associated with security concerns that most businesses are unable to address at the pace of the spread of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Moschella, D., D. Neal, P. Opperman and J. Taylor. (2004). ''The "Consumerization" of Information Technology''. El Segundo, California, USA: CSC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political impact===

Some scholars have argued that technological change will bring about a third wave of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand, P. (2000). The Internet, democracy and democratization. Democratization, 7(1): 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has been recognized for its role in promoting increased citizen advocacy and government transparency.&lt;ref name="NDI"&gt;"[http://www.ndi.org/democracy-and-technology Democracy and Technology]." National Democratic Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Chen, a leading thinker in democratic engagement technologies, distinguishes the democratizing effects of technology from democracy itself. Chen has argued that, while the Internet may have democratizing effects, the Internet alone cannot deliver democracy at all levels of society unless technologies are purposely designed for the nuances of democracy, specifically the engagement of large groups of people in between elections in and beyond government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Redefining Democracy for People's Power {{!}} Jesse Chen {{!}} TEDxLoyolaMarymountU|date=2015-08-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmgD_aCSPM|accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of the Internet and other forms of technology has led to increased global connectivity. Many scholars believe that it has been associated in the developing world not only with increased Western influence, but also with the spread of democracy through increased communication, efficiency, and access to information.&lt;ref name="NDI" /&gt; Scholars have drawn associations between the level of technological connectedness and democracy in many nations.&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Rıza Babaoğlan (16 Jan. 2013). "[http://www.alibabaoglan.com/blog/comparative-analyze-internet-usage-and-level-of-democratization.html Comparative Analyze: Internet Usage and Level of Democratization]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can enhance democracy in the developed world as well. In addition to increased communication and transparency, some electorates have implemented online voting to accommodate an increased number of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/internet-voting.aspx Internet Voting]."

They are also given D-Terminals that hold Crest-themed Digi-Eggs that allow their Digimon partners to undergo Armor Digivolution to counter the presence of Control Spires. The Digimon Emperor, revealed to be boy genius Ken Ichijoji, flees to the Digital World. Assisted by Ken's partner, Wormmon, the DigiDestined defeat Ken and have him realize his mistakes.

While the DigiDestined rebuild the Digital World, Davis, Yolei, and Cody unlock normal Digivolution. At the same, they ally themselves with a reformed Ken, who joins the team to fight Arukenimon, a Digimon who revives the Control Spires as other Digimon. When the Control Spire Digimon prove to be stronger than them, the DigiDestined learn DNA Digivolution, which enable two champion-level Digimon to merge into a stronger ultimate-level one. In response, Arukenimon creates BlackWarGreymon, but BlackWarGreymon begins to destroy the Destiny Stones to validate his existence and challenge Azulongmon, who appears when each Stone is destroyed. Once Azulongmon defeats BlackWarGreymon and sends him off, he warns the DigiDestined about an impending threat behind Arukenimon and Mummymon.

During Christmas, Control Spires appear across the human world, bringing Digimon with them. While the DigiDestined set off with Imperialdramon to destroy them with the help of the international DigiDestined, Arukenimon and Mummymon begin kidnapping several children for Yukio Oikawa, a friend of Cody's father who dreams of entering the Digital World. Once the DigiDestined return to Japan, they fight the Daemon Corps while Oikawa uses the Dark Spore inside Ken to implant them into the children. BlackWarGreymon returns to defeat Oikawa, but after he is mortally wounded, he sacrifices himself to seal the portal to the Digital World at Highton View Terrace before Oikawa can transport himself and the children there.

The DigiDestined are transported to the Dream World with Oikawa and the children, where Myotismon splits from Oikawa and uses the energy from the children's Dark Spores to be reborn as MaloMyotismon. With help from the DigiDestined all over the world, the DigiDestined defeat MaloMyotismon and Oikawa sacrifices his body to rebuild the Digital World. Twenty five years later, humans and the Digimon live side by side.

After the success of season 1 of ''[[Digimon Adventure|Digimon: Digital Monsters]]'', the producers requested the writers to add more North American jokes to the script, resulting in several revisions.

===Films===
{{Main|List of Digimon films|Digimon: The Movie}}

Several short films were screened in Japanese theaters during the show's run. A two-part featurette, {{nihongo|''Digimon Adventure 02: Part I: Digimon Hurricane Landing!!/Part II: Transcendent Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals''|デジモンアドベンチャー02: 前編 デジモンハリケーン上陸！！ / 後編 超絶進化！！ 黄金のデジメンタル|Dejimon Adobenchā Zero Tsū: Zenpen: Dejimon Harikēn Jōriku!!/Kōhen: Chōzetsu Shinka!! Ōgon no Digimentaru}} was released on July 8, 2000 as part of Toei Animation Summer 2000 Animation Fair. The film was featured along with ''[[Ojamajo Doremi|Ojamajo Doremi #: The Movie]]'', which was screened in between. In the film, the older DigiDestined are abducted by Wendigomon. The younger DigiDestined investigate their disappearance along with American DigiDestined Willis and his partner, Terriermon, who share a common past with Wendigomon. The film grossed [[Japanese yen|¥]]120 billion. The film's ending theme song is {{nihongo|"Stand By Me ~Hitonatsu no Bōken~"|スタンド・バイ・ミー～ひと夏の冒険～|Sutando Bai Mī ~Hitonatsu no Bōken~}} by [[Ai Maeda (voice actress)|AiM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/229849/products/165061/1/ | title=スタンド・バイ・ミー～ひと夏の冒険～ | language=ja | work=[[Oricon]] | accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Digimon Adventure 02: Part 1: Digimon Hurricane Landing!!/Part 2: Transcendent Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals'' was released in North America on October 6, 2000, as the third part of ''[[Digimon: The Movie]]'', which included ''Digimon Adventure'' (1999) and ''Digimon Adventure: Children's War Game!'' (2000). The film was heavily altered, one of the cuts including the subplot where the older DigiDestined are kidnapped by Wendigomon, because Saban Entertainment lacked funding to produce a full two-hour movie. Scriptwriter [[Jeff Nimoy]] had wanted to release the movie separately as a television film, but the idea was overruled.&lt;ref name="nimoy"/&gt; In addition to Japanese elements being removed and North American jokes added,&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news |title=Digiconfusion from a parallel universe |first=Liam |last=Lacey|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis' backstory was slightly rewritten to include that he had created Diaboromon in order to draw a connection to ''Digimon Adventure: Children's War Game!''&lt;ref name="nimoy"/&gt;

{{nihongo|''Digimon Adventure 02: Revenge of Diaboromon''|デジモンアドベンチャー02: ディアボロモンの逆襲 |Dejimon Adobenchā Zero Tsū: Diaboromon no Gyakushū}} was released on March 3, 2001. The story follows the DigiDestined fighting against a resurrected Diaboromon. The film was released in the United States on August 5, 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">'''Domestic realism''' normally refers to the genre of 19th-century novels popular with women readers. This body of writing is also known as "[[Sentimental novel|sentimental fiction]]" or "woman's fiction". The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s "Our Country Neighbors" and ''The New Housekeeper's Manual'' written by Stowe and her sister-in-law [[Catharine Beecher]] are works of domestic realism.  The style's particular characteristics are:

"1. Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman (Reynolds) who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the passive woman (incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroine's mother is this type) and the "belle," who is deprived of a proper education.

2. The heroine struggles for self-mastery, learning the pain of conquering her own passions (Tompkins, Sensational Designs, 172).

3. The heroine learns to balance society's demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of religion.

4. She suffers at the hands of [[abuse of power|abusers of power]] before establishing a network of surrogate kin.

5. The plots "repeatedly identify immersion in feeling as one of the great temptations and dangers for a developing woman. They show that feeling must be controlled. . . " (Baym 25). Frances Cogan notes that the heroines thus undergo a full education within which to realize feminine obligations (The All-American Girl).

6. The tales generally end with marriage, usually one of two possible kinds:

A. Reforming the bad or "wild" male, as in [[Augusta Jane Evans|Augusta Evans]]'s ''St. Elmo'' (1867)

B. Marrying the solid male who already meets her qualifications.
Examples: [[Maria Susanna Cummins|Maria Cummins]], ''[[The Lamplighter]]'' (1854) and [[Susan Warner]], ''[[The Wide, Wide World]]'' (1850) 

7. The novels may use a "language of tears" that evokes sympathy from the readers.

8. [[Richard H. Brodhead|Richard Brodhead]] (Cultures of Letters) sees class as an important issue, as the ideal family or heroine is poised between a lower-class family exemplifying poverty and domestic disorganization and upper-class characters exemplifying an idle, frivolous existence (94)."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Donna M. ''Domestic or Sentimental Fiction, 1820-1865'' 21 May 2007. [http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/domestic.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this style of novel is [[Jane Smiley]]'s ''[[A Thousand Acres]]'' in which the main character's confinement is emphasized in such a way.

Some early exponents of the genre of domestic realism were [[Jane Austen]] and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]].

'''Earth Hour''' is a worldwide movement organized by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).  The event is held annually encouraging individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off non-essential electric lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm on a specific day towards the end of March, as a symbol of commitment to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.earthhour.org/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started as a lights-off event in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2007. Since then, it has grown to engage more than 7,000 cities and towns across 187 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/Earth_Hour_Report_2017.pdf|title=Earth Hour 2017 report|author=|first=|date=|website=www.earthhour.org|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, in years when [[Holy Saturday]] falls on the last Saturday of March, Earth Hour is moved a week early rather than its traditional date.

Earth Hour 2018 was on March 24, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm.

Earth Hour 2019 is scheduled for March 30, from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/earthhour|title=Earth Hour (@earthhour) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Conception and start: 2004–2007===
In 2004, confronted with scientific findings, WWF Australia met with advertising agency [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Sydney]] to "discuss ideas for engaging Australians on the issue of climate change".&lt;ref name="earthhour1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |title=history |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327103047/http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a large scale switch off was coined and developed in 2006, originally under the working title "The Big Flick".  WWF Australia presented their concept to [[Fairfax Media]] who, along with Sydney Lord Mayor [[Clover Moore]], agreed to back the event.&lt;ref name="earthhour1"/&gt; The 2007 Earth Hour was held on March 31 in Sydney, Australia at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm, local time.

In October 2007 San Francisco ran its own "Lights Out" program inspired by the Sydney Earth Hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/19/local/me-lightsout19 |title= Hour leg of darkness | newspaper = [[LA Times]] | date = September 19, 2007| author = John M. Glionna}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their successful event in October, the organizers decided to rally behind the Earth Hour being planned for March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightsoutsf.org/2007/10/24/moving-forward/ |title=Moving forward &amp;#124; Lights Out San Francisco |publisher=Lightsoutsf.org |date=October 24, 2007 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikinews|Businesses and individuals worldwide turn lights off as part of Earth Hour 2008}}
Earth Hour 2008 was held internationally on March 29, 2008 from 8&amp;nbsp;pm to 9&amp;nbsp;pm local time, marking the first anniversary of the event. 35 countries around the world participated as official flagship cities and over 400 cities also supported. Landmarks around the world turned off their non-essential lighting for Earth Hour. Some websites took part in the event, with Google's homepage going "dark" on the day .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cities Shut Lights for Earth Hour 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/03/29/world-cities-shut-lights-for-earth-hour-2008/|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Zogby International online survey, 36 million Americans—approximately 16 percent of the United States adult population—participated in Earth Hour 2008. The survey also showed there was a 4 percentage point increase in the level of interest in environmental issues such as climate change and pollution directly after the event (73 percent pre-event versus 77 percent post-event).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/21/idUS134396+21-Apr-2008+BW20080421 | title = 36 Million Americans Take Part in World Wildlife Fund's Global 'Earth Hour' | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = April 28, 2008 | accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to WWF Thailand, [[Bangkok]] decreased electricity usage by 73.34 [[megawatts]], which, [[megawatt-hour|over one hour]], is equivalent to 41.6 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/03/29/earth-hour.html |title= Canadians go dark with world for Earth Hour |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/bangkok-post/20080330/281500746965118 Bangkok Post]'' gave different figures of 165 [[megawatt-hours]] and 102 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]]. This was noted to be significantly less than a similar campaign initiated by Bangkok's City Hall the previous year in May, when 530 megawatt-hours were saved and 143 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide emission]] were cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/30Mar2008_news03.php|title=Lights out campaign disappointing: Bangkok helps save very little energy |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30 |publisher=[[Bangkok Post]]}} {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippine Electricity Market Corp. noted that power consumption dropped by about 78.63 megawatts in [[Metro Manila]], and up to 102.2 megawatts on [[Luzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20080331-127542/Earth-Hour-made-dent-in-power-use |title=Earth Hour made dent in power use |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=March 31, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526020555/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20080331-127542/Earth-Hour-made-dent-in-power-use |archivedate=May 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum demand drop of around 39 MW was experienced at 8:14&amp;nbsp;pm in Metro Manila and of around 116&amp;nbsp;MW at 8:34&amp;nbsp;pm in the Luzon grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/theenvironmentreport/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20081211-177480 |title=WWF calls for 'lights out' event in 2009 |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212211646/http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/theenvironmentreport/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20081211-177480 |archivedate=December 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario]] used approximately 900 megawatt-hours less electrical energy during Earth Hour. At one point, [[Toronto]] saw an 8.7% reduction in consumption as compared to a typical March Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/SpecialSections/EarthHour/article/407246 |title= Toronto hits energy target |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30 | first=Peter | last=Gorrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland, as a whole, had a reduction in electricity use of about 1.5% for the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0330/environment.html |title= Ireland uses less power for 'Earth Hour' |publisher=[[RTÉ News And Current Affairs|RTÉ News]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the three-hour period between 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm, there was a reduction of 50 megawatts, saving 150 megawatt-hours, or approximately 60 tonnes of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name = "continuation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mhojojmhcwoj/ |title= Call for continuation of Earth Hour ethos |publisher=Breakingnews.ie |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dubai]], where external lighting on several major city landmarks was turned off and street lighting in selected areas was dimmed by 50%, the Electricity and Water Authority reported savings of 100 megawatt-hours of electricity. This represented a 2.4% reduction in demand compared to before the hour began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/515051-dubai-slashes-energy-use-for-earth-hour?ln=en |title= Dubai slashes energy use for Earth Hour |publisher=[[Arabian Business]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best result was from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, with the city reporting a drop of 13% in electricity demand. However, national grid operator [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] reported that New Zealand's power consumption during Earth Hour was 335 megawatts, higher than the 328 megawatt average of the previous two Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4457620a11.html Lights on, power use up for Earth Hour]. Kelly Andrew. ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]''. Monday, March 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melbourne]], Australia reduced demand by 10.1%. Sydney, being the city that participated in both the 2007 and 2008 Earth Hours, cut electricity consumption by 8.4%. This is less than the previous year's 10.2%; however, Earth Hour executive director Andy Ridley made the claim that after factoring [[margin of error]], the participation in this city was the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/407472 |title= Where do we go from here? |work=[[Toronto Star]] |pages=A1, A17 |date= March 31, 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-31 | first=Peter | last=Gorrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippines]] saw participation from 647 cities and towns; over 10&amp;nbsp;million Filipinos were estimated to have joined in the hour-long lights-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/06/philippines-earth-hour-2010/|title=Philippines: Earth Hour 2010 |work=Global Voices|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by Greece with 484 cities and towns participating, and Australia with 309.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/2009/03/31/step-forward-earth-wins-in-2009-vote-earth-earth-hour-campaign/|title=Step Forward – Earth Wins in 2009 Vote Earth / Earth Hour Campaign|work=Ecology Global Network|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite official organizers WWF stating that the event is not about the reduction in electricity, a number of public institutions reported on electricity savings in their cities to see participation numbers. The [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], excluding the city of [[Toronto]], saw a decrease of 6% in electricity usage while [[Toronto]] saw a decrease of 15.1% (nearly doubled from 8.7% the previous year) as many businesses darkened, including the landmark [[CN Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090329/earth_hour_090329/20090329?hub=TorontoHome |title=CTV Toronto – Earth Hour prompts 15 per cent T.O. power drop – CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippines]] was able to save 611 MWh of electricity during the time period, which is said to be equivalent to shutting down a dozen coal-fired power plants for an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adraneda |first=Katherine |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleid=454057 |title=RP's Earth Hour savings: 611 megawatt-hours |newspaper=The Philippine Star |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States polling showed that an estimated 90,000,000 Americans participated in Earth Hour as lights were turned off around the country, including landmarks such as [[Mount Rushmore]], the [[Las Vegas Strip]], the [[Empire State Building]] and [[Niagara Falls]].

Some cities and landmarks took the opportunity to make more long-term adjustments to their everyday power consumption. In Chicago, the [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] (BOMA) developed lighting guidelines to reduce light pollution and reduce the carbon footprint of downtown buildings. [[Mount Rushmore]] in [[South Dakota]] started powering down each night around 9&amp;nbsp;pm instead of 11&amp;nbsp;pm.

In [[Vietnam]], electricity demand fell 500,000&amp;nbsp;kWh during Earth Hour 2010, which was three times larger than the first time the country joined the event in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[Tr&amp;#7903; v&amp;#7873;] |url=http://www.vnexpress.net/GL/Kinh-doanh/2010/03/3BA1A2E1/ |title=Tiết kiệm 450 triệu đồng trong giờ Trái đất |publisher=VnExpress |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
Earth Hour 2011 was the biggest year in the campaign's five-year history, reaffirming it as the largest ever voluntary action for the environment. In 2011, the tagline "Beyond the Hour" was adopted by organizers as a way to encourage people to take their commitment to the cause beyond the 60-minute event. Together with agency Leo Burnett, Earth Hour unveiled an updated planet themed logo that included a small plus symbol to the right of the signature "60" which was used in previous years. The 60+ symbol continues to be the main logo used by campaign organizers around the world.

Earth Hour 2011 took place in a record 5,251 cities and towns in 135 countries and territories on all seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |title=about |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330132314/http://www.earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an estimated reach of 1.8&amp;nbsp;billion people across the globe. In addition to this, the campaign's digital footprint grew to 91 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthhour.org/blog/earthhour-heats-social-media |title=#Earthhour Heats Up on Social Media |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628120010/http://earthhour.org/blog/earthhour-heats-social-media |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippines]], which has been an active participant of the Earth Hour, had an early "earth hour" when power was accidentally interrupted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gatdulla and Villanueva|first=Rodina and Donabelle|title=Earth Hour comes early in Metro |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=670245&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=68&amp;newsalert|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; plunging Metro Manila and nearby [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] into darkness. After power was restored, major buildings, commercial centers and residential areas in Metro Manila and most [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] continued to turn off their lights, while participating channels in the Philippines, ABS-CBN and Cartoon Network halted their transmissions for an hour.

30 provinces and cities in Vietnam took part in Earth Hour 2011 with the main event held in [[Nha Trang]]. The nation's electricity demand fell 400,000&amp;nbsp;kWh, one-fifth less than the previous year's. Vietnam managed to save 500 million [[VND]] (US$23,809) thanks to the saved power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |title=Vietnam Foreign Press Center – Vietnam saves 400,000 kWh of power during Earth Hour |publisher=Presscenter.org.vn |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322162359/http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |archivedate=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube promoted the Earth Hour by changing its logo, and by adding a switch on/off feature near the title of each video, so that users could change the background colour from white to black.

One of the least co-operative areas traditionally has been [[Alberta]]; in 2008, Calgary's power consumption went up during Earth Hour. The trend continued in 2011 when [[Edmonton]]'s power usage also increased. While [[Calgary]]'s power usage went down in 2011 during the event, electricity officials could not distinguish their readings between normal usage and a conscious attempt to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2011/03/28/edmonton-earth-hour-failure.html |title=No Energy for Earth Hour |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniquely participating in the Earth Hour activity are the inhabitants of an island called [[Sibuyan]] in the Philippines who turned on their lights to elevate the message of using renewable energy. The island's source of electricity is a mini-hydro power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/88271-philippines-sibuyan-island-lights-earth-hour|title=PH island switches on lights during Earth Hour|work=Rappler|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
Earth Hour 2016 was on Saturday, March 19, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm during participants' local time. It was also changed to avoid coinciding with the Christian [[Holy Saturday]], which fell on March 26 of that year. It was the 10th anniversary of the campaign's beginnings in Sydney, Australia. Östersund in Sweden cancelled the 2016 event, following a spate of sex attacks, highlighting safety as a subject for discussion when saving resources.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Almost all the countries in the world observed Earth Hour.

=== 2017 ===
Earth Hour occurred on Saturday, March 25.

=== 2018 ===
Earth Hour 2018 took place on March 24, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm in participants' time, in order to avoid coinciding with Catholic [[Holy Saturday]] which fell on March 31.

==Measurement of reduction in electricity use==
The Earth Hour Global FAQ page states:
{{Quote|Earth Hour does not purport to be an energy/[[Carbon neutrality|carbon reduction]] exercise, it is a symbolic action. Therefore, we do not engage in the measurement of energy/carbon reduction levels for the hour itself. Earth Hour is an initiative to encourage individuals, businesses and governments around the world to take accountability for their [[ecological footprint]] and engage in dialogue and resource exchange that provides real solutions to our environmental challenges. Participation in Earth Hour symbolizes a commitment to change beyond the hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/celebrating-earth-hour |title=Celebrating Earth Hour |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 2014 study published in ''Energy Research and Social Science'' compiled 274 measurements of observed changes in electricity demand caused by Earth Hour in 10 countries, spanning 6 years, and found that the events reduced electricity consumption an average of 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000474|title=The electricity impacts of Earth Hour: An international comparative analysis of energy-saving behavior|accessdate=May 31, 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.04.014|volume=2|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|pages=159–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted the policy challenge of converting Earth Hour's short-term energy saving into longer-term actions, including sustained changes in behaviour and investment.

==Criticism==

[[Bjørn Lomborg]], author of ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'', wrote, "It is vital to make [[solar power|solar]] and [[green energy|other new technology]] cheaper than fossil fuels quickly so we can turn off carbon energy sources for a lot longer than one hour and keep the planet running... Fossil fuels literally gave us an enlightenment, by lighting our world and giving us protection from the fury of the elements. It is ironic that today's pure symbolism should hark back to a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|darker age]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25247677-7583,00.html | title = Hour of no power increases emissions | publisher = The Australian | date = March 27, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.lomborg.com/sites/lomborg.com/files/2009_mc_27_bl_op-ed_hour_of_no_power_0.pdf | archivedate = October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg also pointed out the feel-good factor Earth Hour creates, noting that it is an "ineffective feel good event" that makes people feel they are doing something for the environment, while in reality the amount of carbon emissions reduced by the earth hour is negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Why Bjorn Lomborg won't be turning off the lights during Earth Hour|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/q-a-why-bjorn-lomborg-won-t-be-turning-off-the-lights-during-earth-hour-1.2591072|accessdate=June 12, 2014|work=Mark Gollom, CBC News|agency=CBC News|issue=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms of Earth Hour have included the following:  
* Some critics point out that the reduction in power consumption during Earth Hour itself is relatively insignificant.&lt;ref name = "rage against dimming"&gt;{{cite news | last = Soloman | first = David | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21694864-7583,00.html | title = Rage, rage against dimming of the light | publisher = The Australian | date = May 9, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Herald Sun]]'' equated the power savings in the Sydney central business district to "taking 48,613 cars off the road for 1 hour".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Australian columnist [[Andrew Bolt]] pointed out that "A cut so tiny is trivial – equal to taking six cars off the road for a year".&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, Andrew (March 28, 2008).

*Other environmentalists have criticized Earth Hour's focus on individual behaviour, when a small number of fossil fuel companies have emitted the vast majority of man-made carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainababble.fish/?p=101|title=Sustainababble Podcast - Earth Hour|last=|first=|date=29 March 2015|website=|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam McGibbon, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', criticized Earth Hour for releasing fossil fuel companies and politicians from their responsibility to deal with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/earth-hour-climate-change-environment-fossil-fuels-boycott-make-change-happen-really-care-a7643971.html|title=If you really care about climate change, boycott Earth Hour|date=2017-03-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' said that most candles are made from [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], a heavy [[hydrocarbon]] derived from [[crude oil]], a [[fossil fuel]], and that depending on how many candles a person burns (if one uses candles during Earth Hour), whether or not they normally use [[compact fluorescent light]] bulbs, and what source of energy is used to produce their electricity, in some cases, replacing light bulbs with candles will cause an increase, instead of a decrease, in carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/03/27/does-lighting-candles-for-earth-hour-defeat-the-purpose/ Does lighting candles for Earth Hour defeat the purpose?], ''Christian Science Monitor'', March 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 29, 2009, one day after Earth Hour 2009, ''Dân Trí Daily News'' published an editorial expressing concern that many young people chose to drive around the darkened city of [[Hanoi]] for fun, exhausting petroleum instead of electricity and resulting in long traffic jams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dantri.com.vn/xa-hoi/cai-nhin-khac-trong-gio-trai-dat-316112.htm "Cái nhìn khác trong Giờ Trái đất"], ''Dân Trí Daily News'', by Cường Cao, date: 2009-03-29. {{vi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*George Marshall of the Climate Outreach Information Network criticized Earth Hour for "playing into the hands of (the critics of environmentalists)," as darkness is symbolic of fear and decay.  "The overwhelming need at the moment is to inspire ordinary people with a vision of a better world, to make them feel that action on climate change is utterly desirable and positive.... the cultural resonance (of Earth Hour) couldn't be any worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/mar/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions|title=Earth Hour: Turning out the lights plays into the hands of our critics|last=Marshall|first=George|date=2009-03-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] has introduced an opposing ''Human Achievement Hour'' in celebration of human progress in various fields of industry, including technology, medicine, energy, and more. During this hour, the Institute suggests that people celebrate by using modern technology such as electricity, telecommunications and indoor plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cei.org/content/human-achievement-hour-2015|title=Human Achievement Hour 2015|work=cei.org|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2009, economist [[Ross McKitrick]] criticized the idea, saying, "Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century.[...] The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/earthhour.pdf | title=Earth Hour: A Dissent | last=McKitrick | first=Ross | authorlink=Ross McKitrick | year=2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' quoted Ross Hayman, head of media relations at the [[UK National Grid]], as saying "it could therefore result in an increase in carbon emissions" due to complications related to rapidly lowering then raising electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7527469/Earth-Hour-will-not-cut-carbon-emissions.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Earth Hour 'will not cut carbon emissions' | date=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2010, Rick Giles, president of [[ACT on Campus]], the youth wing of New Zealand's [[ACT Party]], appeared on the [[morning television]] show ''[[Sunrise (New Zealand TV program)|Sunrise]]'' to denounce Earth Hour and instead suggested the celebration of "Edison Hour". He argued that Earth Hour is an "anti-technology" cause, and that people will simply use candles instead, which is undesirable as they are petroleum-based. He argued that if we are heading for some kind of disaster, it makes sense to use technology to combat this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B9MqNzQuuk |title=I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it |publisher=YouTube |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick said "I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it".
* The [[Ayn Rand Institute]] wrote, "Participants spend an enjoyable sixty minutes in the dark, safe in the knowledge that the life-saving benefits of industrial civilization are just a light switch away... Forget one measly hour with just the lights off. How about Earth Month... Try spending a month shivering in the dark without heating, electricity, refrigeration; without power plants or generators; without any of the labor-saving, time-saving, and therefore life-saving products that industrial energy makes possible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://ari.aynrand.org/issues/science-and-industrialization/environmental-issues/The-Real-Meaning-of-Earth-Hour The Real Meaning of Earth Hour], by Keith Lockitch, Ayn Rand Institute, March 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expressing sarcastic support for Earth Hour, the pro-carbon Carbon Sense Coalition wants Earth Hour to be renamed "Blackout Night", and to be held outside on the shortest and coldest day of the year "...to prepare our population for the dark days ahead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carbon-sense.com/|title=The Carbon Sense Coalition|work=carbon-sense.com|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 2010 Earth Hour in the city of [[Uusikaupunki]] in Finland, a 17-year-old female motorcyclist hit a 71-year-old man, who was walking on the street instead of the sidewalk for an unknown reason. The man died from his injuries, while the motorcyclist and her passenger were uninjured. At the time of the accident the street lights had been turned off as part of the Earth Hour. The police stated that the lack of street lighting may have played a part in the accident, while the mayor believed the city's street lights would have been too dim to prevent it even if they had been on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mies kuoli moottoripyörän alle pimeystempauksen pimentämällä tiellä | work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] | url = &lt;!-- http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Mies+kuoli+moottoripy%C3%B6r%C3%A4n+alle+pimeystempauksen+piment%C3%A4m%C3%A4ll%C3%A4+tiell%C3%A4/1135255005911 --&gt;http://hommaforum.org/index.php?topic=25901.5;imode | date=March 27, 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-28 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaupunki sammutti katuvalot Earth Hourin ajaksi – Mies jäi moottoripyörän alle pimeällä tiellä ja kuoli |work=[[Aamulehti]] |url=http://www.aamulehti.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/174590.shtml |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-28 |language=Finnish }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13135">'''Engelbart's law''' is the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential. The law is named after [[Douglas Engelbart]], whose work in augmenting human performance was explicitly based on the realization that although we make use of technology,
the ability to improve on improvements ([[Bootstrapping]], "getting better at getting better") resides entirely within the human sphere.

Engelbart's Bootstrapping concept identifies the general, and particular, meaning of the observation with regards to rate and performance: a quantity, amount, or degree of something measured per unit of something else.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary
|publisher = Merriam-Webster
|year  = 1999
|isbn  = 978-0877797135
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, Engelbart's law is not limited to an increase in the acquisition, or use of, or quantity of knowledge, nor of the extent or depth of participation among individuals or teams, nor of the period-to-period change. The law is independent of the domain of performance and the quantity, amount, or degree on which one chooses a measure.

== Exponential performance ==

Humans have long performed at exponential levels, and in widely varying contexts and domains.

As with other phenomenon, when we notice similar results when applying a reagent or catalyst across many contexts and domains, we associate the power to produce or induce those results with the reagent, here the human animal.

Stephen Jay Kline presented an interesting visualization of this exponential phenomenon in his 1995 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; See page 173, figure 14-1. The Growth of Human Powers Over the Past 100,000 Years Plotted as Technoextension Factors (TEFs).
The log-log chart (time, TEF) illustrates exponential performance extending over many domains and over hundreds of years.

On this topic Kline's work made heavy use of the work of John H. Lienhard. Kline specifically references Linehard's ''The Rate of Technological Improvement before and after the 1830s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

, [[Gordon Moore]] locates the roots of his inspiration in Engelbart's observations on the propensity of humans to envision and achieve scale, and its non-linear effects.

== Collective IQ ==

Engelbart labeled Collective IQ as the ''measure of how well people can work on important problems and opportunities '''collectively'''''. It is, ultimately, ''a measure of effectiveness''.

It has long been the fashion to talk of human performance as if it were dependent on a particular socio-technology fabric. Yet Engelbart felt that what was important was not the particulars of that fabric, but its ''nature.'' He called the nature of that fabric

|accessdate= July 10, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to his realization was a [[Dynamic Knowledge Repository]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
('''DKR''')
capable of enabling the concurrent development, integration and application of knowledge ('''CoDIAK'''). Such a DKR would itself be
subject to the CoDIAK process.

This is a co-evolution of the human system and the tool system. To facilitate this, Engelbart observed that a particular structure of human activities is most useful and natural, the A-level ('Business as Usual'), B-level ('Improving how we do that') and C-level ('Improving how we improve') Activities.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url= http://www.dougengelbart.org/paradigm/abc-model-improvement.html
|title= ABC Model for Continuous Improvement
|author= Engelbart
|accessdate= July 10, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/abc-model.html ABC Model], and particularly [http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/abc-model.html#3 Turbo Charge the C Activity] and [http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/abc-model.html#4 Extra Bootstrapping] Engelbart addresses the necessity of the C-level Activitiy in the shift from an ''incremental improvement curve to an exponential improvement curve''.

Whereas B-level Activities achieve mildly-exponential results, Engelbart held that C-levels Activities are necessary to achieve Bootstrapping, improving the improvement, a direct dependence on the intrinsically exponential nature of humans.

== Bootstrap measurement ==

Although Engelbart never published a metric for measuring Bootstrap effects, the [[Bootstrap Alliance]], in 1997, considered, the characteristics of candidate metrics.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url= http://enosis.com/services/BA/baposition.pdf
|title= Positioning the Bootstrap Alliance
|author= Nick Ragouzis
|accessdate= July 10, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As derived from the above, candidate metrics would necessarily:

* Account for the feedback-like results of each of the ABC-level Activities
* Reflect an augmentation of ''CIQ''
* Measure an improved ability to ''CoDIAK'' through the use of a ''DKR''
* Capture the amplification of Bootstrapping itself

In addition to the above acronyms, the following represents the performance of ABC-level Activities by their respective letters:
&lt;math alt="A, B, C in calligraphic face"&gt;\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Insufficient Metrics ===

==== Simple Compounded Rate ====

Candidate metric:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math
alt="CIQ at time t = A-level Activity amplified by the B-level Activity repeatedly applied over all time periods"&gt;
CIQ_t = \mathcal{A} \left ( 1 + \mathcal{B} \right )^t
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Although this metric would reflect the augmentation of ''CIQ'', the efficiency in the concurrent development, integration, and application of knowledge ('''CoDIAK''') would be dependent solely on the application of B-level Activity to A-level Activity.
(For example:
&lt;math
alt="Change in CoDIAK = 1 plus A-level Activity"&gt;
CoDIAK_{t \to t+1} = 1 + \mathcal{B}
&lt;/math&gt;)
There is insufficiently-explicit accounting of improvements to CoDIAK dynamics, and no accounting of C-level Activities.

==== Simple Exponential Power ====

Although powerful, Engelbart's Bootstrapping effects are also unaccounted in simple exponential power formulations.

Candidate metric:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math
alt="CIQ at time t = A-level Activity amplified by the exponential effect
of the B-level Activities over time"&gt;
CIQ_t = \mathcal{A} e^{\mathcal{B} t}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Although this metric signifies an improved performance rate (e.g., we might say &lt;math alt="Change in CoDIAK = the exponential effect of the B-level Activities"&gt; CoDIAK_{t \to t+1} = e^\mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt;), it too provides insuffienct accounting of other activities.

=== Nature of a Candidate Metric ===

Comparing these two insufficient candidates illustrates the same key aspect underpinning Engelbart's law: human organization and directed activity are the essential elements to our performance.

An implication of the foregoing as insufficient Bootstrapping metrics is that simple exponential power relationships are insufficient to improve CoDIAK abilities. By definition this result precludes a simple combination of such metrics or laws, such as a factor or power relationship between [[Moore's law]] and [[Metcalfe's law]] (or variations thereon).

Various complex power functions, incorporating the effect of efforts at each of the ABC-level Activities were considered as candidates.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math
alt="CIQ at time t = A-level Activity augmented by two components: (1) the exponential effect of the t times application of B-level Activity, and (2) the current C-level Activity"&gt;
CIQ_t = \mathcal{A} e^{\mathcal{B} t} \mathcal{C}_t
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math
alt="CIQ at time t = A-level Activity augmented by the exponential effect
of the two activities: the t-times application of B-level Activity, and the current C-level Activity"&gt;
CIQ_t = \mathcal{A} e^{\mathcal{B}  t  \mathcal{C}_t}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math
alt="CIQ at time t = A-level Activity augmented by the exponential effect
of the two activities: B-level Activity times the sum total effect of
all prior C-level Activity"&gt;
CIQ_t = \mathcal{A} e^{\mathcal{B} \int\limits_{0}^{t} \mathcal{C}_x \, dx}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

The differences illustrate the interplay and interdependencies of A-level, B-level and C-level Activities, and the Bootstrapping effects (improved improvement). In all three, improvement to CIQ, CoDIAK, and Bootstrapping itself depends on a recursive application of B-level Activities and C-level Activities.

== Examples in practice ==

{{examples needed|date=July 2013}}

Although levels of exponential rates of performance, over many time periods and in many domains, with respect to quantity, extent, or degree, is well-documented by Lienhard and many others, modern and real-time ongoing of Bootstrapping levels of performance remain difficult to find.

Perhaps that is unsurprising given the absence of agreed metrics. It is likely also related to Engelbart's own observation that the
future may be very surprising, not merely concerning the yet-unseen challenges, but also concerning how well we organize our teams and our tools.

== Relevance in general ==

{{refimprove section|date=July 2013}}

In explicitly placing within the human sphere the locus of ability for improving our improvement, Engelbart's law chides us against choosing anemic measures of change in performance. Linear rates, or simple compound rates fall far short of our intrinsic abilities.

In addition to envisioning the Bootstrap Paradigm, describing the ''nature'' of a suitable socio-technical fabric, Engelbart envisioned its particular characteristics, which, when placed into use, and subjected to improvement upon improvement, would meet human requirements.

In this way, to fully utilize A-, B-, and C-level Activities, and achieve bootstrapping-levels of performance, we may more easily and readily redefine our measures until we have a suitable basis for such performance:

{{attribution needed|date=July 2013}}

* Include a larger community in A, B, or C-level Activities
* Redefine the problem, include the impact over a larger, or more focused collection of stakeholders
* Include previously-externalized costs
* Include measures for knock-on effects
* Measure second-party costs or benefits from third-party inaction or actions
* Radically increase speed or extent of the incorporation or diffusion of inquiry or knowledge

Engelbart, in writing and working, intended to apply this method of working to all domains of human endeavor, from the individual to the whole species, in private or public service {{attribution needed|date=July 2013}}.

Female participation and advancement in majority [[Muslim countries]], or nations in which more than 50% of the population identifies as an adherent of the Islamic faith, has traditionally been areas of controversy. Several Western nations&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, William; Joseph Hickey (2005). Society in Focus.

[[File:World Muslim Population (Pew Forum).svg|450px|thumb|A map of the Muslim population of the world, by percentage of each country, according to the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum]] 2009 report on world Muslim populations.]]
There are fifty-one countries in the world in which more than 50% of the population identify as Muslims.&lt;ref name = "Muslim World"&gt;"Muslim Population by Country". The Future of the Global Muslim Population. Pew Research Center. Retrieved 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These countries spread from [[North Africa]], to the [[Middle East]], to the [[Balkans]] and [[Central Asia]], to [[Southeast Asia]]. While many nations contain a strong Muslim presence, majority Muslim nations, by definition, have more Muslims as citizens than non-Muslims. Not all majority Muslim states, however, have Islam as their established religion. Turkey, for example, is a prominent Muslim country in which 99% of the population follows some form of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no official religion. The state is secular. Nigeria is also a majority Muslim country which is officially secular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook -Nigeria].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most majority Muslim nations, however, recognize Islam as the official state religion. Furthermore, many states identify a specific derivative of the Islamic faith as their official religion. For example, [[sunni]] Islam is the official state religion of: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Jordan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia]] Islam is the official religion of Iran, which is a theocracy. Some minority Islamic sects are official state religions as well.[[Ibadi]], a minority school within Islam, is the official religion of Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook -Oman].&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all states in the [[Muslim World]] institutionalize a distinction between the sects of Islam.

Retrieved 2012-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; All sects or schools are included. In Egypt, freedom of religion is extended to the [[Abrahamic religions]] even though Sunni Islam is the state-sponsored religion. Similarly, Indonesia, which is the world's largest Muslim country, guarantees freedom of religion but only recognizes six official religions. Islam is one of and the most prominent of the six. Despite a common religion, majority Muslim nations are quite disparate in terms of size, population, demographic composition, and the legal framework of religion.

A basic indicator of women's involvement in the formal economy is a statistic known as the [[labor force participation rate]]. This data point shows the percentage of women in a country who are either employed in full or part-time labor. According to the [[International Labour Organization]], the labor force participation rate is defined as "the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period."&lt;ref name = "ILO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/resource/subject/labourstat.htm|title=Research guides|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Table 2 lists the labor force participation rates of women in eleven majority [[Muslim]] countries. Majority Muslim countries are defined as states in which more than 50% of the population identifies with the Islamic faith.

Of these eleven countries, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Indonesia]] had the highest rates of female participation in the labor force in 2010 with 57% and 51%, respectively. [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and [[Afghanistan]] have the lowest rates of female labor force participation among these eleven nations with 13%, 14%, and 15%, respectively. However, numerically large discrepancies exist in the data for a couple of nations when drawn from different sources. Afghanistan's female labor force participation rate, for example, was 15% in 2010 according to World Bank figures.&lt;ref name = "World Bank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/topic/gender|title=Gender|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That percentage nearly doubles to 28.9% if data from [[UNESCAP]] is cited.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/stat/data/syb2011/III-Economy/Employment.asp|title=Employment, Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same discrepancy is true for figures for Iran for which the World Bank lists its female participation rate at 16% in 2010 and UNESCAP lists it as 26.9%.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; It is unclear why these two sources give significantly different numbers as their methodology and definitions of labor force participation were similar.

[[File:Female Employment to Female Population in 11 Muslim Majority Countries.png|thumb|450px|A graph of the percentage of women in 11 Muslim majority populations who are in the labor force relative to the entire population of women in those countries.]]

=== Female-to-male workers ratio ===

Another statistic indicative of female participation in the formal economy of a country is the ratio of female to male workers. As nations develop and their economies both expand and diversify, the expansion of jobs and industries increases this ratio, pushing it toward 1, provided female workers have access to job opportunities and firms, collectively, do not systematically discriminate against female candidates.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;

Generally speaking, the closer the ratio is to 1, the more gender equal an economy is because neither sex has a disproportionate share of jobs. Bangladesh and Indonesia have the largest ratio of these eleven countries with scores of 0.73 and 0.61, respectively. [[Nigeria]] also has a relatively large ratio of female to male workers of 0.51. Despite having twice the percentage of females in the actual labor force, [[Turkey]]'s female to male laborer ratio is far lower than Iran's, 0.35 to 0.44. Similarly, Syria's ratio is barely smaller than [[Egypt]]'s (0.27 as compared to 0.30) whereas Egypt's female population has twice the percentage size of formal economic workers as Syria's female labor force. These ratios are compiled and published by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum"&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf The Global Gender Gap Report 2012], World Economic Forum. By Ricardo Hausmann, Laura D. Tyson and Saadia Zahidi&lt;/ref&gt; The median annual income for female workers in the United States was $36,931 in 2010.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/womens-earnings-and-income|title=Knowledge Center|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum did not, however, list this information for Afghanistan, Iraq, or [[Tunisia]]. It is probable that the ratios are small given the low labor force participation rate of women in these countries and high unemployment rates, but given the uncertain correlation between female labor force participation rate and the ratio of male to female workers, this cannot be stated with any certainty. One possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy is the ratio of females to males in the population. In Syria, for every woman between the ages of 15 and 65, there are 1.03 males.&lt;ref&gt;"Syria." CIA World Fact Book. Central Intelligence Agency, n.d. Web. 21 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are more men than women for a limited number of jobs, more men, in absolute terms, are excluded from [[informal sector|formal employment]]. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent a larger percentage of those who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its female labor force participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.

Similar to the ratio of female to male workers in the labor force is the percentage of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers as a percentage of the total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;

However, as one is a subsect of the other, the two figures generally move collinearly. Despite a lower female labor force participation rate and a smaller female to male worker ratio, Nigeria's female workers represent the largest component, in terms of percentage, of a nation's labor force when compared to the other ten countries.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/|title=Country Facts Explorer - IndexMundi|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Labour Organization]], 42.84% of the Nigerian labor force is composed of women. Bangladesh and Indonesia are a close second and third with 39.87% and 38.23%, respectively. Iraq, Syria, and Turkey's labor force's female composition rates (14.30%, 15.20%, and 28.69%, respectively) are quite close to their female labor force participation rates which suggests a population parity between men and women. This is interesting as many other Developing countries do not have population parity by gender.&lt;ref&gt;"Sex Ratio". The World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female employment characteristics==
There are a variety of characteristics of female employment such as salary and employment type which are meaningful indicators of female economic participation and female economic stability. These indicators help clarify the economic status women hold in some majority Muslim nations and the permanence of their involvement in the economy. In development economics, great emphasis has been placed on salaried work because it provides a stable source of income.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chen"&gt;Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz, Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner.

===Salaried work===

''Salaried worker'', as defined by the [[International Labour Organization]], are "workers who hold the type of jobs defined as 'paid employment job' where the incumbents hold explicit (written or oral), or implicit employment contracts that give them a basic remuneration that is not directly dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work."&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Fundamentally, salaried workers are more likely to be full-time or, even permanent workers.&lt;ref name = "Chen" /&gt; Thus, they are staples of the formal market whereas non-salaried workers are more or less on the fringe of economic activity which relegates them to limited participation in the formal market.&lt;ref name = "Chen" /&gt;

While labor force participation rate sheds light on how many women work in the formal sectors of the economy, it says nothing about the type of work or the stable presence of women in the labor force. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, when female labor force participation rate or the ratio of male to female workers or similar indicators are considered, appear to have substantial female involvement in their economies. However, very few of the women in these nations have salaried work which means they may go through cycles of short periods of work punctuated by long periods of unemployment. Alternatively, these women may be shuffled from task to task for different employers and never develop a stable basis at a particular firm or within a particular field.

In Bangladesh and Indonesia, two majority Muslim countries with high female labor force participation rates, 11.70% and 31.70% of female workers are salaried, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Perhaps counter intuitively, majority Muslim countries such as Egypt, Iran, Syria, and Tunisia which have low rates of female labor force participation and a relatively small number of actual female laborers have high rates of female salaried employees. In Egypt, 47.9% of employed females have salaried jobs.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

In Iran, 46.8% of female workers are salaried and in Tunisia the percentage is 69.1%. Perhaps the most surprising case is Syria where 74.30% of women are salaried.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; This is the largest percentage in the Middle East and one of the highest in the entire Muslim world.

It is unclear why several nations with few female workers have such a high percentage of salaried women. One possible explanation is that so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages. This information has not been provided by the ILO for Iraq, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan.

===Employers, employees, self-employed===
'''Employees and self-employed'''

Women's role in the economy as employees, employers, or as self-employed labor units is another important characteristic of female labor force participation. In patriarchal societies or rigid(high degree of difficulty for workers to move between industries)  labor markets, women are more likely to be employees than employers because they do not have the resources, skills, networks, or opportunities to either be promoted within a firm or to be owners of small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;Bernasek, Alexandra. "Banking on Social Change: Grameen Bank Lending to Women."International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society. 16.3 (2003): 369-385. Web. 2 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Abhijit V. and Esther Duflo. 2011. “Barefoot Hedge-Fund Managers” and “The Men from Kabul and the Eunuchs of India: The (Not So) Simple Economics of Lending to the Poor,” in Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty. New York: PublicAffairs. Chapters 6 and 7, pp. 133–82 and notes, pp. 287–89&lt;/ref&gt; In poor countries, or countries with large swaths of poverty within the population, which many predominantly Muslim nations are or have,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-related-factors-economic.aspx|title=Related Factors|date=27 January 2011|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the probability of self-employment is greater because women cannot find more established jobs.

There are, however, dozens of reasons why women may be employees, employers, or self-employed that reach beyond basic macroeconomic forces or social norms and conventions. According to the ILO, more than half, 53% of all female workers in Iran are self-employed. In Egypt, slightly fewer women are self-employed than are in Iran. Fifty-two percent of Egyptian female workers have their own business ventures. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia have the highest rates of female self-employment with 86.7%, 77.9%, and 68.3%, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Very few women are involved in the formal labor market in Pakistan but more than three fourths of them are self-employed. Nearly half of working women in Turkey are self-employers with 49% of female workers operating their own private enterprise or services.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Female economic activity and participation is widely distributed across the Muslim world.

==== Female employers ====

The female labor force participation rate, the ratio of female workers to male workers, the wage security of women, and other elements of formal economic activity cover a large interval across predominantly Muslim nations. However, across most majority Muslim nations, there is a sharp convergence on female employers. With the exception of Turkey, hardly any women are employers in many majority Muslim nations.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

In Turkey, 48% of female workers are employers. This statistic suggests that Turkish women hire at least one additional worker for their self-employed commercial enterprises considering that self-employment is the most common form of employment among this demographic group. The second largest percentage of female employers as a percentage of female workers is 3% in Egypt. In Indonesia where 68% of women are self-employed and 38% of the labor force is composed of women, only 1% of these individuals are employers.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

One tenth of one percent of female workers in Bangladesh are employers despite the nation's sizable female labor pool. This number is one eighth of the percentage of Syrian women who are employers. Syria has, of course, only one eighth the population of Bangladesh. In majority Muslim countries, very few women and a small percentage of women who do work are employers.

==== Limited economic opportunities ====

Such high rates of self-employment and low rates of females as employers suggest that the economies of Muslim nations provide few formal opportunities for females to work in the private sector. Furthermore, it suggests that even fewer women have the ability to advance within their organization when they do earn work with an established business. High rates of self-employment can be indicative of a gender biased economic system but it can also simply indicate a poorly developed system.

The wide gap between male and female labor force participation rates and ratios, and the gap between male and female employers is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries. However, numerous reasons may account for these outcomes such as weak education infrastructure for women, low levels of economic development, or simply capital-intensive resource development. The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.&lt;ref&gt; Note, however, that a direct test of this hypothesis by Korotayev et al. has yielded negative results ([https://www.academia.edu/9919252/Female_Labor_Force_Participation_Rate_Islam_and_Arab_Culture_in_Cross-Cultural_Perspective Korotayev, A. V., Issaev, L. M., &amp; Shishkina, A. R. (2015). Female Labor Force Participation Rate, Islam, and Arab Culture in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Cross-Cultural Research, 49(1), 3-19].). &lt;/ref&gt;

===Female unemployment===

Unemployment rates among women in majority Muslim countries are high.&lt;ref&gt;Global Employment Trend 2011. Rep. Geneva: International Labour Organization, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; When aggregated by region, North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, the three regions with the most and highest density of Muslims in the world, have the highest rates of female unemployment in the world.&lt;ref name = "Seager"&gt;Seager, Joni. "The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World: Completely Revised and Updated (Reference) [Paperback]." The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World: Completely Revised and Updated (Reference): Joni Seager: 9780142002414: Amazon.com: Books. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In North Africa, 17% of females are unemployed and 16% of women in the Middle East are unemployed.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

In both these regions, male unemployment was only 10%. Only Sub-Saharan Africa had a male unemployment rate as high as 10%.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; Seven percent of women are unemployed in Southeast Asia as compared to 6% of men. South Asia, which contains a few majority Muslim nations such as Bangladesh, has a higher female unemployment rate, 6%, than a male unemployment rate which is 5%. However, non-Muslim regions of the world also demonstrate disproportional employment figures. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the female unemployment rate was 11% in 2006 while the male unemployment rate was only 7%.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

In the European Union and other Developed countries such as the United States, female unemployment is higher than male unemployment. In 2006, Seven percent of women in the Developed World were unemployed as compared to 6% of men. Both rates have increased dramatically since the Great Recession but more women are still unemployed than men in these countries.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Data demonstrates that a greater proportion of women are unemployed relative to men in majority Muslim countries but that trend is true of several non-Muslim majority regions as well.

[[File:Shows the female unemployment rate in eleven majority Muslim countries from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.png|450px|thumb]]

Structural unemployment in Muslim countries seems to be high for women and economic opportunities are limited. Possible explanations for this phenomenon could the same determinants of high self-employment among females and low rates of female employers: low levels of economic development, gendered employment social norms, or capital-intensive industry. This last explanation may be particularly salient in the oil-rich Muslim nations because petroleum exports are capital-intensive and require very high skilled labor which most Muslim women are incapable of providing given low levels of education. The Great Recession has increased unemployment across the board in many Muslim nations and female workers were not left unaffected. According to the World Bank, in 2009, 22.9% of women were unemployed in Egypt.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt;

In Syria in 2010, 22.5% of women were unemployed.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; This figure has probably increased significantly due to the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh all had female unemployment levels below 10% which is similar to female unemployment rates in many Developed countries such as the United States. Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Iran all have female unemployment rates ranging from 15% to 17%.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Female unemployment in Iran may be exacerbated by the collateral effects US, UN, and European sanctions. To what extent this is true is uncertain.

Turkey has a moderate level of female unemployment relative to other Muslim countries. In 2008, 11.6% of women were unemployed.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; By 2010, this number crept up to 13.0%. However, long-term employment is a significant portion of female unemployment. In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or workers who have been out of work for more than one year.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Very little data exists on the long-term unemployment rates of women for most nations and for Middle Eastern nations in particular.

==Occupations, opportunities, and wages==

===Female employment by economic sector===
In many economies, women are traditionally funneled into specific occupations or employment fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = Joyce P. | last2 = Baker | first2 = Matthew J. | author-link1 = Joyce P. Jacobsen | title = Marriage, specialization, and the gender division of labor | journal = [[Journal of Labor Economics]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 763–793 | publisher = [[Chicago University Press|Chicago Journals]] via [[JSTOR]] | doi = 10.1086/522907 | jstor = 10.1086/522907 | date = October 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/522907 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [ftp://dlib.info/opt/ReDIF/RePEc/usn/wp/usnawp1.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar trend is also present in the economies of many majority Muslim nation's economies as well. The International Labour Organization, the World Bank, and the UN divide a national economy into three broad categories: agriculture, industry, and services. Agriculture is any work which relates to the primary development of resources for nutritious consumption. According to the UN, whose definitions the ILO, World Bank, and other data collection bases use, agricultural work includes forestry, hunting, and fishing in addition to land cultivation.&lt;ref name = "UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?cl=2|title=United Nations Statistics Division - Classifications Registry: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Rev.3 | website = unstats.un.org/unsd |publisher= [[United Nations Statistics Division]] |accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial employment is involvement in the manufacturing of products from raw materials or work for the purpose of extracting raw materials. This includes mining, quarrying, oil and gas production, construction, and public utilities.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Services-oriented labor revolves around the provision of consumable, non-durable goods and the fulfillment of tasks by an external source for the consumer. This includes wholesale and retail trade and restaurants and hotels; transport, storage, and communications; financing, insurance, real estate, and business services; and community, social, and personal services.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; Most female laborers in Muslim majority countries work in the agriculture sector but many also work in private service jobs. Few, though some, women are employed in industrial-oriented labor.

'''Source: World Bank'''

In four of the eleven nations for which there is data, the percentage of female workers who are in the agricultural sector as compared to the percentage of female workers in the services sector. In Turkey, for example, 42% of female workers are employed in the agricultural sector and 42% work in some form of services enterprise.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Forty-nine percent of female employees work in agriculture in Egypt as compared to 46% of women who work in the services industry. Saudi Arabia is the only nation in which women play a negligible role agriculture.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Tunisian, Nigerian, and Iranian women are more evenly distributed across the economic sectors. Iranian female workers are particularly evenly distributed across all three divisions with 3 of 10 women in agriculture, 4 of 10 in services, and just over one quarter in industry. Saudi Arabian women, on the other hand, are entirely concentrated in the services industry.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

==== Agriculture ====

Employment in agriculture is lower-paying and lower-skilled than so called "white collared" jobs. Agriculture is also incredibly labor-intensive. The combination of these characteristics may explain why so many women in majority Muslim countries work in agriculture. Female workers generally have fewer skills than male workers in Developing nations. Literacy rates and school enrollment rate of females are generally low and low relative to men in developing countries of which many majority countries are.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

Accordingly, they are not hired for high skill work but they provide an abundant labor source for physical work such as agriculture. However, many majority Muslim nations, including Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, all of which have varying levels of female participation within their economies, have more than 80% of their female citizens enrolled in secondary education.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Nearly all of them are literate as well.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

This data somewhat undermines the traditional economic explanation of the concentration of female labor in agriculture. Regardless of the underlying reason for high female participation in agriculture, these workers earn a lower wage than their male counterparts both within this sector and relative to workers in other sectors. This may be one reason for the wide wage gap in some majority Muslim countries.

Female workers in majority Muslim nations are more concentrated in agricultural work than their counterparts in non-majority Muslim nations as well. For nations where data is available, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Iran, Indonesia, and Egypt had the highest percentage of female workers involved in agricultural labor than almost every other country.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; In these nations, anywhere from 20-49% of farm workers were female from 1995 to 2005. Over this time period, 50%-69% of farm workers in Turkey, Syria, and Pakistan were women. Only Cambodia, Laos, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Madagascar had higher percentages of female agricultural workers.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

==== Services and industry ====

The services sector also employs a significant percentage of females and, possibly, for similar reasons. Service jobs such as culinary arts, retail, and administrative work, similar to agriculture, is low-skill, low-paying labor-intensive work. Many bodies are needed to complete generally basic routine tasks. Accordingly, they are more suited to women in developing countries as higher-paying jobs may require a specificity of skills beyond those of the general female laborer and in countries with gender biases.

While the percentage of women working low-skill agriculture and services work is compatible with the notion that women face limited economic opportunities in Muslim nations, data from the ILO does not support or refute that conclusion. Industrial work attracts few women which may be accounted for the physical nature of much industrial work. Furthermore, if women in majority Muslim countries are funneled into agriculture and service-oriented work due to a weak skill set, then it follows that they would not be hired for industrial work as some of it, such as smelting, requires specific vocational skills.

===Executive positions===
{{see also|Glass ceiling}}

The [[glass ceiling]] is one prevalent concern about the quality of economic opportunity available to women involved in the formal labor market. This phenomenon is the de facto limitation of females' ability to achieve the top levels of leadership in an organization. While the concept is not restricted to the market, it is prevalent in profit-based institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Johanne. "The Glass Ceiling." Feminism and Women's Studies (1993). Web. 22 Mar 2011.&lt; http://feminism.eserver.org/the-glass-ceiling.txt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David A., Joan M. Hermsen, Seth Ovadia, and Reece Vanneman (2001). The glass ceiling effect. Social Forces, Vol. 80 No. 2, pp. 655–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies-Netzley, Sally A. (1998). Women above the Glass Ceiling: Perceptions on Corporate Mobility and Strategies for Success Gender and Society, Vol. 12, No. 3, p. 340, doi:10.1177/0891243298012003006.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to female workers in majority Muslim countries, women are not evenly represented on the board of directors or among the senior management positions of most of the 100 most lucrative companies in the Arab World.&lt;ref name = "Muslim Companies"&gt;http://www.middleeastdirectory.com/top-companies-arab-world.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, for example, there is only one female senior executive among its five largest commercial enterprises. Orascom Telecom Holding Company, which is the 62nd largest company in the Muslim World&lt;ref name = "Muslim Companies" /&gt; (nations whose populations are predominantly Islamic), has one female member of its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orascomtelecom.com/about/board.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This woman, Elena Shmatova, however, is neither Egyptian nor Muslim which does not suggest opportunity for female advancement. Egypt's other largest firms by revenue, Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, Suez Canal Authority, Orascom Construction Industries, and Telekom Egypt, do not have a single female member of their board of directors or among their senior management teams.

No women occupy the top leadership positions in the most profitable Iranian businesses either.&lt;ref name="payvand.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/feb/1110.html|title=Where Are Iran's Working Women?|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's three largest companies-National Iranian Oil Company (the second largest in the Muslim World), Iran Khodro, and National Petrochemical Company-also do not have any women in senior leadership positions. This is not surprising as the 2006 Iranian census showed that only 4% of women are in senior executive or management positions.&lt;ref name="payvand.com"/&gt; Critics of Iran's radical shia theocratic government may attribute this evidence of limited female economic mobility as a critique of the government's ideology. However, in Turkey, which is a secular state governed by a moderate Islamic party, women comprised only 8% of managers in the labor force in 2007.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; Regardless of the official status of Islam or the ideology of the ruling party, there exists some evidence of a glass ceiling for women in the private sector.

Eleven of the Muslim world's largest businesses are located in Indonesia. These firms include automotive giant Astra International, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, and electric service provider Perusahaan Listrik Negara. Of these eleven firms, seven of them have at least one female member of the board of directors or a female in a senior executive management position. However, only Gudang Garam, a massive cigarette manufacturer, and Pertamina, the largest company in Indonesia, have 2 female members on the board of commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gudanggaramtbk.com/ina/directors/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pertamina.com|title=Pertamina|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pertamina is owned and operated by Japanese, not Indonesian, executives, however, and none of its female leaders are Muslim or Indonesian.

==Claims of gender inequality in the Muslim world==
Majority Muslim countries have been criticized for implementing policies which perpetuate gender inequality. Limits on the economic rights of women under the rule of law are present in several Muslim nations.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; In Saudi Arabia, for example, women are allowed to work but their formal employment cannot interfere with her duties as a homemaker.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;International Management: Explorations Across Cultures - Page 74, Elizabeth M Christopher - 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi female workers must also travel with male companions, and they cannot work unless their husbands or guardians approve.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Claims that Islam promotes gender inequality ===

Sociologists Helen Rizzo, Abdel-Hamid Abdel-Latif, and Katherine Meyer explored cultural attitudes in majority Muslim countries subdivided by Arab and non-Arab.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo"&gt;Rizzo, Helen, Katherine Meyere, and Abdel-Hamid Abdel-Latif. "The Relationship Between Gender Equality and Democracy: A Comparison of Arab vs. Non-Arab Muslim Societies." Sociology 41 (2007): 1151-170. SAGE. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab states studied were Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Morocco, and Jordan while the non-Arab nations were Turkey, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Indonesia. To be Arab nations, states had to be members of the Arab League and recognize Arabic as the official language. Of these states, Rizzo et al. found that the Arab states were significantly less pro-gender equality and opportunity for women than the non-Arab states despite their shared Islamic faith.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These results were further supported by Korotayev et al. ([https://www.academia.edu/9919252/Female_Labor_Force_Participation_Rate_Islam_and_Arab_Culture_in_Cross-Cultural_Perspective Korotayev, A. V., Issaev, L. M., &amp; Shishkina, A. R. (2015). Female Labor Force Participation Rate, Islam, and Arab Culture in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Cross-Cultural Research, 49(1), 3-19].). &lt;/ref&gt;

However, neither group of countries was pro-gender equality in the sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that a man has more right to a job than a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt; These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.

=== Denials that Islam promotes gender inequality ===

Academic literature is mixed on this subject, however. Some scholars do not believe that gender inequality in majority Muslim states is a product of Islam. Feminist sociologist [[Valentine Moghadam]] has written extensively on gender inequality, including employment inequality, in the Muslim World.&lt;ref name = "Moghadam"&gt;Moghadam, Valentine M. "The Reproduction of Gender Inequality in Muslim Societies: A Case Study of Iran in the 1980s." World Development 19.10 (1991): 1335-349. Science Direct. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Moghadam, women are victims of clear political, economic, and social disparities in many Islamic countries which create gender distinctions within the public and private spheres. This inhibits the ability of women to participate in the government or to advance in the private sector. Moghadam specifically points to low female labor force participation across the board in Muslim states as a sign of gender inequality as do other scholars (Youseff 1978, Sivard 1985).&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt;

However, she does not believe that Islam is the root cause of gender inequality in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. She points at that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women as mothers and daughters first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt;

Many cultures divide occupations along gender lines such as teaching and education administration or nursing and doctors. Why are Muslim nations singled out for holding similar gender biases as non-Muslim nations, asks Moghadam. She does state, however, that the presence of fundamentalist Islamic voices in influential positions in states such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan has helped perpetuate institutionalized gender disparities. Iran, in particular, provides little economic opportunity for women which has resulted in limited participation in the formal economy. In 1986, for example, 11 million women were not counted in the labor force because the Iranian regime deemed them to be "homemakers."&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; Many women, particularly agricultural workers, do not receive wages frequently, which marginalizes them as economic actors.

=== Claims that Radical Islam promotes gender inequality ===

[[Ziba Mir-Hosseini]] takes a middle path on the question of Islam and gender equality as do many other theorists. Hosseieni is a visiting school at New York University Law school. Hosseini argues that the faith of Islamic and general principles promote gender equality.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini"&gt;Mir-Hosseini, Ziba. "Muslim Women’s Quest for Equality: Between Islamic Law and Feminism." Critical Inquiry 32 (2006): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hosseini, theocratic Islamic regimes which conflate theocracy with democracy, such as Iran or Afghanistan under the Taliban, create a tension which reinforces fundamentalist, reactionary thinking. This in turn leads to the repression of women.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini" /&gt; She argues that it is not that majority Muslim nations are intrinsically predisposed to gender inequality, it is that ultra conservative regimes are. This is also occurring in Iraq under Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]]. Hosseini points to "Islamic feminism" as proof of Islam's inherent compatibility with gender equality and a sign that Muslim states will progress toward gender equality while remaining Islamic in character.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini" /&gt; A patriarchal interpretation of Islam must be defeated, not Islam itself, argues Hosseini.

==Gender equality and the formal labor market==
{{see also| Gender inequality}}

=== Estimated earned income ===

Gender equality in the workplace is a major concern of many social activists, public officials, and academics, among others. Even in Developed Countries and wealthy democracies such as the United States there is concern of gender inequities in economic mobility for women. [[President of usa|American President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] was passed in response to concerns among Americans that women were receiving lower wages for equal work. Wages and wage equality with men are two common indicators of gender equality and opportunity within a formal market. Higher aggregate wages indicate that females are holding more productive, valued jobs which is considered indicative of social progress. Equal pay with men demonstrates a neutrality to gender within the workplace and may suggest functional fairness between female workers  and their male counterparts. Given these two indicators, wage statistics suggest that gender equality in terms of economic participation and the quality of formal economic opportunities are not high in many predominantly Muslim nations. In 2011, the World Economic Forum gathered information about the estimated earned income of women in 135 countries. Of these countries, Syria placed 134th in terms of earned annual income for women.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

Egypt finished 126th, Iran was 130th, Pakistan was 131st, and Saudi Arabia was 132nd.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Even countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey, which have substantially larger and higher-status female participation in their economies, placed 90th, 112th, and 121st, respectively, in terms of earned annual income for female laborers.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Several poorer and more volatile states in Sub-Saharan Africa outperformed these nations. The estimated annual income of these women were, in terms of U.S. dollars' [[purchasing power parity]], quite low and only a fraction of their male counterparts' wages.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

[[File:Estimated Earned Annual Income of Women in 11 Majority Muslim Nations and the Female-to-Male Ratio of Workers.png|thumb|550px|The Estimated Earned Income of Women in 11 Muslim Majority Countries.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;]]

Turkey and Saudi Arabia award women the highest annual incomes when adjusted for purchasing power parity in terms of U.S. dollars. Female workers in Turkey are estimated by the World Economic Forum to earn $7,813 while Saudi female workers earn $6,652.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Women in Pakistan don't even earn $1,000 for a year's worth of labor ($940) Egyptian, Syrian, Indonesian, Nigerian, and Bangladeshi women earn less, far less for some countries (Syria, Bangladesh, Nigeria), than $3,000 annually.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  The median annual income for female workers in the United States was $36,931 in 2010.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

Women in these countries earn very low wages when compared to men from the same country. Out of 11 of the most populated and economically significant Muslim majority nations (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Tunisia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) only two nations, Bangladesh and Nigeria have a gender wage gap below 50%. In Nigeria, women earn 57 cents to the dollar of a man, according to the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report 2012. Women in Bangladesh earn 52% of their males counterparts' wage. In Syria, women only earn 15% of a man's wage.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

These large disparities in income size and relative size to men in addition to low overall labor involvement, few salaried positions, and high levels of unemployment suggest that these nations' economies perpetuate significant gender disparities. However, low wages and large wage gaps can be explained by the different types of work men and women perform in these countries. If women are hired for mostly low-skill, low-wage work which is less productive and less elastic in demand than the work of most men, then their wages should be low and be significantly smaller than men's wages. Furthermore, a large supply of female labor for the few jobs women do work in these various economies may be depressing wages.

=== Wage gap ===

Low wages in absolute terms and low wages relative to men's wages in the aggregate, however, do not provide a full picture of gender economic equity. The ratio of income for women to men for equal work is another significant financial indicator of economic gender equality. Using this metric, these countries, collectively, are moderately equal relative to the majority of the world. The World Economic Forum's 2012 Gender Report found that women in Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia all received approximately 60% of the wages of a male for the same work.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

Respectively, these nations were ranked 87th, 85th, 58th, and 94th in the world out of 135. While not terribly equal, these nations were not too far behind the median nation. Egypt, however, is the most gender equal country in terms of equal pay. The World Economic Forum found that Egyptian women receive 82% of the income of their true male counterparts, not of men in general.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt; No other nation's women earn as high an income percentage as that.

===World Economic Forum economic participation and Opportunity subindex===
{{see also|Global Gender Gap Report}}
''''Global Gender Gap Index'''

An additional measurement of gender inequality is the World Economic Forum global gender gap index which it measures for 135 countries each year and publishes its results in its ''Gender Gap Report.'' Its statistic is known as the ''Global Gender Gap Index.'' The index measures gender disparities in economic, political, health, and educational spheres and uses corresponding criteria.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The GGGI utilizes four sub-indices to measure these four spheres of inequality and to create a composite metric of gender inequality. The four sub-indices are: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. The economic participation and opportunity subindex "is captured through three concepts: the participation gap, the remuneration gap and the advancement gap. The participation gap is captured  using the difference in labour force participation rates. The remuneration gap is captured through a hard data indicator (ratio of estimated female-to-male earned income) and a qualitative variable calculated through the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey (wage equality for similar work). Finally, the gap between the advancement of women and men is captured through two hard data statistics (the ratio of women to men among legislators, senior officials and managers, and the ratio of women to men among technical and professional workers)."&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The index is measured on a scale of 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfectly equal level of participation in the labor market between men and women and equal economic opportunities and o indicating complete inequality. Of the 135 nations analyzed, Pakistan (134), Syria (132), and Saudi Arabia (131) are in the bottom five countries for female labor force participation and for the provision of labor opportunities for women.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The GGGI is a comprehensive index relative to other measures of gender inequality such as the [[Gender Inequality Index]] produced by the United Nations. One serious critique of the index, however, is that the measurement of a country's gender equality is too dependent on income.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  While the ratio of income between men and women is taken into account, over reliance on financial data may benefit more Developed countries by virtue of having larger economies which can accommodate higher wages. The multiple subsections of the index, however, aim to condition the final measurement of economic participation and opportunity with emphasis on the ratio of wages, job advancement, and other metrics of females to males. This methodology quantifies gender inequality by analyzing the gap between males and females instead of absolute measurements.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

===UN Gender Inequality Index===
{{see also|Gender Inequality Index}}

The most frequently cited indicator of gender inequality is the [[United Nation]]'s [[Gender Inequality Index]], or GII. It was adopted in 2010 because the Gender Development Index did not measure gender inequality directly. It measured female development.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; The Gender Empowerment Measurement was replaced as well due to its overemphasis of income. As a consequence of this methodological construction, the GEM over estimated gender inequality in poor countries. Consequently, the GII was adopted to address these flaws and to be a true measure of inequality and not a proxy indicator. Income is not a component of the GII and the three categories are weighed equally to present a balance assessment of gender equality. The GII covers three broad categories of female disadvantage: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market status.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

The purpose of the index is to demonstrate the loss of human development due to inequalities between men and women. The three categories are measured with the following metrics. Reproductive health is measured by the maternal mortality rate and the adolescent fertility rate. Empowerment is indicated by the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex and secondary and higher education levels of each sex. Finally, the labor market aspect of the GII is measured by women's participation rate in the workforce. Mathematically, it is the approximated loss of human development to women due to inequality.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Philosophically and methodologically, the GII is based on and, in some sense, a subindicator of the [[Human Development Index]]. Scores for nations are on a scale of 0 to 1 where 0 is pure gender equality and 1 is pure gender inequality. GII is measured in a similar manner as the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. According to the UN, IHDI is "based on a distribution-sensitive class of composite indices proposed by Foster, Lopez-Calva, and Szekely (2005), which draws on the Atkinson (1970) family of inequality measures. It is computed as the geometric mean of dimension indices adjusted for inequality. The inequality in each dimension is estimated by the Atkinson inequality measure, which is based on the assumption that a society has a certain level of aversion to inequality." &lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

The median GII score for the global community is 0.463. When divided by regions, the Arab States have the third worst GII score of 0.555.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; This score is only superior to the scores of Sub-Saharan Africa (0.577) and South Asia (0.568). While not all encompassing and inclusive of other religious and cultural groups, these three regions, particularly the Arab States and South Asia, are inhabited by large Muslim populations. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, and Bangladesh all have GII scores above the median. Only Tunisia's score (0.293) is below the median.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; However, it is significantly below the median.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Gender inequality, however, is not increasing or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, as measured by the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can be said about the level of gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.

'''''Forge of Heaven''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American science fiction and fantasy author {{nowrap|[[C. J. Cherryh]]}}. It was first published in June 2004 in the United States by [[HarperCollins]] under its [[HarperCollins#Imprints|Eos Books]] imprint.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; 

''Forge of Heaven'' is the second of two novels set in Cherryh's [[The Gene Wars universe|Gene Wars universe]], and concerns [[Genetic engineering|gene manipulation]] using [[nanotechnology]], and contact with an alien race, the ''ondat''. The first novel, ''[[Hammerfall (novel)|Hammerfall]]'' was published in June 2001.

==Backstory==
Human territory consisted of the Inner Worlds, governed by Earth Federation, who maintained strict control on the use of biotech and frowned on genetic manipulation, and Outsider Space, near the edge of human space, who openly used biotech for their own benefit. In Outsider Space a group called the Movement broke away from local authority, and by joining nanotech and biotech, bioengineered humans, livestock and agriculture for the colonizing other planets. Fearing contamination, Earth severed all direct contact with Outsider Space, but assisted the moderate Outsider governments, who themselves feared runaway biochange, in tracking down and destroying Movement bases.

The outlawed Movement moved their biotech beyond Outsider Space and onto worlds, unbeknown to them, in space occupied by an unknown alien species, the ''ondat''. The ''ondat'' came into contact with the Movement's aggressively adaptive nanisms and unwittingly spread it to their homeworld. Unable to distinguish between the Movement, Outsiders and Earth, the aliens went to war with humankind, sparking the Gene Wars. But when they saw Earth and the Outsiders destroying Movement bases, the ''ondat'' learnt that not all humans were the enemy. After the Movement was neutralized, the ''ondat'' withdrew to their original borders, and Earth and the Outsiders maintained a shaky truce with the ''ondat'' that lasted for 300 years. Second and Third Movements later sprang up, but they were driven underground and eventually eliminated.

The ''ondat'' were an enigma: no one ever saw them and communication was all but impossible. But years after the end of the Gene Wars, an ''ondat'' ship initiated contact by entering human space and leading a human ship to a planet in ''ondat'' territory that had a functioning First Movement base. They indicated that they wanted to destroy the world, and Earth concurred, but the Outsiders wanted to rescue those on the planet and get their hands on First Movement technology that may have advanced beyond what they had previously encountered. Earth yielded to the Outsider's request because they knew that if the ''ondat'' ever started a bioengineered attack, the Outsiders would be better equipped to counter them.

Two Outsider scientists, Luz and Ian, landed on the surface to look for Movement technology and rescue as many locals as they could before the ''ondat'' began scouring the planet. They were amazed to discover a member of the original First Movement, the Ila, alive after hundreds of years, ruling and spreading her nanoceles. The Outsiders requested a century to study these nanoceles to see if they could be adapted to reverse contamination here and elsewhere; the ''ondat'' gave them 40 years. The events of ''[[Hammerfall (novel)|Hammerfall]]'' followed, where Marak brought many of the locals, including the Ila and her records, to Luz's Refuge before the ''ondat'''s hammer fell.

Concord Station was constructed to orbit Marak's World where representatives from Earth, the Outsiders and the ''ondat'' monitored the planet's recovery and enforced the Treaty between the three parties, that no First Movement technology must leave the planet. Luz and Ian remained on Marak's World and released their own nanisms to eliminate the Ila's contaminants. With Marak, they monitored the planet's rehabilitation from the ground and fed data up to the station. The station in turn sent down to the still unstable planet invaluable weather reports.

==Plot summary==
''Forge of Heaven'' takes place several centuries after ''[[Hammerfall (novel)|Hammerfall]]''. The transformation of Marak's World is monitored on the ground by Marak, assisted by Luz and Ian, and planetary watchers on Concord Station using taps, nanocele implants that enable watchers and those on the planet to communicate with one another. Kekellen, the ''ondat'''s representative on the station, whom no one has ever seen, is particularly interested in Marak and his activities, and uses it to help understand humans. Procyon is Marak's watcher on Concord.

Unannounced, a ship from Earth arrives at the station and Earth ambassador Andreas Gide demands to interrogate Procyon about whether illegal First Movement technology is leaving the planet. Fearing Outsider contamination, Gide enters the station in a sealed mobile containment unit. Procyon assures Gide that, to his knowledge, no illicit technology is leaving the planet, but as the interview ends, Gide is shot at with an armor-piercing shell, which breaches his containment field. Gide is taken to hospital on the station, but because he has now been exposed to Outsider "contaminates", he is unable to return to the Earth ship. Procycon, concussed from the blast, wanders off and is soon lost in the station's corridors.

Procyon's disappearance causes problems for the Planetary Observations Office, which oversees communications with the world below. Marak, who has become dependent on Procycon, demands to know what has happened to his watcher. Kekellen, concerned about the disruption of the Planetary Observation Project, intervenes. Using station maintenance robots, he rescues Procycon, but implants a tap in him, enabling Kekellen to keep in touch with him.

It is revealed that Movement technology ''was'' leaked from the planet via the Ila's watcher on Concord and exported to Orb, a nearby station where sophisticated illicits were being manufactured. The Ila inadvertently kills her watcher when she attempts to hack Concord's tap system. With the help of the ''ondat'', Movement operatives on Concord are neutralized and their conduit to Orb is severed.

Project operations on Concord resume and Procyon returns to work as Marak's tap. On the planet, geological upheavals have resulted in a new sea forming with new weather patterns and the promise of new life evolving. The ''ondat'', via Procyon, are now closer to Marak's World and is able to watch the planet's rebirth first hand.

==Reception==
Writing in SFRevu, author and academic Edward Carmien (editor of ''[[The Cherryh Odyssey]]'') described ''Forge of Heaven'' as "immersive, imaginative, and compelling".&lt;ref name=SFRevu/&gt; He said Cherryh's switch from her intense third-person narrative in ''[[Hammerfall (novel)|Hammerfall]]'', which he said "can become oppressive", to this novel's multi-threaded narrative, has made it a "livelier" and more interesting read.&lt;ref name=SFRevu/&gt; In a review in ''[[Booklist]]'', Paula Luedtke wrote that despite the novel's uneven pace, it should not be "underestimated". She said "it gathers momentum toward the stunning and unexpected ending that is realized with masterly aplomb".&lt;ref name=Luedtke/&gt;

A ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' review described ''Forge of Heaven'' as a "suspenseful sequel to ''Hammerfall''", and called Procyon "[a]mong the many nicely drawn characters" in the book.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly/&gt; A reviewer in [[Kirkus Reviews]] called the "[i]ntrigue and strife" in ''Forge of Heaven'' a "desperately complicated setup" with a plot that is "going nowhere", but added that given the author's strength as a storyteller, "you almost don’t notice".&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

In ''The Cherryh Odyssey'' science fiction writer and literary critic [[John Clute]] described ''Hammerfall'' as "an epic, with prose rhythms that evoke the Bible", but added that he had not worked it out, and awaited "the New Testament", the sequel, which he hoped would be "something else".{{sfn|Clute|2004|p=93}} Clute said that while ''Forge of Heaven'' is not quite "the New Testament", it is "queerly and fascinatingly Asimovian" in so far as it is about "the conflict between change and stability", the backbone of [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|'' Foundation'']] and [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]].{{sfn|Clute|2004|pp=94–95}}

== Palau Joan de Valeriola ==
The Palau Joan de Valeriola is one of the finest examples of the civil gothic architecture in the Mediterranean. The building was the residence of Joan de Valeriola, descendant of Arnau Valleriola, the most important financier in 14th century Valencia. The last member of the family that occupied the palace was Gaspar, who joined the Borja family after marrying Anna de Borja, niece of Pope Alexander VI. Its patrimonial and architectural value is based on its interior spaces, its unique Gothic elements (arches, windows, chairs) and the uniqueness of its wooden ceilings covered with great decorative details that were rediscovered during the rehabilitation of the building.

'''Gerontissa Gavrielia''' (Elder Gabriela), also known as '''Mother Gavrielia'''&lt;ref name="In Communion"/&gt; (15 October 1897 – 28 March 1992) was a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] nun, known for her care of the poor and sick. She was the second woman to be admitted to a Greek university and was a trained physiotherapist prior to taking up her religious calling at the age of 60.

==Biography==
Avrilia Papayannis&lt;ref name="In Communion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brady|first1=John|title=Mother Gavrilia: "A Holocaust to His Love"|journal=In Communion|date=Fall 2004|issue=35|url=http://incommunion.org/2004/10/23/mother-gavrilia/|accessdate=8 December 2015|publisher=Orthodox Peace Fellowship|location=Alkmaar, The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born on 15 October (2 October [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) 1897 N.S. in [[Constantinople]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerontissa (Elder) Gabrielia |url=http://www.stjohndc.org/Russian/saints/SaintsE/e_0110c.htm |publisher=Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St. John the Baptist |accessdate=8 December 2015 |location=Washington, D.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126003728/http://www.stjohndc.org/Russian/saints/SaintsE/e_0110c.htm |archivedate=26 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the youngest child of Helias and Victoria Papayannis,&lt;ref name=OrthodoxWiki&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabrielia (Papayannis)|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Gabrielia_%28Papayannis%29|publisher=OrthodoxWiki|accessdate=8 December 2015|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a wealthy Greek family. She grew up in Constantinople and lived there until her family was deported during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] and sent to [[Thessaloniki]]. She entered the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], becoming the second woman ever admitted to a Greek university,&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; where she earned a degree in [[philosophy]]. She had previously graduated with a degree in [[botany]] at a Swiss university.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=23}} In 1932, she moved to Athens and cared for [[nursing home]] residents&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; until 1938 when she moved to England to study [[podiatry]] and [[physiotherapy]], where she remained until the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1945, Papayannis returned to Greece and began working with the [[American Farm School]] and [[Friends Relief Service]] in Thessaloniki,{{sfn|Marder|1979|p=215}}&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; until 1947, when she moved to Athens and opened a physiotherapy practice. For a decade she operated her office using funds from her paying clients to provide assistance to the poor. Upon the death of her mother, in 1954, she took a vow of poverty and gave all her worldly possessions away. The following year,&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; she moved to [[India]] to work with the poor and assist [[Baba Amte]] in his work with [[Leprosy|leper]] communities in India.&lt;ref name=OrthodoxWiki /&gt; After four years of providing free physiotherapy to the poor, Papayannis went to the [[Himalayan Mountains]], spending eleven months in solitude as a hermit.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; She then traveled to [[Landour]] where she met an American woman, who arranged for her to go to the monastery headed by Father Theodosius in [[Bethany]], in the [[Holy Land]] in 1960.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=25}} She arrived at the [[Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord]]{{#tag:ref|The Russian Orthodox archive account calls this monastery the "Monastery of Mary and Martha",&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; Brady calls it the "Monastery of St. Lazarus"&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; and the Orthodox Wiki calls it "the Monastery of Sts Mary and Martha in Bethany".&lt;ref name=OrthodoxWiki /&gt; The Greek Orthodox Church and St. Lazarus Monastery were not built until 1965.{{sfn|Murphy-O'Connor|2008|p=228}} According to the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission of Jerusalem, two British women, who became Orthodox tonsured nuns in 1932, took the religious names Mary and Martha. They organized a religious community in Bethany, called the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord. Soon after its founding, the church authorities moved the community to Gethsemane where they became attached to the [[Church of Mary Magdalene]]. Though its name officially remains the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord, it is often identified as the Convent of Mary Magdalene.&lt;ref name="Russian Ecclesiastical Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord|url=http://www.jerusalem-mission.org/bethany.html|publisher=Russian Ecclesiastical Mission|accessdate=8 December 2015|location=Jerusalem, Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="notes"}} and after accepting [[tonsure]] became a nun. After her three-year [[novitiate]], Papayannis took the name Gavrielia.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt;

Sister Gavrielia was sent to the [[Taizé Community]] in France by the Patriarch [[Athenagoras I of Constantinople]], though her assignment there was brief. She was then sent to the United States, where she toured ethnic Greek communities in seventeen states and accompanied many mentally ill patients to psychiatric hospitals in Europe.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} After nearly a decade of touring, speaking, and helping the sick, she was sent to East Africa for three years to do missionary work.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; Following a brief assignment in Germany, Sister Gavrielia was sent back to India,{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} where she remained for three years. In 1979, she was given use of an Athens apartment and became a "Gerontissa" (elder), counseling disciples and helping the sick over the next ten years. Near the end of her life, she retreated to a hermitage in [[Aegina]],&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; but when she developed [[Hodgkin's disease]] she returned to Athens. After a miraculous healing, she left Athens two years before her death and moved to the island of [[Leros]].{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} Gerontissa Gavrielia died on Leros on 28 March, 1992.&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1996 a biography of her life entitled ''I Askitiki tis Agapis'' was published in Greek,&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; in 1999 the book was translated into English,{{sfn|Nun Gavrilia|1999|p=}} and in 2000 into Russian.&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; It has since had 14 Greek editions, 2 English editions, and has been translated into Arabic, French and Serbian.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=21}}

'''Guerlain''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡɛʁlɛ̃}}) is a French perfume, cosmetics and skincare house, which is among the oldest in the world. Many traditional Guerlain fragrances are characterized by a common olfactory accord known as the "Guerlinade".{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The house was founded in Paris in 1828 by the [[perfumer]] Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain. It was run by the Guerlain family until 1994, when it was bought by the French multinational company [[LVMH]]. Its flagship store is 68, Avenue des Champs-Elysées in Paris.&lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/shopping/champs-elysees-shops.htm |title=Champs-Elysées stores and shops |author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:L'Heure Bleue.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Guerlain's L'Heure Bleue]]
The House of Guerlain was owned and managed by members of the Guerlain family from its inception in 1828 to 1994. It was acquired in 1994 by the [[LVMH]] group, a French multinational investment corporation specializing in luxury brands.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Immeuble, 68 avenue des Champs-Élysées, Paris 8e 03.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A Guerlain boutique on the [[Champs-Élysées]], in [[Paris]]]]

===Beginning===
The House of Guerlain was founded in 1828, when Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain opened his perfume store at 42, [[rue de Rivoli]] in [[Paris]]. As both the founder and first perfumer of the house, Pierre-François composed and manufactured custom fragrances with the help of his two sons, Aimé and Gabriel. Through continued success and the patronage of members in high society, Guerlain opened its flagship store at 15, [[rue de la Paix]] in 1840, and put its mark on the Parisian fashion scene.

The success of the house under Pierre-François peaked in 1853 with the creation of ''Eau de Cologne Impériale'' for French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and his Spanish-French wife [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]]. This perfume earned Pierre-François the prestigious title of being His Majesty's Official Perfumer. Guerlain went on to create perfumes for [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom and [[Queen Isabella II]] of Spain, among other royalty.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Second generation===
With the death of Pierre-François in 1864, the house was left to his sons Aimé Guerlain and Gabriel Guerlain. The roles of perfumer and manager were divided between the two brothers, with Gabriel managing and further expanding the house, and Aimé becoming the master perfumer. The House of Guerlain thus began a long tradition whereby the position of master perfumer was handed down through the Guerlain family.

As Guerlain's second generation in-house perfumer, Aimé was the creator of many classic compositions, including ''Fleur d'Italie'' (1884), ''Rococo'' (1887) and ''Eau de Cologne du Coq'' (1894). However, many would argue that his greatest composition was 1889's ''[[Jicky]]'', the first fragrance described as a "parfum" rather than an eau de cologne, and among the first to use synthetic ingredients alongside natural extracts.

===Third generation===
[[File:Mitsouko.jpg|thumb|right|Guerlain's ''Mitsouko'']]
The business was handed down to the sons of Gabriel Guerlain: [[Jacques Guerlain]] and Pierre Guerlain. Jacques, Aimé's nephew, became Guerlain's third master perfumer; he was the author of many of Guerlain's most famous classics, which are still held in high esteem in the modern perfume industry. Many of his perfumes are still sold and marketed today. Among Jacques Guerlain's most important creations are ''Mouchoir de Monsieur ''(1904), ''Après L'Ondée ''(1906), ''L'Heure Bleue'' (1912), ''[[Mitsouko (perfume)|Mitsouko]]'' (1919), Guerlain's flagship fragrance ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]'' (1925), and ''Vol de Nuit'' (1933). Jacques composed his final perfume, ''Ode'' (1955), with the assistance of his grandson, the then-18-year-old Jean-Paul Guerlain.

===Fourth generation===
Jean-Paul Guerlain was the last family master perfumer. He created Guerlain's classic men's fragrances ''Vétiver'' (1959) and ''Habit Rouge'' (1965). He also created ''Chant d'Arômes'' (1962), ''Chamade'' (1969), ''Nahéma'' (1979), ''Jardins de Bagatelle'' (1983), and ''Samsara'' (1989), as well as ''Héritage'' and ''Coriolan'' in the 1990s. Jean-Paul Guerlain retired in 2002, but continued to serve as advisor to his successor until 2010, when he was terminated after making a racist remark on French television regarding the inspiration for his scent Samsara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel|first=Henry|title=Jean-Paul Guerlain fined for racist comment|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9173613/Jean-Paul-Guerlain-fined-for-racist-comment.html|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no heir from within the Guerlain family to take over, the role of master perfumer is no longer tied to family succession.

===Purchase by the LVMH Group===
In a decision widely seen as a break with tradition, the Guerlain family sold the company to the luxury goods conglomerate [[Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton]] (LVMH) in 1994. Though Jean-Paul Guerlain remained as an in-house perfumer until 2002, other perfumers were brought in after 1994 to compose perfumes for Guerlain, and Jean-Paul had to submit his compositions against those of others. Fans of the house viewed the LVMH purchase as a step towards the cheapening and commercialization of the legendary firm's legacy. Most were unhappy with the first post-LVMH release, the 1996 sweet mimosa floral ''Champs-Elysées'', composed by [[Olivier Cresp]], whose entry was selected over that of Jean-Paul Guerlain.

[[File:Guerlain David Jones Elizabeth Street 2013.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Guerlain at Australian department store [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]] in [[Sydney]]]]

Among the outside perfumers to compose perfumes for the firm after 1994 was [[Mathilde Laurent]], who worked for Guerlain at the end of the 1990s and in the early 2000s. She composed ''Aqua Allegorica Pamplelune'' (1999) and ''Shalimar Light'' (2003, reattributed to Jean-Paul Guerlain and relaunched in 2004 following reformulation). [[Maurice Roucel]], a perfumer of [[Symrise]], composed ''L'Instant de Guerlain'' (2004) and ''Insolence'' (2006). As the niece of Jean-Jacques Guerlain, some thought [[Patricia de Nicolaï]] would have been a candidate for the position of Guerlain's in-house perfumer,&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{citation |first=Burr |last=Chandler |title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-375-50797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the presence of a [[glass ceiling]] in the company prevented her selection for position.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{citation |title=Scent of a woman: Patricia de Nicolai on circumventing the Guerlain gender bias |first=Nathalie |last=Atkinson |journal=National Post |date=2010-12-20 |url=http://www.canada.com/entertainment/television/tv-listings/Scent+woman/4004505/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, [[Thierry Wasser]] was named the in-house perfumer for Guerlain. Wasser, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] perfumer who used to work for [[Firmenich]], created ''Iris Ganache'' (2007) and ''Quand Vient la Pluie'' (2007) for Guerlain before his appointment the following year. Jean-Paul Guerlain stayed on in an advisory consultant role, both for fragrance design and ingredients.

Guerlain's creations have long influenced the trends of perfumery with fragrances such as ''Jicky'', ''Shalimar'', and ''Vétiver''. Guerlain is among the few older houses (such as [[Parfums Caron|Caron]]) that exist solely to produce and market perfumes. Many brands in the perfume industry, such as [[Chanel]] and [[Jean Patou]] are in fact divisions of fashion houses or multinational conglomerates that license the brand name. Alongside its fragrances, today Guerlain has expanded to offer a large range of makeup and skincare. Guerlain products are available across the world at serviced counters within department stores, and at beauty stores such as fellow LMVH brand [[Sephora]]. Guerlain also maintains thirteen international beauty and spa 'boutiques', five within France (two being in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guerlain.com/int/en/base.html#/en/patrimoine-guerlain/lepatrimoine-subtitle/lepatrimoine-boutiquesspas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfumes===
*'''Eau de Cologne Impériale''' (1853) ({{IPA-fr|od kɔlɔɲ ɛ̃peʁjal|pron}}): Guerlain composed this classic [[Eau de Cologne|cologne]], with rich lime and lime-flower notes, as a gift for [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], the wife of French emperor [[Napoléon III]]. She liked the composition so much that she named Guerlain an official purveyor of colognes and toiletries to the imperial family. Over a century and a half later, the cologne is still in regular production.
*'''[[Jicky]]''' (1889) {{IPA-fr|ʒiki|}}: Said to be named either after the nickname Aimé Guerlain gave to his nephew, Jacques, or after a girl who broke Aimé's heart as a student in England, Jicky is widely heralded as the first "modern" fragrance, and the first to be referred to as a perfume. Jicky was among the first fragrances to incorporate synthetic odorants ([[vanillin]] and [[coumarin]]) in its composition, and is described by some as being the "ultimate" [[fougère]]. The fragrance is known for its main notes of lavender and vanilla over animalic [[civet]]. Although marketed by Guerlain as a women's fragrance, it was initially more successful with men and has proven to be a popular unisex fragrance. Over 120 years later, Jicky is still being sold, making it the oldest fragrance (other than colognes) in continuous production.

*'''Après L'Ondée''' (1906) {{IPA-fr|apʁɛ lɔ̃de|}}: Meaning "After the rain shower," Après L'Ondée is a light floral fragrance reminiscent of bitter almonds, with anise and herbal notes. Its composition includes violet, rose, heliotrope, hawthorn, anise, and citrus notes.
*'''L'Heure Bleue''' (1912) {{IPA-fr|lœʁ blø|}}: Meaning "[[Blue hour|The Blue Hour]]," L'Heure Bleue is a floral oriental fragrance with the dusky scent of candies and almond cake bought in an old world [[apothecary]]. Its powdery accord is similar to that of Après l'Ondée, but L'Heure Bleue is denser, richer, and has a more confectionery quality, while Apres l'Ondée has a more floral character, particularly in its violet notes, and is perhaps more clear and open. Both Apres l'Ondée and L'Heure Bleue are often perceived as melancholy scents.
*'''[[Mitsouko (perfume)|Mitsouko]]''' (1919) {{IPA-fr|mitsuko|}}: Named after the heroine of the novel ''La Bataille'' by [[Claude Farrère]], Mitsouko is said to herald the ending of [[World War I]]. Due to a bottle shortage at the end of the war, it was marketed in an identical bottle to that of L'Heure Bleue, and is sometimes considered to be that fragrance's warm counterpart. The structure is based on Coty's 1917 perfume Chypre, with added notes of peach and iris. With Coty's fragrance long since discontinued, Mitsouko is today considered by Luca Turin, a well-known perfume critic and reviewer, to be a reference fragrance in the [[chypre]] olfactive family.&lt;ref&gt;Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez, Perfumes: the A–Z Guide, Expanded Edition, Penguin, 2009, 384–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]''' (1925) {{IPA-fr|ʃalimaʁ|}}: Named after the garden in [[Lahore]], built by ''[[Shah Jahan]]'' in memory of his wife, Shalimar is one of the world's most famous oriental fragrances, and was one of the first perfumes to successfully incorporate large amounts of [[vanillin]] in its composition. The scent of Shalimar is densely constructed, with a cascade of many notes, including bergamot, tonka bean, iris, and vanilla. This is the flagship perfume of the House of Guerlain.
*'''Vol de Nuit''' (1933) {{IPA-fr|vɔldənɥi|}}: Composed as a tribute to flight, celebrating the novel of the same name by pilot [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] and [[Air France]], this is a green, semi-oriental [[chypre]] with notes of iris, galbanum, daffodil, and oakmoss. Vol de Nuit's use of galbanum made it the first fragrance to feature pronounced green notes.&lt;ref&gt;Roja Dove, The Essence of Perfume, London: Black Dog Publishing, 2008, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chamade''' (1969) {{IPA-fr|ʃamad|}}: Named after the novel by [[Françoise Sagan]], Chamade is a floral oriental fragrance with a pronounced topnote of galbanum introducing a core of notes including hyacinth, blackcurrant buds, and vanilla. In French, the word "Chamade" refers to a particular rapid drumbeat used by Napoleon's armies to signal an order to retreat. Packaged in a bottle representing an upside-down heart pierced by an arrow, the fragrance is said to symbolize a total surrender to love.
*'''Nahéma''' (1979): This floral oriental fragrance was inspired by the legend of a sultan who had twin daughters, the gentle and obedient Mahane and the fiery and passionate Nahéma. Built predominantly around rose notes, Nahéma was an early fragrance to feature [[damascenones]], a set of newly discovered aromachemicals with a profound fruity-rose character.
* '''Samsara''' (1989) {{IPA-fr|sɑ̃saʁa|}}: Composed by Jean-Paul Guerlain, this is a heady oriental fragrance featuring main notes of jasmine, ylang-ylang, and sandalwood. The name is a reference to the cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth or reincarnation in Hinduism and many other religions in South Asia.

Since its foundation in 1828, Guerlain has created over 300 fragrances. These include:

This article details the '''history of [[cross-dressing]]'''. Cross-dressing is the act of dressing in the clothes of the [[gender identity|sex or gender one does not identify]] with.

==In mythology==

===Greek===
[[Image:Ed0019.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thor]] and [[Loki]] disguised as women]]
*In punishment for his murder of Iphitus, [[Heracles]]/[[Hercules]] was given to [[Omphale]] as a slave. Many variants of this story say that she not only compelled him to do women's work, but compelled him to dress as a woman while her slave.
*In [[Achilles on Skyros]], [[Achilles]] was dressed in women's clothing by his mother [[Thetis]] at the court of [[Lycomedes]], to hide him from [[Odysseus]] who wanted him to join the Trojan War.
*[[Athena]] often goes to the aid of people in the guise of men in ''[[The Odyssey]]''.
*[[Tiresias]] was turned into a woman after angering the goddess [[Hera]] by killing a female snake that was coupling.
*In the cult of [[Aphroditus]], worshipers cross-dressed, men wore women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing with false beards.

===Norse===
*[[Thor]] dressed as [[Freyja]] to get [[Mjölnir]] back in ''[[Þrymskviða]]''.
*[[Odin]] dressed as a female healer as part of his efforts to seduce [[Rindr]].
*[[Hagbard]] in the Scandinavian legend of [[Hagbard and Signy]] (the [[Romeo and Juliet]] of the [[Viking]]s). After having slain Signy's brothers and suitors, Hagbard was no longer welcome in the hall of Signy's father [[Sigar]]. Hagbard then dressed up as one of his brother [[Haki]]'s [[shieldmaiden]]s to gain access to the chambers of his beloved. When the handmaidens washed his legs, they asked him why they were so furry and why his hands were so calloused. He responded with a clever verse to explain his strange appearance. Signy, however, who understood that it was Hagbard who had come to see her, explained to the maidens that his verse was truthful. Hagbard was, however, deceived by the handmaidens and he was arrested by Sigar's warriors. Hagbard was hanged and Signy committed suicide as Hagbard watched from the gallows.
*[[Frotho I]] dressed as a shieldmaiden in one of his eastern campaigns.
*[[Hervor]] from the ''[[Hervarar saga]]''. When Hervor learnt that her father had been the infamous Swedish berserker [[Angantyr]], she dressed as a man, called herself Hjörvard and lived for a long time as a Viking.

===Hindu===
* The [[Mahabharata]]: In the [[Agnyatbaas]] ("exile") period of one year imposed upon the [[Pandavas]], in which they had to keep their identities secret to avoid detection, [[Arjuna]] cross-dressed as [[Brihannala]] and became a dance teacher.
* The goddess [[Bahuchara Mata]]: In one legend, Bapiya was cursed by her and he became impotent. The curse was lifted only when he worshiped her by dressing and acting like a woman.
* Devotees of the god [[Krishna]]: In the region of [[Braj]]bhoomi, some male devotees of the god Krishna, called the ''sakhis saints'', dress in female attire to pose as his consort, the goddess [[Radha]], as an act of devotion.

== Background ==
[[Patriarchy]] is the social system in which men have all of the power towards women and their families in regards to the tradition, law, division of labor, and education women can take part in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucm.eblib.com/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=3441577|title=History Matters : Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism|last=Bennett|first=Judith M.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.|isbn=9780812200553|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women used [[cross-dressing]] to pass as men in order to live adventurous lives outside of the home, which were unlikely to occur while living as women.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altenburger|first=Roland|date=2005-01-01|title=Is It Clothes that Make the Man?

== Historical figures ==
Famous historical examples of cross-dressing people include:
[[Image:Dorothy.Lawrence.soldier.jpg|upright|thumb|[[World War I|First World War]] photograph of English war reporter [[Dorothy Lawrence]] who secretly posed as a man to become a soldier.]]
*[[Hua Mulan]], the central figure of the '''Ballad of Mulan''' (and of the Disney film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''), may be a historical or fictional figure. She is said to have lived in China during the [[Northern Wei]], and to have posed as a man to fulfill the household draft quota, thus saving her ill and aged father from serving.
*Several tales of the [[Desert Fathers]] speak of monks who were disguised women, and being discovered only when their bodies were prepared for burial. One such woman, [[Marina the Monk]], died 508, accompanied her father to a monastery and adopted a monk's habit as a disguise. When falsely accused of getting a woman pregnant, she patiently bore the accusation rather than revealing her identity to clear her name, an action praised in medieval books of saints' lives as an example of humble forbearance.
*In [[monarchies]] where the throne was inherited by male offspring, male descendents of deposed rulers were sometimes dressed as female so that they would be allowed to live. One example was the son of [[Joseon dynasty|Korean]] [[Princess Gyeonghye]], herself the daughter of a [[Munjong of Joseon|former king]], who was dressed in female clothes in his early years to fool his [[Sejo of Joseon|great uncle]] into thinking he was not a male descendant of Munjong.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite article|title=端宗과 定順王后 兩位 제사의 장기지속 - 海州 鄭氏 寧陽尉派 家系 傳承을 중심으로|trans-title=The continuing tradition of memorial services for King Danjong and Queen Jungsun: case study on transmission through the Youngyang-wi branch of the Hyeju Jung family|language=Korean|last1=Jang 장 |first1=Hee-Hyung 희홍|journal=The Journal of Korean Historical-Folklife|volume=41|pages=165-193|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE02160533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[legend]] of [[Pope Joan]] alleges that she was a promiscuous female [[pope]] who dressed like a man and reigned from 855 to 858. Modern [[historian]]s regard her as a [[urban legend|mythical]] figure who originated from 13th-century anti-papal [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of Pope Joan|last=Boureau|first=Alain|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|isbn=0226067459|page=8|translator=Lydia G. Cochrane}}
* [[Joan of Arc]] was a 15th-century [[France|French]] peasant girl who joined French armies against [[England|English]] forces fighting in France during the latter part of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. She is a French national heroine and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[saint]]. After being captured by the English, she was burned at the stake upon being convicted by a religious court, with the act of dressing in male clothing being cited as one of the principal reasons for her [[Execution (legal)|execution]]. A number of witnesses, however, testified that she had said she wore male clothing (consisting of two layers of pants attached to the doublet with twenty fasteners) because she feared the guards would rape her at night.  She was, however, burned alive in a long white gown. [http://archive.joan-of-arc.org/joanofarc_male_clothing.html Joan of Arc, Male Clothing Issue&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Catalina de Erauso]] (1592–1650), known as ''la monja alférez'' "the Nun Lieutenant", was a Spanish woman who, after being forced to enter a convent, escaped from it disguised as a man, fled to America and enrolled herself in the Spanish army under the false name of Alonso Díaz Ramírez de Guzmán.&lt;ref&gt;According to her supposed autobiography, ''Mi vida'', ed.Auñamendi, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; She served under several captains, including her own brother, and was never discovered. She was said to behave as an extremely bold soldier, although she had a successful career, reaching the rank of ''alférez'' ([[lieutenant]]) and becoming quite well known in the Americas. After a fight in which she killed a man, she was severely injured, and fearing her end, she confessed her true sex to a bishop. She nonetheless survived, and there was a huge scandal afterwards, specially since as a man she had become quite famous in the Americas, and because nobody had ever suspected anything about her true sex. Nevertheless, thanks to the scandal and her fame as a brave soldier, she became a celebrity. She went back to Spain, and was even granted a special dispensation by the [[pope]] to wear men's clothes. She started using the male name of Antonio de Erauso, and went back to the America, where she served in the army till her death in 1650.
*[[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] were 18th-century [[piracy|pirate]]s. Bonny in particular gained significant notoriety, but both were eventually captured. Unlike the rest of the male crew, Bonny and Read were not immediately executed because Read was [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] and Bonny stated that she was as well.
*[[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]] was a Swedish woman who served as a soldier during the [[Great Northern War]] and married a woman.
*[[Charles Edward Stuart]] dressed as [[Flora MacDonald]]'s maid servant, Betty Burke, to escape the [[Battle of Culloden]] for the island of [[Skye]] in 1746.
*[[Mary Hamilton (transvestite)|Mary Hamilton]] dressed as a man to learn medicine and later married a woman in 1746. It was also alleged that she had married and abandoned many others, for either financial gain or for sexual gratification. She was convicted of fraud for misrepresenting herself as a man to her bride.
*[[Ann Mills]] fought as a [[dragoon]] in 1740.
*[[Hannah Snell]] served as a man in the [[Royal Marines]] 1747–1750, being wounded 11 times, and was granted a military pension.
*Charles-Geneviève-Louis-Auguste-André-Timothée Éon de Beaumont (1728–1810), usually known as the [[Chevalier d'Eon]], was a French [[diplomat]] and [[soldier]] who lived the first half of his life as a man and the second half as a woman. In 1771 he stated that physically he was not a man, but a woman, having been brought up as a man only. From then on she lived as a woman. On her [[death]] it was discovered that her body was anatomically male.
*[[George Sand]] is the [[pseudonym]] of Amandine-Aurore-Lucile Dupin, an early 19th-century French [[novelist]] who preferred to wear men's clothing exclusively. In her [[autobiography]], she explains in length the various aspects of how she experienced cross-dressing.
*[[Dorothy Lawrence]] was an [[England|English]] [[War correspondent|war reporter]] who [[disguise]]d herself as a man so she could become a [[soldier]] in [[World War I]].
*[[Rrose Sélavy]], the feminine alter-ego of the late French artist, [[Marcel Duchamp]], remains one of the most complex and pervasive pieces in the enigmatic puzzle of the artist's oeuvre. She first emerged in portraits made by the photographer [[Man Ray]] in New York in the early 1920s, when Duchamp and Man Ray were collaborating on a number of conceptual photographic works. Rrose Sélavy lived on as the person to whom Duchamp attributed specific works of art, [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]], puns, and writings throughout his career. By creating for himself this female persona whose attributes are beauty and eroticism, he deliberately and characteristically complicated the understanding of his ideas and motives. More contemporary artists like [[J. S. G. Boggs]], [[Yasumasa Morimura]], and [[Grayson Perry]] have also explored cross-dressing.
* [[Shi Pei Pu]] was a male Peking Opera singer. Spying on behalf of the Chinese Government during the [[Cultural Revolution]], he cross-dressed to gain information from [[Bernard Boursicot]], a French diplomat. Their relationship lasted 20 years, during which they married. [[David Henry Hwang]]'s 1988 play ''[[M. Butterfly]]'' is loosely based on their story.
*[[Billy Tipton]] was a notable jazz pianist and saxophonist in the United States during the [[Great Depression]]. He was born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in 1914, but began living as a man in the 1930s. He was married five times to women, and adopted three boys. He led a full career as a musician and, in later life, as an entertainment agent. Other than his birth family, no one knew of his birth sex or cross-living until after his death in 1989.
*[[Willmer "Little Ax" Broadnax]] was a lead singer in several important [[Gospel music|gospel]] quartets, most famously the [[Spirit of Memphis Quartet]]. When he died in 1994, it was discovered that he was female bodied.
*Because female enlistment was barred, many women fought for both the Union and the Confederacy during the [[American Civil War]] while dressed as men.
*[[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon]], colonial governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] in the early 18th century is reported to have enjoyed going out wearing his wife's clothing, but this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/020125.html The Straight Dope: Did New York once have a transvestite governor?&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde was an unpopular figure, and rumors of his cross-dressing may have begun as an [[urban legend]].

==In folklore==
[[Ballad]]s have many cross-dressing heroines. While some (''[[The Famous Flower of Serving-Men]]'') merely need to move about freely, many do it specifically in pursuit of a lover (''[[Rose Red and the White Lily]]'' or ''[[Child Waters]]'') and consequently pregnancy often complicates the disguise. In the Chinese poem the ''Ballad of Mulan'', [[Hua Mulan]] disguised herself as a man to take her elderly father's place in the army.

Occasionally, men in ballads also disguise themselves as women, but not only is it rarer, the men dress so for less time, because they are merely trying to elude an enemy by the disguise, as in ''[[Brown Robin]]'', ''[[The Duke of Athole's Nurse]]'', or ''[[Robin Hood and the Bishop]]''. According to ''[[Gude Wallace]]'', [[William Wallace]] disguised himself as a woman to escape capture, which may have been based on historical information.

[[Fairy tale]]s seldom feature cross-dressing, but an occasional heroine needs to move freely as a man, as in the German ''[[The Twelve Huntsmen]]'', the Scottish ''[[The Tale of the Hoodie]]'', or the Russian ''[[The Lute Player]]''. [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] included such a woman in her literary fairy tale, ''[[Belle-Belle ou Le Chevalier Fortuné]]''.

In the cities [[Techiman]] and [[Wenchi]] (both Ghana) men dress as women – and vice versa – during the annual [[Apoo festival]] (April/May).

==In literature==
In the myth of the [[Trojan War]], [[Achilles]]' mother [[Thetis]] wanted to keep him from joining the Greek forces (and thus dying in battle as was prophesied), so she dresses him in women's clothes and hides him among a cloister of women. When the Greek envoy arrives to fetch him for battle, [[Odysseus]] is suspicious of Achilles' absence and concocts a scheme to reveal the deception: he offers gifts to all the women, including among them a sword and shield. Then he has an alarm sounded, and when Achilles instinctively grabs the weapons to defend himself, the ruse is revealed and he must join the Greek army and fight at Troy.

In [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Bradamante]], being a knight, wears full-plate armor; similarly, [[Britomartis#As Britomart|Britomart]] wears full-plate armor in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. Intentionally or not, this disguises them as men, and they are taken as such by other characters. In ''Orlando Furioso'', Fiordespina falls in love with Bradamante; her brother Ricciardetto disguises himself as his sister, dressing as a woman, persuades Fiordespina that he is Bradamante, magically changed into a man to make their love possible, and in his female attire is able to conduct a love affair with her.

In [[Giannina Braschi]]'s mock diary, "Intimate Diary of Solitude/el diario intimo de la soledad" (the finale of the Latin American trilogy "Empire of Dreams/el imperio de los suenos") the heroine Mariquita Samper is a cross-dressing Macy's makeup artist who plots a literary revolution to kill the narrator.

In ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]'', Sir [[Philip Sidney]] has one of the heroes, Pyrocles, disguise himself as an Amazon called Zelmane in order to approach his beloved Philoclea.

In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s novel ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', he has an entire regiment of females (of assorted species) dressing as males to join the army, satirizing the phenomenon of [[List of wartime cross-dressers|crossdressing during wartime]].

In [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Éowyn]] disguises herself as man under the name Dernhelm to fight in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] outside the city Minas Tirith.

==On stage and on the screen==

===Cross-dressing characters===
[[William Shakespeare]] made substantial use of cross-dressing for female characters who took on masculine clothing to carry out actions difficult for women. In Shakespeare's play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] and her maid dress as men to plead in court on the merchant's behalf, and are quite successful in their ruse; in the same play, Shylock's daughter Jessica dresses as a man to elope with her Christian lover. ''[[Twelfth Night, or What You Will]]'' deals extensively with cross-dressing through the female protagonist Viola. She disguises herself as Cesario and immediately finds herself caught up in a love triangle. She loves Duke Orsino who loves Countess Olivia who loves Cesario. Luckily, all is resolved when Viola's presumed dead twin brother Sebastian comes along. We only see Viola as Viola in one scene; for the rest of the play she is dressed as Cesario. When Rosalind and Celia flee court in ''[[As You Like It]]'', Rosalind dresses, for their protection, as a man. However, as a way to further complicate the situation for comedic affect, Shakespeare has Rosalind's male character "Ganymede" dress as a woman to help a male friend, Orlando de Boys, practice wooing Rosalind, with whom he is smitten, while at the same time fending off the affections Phoebe has for "Ganymede". In other words, it is a man, (the actor), dressing as a woman, dressing as a man, dressing as a woman.

Joe and Jerry in [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1959 ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', two struggling musicians, have to dress up as women to escape the ire of gangsters. The film is a remake by Wilder and [[I. A. L. Diamond]] of a 1935 French movie, ''[[Fanfare of Love]]'', from the story by [[Robert Thoeren]] and Michael Logan, which was itself remade in 1951 by German director [[Kurt Hoffmann]] as ''[[Fanfares of Love]]''.

In [[Blake Edwards]]'s 1982 [[Musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] ''[[Victor Victoria]]'', Victoria Grant, a struggling soprano, is unable to find work but she finds success when she becomes "Count Victor Grazinski", a female impersonator. The film is a remake of ''[[Viktor und Viktoria]]'', a German film of 1933.

[[David Henry Hwang]]'s 1988 play ''[[M. Butterfly]]'' focuses on a love affair between a [[France|French]] diplomat and a male [[Beijing]] opera singer who plays ''[[Dan (Chinese opera)|dan]]'', or female, roles.

Although there is some dispute as to whether the character is transgender or simply a cross-dresser, the character of Hedwig from the musical and subsequent movie ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (film)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' is another modern drag queen (the musical also features a male character played traditionally by a female actress, although the character's true gender is deliberately left with slight ambiguity).

Dr. Frank 'n' Furter in the ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' wore nothing but women's clothing the entire movie/play.

In ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', Drew's brother, Steve Carey, is a cross-dresser.

[[Robin Williams]] played a father who dressed as a nanny to be with his children in the 1993 comedy ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]''.

[[Dame Edna]] was an elderly drag queen with "wisteria-colored hair" who did international chat shows in the 1990s.

====Animation, cartoons and anime====
[[Bugs Bunny]] frequently cross-dresses in his cartoons for either comedic effect, or to confound a male opponent. Notable examples include "[[Rabbit of Seville]]", "[[What's Opera Doc]]" and "[[Rabbit Seasoning]]", all in attempts to deceive [[Elmer Fudd]].

Birdo from the ''[[Super Mario (series)|Super Mario]]'' series is an interdeterminate, though highly suspected, cross-dressing male dinosaur.

[[Major characters of Crash Bandicoot#Doctor N. Gin|Doctor N. Gin]] from the ''[[Crash Bandicoot (series)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' series wears a [[ballerina]] dancer outfit in ''[[Crash Tag Team Racing]]''. The tutu, obtained through one of Crash's missions, is an alternative costume that made N. Gin feel "pretty" and boosted his self-esteem.

[[Him (powerpuff girls)|Him]] from the ''[[Powerpuff Girls]]'' series is shown every time, wearing a typical skirt, fishnet stockings, and high-heeled boots.

In the Disney film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', derived from a Chinese ballad-poem, the character [[Fa Mulan]] disguises herself as a man, to take her elderly father's place in the army.

[[List of characters in the Pokémon anime series#Jessie, James and Meowth|Jessie and James]] from ''[[Pokémon]]'' cross-dress as ballet performers and wedding couples.

In the manga and anime ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]'', the main character of Haruhi Fujioka cross-dresses as a boy so that she can work in a host club to pay off a debt she owes to the other members.  Haruhi's father is also a cross-dresser.

In the manga and live action series of ''[[Hana-Kimi]]'' (Hanazakari no Kimitachi e), the main character, Mizuki Ashiya, cross-dresses as a boy to attend an all-boys boarding school to meet her idol, Izumi Sano.

In the manga and anime ''[[Shugo Chara]]'', Nagihiko Fujisaki cross-dresses as his "twin" Nadeshiko out of family tradition. He also crossdresses in his transformation ''Yamato Maihime.''

In the manga and anime ''[[Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Pure]]'', one of Michel's servants, named Lady Bat, cross-dresses as a female, actually a male.

In the anime [[Himegoto]], the main character, Hime Arikawa, cross-dresses to join the Student Council who promises to pay off the debt created by Hime's parents. There are also four other characters who cross dress, including Hime's brother, Kaguya, HIro Toyotomi, No. 1, and Mitsunaga Oda, all of whom are against the Student Council.

===Cross-dressing actors and actresses===
[[File:Greek - Actor - Walters 541067.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Bronze statue of a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek actor]]. He wears a man's conical cap but female garments, following the Greek custom of men playing the roles of women. 150-100 BCE.]]
In [[English Renaissance theatre|Renaissance England]] it was illegal for women to perform in theatres,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globe-theatre.org.uk/globe-theatre-female-roles.htm Globe Theatre Female Roles]&lt;/ref&gt; so female roles in the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporary playwrights were originally played by cross-dressing men or boys. (See also ''[[Stage Beauty]]''.) Therefore, the original productions of the above-mentioned Shakespeare plays actually involved double-cross-dressing: male actors playing female characters disguising themselves as males. Academic research into the contemporary attitudes towards the practise have yielded a variety of interpretations. Laura Levine argues that "an all-male acting troupe was the natural and unremarkable product of a culture whose conception of gender was "teleologically male""; she also suggests that contemporary protests against the practise (believing it made young actors "effeminate") reflected "deepseated fears that the self was not stable and fixed but unstable and monstrous and infinitely malleable unless strictly controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Jean E.|title=Crossdressing, The Theatre, and Gender Struggle in Early Modern England|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|year=1988|volume=39|issue=4|pages=419|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~jorgea/untitled%20folder/Crossdressing.pdf|accessdate=October 21, 2012|doi=10.2307/2870706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-dressed female actors are referred to as playing "trouser roles," a historical example of an actress famous for trouser roles is [[Julie d'Aubigny]], aka "La Maupin" (1670–1707).

In the late 19th century, one of the most famous actresses was the cross-dressing woman [[Vesta Tilley]]. She grew up working in a music hall from age 5 well into her fifties. In the late 1890s, she was the highest paid woman in Britain. What made her so famous was her tendency to dress as a man and act out "masculine" scenes and roles.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbach, Susie L. . Understanding the Victorians. London: Routledge, 2012. 192-193. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Clue (musical)|Clue: The Musical]]'', Mrs. White is usually played by a man.

In all versions of ''Hairspray''—the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|original film]], the [[Hairspray (musical)|stage musical]], and the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|film adapted from the musical]]—Edna Turnblad is played by a man.

On some plays and films by [[Tyler Perry]], he dresses up as a woman to play as [[Madea]].

All roles in Japanese [[Noh]] dramas are traditionally played by male actors. Actors playing female roles wear feminine costumes and female-featured masks.

Japanese [[Kabuki]] theatre began in the 17th century with all-female troupes performing both male and female roles. In 1629 the disrepute of kabuki performances (or of their audiences) led to the banning of women from the stage, but kabuki's great popularity inspired the formation of all-male troupes to carry on the theatrical form. In Kabuki, the portrayal of female characters by men is known as onnagata. The practice is detailed in a story of the same name by the Japanese writer, [[Yukio Mishima]].

In ancient China, nearly all the characters in [[Chinese Opera]] were performed by men, so that all the male actors, who played the role of a female were crossdressing. A famous cross-dressing opera singer is [[Mei Lanfang]]. From early 20th century, Shanghai yue opera (or Shaoxin opera) is developed from all male to all female genre. Although male performers were introduced into this opera in 1950s and 1960s, today, Shanghai yueju (yue opera) is still associated as the only all female opera and the second most popular opera in China.

[[Meryl Streep]] played a male rabbi in an episode of ''[[Angels in America (miniseries)|Angels in America]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The [[Monty Python]] troupe have been known to cross dress for comedic purposes in their TV series and films. The troupe usually dress up as older, more unarousing women referred to by the troupe as "pepperpots". Although member [[Terry Jones]] was most famous for his female characters, all the members have been seen in drag in one sketch or another; members [[Michael Palin]] and [[Eric Idle]] have been said to look the most feminine, [[Graham Chapman]] specialized in screeching, annoying housewives and [[John Cleese]], whom the troupe has said is the most hilarious in drag, appears so extremely unfeminine, with his square chin and six-foot, five-inch frame that it is funny. Cleese also wore female clothes while appearing as ''himself'' in a magazine advertisement for American Express. For more information about cross-dressing in movies and television, see the article ''[[Cross-dressing in film and television]]''.  ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' also did a sketch called "[[The Lumberjack Song]]," about a [[lumberjack]] who likes to "put on women's clothing and hang around in bars."

[[The Kids in the Hall]] comedy troupe often dress up as female characters. In contrast to Monty Python who dressed as women in an exaggerated fashion for comedic purposes, The Kids in the Hall usually played women straight, their reasoning for cross-dressing being that there are few if any women involved in their projects. This has gone on to be one of the group's defining characteristics.

[[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]] regularly cross-dress in the ''[[Little Britain]]'' television comedy show, with Lucas in particular often somewhat more feminine and convincing in his appearance and performances than cross-dressing comedians of the past. The two also sometimes play a pair of unconvincing transvestites as a parody of some cross-dressers who try to act in a stereotypically feminine way while not succeeding in "passing" as women.

The British writer, presenter and actor [[Richard O'Brien]] sometimes cross-dresses and ran a "Transfandango" ball aimed at transgender people of all kinds in aid of charity for several years in the early 2000s (decade).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PriscillaQueen.jpg|thumb|upright|The mainstream Australian film ''Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'' includes transvestism and transsexuality (qcinema.com)]] --&gt;

The [[Takarazuka Revue]] is a contemporary all-female Japanese acting company, known for their elaborate productions of stage musicals. Takarazuka actresses specialize in either male or female roles, with male role actresses receiving top billing.

In [[pantomime]] plays that are traditionally adaptations of [[fairy tale]]s and performed around [[Christmastide]], the role of lead male was once commonly played by a [[principal boy]]—a young, attractive, female. This practise has fallen out of favour recently, with popular male television and [[pop stars]] taking these roles. Conversely, the role of a [[pantomime dame]], a middle aged woman played by a man for comic relief, is still one of the mainstays of the Pantomime.

[[Michelle Ehlen]] plays a butch lesbian actress who gets cast as a man in a film in the comedic feature ''[[Butch Jamie]]''.

[[Eddie Izzard]], a British stand-up comedian and actor, states that he has cross-dressed his entire life. He often performs his act in feminine clothing, and has discussed his cross dressing as part of his act. He calls himself an "executive transvestite".

Classic trouser parts (male characters intended to be played by women) include the title character in ''[[Peter Pan]]'' ([[J.M. Barrie]]) and Cherubino in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' ([[Beaumarchais]]).

In the 1992 Kannada movie ''[[Bombat Hendthi]]'', a well-known male actor and dancer named [[Sridar]] crossdresses. His character and the character's friends want to rent a house, but the owners are not willing to rent to bachelors. So Sridhar crossdresses to become his friend's wife, while the rest of the actors (Sihi-kahi Chandru, Tennis Krishna, Ramesh Bhatt, Malashri and Anjali) are in supporting roles.

==In music==

===In opera===
An entire cross-dressing genre of operatic roles, called "[[pants role]]s", "trouser roles", or "travesty roles". These are male roles performed by women, typically mezzo-sopranos but occasionally by sopranos. Some female opera singers specialize in these types of roles.

A major artistic reason for "pants roles" was that some storylines required young boy characters, but the actual performance required an adult's vocal strength and stage experience in addition to a high, boyish voice. Women were thus better suited to these boy roles than actual boys. Some examples of these boyish pants roles are Cherubino in "The Marriage of Figaro," Siebel in "Faust," and Hansel in "Hansel and Gretel". Other pants roles were created due to the need for an adult male character to seem other-worldly (Orpheus in "Orfeo ed Euridice") or unmanly (Prince Idamante in "Idomeneo"). In some cases, the casting of a woman in a "pants role" may have been just an excuse to have an attractive actress appear in tight-fitting trousers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} During the Grand Opera era, women typically worn voluminous dresses onstage. Some male operatic roles originally written to be sung in the voice range of [[castrati]] (men castrated in boyhood, whose voices never descended into the normal male register) are now usually cast with female singers in male costume.

Beethovens' only opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'', is unusual in that it features a female character who cross-dresses as part of the plot. ''Fidelio'' involves a woman who disguises herself as a young man as part of a plan to rescue her husband from prison. In "The Marriage of Figaro" Cherubino dresses as a girl to avoid army duty. The part of Cherubino is thus played by a woman, who plays a man who dresses as a woman.

In the early 20th century, German composer Richard Strauss included a major trouser role in two operas: the Composer in "Ariadne auf Naxos" and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier."

=== France ===

As the [[Hundred Years' War]] developed in the late [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sumption|1991|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cross-dressing|cross dressing]] in [[France]] was a way for women to join the cause against [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Leslie. ''Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1996. 32-35. [[Joan of Arc]] was of adolescent age when she decided to present herself alongside her peasant army to Prince Charles, heir to the French throne, who granted her the lead of a ten thousand peasant army. This can be attributed to her defense of her dressing in men’s clothing as a direct order from God which correlates to the religious attribute of the feudal life of the time. A couple years after joining the fight, [[Joan of Arc]] was captured in 1492 by allies of [[England]] because of her masculine ways. Despite her importance in the cause, the now King Charles did not offer any [[Franc]]s to demand her release.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century, [[France]] underwent a period where there was a financially driven social conflict in what has been named the Fronde.&lt;ref&gt;Treasure, Geoffrey. "THE FRONDE Part II: The Battle for France." History Today 28, no. 7 (July 1978): 436. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed December 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the duration of the [[Fronde]], French women often utilized [[Cross-dressing|cross dressing]] to enlist in the army as a male soldier to join the opposition with their male family members against the [[parliament]] and its affiliates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Harris, Joseph. ''Hidden Agendas: Cross-dressing in 17th-century France''.

By the 1950s, publications concerning MTF cross-dressing were in circulation, advertising themselves as aimed at the "study" of the phenomenon. Fully-fledged "commercial" magazines aimed at cross-dressing 'hobbyists' began publishing after the launch of the first such magazine, ''Queen'', in 1980. It was affiliated with the Elizabeth Club, which opened branch clubs in several Tokyo suburbs and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of Japanese Culture and Society|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136736278|pages=148|editor1=Victoria Bestor |editor2=Theodore C Bestor |editor3=Akiko Yamagata }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Since the [[Yuan dynasty]], [[cross-dressing]] has had a unique significance in [[Chinese opera]]. Period scholars cite it as the time in Chinese theatre as the “golden age.”

==Cross-dressers from other fields==
The British writer and doctor [[Vernon Coleman]] cross-dresses and has written several articles defending men who cross-dress, stressing they are often heterosexual and usually do not want to change sex.

British artist and [[Turner Prize]] winner, [[Grayson Perry]] often appears as his alter-ego, Clare.

'''Human geography''' is the branch of [[geography]] that deals  with the study of people and their communities,
cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place.&lt;ref name="HGDICT"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Johnston|first=Ron|editor1-last=Johnston|editor1-first=Ron|editor2-last=Gregory|editor2-first=Derek|editor3-last=Pratt|editor3-first=Geraldine|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Watts|editor4-first=Michael|title=Human Geography|encyclopedia=The Dictionary of Human Geography| pages=353–60|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human geography attends to human patterns of social interaction, as well as spatial level interdependencies, and how they influence or affect the earth's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russel|first1=Polly|title=Human Geography|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpsubject/socsci/humangeog/humangeography.html|website=British Library|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/human/index_en.html|title=Human Geography|last=Reinhold|first=Dennie|date=February 7, 2017|website=www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an intellectual discipline, [[geography]] is divided into the sub-fields of [[physical geography]] and human geography, the latter concentrating upon the study of human activities, by the application of [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research]] methods.

==History==
{{Main article|History of geography}}
{{History of geography sidebar}}
Geography was not recognized as a formal academic discipline until the 18th century, although many scholars had undertaken geographical scholarship for much longer, particularly through [[cartography]].

The [[Royal Geographical Society]] was founded in [[England]] in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Geographical Society|title=History|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/History.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the United Kingdom did not get its first full Chair of geography until 1917. The first real geographical intellect to emerge in [[United Kingdom]]'s geographical minds was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.

The [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became, and continues to be, a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education on geographical topics.

The Association of American Geographers was founded in 1904 and was renamed the [[American Association of Geographers]] in 2016 to better reflect the increasingly international character of its membership.

One of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorize the physical properties of the earth is [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Though Snow was primarily a [[physician]] and a pioneer of [[epidemiology]] rather than a geographer, his map is probably one of the earliest examples of [[health geography]].

The now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography have developed at a later date. This connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of [[environmental determinism]], made popular in the 19th century by [[Carl Ritter]] and others, and has close links to the field of [[evolutionary biology]] of the time. Environmental determinism is the theory, that people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. However, by the mid-19th century, environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigor associated with modern science, and later as a means to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]].

A similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries focused on [[regional geography]].The goal of regional geography, through something known as [[regionalisation]], was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region through both human and physical aspects. With links to (possibilism) (geography) and [[cultural ecology]] some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture remain with environmental determinism.

By the 1960s, however, the [[quantitative revolution]] led to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor in an overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from its two subfields of physical and human geography and from [[geology]], geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical models in order to solve spatial problems.&lt;ref name="HGDICT"/&gt; Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of [[geographic information systems]]; the use of statistics, spatial modeling, and positivist approaches are still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], and [[Torsten Hägerstrand]].

From the 1970s, a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged. Known under the term '[[critical geography]],' these critiques signaled another turning point in the discipline. [[Behavioural geography|Behavioral geography]] emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places, and made locational decisions. The more influential 'radical geography' emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. It draws heavily on [[Marxist geography|Marxist]]'s theory and techniques, and is associated with geographers such as [[David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]]. Radical geographers seek to say meaningful things about problems recognized through quantitative methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Harvey, David| authorlink=David Harvey| title=Social Justice and the City| year=1973 | publisher=Edward Arnold | location=London | pages=128–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide explanations rather than descriptions, put forward alternatives and solutions, and be politically engaged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&amp;site=1 | title=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography: Celebrating Over 40 years of Radical Geography 1969-2009 | author=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography | year=2009 | accessdate=31 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010193949/http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&amp;site=1 | archivedate=10 October 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than using the detachment associated with positivists. (The detachment and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital). Radical geography and the links to Marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography (See: ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]''). Critical geography also saw the introduction of 'humanistic geography', associated with the work of [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], which pushed for a much more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] approach in methodology.

The changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as [[feminist geography]], [[Cultural geography#"New cultural geography"|new cultural geography]], "demonic" geographies&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339&lt;/ref&gt;, and the engagement with [[postmodern]] and [[post-structural]] theories and philosophies.

==Fields==
The primary fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of:

===Culture===
[[Cultural geography]] is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places, as well as their relations. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Agriculture_in_Asia.jpg|thumb|This picture shows terraced rice agriculture in Asia.]]

* Subfields include: [[Social geography]], [[Animal geographies]], [[Language geography]], [[Sexuality and space]], [[Children's geographies]], and [[Religion and geography]].

===Development===
[[Development geography]] is the study of the Earth's geography with reference to the [[standard of living]] and the [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants, study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities, across the Earth. The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.

===Economic===
[[File:Shan Street Bazaar.JPG|thumb|Economic Geography: Shan Street bazaar, market in Myanmar]]
[[Economic geography]] examines relationships between human economic systems, states, and other factors, and the biophysical environment.
* Subfields include: [[Marketing geography]] and [[Transportation geography]]

===Health===

[[Health geography]] is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]]. Health geography deals with the spatial relations and patterns between people and the environment. This is a sub-discipline of human geography, researching how and why diseases are spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dummer|first=Trevor J.B.|date=2008-04-22|title=Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|issue=9|pages=1177–1180|doi=10.1503/cmaj.071783|issn=0820-3946|pmc=2292766|pmid=18427094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
[[Historical geography]] is the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past. Historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics. A common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time. Many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time, including how people have interacted with their environment, and created the cultural landscape.

===Political===
[[Political geography]] is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures.
* Subfields include: [[Electoral geography]], [[Geopolitics]], [[Strategic geography]] and [[Military geography]]

===Population===
[[Population geography]] is the study of ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to their environment or location.

===Settlement===
[[Settlement geography]], including [[urban geography]], is the study of [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement.  That is the study of areas which have a concentration of [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]].  These are areas where the majority of [[economy|economic]] activities are in the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sectors]]. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high [[population density]].
{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Urban ===
[[Urban geography]] is the study of cities, towns, and other areas of relatively dense settlement. Two main interests are site (how a settlement is positioned relative to the physical environment) and situation (how a settlement is positioned relative to other settlements). Another area of interest is the internal organization of urban areas with regard to different demographic groups and the layout of infrastructure. This subdiscipline also draws on ideas from other branches of Human Geography to see their involvement in the processes and patterns evident in an [[urban area]].&lt;ref name="Palm"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|date=2016-09-05|title=Urban geography: city structures|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030913258200600104|journal=Progress in Geography|language=en|doi=10.1177/030913258200600104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Kaplan, Dave H. |author2=Holloway, Steven |author3=Wheeler, James O. |title=Urban Geography, 3rd. Edition | year=2014 | publisher=Wiley | location=Hoboken, NJ  | isbn=978-1-118-57385-3 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subfields include: [[Economic geography]], [[Population geography]], and [[Settlement geography]]. These are clearly not the only subfields that could be used to assist in the study of [[Urban geography]], but they are some major players.&lt;ref name="Palm"/&gt;

==Philosophical and theoretical approaches==
Within each of the subfields, various philosophical approaches can be used in research; therefore, an urban geographer could be a Feminist or Marxist geographer, etc.

Such approaches are:

The '''Japan–British Society''' (or {{Nihongo||日英協会|Nichiei Kyōkai}}) was founded in 1908 "to encourage the study of things British and to promote cordial relations between the peoples of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and [[Japan]]."&lt;ref name="JSL-JBS"&gt;{{cite web | title = Links to other Japan-related sites | publisher = Japan Society of London   | url = http://www.japansociety.org.uk/about_links.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCO-JBS"&gt;{{cite web | title = Japan British Society | work = UK in Japan | publisher = UK Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office | url = http://ukinjapan.fco.gov.uk/en/working-with-japan/uk-japan-relations/japan-british-society/ | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the oldest [[bilateralism|bilateral]] organization in Japan, promoting international cooperation and exchanges.

__TOC__

==Foundation of the society==

The society was founded in 1908, six years after Japan and the United Kingdom formed the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], which at first was a purely military arrangement.  Japanese Government Officials established the society after [[Culture gap|recognising the need]] for mutual understanding of the two countries' societies and cultures.&lt;ref name="JT-JBS"&gt;{{Citation | last = Arita | first = Eriko | author-link = Arita Eriko | title = Japan-British Society wants help in recovering records of its activities | newspaper = Japan Times | date = 2001-05-10 | url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20010510a7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japan–British Society and the [[Japan Society of the UK|Japan Society]]'s Japan branch (which is no longer extant) appear to have had their roots in a group known as "the Old Country Club" for Japanese who had previously lived in England.&lt;ref name="HC-JBS-A"&gt;{{Citation | last = Cortazzi | first = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Cortazzi | last2 = Daniels | first2 = Gordon | author2-link = Gordon Daniels | title = Britain and Japan, 1859-1991: themes and personalities | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | pages = 8 and 294| edition = Illustrated | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bLI9AAAAIAAJ | isbn = 978-0-415-05966-4| id = {{ISBN|0-415-05966-6}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 1908, a meeting was held at the [[rokumeikan|Peer's Club]]&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The [[kazoku|Peer]]'s Club purchased the old Rokumeikan building in 1890, and renamed it {{Nihongo3|literally "Peerage Meeting Hall", though known in English as the Peer's Club, Noble's Club, and Peerage Club.|華族会館|[[Kazoku]] Kaikan}}  The building was demolished in 1941, and its imposing, copper clad gates were destroyed by bombing in 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bar | first = Pat  | year = 1989 | title = The Deer Cry Pavilion: A Story of Westerners in Japan, 1868-1905 | publisher = Penguin (non classic) | isbn = 0-14-009578-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Terry | first = Thomas | authorlink =   | coauthors = | title = Terry's Japanese Empire: Including Korea and Formosa, with Chapters on Manchuria, the Trans-Siberian Railway, and the Chief Ocean Routes to Japan; a Guidebook for Travelers; with 8 Specially Drawn Maps and 21 Plans | publisher = Houghton Mifflin company | year = 1914 | pages = 115, 137 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ipbUA13CHoC&amp;q=Peers+Club&amp;dq=Peers+Club&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tokyo to discuss the formation in Tokyo of a society to equal the Japan Society of London.  Viscount Hayashi was elected as chairman, and the British Ambassador&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The [[Ambassador|Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary]] from the [[Court of St. James's]] to Japan holds the presidency of the society for the duration of their appointment.&lt;/ref&gt; was elected as its first president.  The Ambassador proposed that the society be named "The Japanese and British Society", however those present chose the shorter "The British Society" instead.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = Japan Weekly Mail (1870~1915) | place = Tokyo | date = 1908-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 1908, "The British Society" held its inaugural meeting at the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]]&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The original, wooden Imperial Hotel was built next to the Rokumeikan/Kazoku Kaikan in 1890, but was demolished and replaced by a [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|stone and concrete structure]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] in 1923, which in turn was demolished to make way for the current structure in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; in Tokyo, and at some point after 1910, changed its name to "The Japan-British Society".&lt;ref name="HC-JBS-A"/&gt;

==1908 to the present day==

On 13 March 1935, Mr. Charles Sale of the Japan Society used the inauguration of a telephone service between Japan and the United Kingdom to send the Japan Society's greetings to the officers and council of the Japan–British Society in Tokyo, and to their patron [[Prince Chichibu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cortazzi | first = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Cortazzi | last2 = Daniels | first2 = Gordon | author2-link = Gordon Daniels | title = Britain and Japan, 1859-1991: themes and personalities | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | pages =42 | edition = Illustrated | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bLI9AAAAIAAJ | isbn = 978-0-415-05966-4| id = {{ISBN|0-415-05966-6}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the society's activities were halted, and [[Bombing of Tokyo|air raids]] destroyed much of their records.  The society resumed its activities upon the conclusion of the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951.

Large-scale festivals of [[Japanese culture]] were held in the U.K. in 1981 and 1991.  In 1998, a reciprocal event, the UK98 festival, was held with the cooperation of the association to introduce [[British culture]] to Japan.

The Society supported the Japan 2001 festival, which featured a series of events to introduce [[Culture of Japan|traditional]] and [[Japanese popular culture|contemporary]] Japanese culture throughout Britain.  The event's joint patrons were the [[Prince of Wales]] and the [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince of Japan]].  In addition, the society began compiling a history of the organization in preparation for its [[centenary]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="JT-JBS"/&gt;

In November, 2000, the society was reformed and established as a {{Nihongo3|incorporated association|社団法人|Shadan Hojin}}.&lt;ref name="JSL-JBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farazmand | first = Ali | authorlink = Ali Farazmand | title = Public enterprise management: international case studies | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 1996 | pages = 137 and 138 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iSW5FKVYH4wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA138&amp;dq=Shadan+Hojin&amp;lr=#PRA1-PA137,M1 | isbn = 978-0-313-28025-2| id = {{ISBN|0-313-28025-8}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

This body has over 2000 members and is supported by more than 120 corporate members.&lt;ref name="JT-JBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WR-JBS"&gt;{{cite web | title = Directory : The Japan British Society | publisher = White Rose East Asia Centre | url = http://www.wreac.org/nijs/jportal/Portals/Japan-Portal/UK%252DJapan-Relations/The-UK-in-Japan/The-Japan%252DBritish-Society/details.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership of the Society is open to anyone with an interest in the cause of [[Japan-United Kingdom relations]], and on the recommendation of a member of the Society or upon attending a membership interview.
&lt;ref name="FCO-JBS"/&gt;

==Imperial patronage==

[[Prince Fushimi Sadanaru]] became the first Royal Patron of the Society in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cortazzi | first = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Cortazzi | last2 = Daniels | first2 = Gordon | author2-link = Gordon Daniels | title = Britain and Japan, 1859-1991: themes and personalities | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | pages = 294 | edition = Illustrated | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bLI9AAAAIAAJ | isbn = 978-0-415-05966-4| id = {{ISBN|0-415-05966-6}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; after taking an active role in Anglo-Japanese relations.  He travelled to the UK in May, 1907, to give Emperor Meiji's thanks to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] for bestowing [[Order of the Garter|The Most Noble Order of the Garter]]&lt;!--add note about Imperial Garter Recipients--&gt; upon him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cortazzi | first = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Cortazzi | last2 = Daniels | first2 = Gordon | author2-link = Gordon Daniels | title = Britain and Japan, 1859-1991: themes and personalities | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | pages = 20| edition = Illustrated | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bLI9AAAAIAAJ | isbn = 978-0-415-05966-4| id = {{ISBN|0-415-05966-6}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was sent to England again after [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1909, on a mission of thanks from the Japanese government for British advice and assistance during the war, and the Prince also represented Japan at the [[state funeral]] of King Edward VII on May 20, 1910, and met with the new [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].

Later, Prince and Princess Chichibu were Honorary Patrons.  [[Prince Chichibu]] was the second son of [[Emperor Taishō]] and noted for his efforts to promote international relations.  His promotion of [[Rugby union in Japan|rugby in Japan]] is remembered at the [[Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium]] (Prince Chichibu Memorial Rugby Ground) in Aoyama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Chichibu | work = The Imperial Family | publisher = The Imperial Household Agency | url = http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/history/history12.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, [[Princess Chichibu]], eldest daughter of Ambassador [[Tsuneo Matsudaira]], accepted the honorary patronage.  She was active in Anglo-Japanese relations, visiting the UK in 1962 (in reciprocation for the first post-war visit by a member of the UK Royal family, [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra of Kent]], the previous year), and again in 1967, for the 75th anniversary of the Japan Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cortazzi | first = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Cortazzi | last2 = Daniels | first2 = Gordon | author2-link = Gordon Daniels | title = Britain and Japan, 1859-1991: themes and personalities | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | pages = 46 | edition = Illustrated | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bLI9AAAAIAAJ | isbn = 978-0-415-05966-4| id = {{ISBN|0-415-05966-6}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every year, the society holds the Princess Chichibu Memorial Lecture.

{{As of|2013}} [[Prince Tomohito of Mikasa]] was the Honorary Patron of the Japan–British Society.  He is the eldest son of [[Prince Mikasa]], and an [[alumnus]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]'s [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Tomohito of Mikasa | work = The Imperial Family | publisher = The Imperial Household Agency | url = http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/history/history06.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

The Society provides a forum within which members of both nationalities meet for social and cultural exchanges on an informal and friendly basis.  The Society's regular events are an Annual Dinner, a Gala Party, the Princess Chichibu Memorial Lecture and the Annual Golf Tournament for the Princess Chichibu Trophy.  The society also holds many other events such as wine or sake tasting, trips to sporting events and theatrical performances, cultural lessons (such as English cookery), Business Forum meetings, and lectures.

The society's Junior Group arranges social events to appeal to younger members, including the annual Christmas party, the ''Mochitsuki'' (rice pounding), ''Shinnenkai'' (New Year's party), pub nights, film viewings, barbecues, and cherry blossom viewing at the British Embassy.&lt;ref name="FCO-JBS"/&gt;

==Activities==

The society has supported a number of exchange programs and offers opportunities for British and Japanese members to become acquainted with each other, including seasonal events and lectures.  In the educational sphere, the society has supported English language study programs in Britain.&lt;ref name="JT-JBS"/&gt;

==Regional The Japan British Society==

The Japan–British Society was founded in Tokyo in 1908 and gradually spread to many regional areas.  As of August, 2009, there are 19&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukinjapan.fco.gov.uk/en/working-with-japan/uk-japan-relations/japan-british-society/jbs-in-regions Japan-British Societies in the Regions]&lt;/ref&gt; independent, regional Japan-British Societies outside Tokyo: [[Aichi]], [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]], [[Asahikawa]], [[Ehime]], [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.pref.fukui.jp/kokusai/tagengo/html_e/renraku/f_nitiei.html British-Japan Society of Fukui]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fukuoka]], [[Hakodate]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], [[Kagoshima]], [[Kansai]], [[Kumamoto]], [[Miyazaki, Miyazaki|Miyazaki]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]], [[Tohoku]], [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3628">The '''Johns Hopkins Beast''' was a mobile automaton, an early pre-[[robot]], built in the 1960s at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Applied Physics Laboratory]]. The machine had a rudimentary [[Artificial intelligence|intelligence]] and the ability to survive on its own. As it wandered through the white halls of the laboratory, it would seek black wall outlets. When it found one it would plug in and recharge.

The robot was [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]]. It did not use a computer. Its control circuitry consisted of dozens of [[transistor]]s controlling analog voltages. It used [[photocell]] optics and [[sonar]] to navigate. The 2N404 transistors were used to create [[NOR logic|NOR]] [[logic gate]]s that implemented the [[Boolean logic]] to tell it what to do when a specific sensor was activated. The 2N404 transistors were also used to create timing gates to tell it how long to do something. 2N1040 [[Power transistor]]s were used to control the power to the motion treads, the boom, and the charging mechanism.

The original sensors in Mod I were physical touch only.  The wall socket was detected by physical switches on the arm that followed the wall.  Once detected, two electrical prongs were extended until they entered the wall socket and made the electrical connection to charge the vehicle.  The stairway, doors, and pipes on the hall wall were also detected by physical switches and recognized by appropriate logic.

The sonar guidance system was developed for Mod I and improved for Mod II. It used two [[ultrasonic transducer]]s to determine distance, location within the halls, and obstructions in its path. This provided "The Beast" with [[bat]]-like guidance.  At this point, it could detect obstructions in the hallway, such as people in the hallway.  Once an obstruction was detected, the Beast would slow down and then decide whether to stop or divert around the obstruction.  It could also ultrasonically recognize the stairway and doorways to take appropriate action.

An optical guidance system was added to Mod II.  This provided, among other capabilities, the ability to optically identify the black wall sockets that contrasted with the white wall.

The Hopkins Beast Autonomous Robot Mod II link below was written by Dr. Ronald McConnell, at that time a co-op student and one of the designers for Mod II.  Many additional references can be found at this link.

{{distinguish|Legitimacy (family law)}}
[[File:John Locke by Herman Verelst.png|thumb|185px|right|[[John Locke]]: consent of the governed confers political legitimacy.]]
In [[political science]], '''legitimacy''' is the right and acceptance of an [[authority]], usually a governing law or a [[regime|régime]]. Whereas "authority" denotes a specific position in an established government, the term "legitimacy" denotes a ''system'' of government—wherein 
"government" denotes "[[sphere of influence]]". An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse. In political systems where this is not the case, unpopular régimes survive because they are considered legitimate by a small, influential [[elite|élite]].&lt;ref name="Dahl, Robert A. pp. 124"&gt;Dahl, Robert A. ''Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition'' (pp. 124–188). New Haven (Connecticut) and London: Yale University Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese political philosophy, since the historical period of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1046–256 BC), the political legitimacy of a ruler and government was derived from the [[Mandate of Heaven]], and unjust rulers who lost said mandate therefore lost the right to rule the people.

In [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], the term "legitimacy" is often positively interpreted as the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] status conferred by a governed people upon their governors' institutions, offices, and actions, based upon the belief that their government's actions are appropriate uses of power by a legally constituted government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics &amp; Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824–849|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12100/abstract|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era British social philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) said that political legitimacy derives from popular explicit and implicit [[consent of the governed]]: "The argument of the [''Second''] ''Treatise'' is that the government is not legitimate unless it is carried on with the consent of the governed."&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, Richard (ed.): ''John Locke: Critical Assessments'' (p. 524). London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Dolf Sternberger]] said that "[l]egitimacy is the foundation of such governmental power as is exercised, both with a consciousness on the government's part that it has a right to govern, and with some recognition by the governed of that right".&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, Dolf: "Legitimacy" in ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (ed. D.L. Sills) Vol. 9 (p. 244). New York: Macmillan, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political sociologist]] [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] said that legitimacy also "involves the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society".&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour Martin: ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (2nd ed.) (p. 64). London: Heinemann, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The American political scientist [[Robert A. Dahl]] explained legitimacy as a reservoir: so long as the water is at a given level, political stability is maintained, if it falls below the required level, political legitimacy is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dahl, Robert A. pp. 124"/&gt;

== Types ==

Legitimacy is "a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted as right and proper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Jing|title=Useful Complaints: How Petitions Assist Decentralized Authoritarianism in China|year=2016|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=9781498534536|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In political science, legitimacy usually is understood as the popular acceptance and recognition by the public of the authority of a governing régime, whereby authority has political power through consent and mutual understandings, not coercion. The three types of political legitimacy described by German [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] are traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal:

*Traditional legitimacy derives from societal custom and habit that emphasize the history of the authority of [[tradition]]. Traditionalists understand this form of rule as historically accepted, hence its continuity, because it is the way society has always been. Therefore, the institutions of traditional government usually are historically continuous, as in [[monarchy]] and [[Tribe|tribalism]].
*Charismatic legitimacy derives from the ideas and personal [[charisma]] of the leader, a person whose authoritative [[persona]] charms and psychologically dominates the people of the society to agreement with the government's régime and rule. A charismatic government usually features weak political and administrative institutions, because they derive authority from the persona of the leader, and usually disappear without the leader in power. However, if the charismatic leader has a successor, a government derived from charismatic legitimacy might continue.
*Rational-legal legitimacy derives from a system of institutional procedure, wherein government institutions establish and enforce law and order in the public interest. Therefore, it is through public trust that the government will abide the law that confers rational-legal legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick H.|title=Essentials of Comparative Politics|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-93376-5|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numinous legitimacy ===

{{further|Divine right of kings|Mandate of Heaven|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}

In a [[theocracy]], government legitimacy derives from the spiritual authority of a god or a goddess.

* In [[ancient Egypt]] (c. 3150 BC), the legitimacy of the dominion of a [[Pharaoh]] (god–king) was theologically established by doctrine that posited the pharaoh as the Egyptian patron god [[Horus]], son of [[Osiris]].
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|150px|right|Theocracy: The coat of arms of the [[Holy See]], the seat of [[Pope|Papal government]].]]
* In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[priest]]hood derives its legitimacy from a divine source; the Roman Magisterium dogmatically teaches that Jesus Christ designated St. Peter the [[universal jurisdiction|supreme]] and [[papal infallibility|infallible]] head of the entire Christian Church, and thus each [[Papacy|bishop of Rome]] is sanctified, legitimate, and possesses these [[charism]]s as well.

=== Civil legitimacy ===
[[File:Women vote in Cairo - 27-May-2014.jpg|left|thumb|One measurement of civil legitimacy is who has access to the vote, including women are able to vote.]]
The political legitimacy of a civil government derives from agreement among the autonomous constituent institutions—legislative, judicial, executive—combined for the national common good. One way civil society grants legitimacy to governments is through public elections. There are also those who refute the legitimacy offered by public elections, pointing out that the amount of legitimacy public elections can grant depends significantly on the electoral system conducting the elections. In the United States this issue has surfaced around how voting is impacted by gerrymandering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/07/06/a-primer-on-gerrymandering-and-political-polarization/|title=A primer on gerrymandering and political polarization|last=Dews|first=Fred|date=2017-07-06|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Shelby County v. Holder|repeal of part of the Voting Rights Act]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html|title=Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act|last=Liptak|first=Adam|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another challenge to the political legitimacy offered by elections is whether or not marginalized groups such as women or those who are incarcerated are allowed to vote.{{fact|date=July 2018}} 

Civil legitimacy can be granted through different measures for accountability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/programs/cri/programs/governance-accountability|title=Governance &amp; Accountability|website=www.hks.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; than voting, such as financial transparency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://financialtransparency.org|title=Home - Financial Transparency Coalition|website=Financial Transparency Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stake-holder accountability. In the international system another method for measuring civil legitimacy is through accountability to international human rights norms.{{fact|date=July 2018}} 

In an effort determine what makes a government legitimate the Center for Public Impact launched a project to hold a global conversation about legitimacy stating, inviting citizens, academics and governments to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findinglegitimacy.centreforpublicimpact.org|title=Finding Legitimacy|website=findinglegitimacy.centreforpublicimpact.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also publishes case studies that consider the theme of legitimacy as it applies to projects in a number of different countries including Bristol, Lebanon and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/insights/?searchString=&amp;theme%5B%5D=legitimacy&amp;orderby=|title=Viewpoints - Centre for Public Impact (CPI)|work=Centre for Public Impact (CPI)|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Good" governance vs. "bad" governance ===
The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commission (OHCHR) established standards of what is considered "good governance" that include the key attributes transparency, responsibility, accountability, participation and responsiveness (to the needs of the people).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/Development/GoodGovernance/Pages/GoodGovernanceIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} 
	Good Governance and Human Rights|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Input, output and throughput legitimacy ===

Assessing the political legitimacy of a government can be done by looking at three different aspects of which a government can derive legitimacy. [[Fritz W. Scharpf|Fritz Scharpf]] introduced two normative criteria, which are output legitimacy, i.e. the effectiveness of policy outcomes for people and input legitimacy, the responsiveness to citizen concerns as a result of participation by the people. A third normative criterion was added by [[Vivien A. Schmidt|Vivien Schmidt]], who analyzes legitimacy also in terms of what she calls throughput, i.e. the governance processes that happen in between input and output.

=== Negative and positive legitimacy ===

Abulof distinguishes between negative political legitimacy (NPL), which is about the object of legitimation (answering ''what'' is legitimate), and positive political legitimacy (PPL), which is about the source of legitimation (answering ''who'' is the 'legitimator').{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} NPL is concerned with establishing where to draw the line between good and bad, PPL with who should be drawing it in the first place. From the NPL perspective, political legitimacy emanates from appropriate actions; from a PPL perspective, it emanates from appropriate actors. In the social contract tradition, Hobbes and Locke focused on NPL (stressing security and liberty, respectively), while Rousseau focused more on PPL ("the people" as the legitimator). Arguably, political stability depends on both forms of legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;Abulof, Uriel (2015).

=== Instrumental and substantive legitimacy ===

Weber's understanding of legitimacy rests on shared ''values'', such as tradition and rational-legality. But policies that aim at (re-)constructing legitimacy by improving the service delivery or 'output' of a state often only respond to shared ''needs''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weigand|first=Florian|date=April 2015|title=Investigating the Role of Legitimacy in the Political Order of Conflict-torn Spaces|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/62691/1/Investigating-Legitimacy-in-the-Political-Order-of-Conflict-torn-spaces.pdf|journal=SiT/WP|volume=04/15|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, substantive sources of legitimacy need to be distinguished from more instrumental ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Instrumental legitimacy'' rests on "the rational assessment of the usefulness of an authority ..., describing to what extent an authority responds to shared needs. Instrumental legitimacy is very much based on the perceived effectiveness of service delivery. Conversely, ''substantive legitimacy'' is a more abstract normative judgment, which is underpinned by shared values. If a person believes that an entity has the right to exercise social control, he or she may also accept personal disadvantages."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Max Weber]]: societies are politically cyclical.]] 
Max Weber proposed that societies behave cyclically in governing themselves with different types of governmental legitimacy. That [[democracy]] was unnecessary for establishing legitimacy, a condition that can be established with codified laws, customs, and cultural principles, not by means of [[voting|popular suffrage]]. That a society might decide to revert from the legitimate government of a rational–legal authority to the charismatic government of a leader; e.g., the [[Nazi Germany]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Fascism|Fascist]] Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]], and [[Francoist Spain]] under General [[Francisco Franco]].

[[File:matteidoganportrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Mattei Dogan]]]]
The French political scientist [[Mattei Dogan]]'s contemporary interpretation of Weber's types of political legitimacy (traditional, charismatic, legal-rational) proposes that they are conceptually insufficient to comprehend the complex relationships that constitute a legitimate political system in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;Dogan, Mattei: Conceptions of Legitimacy, ''Encyclopedia of Government and Politics'' 2nd edition, Mary Hawkesworth and Maurice Kogan editors, Vol. 2, pp. 116-219. London: Routledge 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Dogan proposed that traditional authority and charismatic authority are obsolete as forms of contemporary government (e.g., the Islamic Republic of Iran (est. 1979) rule by means of the priestly Koranic interpretations by the [[Ayatollah]] [[Khomeini]]). That traditional authority has disappeared in the [[Middle East]]; that the rule-proving exceptions are [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].{{clarify|date=December 2014}}{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Furthermore, the third Weber type of political legitimacy, rational-legal authority, exists in so many permutations no longer allow it to be limited as a type of legitimate authority.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}

== Forms of legitimate government ==

In determining the political legitimacy of a system of rule and government, the term proper—''political legitimacy''—is philosophically an [[essentially contested concept]] that facilitates understanding the different applications and interpretations of abstract, [[Qualitative properties|qualitative]], and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] concepts such as "[[art]]", "[[social justice]]", et cetera, as applied in [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], the [[philosophy of history]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Initially published as Gallie (1956a), then as Gallie (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in defining the political legitimacy of a system of government and rule, the term "essentially contested concept" indicates that a key term ([[communism]], [[democracy]], [[constitutionalism]], etc.) has different meanings within a given political argument. Hence, the intellectually restrictive politics of [[Dogma#Dogma outside of religion|dogmatism]] ("My answer is right, and all others are wrong"), [[scepticism]] ("All answers are equally true or [false]; everyone has a right to his own truth"), and [[eclecticism]] ("Each meaning gives a partial view, so the more meanings the better") are inappropriate philosophic stances for managing a political term that has more than one meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Garver (1978), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[W. B. Gallie|Walter Bryce Gallie]])

Establishing what qualifies as a legitimate form of government continues to be a topic of great philosophical controversy. Forms of legitimate government are posited to include:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*'''[[Communism]]''': The legitimacy of a [[Communist state]] derives from having won a [[civil war]], a [[revolution]], or from having won an election, such as the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende]] (1970–73) in Chile; thus, the actions of the Communist government are legitimate, authorised by the people. In the early twentieth century, [[Communism|Communist parties]] based the arguments supporting the legitimacy of their rule and government upon the scientific nature of [[Marxism]]. (See [[dialectical materialism]].)
*'''[[Constitutionalism]]''': The modern political concept of constitutionalism establishes the law as supreme over the private will, by integrating [[nationalism]], democracy, and limited government. The political legitimacy of constitutionalism derives from popular belief and acceptance that the actions of the government are legitimate because they abide by the law codified in the [[political constitution]]. The political scientist [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] (1901–84) said that, in dividing political power among the organs of government, constitutional law effectively restrains the actions of the government.&lt;ref name="Charlton, Roger p. 23"&gt;Charlton, Roger: ''Political Realities: Comparative Government'' (p. 23). London: Longman, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[checks and balances]].)
*'''[[Democracy]]''': In a democracy, government legitimacy derives from the popular perception that the elected government abides by democratic principles in governing, and thus is legally accountable to its people.&lt;ref name="Charlton, Roger p. 23"/&gt;
*'''[[Fascism]]''': In the 1920s and the 1930s, fascism based its political legitimacy upon the arguments of traditional authority; respectively, the German [[Nazism|National Socialists]] and the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]] claimed that the political legitimacy of their right to rule derived from philosophically denying the (popular) political legitimacy of elected [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[democracy|democratic]] governments. During the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918–33), the political philosopher [[Carl Schmitt]] (1888–1985)—whose legal work as the "Crown Jurist of the Third Reich" promoted fascism and [[Deconstruction|deconstructed]] liberal democracy—addressed the matter in ''Legalität und Legitimität'' (Legality and Legitimacy, 1932), an anti-democratic [[Polemics|polemic]] treatise that asked: How can parliamentary government make for law and legality, when a 49 per cent minority accepts as politically legitimate the political will of a 51 per cent majority?&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Carl: ''Legality and Legitimacy'' (Jeffrey Seitzer translator). Durham (North Carolina): Duke University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Monarchy]]''': In a monarchy, the [[divine right of kings]] establishes the political legitimacy of the rule of the monarch (king or queen); legitimacy also derives from the popular perception (tradition and [[Convention (norm)|custom]]) and acceptance of the monarch as the rightful ruler of nation and country. Contemporarily, such divine-right legitimacy is manifest in the [[absolute monarchy]] of the [[House of Saud]] (est. 1744), a [[royal family]] who have ruled and governed [[Saudi Arabia]] since the 18th century. Moreover, [[constitutional monarchy]] is a variant form of monarchic political legitimacy which combines traditional authority and legal–rational authority, by which means the monarch maintains nationalist unity (one people) and democratic administration (a political constitution).

'''''Monster Café ''''' is a [[CBBC|Children's BBC]] comedy programme about three monsters working in Monster Café, where they meet weird monsters, serve weird food and battle with their evil boss, the Baroness. The series originally aired from 1994–1995.

The series was repeated on [[CBBC On Choice]] between 2000 and 2001, [[CBBC]] in 2002&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/cbbc/2002-12-09#at-14.20&lt;/ref&gt;, then on [[BBC Two]] in May 2005&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2005-05-09#at-6.50&lt;/ref&gt;, and again on [[CBeebies]] in November 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008942f&lt;/ref&gt;, but after complaints on BBC Message Boards and direct to the BBC regarding how the programme "scared young children", it was pulled from the schedule.

==Characters==
'''Frankie''' played by Isobel Middleton

Frankie is a female robot who works at the café. She is the smartest of the trio and uses many of the gadgets on her body to help out with problems and to fight the Baroness sometimes.

'''Igor''' played by David Shimwell

Igor is a 1-trillion-millenniums-old [[Transylvania]]n man who has very poor hygiene (but claims it's an old Transylvanian custom). He also works at the café and loves making potions and other weird concoctions. He also has a pet dustbin called Vinny. Igor also has a short temper, when he gets angry he has a 'Monster Bubbly' where he breathes fire and throws saucepans and custard pies (which always hit Skull) at other monsters.

'''Mummy''' played by [[Toby Sedgwick]]

Mummy is a 6000-year-old [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian [[mummy]] who works at the café. He is very dim-witted and often gets stuff wrong. He also pronounces his Ms as Rs (So he called himself Rummy). Mummy sleeps in a coffin.

'''Baroness de Monstro''' played by [[Peta Lily]]

The Baroness is the bossy and bad-tempered manager of the Monster Café. She also hates the monsters having any kind of fun and meals being given away for free. She also created Frankie to help work in the café.

===Minor characters===
'''Vinny the Bin'''

Igor's pet dustbin, who acts very much like a dog and will eat anything.

'''Skull''' played by [[Simon Davies (Welsh TV presenter)|Simon Davies]]

A talking skull who lives in the Monster Café. He always tells incredibly bad jokes and is often mistreated, by being turned into a cabbage by the Baroness or having a custard pie thrown at him by Igor.

'''Chas''' played by Richard Ashton

Monster Café's best and favourite customer. Chas loves eating slugs and talks with a very strong [[Birmingham]] accent.

[[Marcel McCalla]] narrates the show.

'''Mulquinerie''', a landmark of [[French fashion|French sartorial heritage]] and [[Master craftsman|high craftsmanship]], is the art of [[weaving]] and [[Trade|trading]] fine fabrics composed exclusively of [[linen]]: whether plain [[Flax|flax cloth]], 'linon'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/linon|title=Linon: Merriam-Webster Dictionary|last=|first=|date=2018|website=MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARIES|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[batiste]]. A 'mulquinier' was the [[artisan]] textile [[Textile design|designer]] and [[Weaving|weaver]] as well as the merchant of canvases. The mulquiniers were not only a subcategorization of the [[Weaving#Medieval Europe|tisserand(e)]] artists &lt;small&gt;([[Weaving#Hand loom weavers|hand loom weavers]]; French pronunciation: [tisʀɑ̃])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/french-english/tisserand|title=Tisserand - Cambridge French to English dictionary|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Cambridge University Press - Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were also the traders of their own craft. This activity was predominantly developed within villages as a substantial rural [[Proto-industrialization|proto-industry]], hence mulquiniers working on [[wiktionary:métier à tisser|métiers à tisser]] in their home' basement while breathing from "bahottes" or "blocures" to obtain the most propitious [[Humidity|humidity levels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terrier|first=Didier|date=1983|title=Mulquiniers et gaziers : les deux phases de la protoindustrie textile dans la région de Saint-Quentin. 1730-1850|url=|journal=Revue du Nord|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and Etymology ==
Mulquinerie originated in the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century|18th]] centuries from [[metropolitan France]]’s Northern [[Departments of France|Departments]] now constituting the [[Hauts-de-France]] region &lt;small&gt;(French pronunciation: [[Help:IPA/French|[o d(ə) fʁɑ̃s]]], translating to "Upper France" in English; [[Picard language|Picard]]: ''Heuts-d'Franche'')&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/archive/recup/region/la-region-a-vote-et-s-appelle-desormais-ia0b0n3385042|title="La Région a voté et s'appelle désormais Hauts-de-France" [The region has voted and is now called Hauts-de-France]|last=|first=|date=15 March 2016|work=La Voix du Nord Newspaper Online (in French)|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the territorial reform of [[Regions of France|French Regions]] (2014) from a merger of [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] and [[Picardy]]. The activity was ubiquitous in the towns of the former [[Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin]], the [[Cambrai|Cambrésis]] sub-province or the [[Thiérache]] including [[Saint-Vaast-en-Cambrésis]], [[Saint-Hilaire-lez-Cambrai]], [[Haspres]], [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] or [[Neuvilly]]. This also included [[Caudry]], the [[Medieval art|medieval]] capital city of [[Lace|French Lace]] which remains (in collaboration with [[Calais]]) the only town in [[France]] where lace is still made.

[[Etymology|Etymologically]], ‘mulquinier’ is derived from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic term]] "mollquin" meaning 'thin canvas'. First traces of the term are encountered in the 'Charter of the mulquiniers of [[Valenciennes]]' in [[1413]] through the use of the term 'molekinier'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malotet|first=A.|date=1910|title=L'industrie et le commerce des toiles fines à Valenciennes dans les temps modernes|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/rnord_0035-2624_1910_num_1_4_1178|journal=Revue du Nord|volume=1-4|pages= 281–320|via=Persée}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the oldest mulquinerie ancestries are the 'Lecygne' and 'Legueil' families tracing back beyond the [[17th century|XVII&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century]] being [[Dyeing|fabric dyers]], [[textile artist]]s, [[Embroidery|embroiderers]], [[patternmaker]]s or [[Hand spinning|hand-spinners]].

== Symbolism and Patronage ==
The French mulquiniers' patron was [[Saint Veronica]] of [[Jerusalem]] whose representations they celebrated biannually ([[summer]] and [[winter]]) as in many pious [[Christianity by country|Christian countries]].

'''Pendejo Cave''' is a geological feature and archaeological site located in southern [[New Mexico]] about 20 miles east of [[Orogrande, New Mexico|Orogrande]].  Archaeologist [[Richard S. MacNeish]] claimed that human occupation of the cave pre-dates by tens of thousands of years the [[Clovis Culture]], traditionally believed to be one of the oldest if not the oldest culture in the Americas.

==Description==
Pendejo is a relatively small cave, only 5 meters wide, 12 meters deep, and having a maximum height of 3 meters. It is below the rim of an escarpment, facing north, and about {{convert|50|m|feet}} above the canyon floor. The cave is located at an elevation of {{convert|1490|m|ft}} amidst the sparse desert vegetation of the [[Chihuahua Desert]].  A slightly more [[mesic habitat]] is found at the foot of the cliffs.&lt;ref&gt;"Pendejo Cave", https://www.utep.edu/leb/pleistnm/sites/pendejocave.htm, accessed 9 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish profanity#Pendejo|'''Pendejo''']] is a Spanish word and literally means ''"a pubic hair"'', but in Mexico it can also be a vulgar insult.

==Archaeological history==
Pendejo Cave was discovered in 1978, and twelve years later, in early 1990, the first archaeological expedition headed by MacNeish excavated the site.  Another excavation occurred one year later, in late winter and early spring of 1991.  [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] (c. 11,000 BCE) tools were found in the cave, along with tools from later Native societies.  Unifacial shavers, utilized flakes, and other artifacts were uncovered and attributed to various eras, along with several examples of worked bone, including a bone awl made from the scapula of a horse, and a knife made from a rib bone.

MacNeish claimed to have found even earlier [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] artifacts in the cave.  A total of 111 chipped tools was found throughout the formation in three complexes.  He estimated the oldest may date back as far as 75,000 years.&lt;ref name="MacNeish"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=MacNeish|editor1-first=Richard|editor2-last=Libby|editor2-first=Jane|editor1-link=Richard MacNeish|title=Pendejo Cave|date=2004|publisher=University of New Mexico|isbn=978-0826324054|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tQLRHdQxD4C&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=Pendejo+cave+75,000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ztamuQfWGm&amp;sig=Qg2wjqFBhqJ5DFy_WPj307uFWdI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL08f4s5vOAhUJIsAKHUpLCWgQ6AEIOTAF#v=snippet&amp;q=75%2C000&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early dating of the discoveries at Pendejo Cave has generally been discounted by other archaeologists.  Faunal remains in the cave had been dated to possibly as old as 55,000 years, but the manufacture and dating of the chipped stones and other alleged artifacts of human origin is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedel, Stuart F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6000">A '''philosophical poet''' is an author or scholar who employs [[Poetry|poetic devices, styles, or forms]] to explore subjects common to the field of [[philosophy]]. Their writing often addresses questions related to the meaning of life, the nature of being ([[ontology]]), theories of knowledge and knowing ([[epistemology]]), principles of beauty ([[aesthetics]]), first principles of things ([[metaphysics]]) or the existence of God. Some may make broad philosophical inquires and engage with diverse philosophical topics throughout their poetry, while others may concentrate within one branch of philosophical poetry. For example, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] is considered by some to be both a philosophical poet, in a general sense, as well as a metaphysical poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QbBcPW-JF8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=philosophical+poet+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yv0rOa2M80&amp;sig=gqL4IWFwaFATG3oO3HQlUog55U8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQv5ypgdPMAhWH4IMKHee2DIQ4ChDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophical%2520poet%2520definition&amp;f=false|title=The Early T.

Although a group discussion may provide fruitful conditions for some to explore philosophical themes, poetry may be seen an alternative entry into philosophical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFogBQAAQBAJ|title=The Philosophy Shop: Ideas, activities and questions to get people, young and old, thinking philosophically|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2012-09-27|publisher=Crown House Publishing|isbn=9781781350614|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children and young writers may find it easier to begin writing philosophical poetry if they start by using poetic styles other than rhyme, such as repetitive form, since rhyme can be distracting and may interfere with the free flow of their philosophical thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFogBQAAQBAJ|title=The Philosophy Shop: Ideas, activities and questions to get people, young and old, thinking philosophically|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2012-09-27|publisher=Crown House Publishing|isbn=9781781350614|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, but not all, philosophical poets do eventually develop one preferred form of philosophical verse when it comes to the style of their writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kenyonreview.org/2012/01/two-philosophical-poets-on-t-s-eliot-and-kay-ryan/|title=Two Philosophical Poets: On T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21771">{{For|the 1995 film|Picture Bride (film)}}
The term '''picture bride''' refers to the practice in the early 20th century of [[immigrant]] workers (chiefly [[Japan]]ese, [[Okinawa]]n, and [[Korea]]n) in [[Hawaii]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] selecting brides from their native countries via a [[matchmaking|matchmaker]], who paired bride and groom using only photographs and family recommendations of the possible candidates. This is an abbreviated form of the traditional matchmaking process, and is similar in a number of ways to the concept of the [[mail-order bride]].

==Motives of husbands==
In the late 19th century, Japanese, Okinawan, and Korean men traveled to Hawaii as cheap labor to work on the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s.&lt;ref name="Takaki 1983 119"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pau Hana: Plantation Life and Labor in Hawaii, 1835-1920|last=Takaki|first=Ronald|publisher=University of Hawaii press|year=1984|isbn=0824809564|location=Honolulu|page=119|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some continued on to work on the mainland.&lt;ref name="Lee 2003 23"&gt;{{cite book|title=Prostitutes and Picture Brides: Chinese and Japanese Immigration, Settlement, and American Nation-Building, 1870-1920|last=Lee|first=Catherine|publisher=Center for Comparative Immigration Studies|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=23|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men had originally planned to leave plantation work and go back home after a few years or a contract was up.&lt;ref name="Takaki 1983 119"/&gt; Between the years of 1886 and 1924, 199,564 Japanese entered Hawaii and 113,362 returned to Japan.&lt;ref name="Lee 2003 23"/&gt; However, many men did not make enough money to go back home.&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa (n.d.). para. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1907 the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]] prohibited immigration from Hawaii to the United States for laborers.&lt;ref name="Lee 2003 23"/&gt; Because now these men were put in situations with limited mobility, they had to make Hawaii or the United States their home, and part of that was getting married. In Hawaii, the plantation owners also wanted to see the laborers get married. Though they had originally preferred single men, when the contract labor system was abolished, the owners thought that wives would make the men more likely to settle down and stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pau Hana: Plantation Life and Labor in Hawaii, 1835-1920|last=Takaki|first=Ronald|publisher=University of Hawaii press|year=1984|isbn=0824809564|location=Honolulu|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the plantation owners hoped that wives would limit the amount of gambling and opium smoking the workers did, and act as a morale booster for the men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fan, C. (1996). Asian women in Hawai'i: migration, family, work, and identity. NWSA Journal, 8(1), 70-84. Retrieved from Academic Search Complete database.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives of picture brides==
[[Image:picturebridesAngelIsland.jpg|thumb|Japanese Picture Brides at [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] in 1919.]]
There were many factors that influenced women to become picture brides. Some came from poor families, so they became picture brides for economic reasons. They thought that they would come upon economic prosperity in Hawaii and the United States, and could send back money to their families in Japan and Korea.&lt;ref name="Fan 1996. p. 75"&gt;Fan (1996). p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Others did it out of obligation to their families. Because the marriages were often facilitated by parents, the daughters felt they could not go against their parents' wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Fan (1996). p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  One former picture bride recounted her decision: "I had but remote ties with him yet because of the talks between our close parents and my parents' approval and encouragement, I decided upon our picture-bride marriage."&lt;ref name="Fan 1996. p. 75"/&gt;  

Some women became picture brides in an attempt to escape familial duties. They thought that by leaving Japan or Korea they could get out of responsibilities such as [[filial piety]] that came along with traditional marriage.&lt;ref name="Fan 1996. p. 75"/&gt; Some women thought that they would gain freedoms denied to them in Japan and Korea. A quote from a Korean picture bride named Mrs. K embodies the mindset of many picture brides traveling to Hawaii, "Hawaii's a free place, everybody living well. Hawaii had freedom, so if you like talk, you can talk, if you like work, you can work."&lt;ref&gt;Chai (1979). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; With the influx of women becoming picture brides, some women followed the trend as the thing to do. As one Japanese picture bride, Motome Yoshimura, explained, "I wanted to come to the United States because everyone else was coming. So I joined the crowd."&lt;ref name="KVIE Public Television 2010"&gt;KVIE Public Television (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage process==
These Japanese, Okinawan, and Korean women got the name picture brides because the men in Hawaii and the United States sent pictures back to their home countries in order to find a bride. Family members, often with the help of a go-between (called a ''nakodo'' in Japanese and a joong-mae jaeng-i in Korean), used these photos to try to find wives for men who sent them.&lt;ref name="Chai 1988. p. 51"&gt;Chai (1988). p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  When looking at prospective brides the go-betweens looked at the family background, health, ages and wealth of the women.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 334"&gt;Niiya (2001). p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of picture bride marriage was modeled after traditional [[arranged marriage]] (called [[miai|miai kekkon]] in Japanese and Joong-mae-kyulhon in Korean).&lt;ref name="Chai 1988. p. 51"/&gt; Picture bride marriage was not much different from these arranged marriage customs, except instead of the man having little role he had no role.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 334"/&gt; Once the bride's name was entered into her husband's family registry, the marriage was considered official in Japan, and she was eligible for travel documents to the U.S. or Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Fan 1996. p. 75"/&gt; However, even though this was sufficient in their home countries, it was not considered a valid form of marriage by the American government.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 334"/&gt; Because of this, mass wedding ceremonies were held at the dock or in hotels subsequent to the brides' arrival.&lt;ref name="KVIE Public Television 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 334"/&gt;

==Immigration==

The Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 stopped the issuance of passports to Japanese laborers trying to go to America or Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2003). p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was a loophole in the agreement that allowed wives and children to immigrate to be with their husbands and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Fan (1996). p. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of this loophole that so many picture brides were able to immigrate to Hawaii and the United States. The impact of the Gentlemen's Agreement is evident in the population percentage of men and women before and after it was issued. For example, 86.7 percent of Japanese admitted to U.S. prior to Gentlemen's Agreement were men, after the agreement only 41.6 percent of the Japanese admitted were men.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2003). p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the Japanese people grew so rapidly that, in 1897, the Japanese were known as the largest single ethnic group in Hawai'i, consisting of 40 percent of the population by the year 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Ogawa and Glen Grant, "The Japanese in Hawai'i: 1885-1920," ''Picture Bride''. N.p., n.d. Web. http://www.picturebridemovie.com/japan.html retrieved on 5 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1907 and 1923 14,276 Japanese picture brides and 951 Korean picture brides arrived in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Takaki (1983). p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1908 and 1920 over 10,000 picture brides arrived on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka (2004). p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival==
[[Image:JapanesePopulationHawaii1890&amp;1920.jpg|thumb|Population of Japanese men and women in Hawaii in the years 1890 and 1920. Numbers from Pau hana: Plantation life and labor in Hawaii 1835-1920 by Ronald T. Takaki.|Population of Japanese men and women in Hawaii in the years 1890 and 1920.

It was a rough journey for the picture brides. When they first arrived, they were required to go through numerous inspections at the immigration station. The United States government did not recognize picture marriages as being legal; therefore, the picture brides would meet their soon-to-be husbands for the first time and attend a mass wedding ceremony on the docks.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Niiya (Ed.), "Japanese Picture Brides," ''Encyclopedia of Japanese American History'', Updated Edition, New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2001, American History Online, Facts On File, Inc. http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE52&amp;iPin=EJA427&amp;SingleRecord=True (accessed on 5 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these women were surprised at what they found upon arrival.  Most of what the women knew about their husbands before meeting them was based on the photos they had sent. However, the images presented did not always represent the men's real lives. Men would send photos back to Japan and Korea that were retouched, old, or of different men completely.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 335"&gt;Niiya (2001). p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Men often wore borrowed suits and chose to pose with luxury items, such as cars and houses, that they did not actually own.&lt;ref&gt;Choi (2007). p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One picture bride summarizes the feelings of many of the brides subsequent to meeting their husbands, she writes "I came to Hawaii and was so surprised and very disappointed, because my husband sent his twenty-five-year-old handsome-looking picture...He came to the pier, but I see he's really old, old-looking. He was forty-five years more old than I am. My heart stuck."  &lt;ref&gt;Chai (1988). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  On average, the grooms were ten to fifteen years older than their brides.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 335"/&gt; The age of their husbands were not the only shock for the women, they were also taken aback by their living conditions. Many women expected to live in houses like ones in the photos the men sent them, but instead found plantation quarters that were crude, isolated, and racially segregated.&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa (n.d.). para. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons that the grooms and go-betweens were not altogether truthful with the future brides was because they believed that the women would not come if they knew the reality of the man and his conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Chai (1988). p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Hawaii==
[[Image:KoreanPopulationHawaii1910&amp;1920.png|thumb|Population percentages of Korean men and women in Hawaii in the years 1910 and 1920. Numbers from Pau hana: Plantation life and labor in Hawaii 1835-1920 by Ronald T. Takaki.|Population percentages of Korean men and women in Hawaii in the years 1910 and 1920. Numbers from Pau hana: Plantation life and labor in Hawaii 1835-1920 by Ronald T. Takaki.]]
Though they were now living in Hawaii, the Japanese picture brides still felt it was important to preserve their traditions and heritage. The values they tried to instill in their children were filial piety, obligation to community and authority (''on'' in the Japanese language), reciprocal obligation (''giri'' in Japanese), the importance of hard work, perseverance, frugality, and a drive for success (''seiko'' in Japanese).&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa (n.d.). para. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Many picture brides worked on the plantations. In 1920 fourteen percent of the workers on the plantations were female, and of those female workers, eighty percent were Japanese.&lt;ref name="Takaki 1983. p. 78"&gt;Takaki (1983). p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; On the plantation they usually irrigated and weeded the fields, stripped cane of dry leaves, or cut seed cane.&lt;ref&gt;Bill (n.d.). para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Men were given similar tasks, but were often paid more. For example, in 1915 Japanese women plantation workers made 55 cents compared to the 78 cents made by their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="Takaki 1983. p. 78"/&gt; 

In addition to working in the fields the women also were expected to take care of the house, which included cooking, cleaning, sewing and raising the children.&lt;ref&gt;Bill (n.d.). para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; When a woman could not afford childcare she might work with her child on her back.&lt;ref name="Bill n.d.. para. 5"&gt;Bill (n.d.). para. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Some picture bride women with children left the fields to work for bachelor men by doing laundry, cooking, or providing clothing.&lt;ref name="Bill n.d.. para. 5"/&gt; Korean picture brides left plantation life sooner than many Japanese women did, and many moved to Honolulu to start their own businesses.&lt;ref name="Chai 1988. p. 56"&gt;Chai (1988). p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of whether they stayed on the plantation or not, it was important to the picture brides to build communities between themselves through women's groups and churches.&lt;ref&gt;Chai (1988). p. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with the practice==
Though initially unhappy, most of the picture brides eventually settled into their marriages or just accepted them so they did not shame their families.&lt;ref name="Yasutake 2004. p. 119"&gt;Yasutake (2004). p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese couples were often from similar areas of Japan and therefore had fewer marital issues than Korean couples who were often from different areas of Korea.&lt;ref name="Chai 1988. p. 56"/&gt; Though, there were exceptions to this, and not every marriage worked out. Some of the picture brides, after seeing their husbands for the first time, rejected them and went back to Japan or Korea.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 335"/&gt; Some married husbands turned out to be alcoholics, physically abusive, or tried to sell them into brothels, but many of these women nevertheless stayed in the marriage for the sake of the children.&lt;ref name="Fan 1996. p. 76"&gt;Fan (1996). p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a picture bride who stayed married to her husband, despite his mistreatment of her, was [[Shizuko Tamaki]]; she and her husband were married for 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Yamato Danley, "Japanese Picture Brides Recall Hardships of American Life," ''Los Angeles Times'', 11 May 1995 http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-11/news/cb-64865_1_picture-bride retrieved on 5 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Others who initially married did not end up staying with their husbands. These picture brides resorted to [[elopement]] with another man, or ''kakeochi'' in Japanese.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 234"&gt;Niiya (2001). p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elopement was especially hazardous to the picture brides because of its endangerment of their reputation and their residency in the United States.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 234"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yasutake (2004). P. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Wives who eloped could be deported to Japan, following the Japanese civil code that granted the husbands the ability to decide the new residency of their wife; for those women, the [[Women's Home Missionary Society]] in the United States provided temporary housing while they waited to go back to Japan.&lt;ref name="Lee 2003. p. 36"&gt;Lee (2003). p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to find their wives who had disappeared, the husbands of these women would take out reward ads in [[Issei]] community newspapers for whomever could find their wife.&lt;ref name="Yasutake 2004. p. 119"/&gt;

Many residents of America and Hawaii thought that the Gentlemen's Agreement would end Japanese immigration to the United States, so when vast numbers of picture brides started arriving, it revitalized the Anti-Japanese Movement.&lt;ref name="Niiya 2001. p. 335"/&gt; The people who were so against the immigration of the Japanese and picture brides were called exclusionists.&lt;ref&gt;Niiya (2001). p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; They called picture bride marriage uncivilized because it didn't involve love or have any regard to morality; exclusionists thought of picture bride marriage as a violation of the Gentlemen's Agreement, since they believed the women were more like workers rather than wives to the men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Exclusionists also feared that children produced from picture bride marriages would be a dangerous addition to the population because they would be able to buy land for their parents in the future.&lt;ref name="Fan 1996. p. 76"/&gt;  Also, some people, many immigrant inspectors included, thought that picture bride marriage was a disguise for a [[prostitution]] trade.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2003). p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, there was a negative sentiment toward picture brides in Hawaii and the United States.

==End of the practice==
In order to maintain positive relations with the United States, the Japanese government stopped issuing passports to picture brides on March 1, 1920, because they were so ill-received in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lee 2003. p. 36"/&gt;  The end of picture brides left around 24,000 bachelors with no way to return to Japan and bring back a wife.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2003). p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, picture brides and the gentlemen's agreement were able to create a second Japanese generation, [[Nisei]], consisting of 30,000 people in 1920.&lt;ref name="Lee 2003. p. 36"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1987, a [[novel]] titled ''Picture Bride'' was written by [[Yoshiko Uchida]], and tells the story of a fictional Japanese woman named Hana Omiya, a picture bride sent to live with her new husband in [[Oakland, California]] in 1917. The novel also focuses on her experiences in a Japanese [[Concentration camp|internment camp]] in 1943.

In 1994, a [[film|movie]] called ''[[Picture Bride (film)]]'' (unrelated to Uchida's novel) was made by Hawaii-born director [[Kayo Hatta]] and starred [[Youki Kudoh]] in the title role. The film tells the story of Riyo, a Japanese woman whose photograph exchange with a plantation worker leads her to Hawaii.

A 2003 Korean language book entitled ''Sajin Sinbu'' (Korean for "Picture Bride"), compiled by [[Park Nam Soo]], provides a thorough Korean/Korean-American cultural approach to the topic, providing a historical overview of the picture bride phenomenon in the Korean context, as well as related poetry, short stories, essays, and critical essays written by various Korean/Korean-American authors. The book was compiled for the [[Korean centennial]], marking the one-hundred-year [[anniversary]] of the first known arrival of Korean immigrants to U.S. territory in 1903 aboard {{RMS|Gaelic|1885|6}}.

A 2009 novel, Honolulu by [[Alan Brennert]] features a Korean picture bride coming to Hawaii.

A 2011 novel by Julie Otsuka titled "The Buddha in the Attic" tells the life of pictures brides brought from Japan to San Francisco about a century ago and what it means to be an American in uncertain times. The novel was a National Book Award for fiction finalist in 2011 and was short listed for 2013 Dublin IMPAC literary award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-2011|title=2011 National Book Awards, The National Book Foundation|website=www.nationalbook.org|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===
{{see|Data lineage}}
[[Scientific research]] is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow [[reproducibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Altintas, I.; Berkley, C.; Jaeger, E.; Jones, M.; Ludascher, B.; Mock S. (2004) "Kepler: An extensible system for design and execution of scientific workflows". ''Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management'', pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasquier|first1=Thomas|last2=Lau|first2=Matthew K.|last3=Trisovic|first3=Ana|last4=Boose|first4=Emery R.|last5=Couturier|first5=Ben|last6=Crosas|first6=Mercè|last7=Ellison|first7=Aaron M.|last8=Gibson|first8=Valerie|last9=Jones|first9=Chris R.|last10=Seltzer|first10=Margo|title=If these data could talk|journal=Scientific Data|date=5 September 2017|volume=4|pages=170114|doi=10.1038/sdata.2017.114|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017114|bibcode=2017NatSD...470114P}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific workflow system]]s assist scientists and programmers with tracking their data through all transformations, analyses, and interpretations. Data sets are reliable when the process used to create them are [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] and analyzable for defects.&lt;ref&gt;Boose, E.; Ellison, A.; Osterweil, L.; Clarke, L.; Podorozhny, R., Hadley, J.; Wise, A.; Foster, D. (2007) Ensuring reliable datasets for environmental models and forecasts. Ecological Informatics, 2(3):237–247&lt;/ref&gt; Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of data provenance. Examples of these initiatives are [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy, as well as the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]].&lt;ref name="Ma, et al."&gt;Ma, X.; Fox, P.; Tilmes, C.; Jacobs, K.; Waple, A. (2014) Capturing and presenting provenance of global change information. Nature Climate Change 4 (6), 409-413.&lt;/ref&gt; Some international academic consortia, such as the [[Research Data Alliance]], have specific group to tackle issues of provenance. In that case it is the Research Data Provenance Interest Group.&lt;ref&gt;https://rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-provenance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer science===
Within [[computer science]], [[Information science|informatics]] uses the term 'provenance'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Yu Shyang|last2=Ko|first2=Ryan K.L.|last3=Holmes|first3=Geoff|date=November 2013|title=Security and Data Accountability in Distributed Systems: A Provenance Survey|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832103/|journal=2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications &amp; 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.221|isbn=9780769550886}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the [[Data lineage|lineage of data]], as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipaw.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP).&lt;ref&gt;http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic web]] standards bodies, including the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the [[Proof Markup Language]] and the Open Provenance Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://openprovenance.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al. (2008) The Open Provenance Model: An Overview, in J. Freire, D. Koop, and L. Moreau (Eds.): IPAW 2008, LNCS 5272, pp. 323–326, 2008. Springer. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.7394&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM Vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, J. (2010) "[http://purl.org/net/opmv/ns Open Provenance Model Vocabulary Specification]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and the PROV Ontology&lt;ref&gt;Lebo et al. (eds.) "[https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ PROV-O: The PROV Ontology]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; make extensive use of metadata models such as [[Dublin Core]] and [[Semantic Web]] technologies such as the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). Current practice is to rely on the W3C PROV data model, OPM's successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khalidbelhajjame.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/w3c-prov-implementations/ "W3C PROV Implementations: Preliminary Analysis", Khalid Belhajjame, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

'''Public-benefit corporations''' are a specific type of corporation that allow for public benefit to be a charter purpose in addition to the traditional corporate goal of maximizing profit for shareholders.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gov-jack-markell/public-benefit-corporation_b_3635752.html|title=A New Kind of Corporation to Harness the Power of Private Enterprise for Public Benefit|last=Markell|first=Gov Jack|date=2013-07-22|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/10/11/benefit-corporations-californi/|title=California creates new corporation types that reward doing good (FAQ)|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the country they may also be known as crown corporations, [[statutory corporation]]s, or [[government owned corporation]]s having [[monopoly]] over a specific service or market.{{clarify|date=September 2015}}. 

The [[Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program]] may be given as an example of public benefit, coming from a governmental organization. 
Secondly, the model of a [[public utility]] corporation shall represent an example for the [[private sector]] of the economy.

A '''public authority''' is a type of public-benefit corporation that takes on a more bureaucratic role, such as the maintenance of public infrastructure, that often has broad powers to regulate or maintain public property.{{Citation needed lead|date=January 2011}} These agencies are known in some countries as statutory authorities, statutory boards, government owned corporations, regulatory agencies, [[QUANGO]] or independent government agencies.

Authorities borrow from both [[municipal corporation]] law (that is, the laws responsible for the creation of [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, and other forms of [[local government]]) and private corporations law. Other public-benefit corporations resemble private [[non-profit organization]]s, and take on roles that private corporations might otherwise perform. These corporations often operate in heavily [[regulation|regulated]] industries, such as [[broadcasting]] and [[transportation]].

Corporations such as these are often found in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s such as the Commonwealth countries and the United States.

==Origins==
Although corporations are now typically associated with private [[business]], historically corporations began as means to serve defined and limited public purposes. Corporation history has roots primarily in government subdivisions and religious institutions, where the institution itself is identifiable independently of its membership's [[death|mortality]]. For example, if the [[Pope]] dies, the [[Catholic Church]] continues to exist, just as it continues to exist as generations pass on and get replaced by new members.

Public-benefit corporations likely have their direct roots in [[Merchant capitalism|mercantile capitalism]]. In the [[Early modern period|early days]] of [[Europe]]an exploration and [[colonization]], a government or [[monarch]] would sometimes grant a [[charter]] to an entity defining a legal body ("corporation") and make potentially risky investments. While certainly not public-benefit corporations by today's standards, entities such as the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and the [[Dutch East India Company]] arguably are prototypical examples of publicly chartered (in this case, crown-chartered) corporations successfully undertaking defined activities with the support of privately contributed investments.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==History==
The modern era of delegation of government authority to a chartered corporation is marked by the United Kingdom [[Port of London|Port of London Authority]], established 1908.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  According to the [[Port of London Acts]] The Authority is a public trust established to "administer, preserve and improve the Port of London."  The goal was to create an entity that would be run self-sufficiently like a private company yet remain under the control of the government.  The name ''Authority'' is derived from the founding act of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] which repeatedly stated that ''"Authority is hereby given...."'' The special status of this entity and the fact that it remained subject to [[administrative law]] was established by the UK courts in ''[[R v Port of London Authority: ex parte Kynoch]]'' [1919] 1 KB 176.

==Incorporation and powers==

Public-benefit corporations are generally governed by boards of directors, which are appointed, rather than elected, and, internally, reflect [[bureaucratic]] forms.  The corporation is government-owned and performs a specific, narrow function for the public good.

Public-benefit corporations are most often created by [[statute]]. In many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[country|countries]], public-benefit corporations continue to receive charters from the [[Great Britain|British]] monarchy. In the United States, they receive their charters usually from states, but possibly from the federal government.

Public authorities are usually created with a specific mandate, such as the construction of bridges, [[mass transit]], etc.  Unlike [[Ministry (government department)|departments]] or ministries of the state, these corporations usually are enabled by [[statute]] to raise revenues through bond issues.

For more information, read below about individual jurisdictions.

==By location==
{{Globalize/West|date=June 2012}}

===United Kingdom===
The first reference to public-benefit corporations in [[United Kingdom]] law is in the [[Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003]], which established [[NHS Foundation Trust]]s as public-benefit corporations. Schedule 1 of the Act sets out the requirements for a public-benefit corporation which include a membership made up of individuals living in a specific area, employees of the corporation and service users, and a board of governors some of whom are elected by the members based on "constituencies" such as staff, users or public. British authorities have used other terms with similar functions to public-benefit corporations such as [[statutory authority]], [[QUANGO]] and [[crown corporation]].

Public-benefit corporations are distinguishable from public authorities in that the latter do not have a membership.

Examples of other bodies which have a similar role to, whilst not being formally called, public-benefit corporations include the [[BBC]], which is incorporated by [[royal charter]]. Many universities have charters going back centuries, and so are also chartered corporations.

===Canada===
[[Via Rail Canada|Via Rail]] in [[Canada]] is an independent [[crown corporation]] offering intercity passenger rail services in Canada. The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] is another example.

The [[Canadian Province|Province]] of [[Ontario]] shares two international public-benefit corporations with the U.S. state of New York:
* [[Peace Bridge Authority|Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority]] [http://www.peacebridge.com/] (also known as the Peace Bridge Authority) — international authority that maintains the [[Peace Bridge]] link between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]], [[Ontario]].
* [[Niagara Falls Bridge Commission]] [http://www.niagarafallsbridges.com/] — international public authority controlling various bridges in the [[Niagara Falls]]. The Board of Commissioners has eight members — four appointed by the Ontario Premier, and four by the Governor of New York State.

===Russia===
In Russia the law "On Noncommercial Organizations" describes the status state corporations. It is a special form of noncommercial [[partnership]] founded by the state to fulfill socially significant tasks. The activities of each corporation are described in a special federal law. Assets transferred to a state corporation are not state property from the legal point of view. Under the law "On Noncommercial Organizations", property transferred to as the investment in a partnership is the property of the partnership. The partnership itself is no one's property. It manages its assets as described in its charter. The rights of the founder are considerable in the partnership, but they are still not ownership rights. There is only one founder in a state corporation, and it is the Russian Federation. That is why the state corporation is independent. It is a set of assets that are managed for purposes established in its charter by managers appointed by the founder. State corporations, as a rule, are subordinate not to the government, but to the Russian president, and act to accomplish some important goal. The state corporations can manage those assets as demanded by the sketchily described goals and tasks of the charters and as allowed by the supervisory council, on which there is no one the president does not trust.

===United States===
The U.S. Constitution is silent about the Federal Government's creation of corporations; the power to define and create corporations (other than as agencies of the U.S. government) is mostly reserved to the individual states. The [[interstate commerce]] clause of the constitution gives implicit authority to create private federally chartered commercial corporations; the most numerous are federally chartered banks and similar financial institutions. The federal government has established certain corporations by an [[acts of Congress|act of Congress]], mostly non-profit organizations serving the public interest, such as the [[Civil Air Patrol]], as well as various charitable, fraternal, and veterans' organizations. In addition, certain [[parastatal]]s, which are for-profit, but may exercise unique powers, such as [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], have federal charters.

Private corporations were not common in the early United States, and were created by an act of a state legislature, typically for a public purpose, such as for the building and maintenance of a toll bridge or toll road or water utility.  Today private corporations may be created by simply filing appropriate documents with the appropriate department of a State.

Federal government public benefit corporations are often [[Independent agencies of the United States government]] as form of [[Government-owned corporation]]. Examples of federal public-benefit corporations created, owned and operated by the [[U.S. government]] include [[Amtrak]], the [[United States Postal Service]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. Many public authorities in the United States are [[interstate compact]]s or local and regional entities spanning multiple municipalities on the county or state level.

====California====
* [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]
* [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]]

California Corporation law designates three types of non-profit corporations — Religious Corporations (for example, a religious order might be incorporated as one of these), Mutual Benefit Corporations (a condominium association) and a Public Benefit Corporation (often things like hospitals or colleges). The assets of a public benefit corporation are irrevocably dedicated to its charitable purpose.  (Generally beginning in California Corporation Code at §5100 — https://web.archive.org/web/20120120002651/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&amp;group=05001-06000&amp;file=5110-5111)

Under California law a Public Benefit Corporation may be created by a public entity — as the two examples above suggest, but the definition in the California Codes is very specific.

====Colorado====
The Colorado General Assembly in House Bill 13-1138&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2013a/sl_230.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018122717/http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2013a/sl_230.htm |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for Public Benefit Companies. Section 7-101-503(2), C.R.S., defines public benefit as "one or more positive effects or reduction of negative effects on one or more categories of persons, entities, communities, or interests other than shareholders in their capacities as shareholders, including effects of an artistic, charitable, cultural, economic, educational, environmental, literary, medical, religious, scientific, or technological nature."

Ello is an example of a Colorado company which operates under the PBC laws.

====Delaware====
In July 2013, Governor Markell signed into law a new type of public benefit corporation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The General Corporation Law (Title 8, Chapter 1 of the Delaware Code) was recently amended by Senate Bill No. 47, effective August 1, 2013, adding a new subchapter XV, which authorizes the creation of Public Benefits Corporations.  As defined in the GCL, a PBC is a for-profit corporation intended to produce a public benefit and operate in a responsible and sustainable manner.  The PBC is to be managed in a manner that balances stockholders' pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation's conduct and the public benefit for which the PBC is formed.

In June 2015, Senate Bill No. 75 amended Delaware PBC rules to make it easier to form, operate or convert into a PBC, by facilitating the naming of PBCs, simplifying the issuance of stock options in PBCs and reducing the voting threshold for conversion from 90 percent to two-thirds of stockholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://global.delaware.gov/2015/06/29/important-amendments-made-to-delaware-general-corporation-law|title=Important amendments made to Delaware General Corporation Law|date=2015-06-29|website=Delaware Government|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kickstarter]] is also a public benefit corporation chartered in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/technology/kickstarters-altruistic-vision-profits-as-the-means-not-the-mission.html|title=Kickstarter Focuses Its Mission on Altruism Over Profit|last=Isaac|first=Mike|date=2015-09-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-03|last2=Gelles|first2=David|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minnesota====
The state of Minnesota has enacted a Public Benefit Corporation Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=304A&amp;view=chapter|title=304A - 2016 Minnesota Statutes|website=www.revisor.mn.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; effective January 2015. A Minnesota public benefit corporation is defined as an entity created under the state's business corporation statute, which "elects in its articles to pursue general public benefit...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=304A&amp;view=chapter#stat.304A.021.2|title=304A - 2016 Minnesota Statutes|website=www.revisor.mn.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "General public benefit," in turn, is defined as "a net material positive impact from the business and operations...on society, the environment, and the well-being of present and future generations."

====Missouri====
See ''[[Bi-State Development Agency]]''.

[[NJ Transit]], formed in 1979 operates bus, light rail and passenger rail service in New Jersey and in neighboring states as well as funding and planning of bus and rail services and programs.

Although "Public Benefit Corporation" is not a statutorily defined term under State laws (New Jersey Statutes or the [[New Jersey Administrative Code]]), such corporations are among those included within the statutorily defined term "State Agency".

====New York====
{{main|New York state public-benefit corporations}}
The widespread use of public authorities in the United States was pioneered in [[New York (state)|New York]] state by [[Robert Moses]]. New York likely has the most extensive number of public-benefit corporations in the country. The approval of the [[New York State Public Authorities Control Board]] is required in some cases when creating an authority. An authority may at times levy taxes and tolls; this means that they are not part of the usual state budgetary process, and gives them a certain independence. Their most admired ability by the New York State and local government, is to circumvent strict public debt limits in the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution]]. Furthermore, they may make [[contracts]]; because of public authorities' corporate status, there is generally no remedy against the chartering State for the breach of such contracts.&lt;ref&gt;''John Grace &amp; Co. v. State University Constr. Fund'', 44 N.Y.2d 84, 375 N.E.2d 377; 404 N.Y.S.2d 316 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, as agents of the state, public authorities are not subject to many laws governing private corporations, and are not subject to municipal regulation. Employees of public authorities usually are not state employees, but are employees of the authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Ciulla v. State'', 191 Misc. 528; 77 N.Y.S.2d 545; (NY Court of Claims, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Public authorities can also often condemn property.&lt;ref&gt;87 NY Jur PUBLIC AUTHORITIES Section 1 ''[[et seq]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the major public-benefit corporations in New York state are the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], a [[interstate compact|bistate authority]]; and the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], which manages most of the public transportation in and around [[New York City]].

====North Carolina====
* [[North Carolina Turnpike Authority]]
* [[North Carolina State Ports Authority]]
* [[North Carolina Hospital Authority]]

====Oregon====
Articles of incorporation may be filed listing the new entity as a Public Benefit company.  Existing companies may be converted to Public Benefit. A checklist of requirements can be found at the Oregon Secretary of State, Public Benefit Corporation Page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sos.oregon.gov/business/Pages/benefit-company.aspx|title=Oregon Secretary of State: File to Become a Benefit Company|website=sos.oregon.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tennessee====
Tennessee is arguably the banner state for the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s (TVA's) operations, which span a region extending into seven states (most of Tennessee and parts of six others), but the TVA is actually a federally owned public authority. The TVA has been key in aiding the region's economic development, most notably in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]]{{Dubious|date=November 2008}}.

====Texas====
* [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas]]
* [[Port of Houston]]

====Vermont====
Like [[Maine]], the state of [[Vermont]] defines public-benefit corporations broadly. They include public-benefit corporations founded by the state and by private entities. The [[Vermont Economic Development Authority]][http://www.veda.org/] is an example of a state-owned public-benefit corporation.

====Washington====
* [[Port of Seattle]]
* [[Sound Transit]]
* [[Public transportation benefit area]]s

==Other meanings==

More broadly, a public-benefit corporation could be any corporation that exists for a charitable purpose, though these are generally called [[Non-profit organization|non-profit corporations]] if they are not founded by a government. Some jurisdictions (the [[U.S. State]] of [[Maine]], for instance) might define a public-benefit corporation broadly. In [[California]], public-benefit corporations are one of several types of non-profit corporations.

'''''Reno 911!''''' is an American [[television comedy|comedy]] television series on [[Comedy Central]] that ran from 2003 to 2009. It is a [[mockumentary]]-style parody of law enforcement [[documentary television series|documentary]] shows, specifically ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'', with comic actors playing the [[police officer]]s. Most of the material is [[improvisational comedy|improvised]], using a broad outline with minimal scripted material. The series spawned a film, ''[[Reno 911!: Miami]]'', featuring the same cast. [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]], [[Robert Ben Garant]] and [[Kerri Kenney-Silver]] all starred in and are billed as creators of the series.

==Premise==
The show is a direct [[satire]] of the iconic [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Television]] series, ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'' (which follows actual police officers through their daily duties, such as chasing criminals, and intervening in domestic disputes). ''Reno 911!'' features members of the fictitious, massively inept "Reno Sheriff's Department"—distinct from the actual Reno Police Department, and, Washoe County Sheriff's Office, both of which are absent from the series (although Comedy Central has repeatedly referenced the series as being about the "men and women of the Washoe County Sheriff's Department").&lt;ref name="CCReno911Homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.com/shows/reno-911- |title=Reno 911 |author=Comedy Central |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628022011/http://www.cc.com/shows/reno-911- |archive-date=2018-06-28 |accessdate=2018-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of their duties patrolling both the city of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and the rest of [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], [[Nevada]], the deputies sometimes address the camera directly (as though being interviewed for a documentary). The show deals heavily in [[politically incorrect]] and racy humor, including many jokes about [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], [[substance abuse]], [[rape]], [[pedophilia]], and [[mental disorder]]s. Another main comedic aspect of the show is the outlandishly severe incompetence of the deputies—often resulting in their being outsmarted by the criminals they are attempting to control.
[[File:Orpheus RENO 911 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Lennon and Kenney-Silver in character at Mardi Gras]]
Only the basic plot elements of the show are scripted, while the dialogue is [[improvisational comedy|improvised]]—enhancing the illusion of reality (a practice referred to as [[retroscripting]]). Unlike ''Cops'', which the show parodies, ''Reno 911!'' Sheriff's deputies are constantly cursing, causing much of their dialogue to be censored for broadcast.  The actors often perform their own stunts.  A constantly changing cast of weirdos, prostitutes, homeless persons, survivalists, political figures, celebrities, etc. are portrayed by comedian friends of the primary cast, and the cast themselves, while disguising their voices and general appearance (and, whose faces were blurred in the style of ''Cops'').

The show's characters occasionally refer to their own program. They insist that the show's producers told them the videotaped [[footage]] was going to be used for a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Television]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] series titled ''Heroes on Patrol''; and, often stated in frustration, that they have no control over what is aired, and that the show only seems to capture their 'moments' of incompetence.  The many "good" incidents, they allege, are left out of the (show-within-a-show's) final edit. Also, some suspects in the show refer to the film crew, and the program being aired on television; occasionally, they will attempt to get arrested just to be on TV.

==Development history==
In Thomas Lennon's words, ''Reno 911!'' came about, "like the best of ideas, through total desperation."&lt;ref name="tsoya"&gt;[[The Sound of Young America]]: [http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2008/05/podcast-reno-911s-stars-and-creators.html Interview with Thomas Lennon, Robert Ben Garant, and Kerri Kenney-Silver, May 22, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of ''[[Viva Variety]]'', ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'' alumni worked on a series of pilots for Fox Television, one of which, after a year's worth of dedicated writing, was terminated the day before shooting. It was scheduled to begin in the fall of 2000.&lt;ref name="tsoya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutcom"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Topel| first = Fred| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = One on One with Cedric Yarbrough| work = | publisher = about.com| year = 2007| url = http://movies.about.com/od/reno911miami/a/reno911cy021607.htm| doi = | accessdate = April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a month left before the pilot was expected to be due (and half of the budget still unused), the team asked if they could produce another pilot with the remaining resources, and the Fox executives agreed.  Working quickly to take advantage of this, the initial ''Reno 911!'' pilot was conceived and shot in five days.&lt;ref name="tsoya" /&gt; [[Cedric Yarbrough]], who had been hired for the cast of the canceled pilot, said that the cast was advised to "come up with [their] own characters" and return for filming.&lt;ref name="aboutcom" /&gt;

As originally written, the sheriff's department material would have served as link material between traditional comedy sketches; the canceled project was being considered for the Fox Saturday lineup, and the team thought at the time that the ''Cops'' format was a natural framework for sketch comedy.  However, during the shooting—and especially the editing—they realized the police element was more interesting than the sketches, and the finished pilot was, according to Robert Ben Garant, "remarkably similar" to the series that eventually aired.&lt;ref name="tsoya" /&gt; Nevertheless, Fox turned down the completed pilot. According to Lennon, their decision not to pick the show up was influenced by a scene, preserved in the eventual Comedy Central pilot, involving Lt. Dangle passionately kissing a man. It was another two years before Comedy Central greenlit the project.&lt;ref name="aboutcom" /&gt;

==Production==
The establishing shots for the show were filmed in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], and everything else was filmed in [[Carson, California]], and some parts of [[Oregon]].  Many of the main scenes of the show were shot over the course of many hours, such as the briefing room scenes.  According to the [[DVD]] commentary for season three, all morning briefing scenes for a season may be filmed on one 10-hour day with different basic plot elements to be used in different episodes.  Actors would contribute their dialogue as they were inspired to do so.

The show was continued for two additional seasons with [[Comedy Central]] running a special of the show titled ''Reno 911!: Off Duty'' on March 21, 2004.  The fourth season began on July 9, 2006 and comprised 14 episodes. Comedy Central aired the first seven in the fall of 2006 and the last seven in the spring of 2007. Also in early 2007, a theatrical film based upon the series entitled ''[[Reno 911!: Miami]]'' was released in North America, featuring the complete TV series cast. The Season Four spring debut drew 1.3 million viewers during the week of March 26 to April 1, 2007. Excess footage from season three was used in season four.

On October 9, 2006, Comedy Central confirmed 13 new episodes to make up ''Reno 911!'' Season Five, though the season actually contained 16 episodes. Production of Season Five started in January and wrapped up in April. ''Reno 911!'' Season Five premiered on January 16, 2008.  On March 27, 2007, [[WGN America|Superstation WGN]] acquired the first four seasons of the half-hour comedy for a two-year run. The syndicated ''Reno 911!'' is a part of their late night comedy block. Reruns are syndicated to broadcast stations. In 2007, Lennon and Garant later appeared in-character on a comedy compilation CD, ''[[Comedy Death-Ray (album)|Comedy Death-Ray]]'', released on September 11, singing a song about why not to use drugs.

On November 10, 2008, Comedy Central confirmed 10 new episodes to make up ''Reno 911!'' Season Six, the final season. Principal photography was done between November and December 2008. [[Carmen Electra]] was a guest star on an episode filmed December 5, 2008 at [[Grant High School (Los Angeles, California)|Grant High School]] in Los Angeles. Season Six premiered on April 1, 2009 on Comedy Central. Season Six consisted of fifteen episodes.  Cast members Carlos Alazraqui, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Mary Birdsong did not return for the final season and their characters' absence was explained as fatalities from an explosion in the Season Five finale.  In addition, actors [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]] and [[Joe Lo Truglio]] were added to the principal cast as Sergeant Jack Declan and Deputy Frank Salvatore Rizzo, respectively.

On August 13, 2009, Thomas Lennon announced through Twitter that the show had ended its six-year run.&lt;ref name="Comedy Central Cancels Reno"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/comedy-central-cancels-reno-911-52072 Comedy Central Cancels "Reno"], ''Hollywood Reporter'', August 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the cancellation, residents and officials of [[Reno, Nevada]] petitioned to save the show.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;Jayne Clark. [https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2009-08-27-save-reno-911_N.htm "'Reno 911!': The city it mocks tries to save it,"] ''USA Today''. August 27, 2009. Retrieved 2010-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discussed Netflix revival===
In October 2011, a story broke that the producers of ''Reno 911!'' were in negotiations with the popular internet streaming website [[Netflix]] to revive the cancelled [[Comedy Central]] series.&lt;ref name="Netflix looking to revive Reno 911!"&gt;[http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2011/10/09/netfix_looking_to_revive_reno_911 Netflix looking to revive Reno 911!], "Afterdawn.com", October 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The main reason ''Reno 911!''{{'}}s producers wanted to revive the show was because only 88 episodes were produced, the producers and syndicating networks would have liked for the show to hit the 100 episode milestone.&lt;ref name="Netflix wants to Make New Episodes of Reno 911!"&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2011/10/netflix_brings_back_reno_911.html Netflix wants to Make New Episodes of Reno 911!], "Vulture.com"&lt;/ref&gt;  However, at the time, Comedy Central, who still held sole rights to the show, had not been involved in any negotiations.  As well, [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and [[Robert Ben Garant]] were attached to other projects.

The '''School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution''' (S-CAR) is a division of [[George Mason University]] based near [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]] with locations in Arlington, Fairfax, and Lorton, Virginia.

== History ==
S-CAR was founded in 1981 as the Center for Conflict Analysis, later named the Center for Conflict Analysis and Resolution (CCAR) and began offering a master's degree in Conflict Analysis and Resolution in 1983.  In 1988 it became the first academic institution to grant PhD's in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and rose to the status of Institute, becoming ICAR in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scar.gmu.edu/newsletter-subject/icar-then-and-now-institute-turns-25-years-old |title=ICAR Then and Now: The Institute Turns 25 Years Old |publisher=S-CAR News, Special Issue: Point of View |date=February 2008|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, after a decade of growth and development, including the introduction of the undergraduate program and graduate certificate programs, it became the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution (S-CAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scar.gmu.edu/newsletter-subject/icar-becomes-school-reflections-past-and-looking-future |title=ICAR Becomes a School: Reflections on the past and looking to the future |publisher=S-CAR News, Volume 5, Issue 1 |date=February 2011|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sign''' is an [[Physical body|object]], [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], event, or [[entity]] whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, [[thunder]] is a sign of storm, or medical [[symptom]]s signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a [[full stop]] signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a [[language]], as well as bodily [[gesture]]s, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, [[road sign]]s, etc., collectively known as [[signage]]) generally inform or instruct using [[written text]], [[symbol]]s, [[picture]]s or a combination of these.

The philosophical study of signs and [[symbol]]s is called [[semiotics]]; this includes the study of [[semiosis]], which is the way in which [[sign (semiotics)|signs (in the semiotic sense)]] operate.

==Nature==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[Semiotics]], [[epistemology]], logic, and [[philosophy of language]] are concerned about the nature of signs, what they are and how they signify.  The nature of signs and symbols and significations, their definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to these classic sources, significance is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they signify (intend, express or mean), where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. Distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs, the traditional theory of signs ([[Augustine]]) sets the following threefold partition of things:
all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals, there are signs which are ''always'' signs (the entities of the mind as ideas and images, thoughts and feelings, constructs and intentions); and there are signs that ''have'' to get their signification (as linguistic entities and cultural symbols). So, while natural signs serve as the source of signification, the human mind is the agency through which signs signify naturally occurring things, such as objects, states, qualities, quantities, events, processes, or relationships. Human [[language]] and [[discourse]], [[communication]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]], [[theology]], and [[religion]] are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of signification may have a decisive value. Communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols; They communicate/pass across/ messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation.

== Christianity ==

===St. Augustine and signs===
[[St. Augustine]] was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. For him a sign is a thing which is used to signify other things and to make them come to mind (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (hereafter DDC) 1.2.2; 2.1.1). The most common signs are spoken and written words (DDC 1.2.2; 2.3.4-2.4.5). Although God cannot be fully expressible, Augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of God’s communication with humans by signs in Scripture (DDC 1.6.6).  Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.  Among the mainstream in the theories of signs, i.e., that of Aristotle and that of Stoics, the former theory filtered into the works of Cicero (106-43 BC, ''De inventione rhetorica'' 1.30.47-48) and Quintilian (circa 35-100, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 5.9.9-10), which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference.  In his commentary on Aristotle’s ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius said, "according to the division of the philosopher Theophrastus, the relation of speech is twofold, first in regard to the audience, to which speech signifies something, and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience." If we match DDC with this division, the first part belongs to DDC Book IV and the second part to DDC Books I-III. Augustine, although influenced by these theories, advanced his own theological theory of signs, with whose help one can infer the mind of God from the events and words of Scripture.

Books II and III of DDC enumerate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them. Signs are divided into natural (''naturalia'') and conventional (''data''); the latter is divided into animal (''bestiae'') and human (''homines''); the latter is divided into non-words (''cetera'') and words (''verba''); the latter is divided into spoken words (''voces'') and written words (''litterae''); the latter is divided into unknown signs (''signa ignota'') and ambiguous signs (''signa ambigua''); both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs (''signa propria'') and figurative signs (''signa translata''), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans.
In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (''lectio''), textual criticism (''emendatio''), explanation (''enarratio''), and judgment (''iudicium''),  one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).

Augustine’s understanding of signs includes several hermeneutical presuppositions as important factors. First, the interpreter should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC 2.41.62). Second, the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to Christian learning,  because all truth is God’s truth (DDC 2.40.60-2.42.63). Third, the heart of interpreter should be founded, rooted, and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire Scriptures (DDC 2.42.63).

The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (''res significans'', DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of "scriptura scripturae interpres" (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine's hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

A '''simulacrum''' ([[plural]]: '''simulacra''' from {{lang-la|simulacrum}}, which means "likeness, similarity") is a representation or imitation of a person or thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Word of the Day |date=1 May 2003 |publisher=dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217130815/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |archivedate=17 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god. By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original.&lt;ref&gt;"simulacrum" ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Fredric Jameson]] offers [[photorealism]] as an example of artistic simulacrum, where a painting is sometimes created by copying a photograph that is itself a copy of the real.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"&gt;Massumi, Brian.

==Philosophy==
Simulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', [[Plato]] speaks of two kinds of image making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek statuary]], which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a [[metaphor]] for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plato |title=The Sophist |others=Translated by Benjamin Jowett |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |chapter=Reason in Philosophy |title=Twilight of the Idols |others=Translated by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale |year=1888 |url=http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426104633/http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |archivedate=26 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodernism/Philosophy|Postmodernist]] French [[social theorist]] [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]. Where Plato saw two types of representation—faithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)—Baudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Simulacra and Simulations"&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html Baudrillard Simulacra] retrieved 2 May 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=9 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, [[Gilles Deleuze]], takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] or "privileged position" could be "challenged and overturned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deleuze |first=Gilles |title=Difference and Repetition |others=Translated by Paul Patton |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=Columbia |year=1968 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze defines simulacra as "those systems in which different relates to different ''by means of'' difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no ''prior [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]'', no ''internal resemblance''".&lt;ref&gt;p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]], in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |title=Ethics - An Essay on the Understanding of Evil|others=Translated by Peter Hallward |publisher=Verso |location=London |year=2001 |pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')".

==Recreation==
Recreational simulacra include [[historical reenactment|reenactments of historical events]] or replicas of landmarks, such as [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]], and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as [[Fantasyland]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. The various Disney parks have by some philosophers been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra, with Baudrillard noting that [[Walt Disney World Resort]] is a copy of a copy, "a simulacrum to the second power".&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. transl. Francois Debrix. Liberation. 4 March 1996. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ "Disneyworld Company."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152759/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ |date=27 May 2010 }} retrieved 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] argued that at Disney's parks, "we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto. ''Travels in Hyperreality.'' Reproduced in relevant portion at
[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html "The City of Robots"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912200642/http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html |date=12 September 2006 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is for some an ongoing concern. Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of [[national park]]s, [[Disney's Wilderness Lodge]], environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and [[anthropologist]] Eric Higgs expressed worry that "the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value".&lt;ref&gt;Cypher, Jennifer and Eric Higgs. [http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html "Colonizing the Imagination: Disney's Wilderness Lodge".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704185846/http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html |date=4 July 2007 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist [[Paul McCarthy]] has created entire installations based on ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation.

==Caricature==
An interesting example of simulacrum is [[caricature]]. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject.

==Iconography==
Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;11) employs the term "simulacrum" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether [[iconic]] or [[aniconic]], in the landscape or greater field of [[Thangka]] art and Tantric Buddhist [[iconography]]. For example, an iconographic [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a [[sacred mountain]] in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an "auspicious canopy" (Sanskrit: [[Chhatra]]) of the [[Ashtamangala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Robert |year=1999 |title=The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs |publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-57062-416-2 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] approach a [[cultural universal]] and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the [[human psychology]].

==Word usage==
The Latinised plural ''simulacra'' is interchangeable with the anglicised version ''simulacrums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |title=simulacrum |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712155454/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |archivedate=12 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sportswear''' or '''activewear''' is [[clothing#Sport and activity|clothing]], including [[footwear#Shoes|footwear]], worn for [[sport]] or [[physical exercise]]. Or it can be a crop top.

Sport-specific clothing is worn for most sports and physical  exercise, for practical, comfort or safety reasons.

Typical sport-specific garments include [[tracksuit]]s, [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s and [[polo shirt]]s. Specialized garments include [[swimsuit#Competitive swimwear|swimsuits]] (for [[human swimming|swimming]]), [[wet suit]]s (for [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[ski suit]]s (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Sports footwear include [[athletic shoe|trainers]], [[football boot]]s, [[riding boot]]s, and [[ice skate]]s. Sportswear also includes [[bikini]] and some [[crop tops]] and
[[undergarments]], such as the [[jockstrap]] and [[sports bra]]. Sportswear is also at times worn as [[casual attire|casual]] [[fashion]] clothing.

For most sports the athletes wear a combination of different items of clothing, e.g. [[sport shoe]]s, [[trousers|pants]] and [[shirt]]s. In some sports, protective gear may need to be worn, such as [[helmet]]s or [[American football]] body armour.

Sports fabrics are technical materials which help to keep the wearer comfortable during exercise. The type of fabric required will depend upon the intensity of the exercise and the activity. [[Yoga pants|Yoga clothing]] should use fabrics with good stretch ability for easy movement which will likely require the fabric to be of a knitted construction. Apparel for long distance running will keep the wearer in good comfort if it has excellent moisture wicking properties to enable sweat to transfer from the inside to the outside for the garment. Performance clothing for outdoor sports in the winter or snow sports ought to use breathable fabrics with very good insulating properties.

==Functional considerations==
[[File:Messi FC BARCELONA - ARSENAL 8 MAR 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Male football players of opposite teams wearing different colour outfits, while the referee is in white T-shirt.]]

Sportswear is typically designed to be lightweight so as not to encumber the wearer. The best athletic wear for some forms of exercise, for example [[cycling]], should not create drag or be too bulky.

On the other hand, sportswear should be loose enough so as not to restrict movement. Some sports have specific style requirements, for example the [[keikogi]] used in [[karate]]. Various physically dangerous sports require protective gear, e.g. for fencing, American football, or ice hockey.

Standardized sportswear may also function as a uniform. In team sports the opposing sides are usually identified by the colors of their clothing, while individual team members can be recognized by a back number on a shirt.

In some sports, specific items of clothing are worn to differentiate roles within a team. For example, in [[volleyball]], the [[volleyball#libero|libero]] (a specialist in defensive play) wears a different colour to that of their teammates. In sports such as [[soccer]] and [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] codes, a contrasting colour or pattern is worn by the goalkeeper. In other sports, clothing may indicate the current status or past achievements of a participant. In cycling disciplines, the [[rainbow jersey]] indicates the current world champion, and in major road cycling races, [[cycling jersey|jersey]]s of particular colours are worn by the race leader and leaders of auxiliary classifications.

[[Spandex]] is the preferred material for [[form-fitting]] sportswear, such as used in wrestling, [[track &amp; field]], dance, gymnastics, [[speed skating]], and [[Human swimming|swimming]].

Sportswear is commonly used as a means for the promotion of sponsors of a sportsperson or team. In some sports, there are regulations limiting the size or design of sponsorship brand names and logos on items of clothing.

==Thermal properties==
Sportswear design must consider the [[thermal insulation]] needs of the wearer. In hot situations, sportswear should allow the wearer to stay cool; while in cold situations, sportswear should help the wearer to stay warm.

Sportswear should also be able to transfer sweat away from the skin, using, for example, moisture transferring fabric. [[Spandex]] is a popular material used as base layers to soak up sweat. For example, in activities such as [[skiing]] and [[mountain climbing]] this is achieved by using layering: moisture transferring (wicking) materials are worn next to the skin, followed by an insulating layer, and then wind and water resistant shell garments.

==Moisture-wicking fabrics==
[[File:MoistureTransferringFabric.jpg|thumb|left|Moisture transferring fabric]]
Moisture-wicking fabrics are a class of hi-tech fabrics that provide moisture control for an athlete's skin. They move perspiration away from the body to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate. These fabrics typically are soft, lightweight, and stretchy—in other words, they are perfectly suited for making activewear. Moisture-wicking means that the fabric is absorbent and this can leave a barrier of wet fabric on your skin. Drywicking is the newest variation of moisture wicking. It is a smart two tier fabric that breaks the surface tension of sweat and propels it through the hydrophobic layer into a natural wicking outer layer like cotton where it is assisted by evaporative cooling leaving your skin absolutely dry. Besides the fact that your body can perform better, it will chemically free prevent odors because a bacteria microclimate cannot grow on dry skin. This broad category of fabrics is used to make garments like T-shirts, sports bras, running and cycling jerseys, socks, tracksuits, and polo-style shirts for any physical activity where the goal is to keep your skin as cool and dry as possible. Moisture-wicking fabrics are used to make apparel for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, mountain biking, snow skiing, and mountain climbing. Due to the popularity of garments made from these fabrics, more variations are being introduced to the market.

==Golf attire==
Golf has a long tradition of specialized attire—attire that reflects the tradition of Scottish aristocrats taking in fresh air while walking around the golf course, swinging their golf clubs, and exercising in a refined, genteel sort of way.  Golf attire though, is also being influenced by modern fabrics and trends that stress function and durability.  Golfers, like athletes in other sports, are athletes first, and public figures second.  Athletes in all sports are showing a preference for moisture-wicking fabrics, crisp details, and modern fashionable colors.

==Sales trends for activewear==
[[File:Keeping Fit and Connected (6635665267) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A woman wearing [[sports bra]] and [[boyshorts]], which were conventionally women's sportswear but are now also worn as [[Casual attire|casuals]] or [[athleisure]] by women in the West.]]

As activewear becomes more fashionable and more popular with consumers, sales have increased.  Total U.S. sales of men's and women's activewear rose by 3.2% in the 12 months ending in March 2011 compared with the previous period, to $48.6 billion, according to consumer tracking firm NPD Group Inc.&lt;ref name=crainsnewyork1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasquarelli|first=Adrianne|title=Activewear makes it onto the runway|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110710/SUB/307109990|work=Crain's New York Business|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all of 2011, activewear sales increased 6.7% from 2010, compared with women's apparel gains in 2011 of 3.1%, also according to NPD Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2012-10-15/business/34479799_1_lululemon-athletica-sales-associates-chicago-marathon |title=Activewear sales up - South Bend Tribune |publisher=Articles.southbendtribune.com |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts attribute the growth in sales to an intrinsic change in the way activewear is designed.  “Historically, what had been available to women were items based on a men's item that were just made smaller and turned a flattering color like pink,” said Scott Key, senior vice president and general manager of Athleta. “Women athletes expected more.” 
&lt;ref name="crainsnewyork1"/&gt;  Designers have recognized this "crossover" between exercise and fashion as a major opportunity for growth. It also syncs nicely with the overall trend in American fashion towards a more casual style of dress. The trend has been so popular that it has spawned a new category of casual clothing, [[athleisure]].  [[Rebecca Minkoff]] is one of the fashion designers who has an entire collection designed around the athleisure concept.

== Protective wear ==

Sportswear also includes the variety of protective gear required for contact sports such as lacrosse, boxing and ice hockey. Different types of protective equipment are needed depending on the type of sport and position. The types of gears include the following: head gear, gum shields, shin pads, shoulder pads, and joint supports.

=== Head gear ===

Head gear is required for most sports with high risk of head injuries such as [[American football]], [[Bobsleigh|bobsledding]] and [[cycling]]. Injuries related to the head have the potential to cause serious damage to the spine and may be life-threatening.&lt;ref name="nsmi2"&gt;Protective wear during sport - sports injury prevention. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from Sports Medicine Information, http://www.nsmi.org.uk/articles/injury-prevention/protective-wear.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although sports like rugby and boxing do not require participants to wear head protection, trainers or referees may choose to depending on the player’s history of head related injuries.&lt;ref name="nsmi2" /&gt; Certain positions of some sports may require different type of protections. For example, goaltenders for ice hockey wear different types of face masks compared to other positions.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Helmets: How they work and what standards do. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from http://www.helmets.org/general.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They also have thick gloves with arm pads and shin guards to protect them from the high impact of pucks. In baseball, catchers and batters wear head gear for protection against the high velocity pitches. Head gear of different kinds must meet the standards of protection set by various organizations. [[Helmet]]s for American football must be regulated by the National Football League or the National Collegiate Athletics Association. Although new rules of safe play have been in effect, players are still in danger of brain damage due to repeated blows to the head.&lt;ref name="nsmi2" /&gt; Football players are more likely to develop brain related disorders during or after their careers compared to other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/health/study-focuses-on-repeated-hits-not-concussions.html|title=Study Focuses on Repeated Hits, Not Concussions|last=Carey|first=Benedict|date=2016-03-31|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eye and face shields ===
Sports of all types may require eye or face protection depending on the players’ need. Face masks come in different forms for different types of sports. In lacrosse and American football, the masks are metal rods attached to the helmet to cover the face.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; While optional, face masks that might be seen in basketball or rugby are plastic masks that are usually molded to fit the players’ face.&lt;ref&gt;Protective eyewear for young athletes - 2013 (2013). American Academy of Ophthalmology. Retrieved from http://www.aao.org/clinical-statement/protective-eyewear-young-athletes--november-2003&lt;/ref&gt; Such masks are worn to minimize additional damage to an already injured part of the face.

Eye protection is an additional support provided by sports goggles. Goggles may be worn in lieu of glasses or contacts. Goggles are reliable in the fact that they do not move around while the player is in motion and they protect the eye from foreign objects.&lt;ref&gt;Sports and your eyes. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from National Eye Institute, https://nei.nih.gov/sports&lt;/ref&gt; For swimmers and divers, goggles keep the water away from their eyes, thus improving visibility.

=== Mouth guards ===
Mouth guards are used in many sports including but not limited to: [[rugby football|rugby]], lacrosse, boxing, water polo, ice hockey, American football, basketball, field hockey, and various martial arts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Mouth guards reduce the risk of sport related dental injuries. Contact or some team sports have a risk of causing injuries related with the mouth, [[jaw]], teeth and oral soft [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Wearing mouth guards are not required in any sports but the players are recommended to.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Mouthguards. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from American Dental Association, http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/mouthguards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Snow gear and ski apparel ==
[[File:Vonn-lindsey 15-12-07 - 007.jpg|thumb|left|Professional USA ski racer [[Lindsey Vonn]] dressed for a race.]]
Different types of attire are needed for extreme weather conditions like snow. Thicker coats or jackets, gloves and boots are necessities in the cold. Winter sports such as snowboarding and skiing require the riders and skiers to be properly geared in the snow. Snow jackets differ from casual coats such that they may be packed with extra insulation and thicker coating materials.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; The insulation is usually made with down, which is the layer of fine feathers from geese or ducks.&lt;ref name="berry2"&gt;Berry, G. (2011, December 28). A guide to insulated winter jackets that are not made with down. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from One Green Planet, http://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/a-guide-to-insulated-winter-jackets-that-are-not-made-with-down/&lt;/ref&gt; These feathers are naturally insulated to keep the birds warm in the harsh winter weathers. The feathers trap air inside and keep the body heat from flowing out.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; Down is also considered to be the highest quality of insulation for jackets. It is light and compressible. Alternative types of insulation are being invented including: synthetic microfibers and polyester-based insulation.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; These materials perform as well as down if not better and are becoming popular in the markets with the help of major brands using such materials for their equipment.

Winter gear must also be flexible so that it may offer a wide range of movement. An ideal jacket would have enough insulation to be warm but light, it should be made with material that are not restricting.&lt;ref name="porter2"&gt;Porter, J. (2016). How to choose the best ski jacket. Retrieved March 31, 2016, from http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Ski-Jacket-Reviews/Buying-Advice&lt;/ref&gt; Jackets with down will be light and warm but they tend to be more expensive. Also down jackets usually are not water-resistant. Synthetic insulated jackets, however, are water-resistant and cheaper than down but lose their insulating factors and are heavier.&lt;ref name="porter2" /&gt;

In the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], the variety of equipment used contain materials such as aluminum, fiberglass, mineral-based fibers and specialty steel alloys. Skis and snowboards are made up of carbon-fiber, aluminum, titanium and boron-fiber with tungsten alloys. Boots are made with ceramic fibers and steel.&lt;ref&gt;Olympics 2014: Let the Science Begin!

'''Stuxnet''' is a [[Malware|malicious]] [[computer worm]], first uncovered in 2010. Thought to have been in development since at least 2005, Stuxnet targets [[SCADA]] systems and is believed to be responsible for causing substantial damage to [[Iran's nuclear program]]. Although neither country has openly admitted responsibility, the worm is believed to be a jointly built [[United States|American]]/[[Israel]]i [[cyberweapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/confirmed-us-israel-created-stuxnet-lost-control-of-it/|title=Confirmed: US and Israel created Stuxnet, lost control of it|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/stuxnet-was-work-of-us-and-israeli-experts-officials-say/2012/06/01/gJQAlnEy6U_story.html|title=Stuxnet was work of U.S. and Israeli experts, officials say|author=Ellen Nakashima|date=2 June 2012|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuxnet specifically targets [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or [[Laboratory centrifuge|centrifuges]] for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four [[Zero-day attack|zero-day flaws]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/stuxnet-attackers-used-4-windows-zero-day-exploits/7347 |title=Stuxnet attackers used 4 Windows zero-day exploits|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system and networks, then seeking out [[Siemens]] Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kushner|first=David|title=The Real Story of Stuxnet|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-real-story-of-stuxnet/|work=ieee.org|publisher=IEEE Spectrum|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuxnet’s design and architecture are not domain-specific and it could be tailored as a platform for attacking modern [[supervisory control and data acquisition|supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)]] and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), the majority of which reside in Europe, [[Japan]] and the US.&lt;ref&gt;S.

Stuxnet has three modules: a [[Computer worm|worm]] that executes all routines related to the main payload of the attack; a [[File shortcut|link file]] that automatically executes the propagated copies of the worm; and a [[rootkit]] component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes, preventing detection of the presence of Stuxnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/us/webattack/54/STUXNET%20Malware%20Targets%20SCADA%20Systems |title=STUXNET Malware Targets SCADA Systems|publisher=Trend Micro|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected [[USB flash drive]], thereby crossing any [[Air gap (networking)|air gap]]. The worm then propagates across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC. In the absence of either criterion, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer. If both the conditions are fulfilled, Stuxnet introduces the infected rootkit onto the PLC and Step7 software, modifying the codes and giving unexpected commands to the PLC while returning a loop of normal operations system values feedback to the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104|title=A Declaration of Cyber-War|work=Vanity Fair|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/exploring-stuxnet-s-plc-infection-process|title=Exploring Stuxnet’s PLC Infection Process|publisher=Symantec|date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Kaspersky Lab]] noted that the [[Equation Group]] had used two of the same zero-day attacks, prior to their use in Stuxnet, and commented that: "the similar type of usage of both exploits together in different computer worms, at around the same time, indicates that the Equation Group and the Stuxnet developers are either the same or working closely together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf |title=Equation Group Questions and Answers |website=securelist.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217023145/https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf |archivedate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
Stuxnet, discovered by Sergey Ulasen, initially spread via Microsoft Windows, and targeted Siemens [[industrial control system]]s. While it is not the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems,&lt;ref name="Siemans-Cyber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totallyintegratedautomation.com/2010/09/building-a-cyber-secure-plant/|publisher=Siemens|title=Building a Cyber Secure Plant|accessdate=5 December 2010 | date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor the first publicly known intentional act of [[cyberwarfare]] to be implemented, it is the first discovered [[malware]] that spies on and subverts industrial systems,&lt;ref name=compworld /&gt; and the first to include a [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC) [[rootkit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2010/abstracts/indepth-look-stuxnet|title=Last-minute paper: An indepth look into Stuxnet|publisher=Virus Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11414483|title=Stuxnet worm hits Iran nuclear plant staff computers|publisher=BBC News | date=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the PBS program ''[[Need to Know (PBS)|Need To Know]]'' cited a statement by [[Gary Samore]], White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, in which he said, "we're glad they [the Iranians] are having trouble with their centrifuge machine and that we – the US and its allies – are doing everything we can to make sure that we complicate matters for them", offering "winking acknowledgement" of US involvement in Stuxnet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/security/video-cracking-the-code-defending-against-the-superweapons-of-the-21st-century-cyberwar/9456/ Gary Samore] speaking at the 10 December 2010 Washington Forum of the [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]] in Washington DC, reported by C-Span and contained in the PBS program ''Need to Know'' ([https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/security/video-cracking-the-code-defending-against-the-superweapons-of-the-21st-century-cyberwar/9456/ "Cracking the code: Defending against the superweapons of the 21st century cyberwar"], 4 minutes into piece)&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a showreel that was played at a retirement party for the head of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), [[Gabi Ashkenazi]], included references to Stuxnet as one of his operational successes as the IDF chief of staff.&lt;ref name=retirement&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Christopher |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8326387/Israel-video-shows-Stuxnet-as-one-of-its-successes.html |title=Israel video shows Stuxnet as one of its successes |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2012, an article in ''The New York Times'' said that Stuxnet is part of a US and Israeli intelligence operation called "[[Operation Olympic Games]]", started under President [[George W. Bush]] and expanded under President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="sanger2012June"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html |title = Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyberattacks Against Iran |publisher = The New York Times |date = 1 June 2012 |accessdate =1 June 2012 |first = David E. |last = Sanger | authorlink= David E.

On 24 July 2012, an article by Chris Matyszczyk from [[CNET]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57478515-71/thunderstruck-a-tale-of-malware-ac-dc-and-irans-nukes/|title=Thunderstruck!

On 25 December 2012, an Iranian semi-official news agency announced there was a cyberattack by Stuxnet, this time on the industries in the southern area of the country. The virus targeted a power plant and some other industries in [[Hormozgan province]] in recent months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20842113|title=Iran 'fends off new Stuxnet cyber attack'|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=25 December 2012|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to expert [[Eugene Kaspersky]], the worm also infected a nuclear power plant in Russia. Kaspersky noted, however, that since the power plant is not connected to the public Internet, the system should remain safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/stuxnet-gone-rogue-hit-russian-nuke-plant-space-station/|title=Stuxnet, gone rogue, hit Russian nuke plant, space station|work=The Times of Israel|last=Shamah|first=David|date=11 November 2013|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaspersky Lab experts at first estimated that Stuxnet started spreading around March or April 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/325/Myrtus_and_Guava_the_epidemic_the_trends_the_numbers |title=Myrtus and Guava: the epidemic, the trends, the numbers |author=Alexander Gostev |date=26 September 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101113112/http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/325/Myrtus_and_Guava_the_epidemic_the_trends_the_numbers |archive-date=1 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the first variant of the worm appeared in June 2009.&lt;ref name="Keizer1" /&gt; On 15 July 2010, the day the worm's existence became widely known, a [[distributed denial-of-service]] attack was made on the servers for two leading mailing lists on industrial-systems security. This attack, from an unknown source but likely related to Stuxnet, disabled one of the lists and thereby interrupted an important source of information for power plants and factories.{{r|gross201104}} On the other hand, researchers at [[Symantec]] have uncovered a version of the Stuxnet computer virus that was used to attack Iran's nuclear program in November 2007, being developed as early as 2005, when Iran was still setting up its uranium enrichment facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/26/us-cyberwar-stuxnet-idUSBRE91P0PP20130226 | work=Reuters | first=Jim | last=Finkle|title=Researchers say Stuxnet was deployed against Iran in 2007 | date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second variant, with substantial improvements, appeared in March 2010, apparently because its authors believed that Stuxnet was not spreading fast enough; a third, with minor improvements, appeared in April 2010.{{r|gross201104}} The worm contains a component with a build time-stamp from 3 February 2010.&lt;ref name="eset_microscope"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://go.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/Stuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdf |title=Stuxnet Under the Microscope |format=PDF |author1=Aleksandr Matrosov |author2=Eugene Rodionov |author3=David Harley |author4=Juraj Malcho |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=24 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011095238/http://go.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/Stuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom on 25 November 2010, [[Sky News]] reported that it had received information from an anonymous source at an unidentified [[IT security]] organization that Stuxnet, or a variation of the worm, had been traded on the [[black market]].&lt;ref name="cyber terrorists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Stuxnet-Worm-Virus-Targeted-At-Irans-Nuclear-Plant-Is-In-Hands-Of-Bad-Guys-Sky-News-Sources-Say/Article/201011415827544 |title=Super Virus A Target For Cyber Terrorists |author=Sam Kiley|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affected countries ==

Iran was reported to have "beefed up" its cyberwar capabilities following the Stuxnet attack, and has been suspected of retaliatory attacks against US banks.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/23/us-iran-cyberattacks-denial-idUSBRE88M06O20120923 Iran denies hacking into American banks]" Reuters, 23 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
{{rquote|right|[O]ne of the great technical blockbusters in malware history.|''Vanity Fair'', April 2011{{r|gross201104}}}}
Unlike most malware, Stuxnet does little harm to computers and networks that do not meet specific configuration requirements; "The attackers took great care to make sure that only their designated targets were hit... It was a marksman's job."{{r|broad20110115}} While the worm is promiscuous, it makes itself inert if Siemens software is not found on infected computers, and contains safeguards to prevent each infected computer from spreading the worm to more than three others, and to erase itself on 24 June 2012.{{r|gross201104}}

For its targets, Stuxnet contains, among other things, code for a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] that fakes industrial process control sensor signals so an infected system does not shut down due to detected abnormal behavior.{{r|gross201104}}{{r|broad20110115}}&lt;ref name=SonsOfStuxnet&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Cherry |author2=with Larry Constantine |title=Sons of Stuxnet|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/telecom/security/sons-of-stuxnet|publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]]|date=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complexity is very unusual for [[malware]]. The worm consists of a layered attack against three different systems:

# The [[Microsoft Windows|Windows operating system]],
# Siemens PCS 7, WinCC and STEP7 industrial software applications that run on Windows and
# One or more Siemens S7 PLCs.

=== Windows infection ===
Stuxnet attacked Windows systems using an unprecedented four [[zero-day attack]]s (plus the [[CPLINK]] [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] and a vulnerability used by the [[Conficker]] worm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd452420.aspx|title=Conficker Worm: Help Protect Windows from Conficker|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=10 April 2009|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It is initially spread using infected removable drives such as [[USB flash drive]]s,&lt;ref name=RewritingPlaybook /&gt;&lt;ref name="eset_microscope" /&gt; which contain Windows shortcut files to initiate executable code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alex Buda |title=Creating Malware using the Stuxnet LNK Exploit |url=http://www.rubydevices.com.au/blog/stuxnetLnkExploit|publisher=Ruby Devices|date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worm then uses other exploits and techniques such as [[peer-to-peer]] [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] to infect and update other computers inside private networks that are not directly connected to the Internet.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Liam O Murchu|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/stuxnet-p2p-component|title=Stuxnet P2P component|publisher=[[Symantec]]|date=17 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="symantec_dossier" /&gt; The number of zero-day exploits used is unusual, as they are highly valued and [[Hacker (computer security)|malware creators]] do not typically make use of (and thus simultaneously make visible) four different zero-day exploits in the same worm.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Amongst these exploits were remote code execution on a computer with Printer Sharing enabled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Microsoft|title=Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-061 – Critical|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms10-061.aspx|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=20 August 2015|date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the LNK/PIF vulnerability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Microsoft|title=Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-046 – Critical|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms10-046.aspx|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=20 August 2015|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which file execution is accomplished when an icon is viewed in Windows Explorer; negating the need for user interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexander|last=Gostev|title=Myrtus and Guava, Episode MS10-061|url=https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/29747/myrtus-and-guava-episode-ms10-061/|publisher=[[Kaspersky Lab]]|accessdate=20 August 2015|date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuxnet is unusually large at half a megabyte in size,&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|author=Kim Zetter |title=Blockbuster Worm Aimed for Infrastructure, But No Proof Iran Nukes Were Target|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/stuxnet-2/|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written in several different programming languages (including [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]) which is also irregular for malware.&lt;ref name=compworld /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keizer1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SonsOfStuxnet /&gt; The Windows component of the malware is [[promiscuous]] in that it spreads relatively quickly and indiscriminately.&lt;ref name="eset_microscope" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Step&amp;nbsp;7), and subverts a key communication library of WinCC called &lt;code&gt;s7otbxdx.dll&lt;/code&gt;. Doing so intercepts communications between the WinCC software running under Windows and the target Siemens PLC devices that the software is able to configure and program when the two are connected via a data cable. In this way, the malware is able to install itself on PLC devices unnoticed, and subsequently to mask its presence from WinCC if the control software attempts to read an infected block of memory from the PLC system.&lt;ref name="symantec_dossier" /&gt;

The malware furthermore used a [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day exploit]] in the WinCC/SCADA database software in the form of a hard-coded database password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-2772|title=Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2010-2772|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=7 December 2010|publisher=[[National Vulnerability Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PLC infection ===
[[File:S7300.JPG|thumb|left|Siemens Simatic S7-300 PLC CPU with three I/O modules attached]]

The entirety of the Stuxnet code has not yet been disclosed, but its payload targets only those SCADA configurations that meet criteria that it is programmed to identify.{{r|gross201104}}

Stuxnet requires specific slave [[variable-frequency drive]]s (frequency converter drives) to be attached to the targeted Siemens S7-300 system and its associated modules. It only attacks those PLC systems with variable-frequency drives from two specific vendors: [[Vacon]] based in Finland and Fararo Paya based in Iran.&lt;ref name="chien"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/stuxnet-breakthrough|title=Stuxnet: A Breakthrough|author=Eric Chien|publisher=Symantec|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it monitors the frequency of the attached motors, and only attacks systems that spin between 807&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 1,210&amp;nbsp;Hz. The industrial applications of motors with these parameters are diverse, and may include pumps or [[gas centrifuge]]s.

Stuxnet installs malware into memory block DB890 of the PLC that monitors the [[Profibus]] messaging bus of the system.&lt;ref name="symantec_dossier" /&gt; When certain criteria are met, it periodically modifies the frequency to 1,410&amp;nbsp;Hz and then to 2&amp;nbsp;Hz and then to 1,064&amp;nbsp;Hz, and thus affects the operation of the connected motors by changing their rotational speed.&lt;ref name="chien" /&gt; It also installs a rootkit – the first such documented case on this platform – that hides the malware on the system and masks the changes in rotational speed from monitoring systems.

== Removal ==
Siemens has released a detection and removal tool for Stuxnet. Siemens recommends contacting customer support if an infection is detected and advises installing Microsoft updates for security vulnerabilities and prohibiting the use of third-party [[USB flash drive]]s.&lt;ref name="Siemens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/llisapi.dll?func=ll&amp;objid=43876783&amp;nodeid0=10805583&amp;caller=view&amp;lang=en&amp;siteid=cseus&amp;aktprim=0&amp;objaction=csopen&amp;extranet=standard&amp;viewreg=WW#Recommended_procedure%200408|accessdate=24 September 2010|publisher=[[Siemens]]|title=SIMATIC WinCC / SIMATIC PCS 7: Information concerning Malware / Virus / Trojan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siemens also advises immediately upgrading password access codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20011095-83.html|title=Siemens warns Stuxnet targets of password risk|date=20 July 2010|accessdate=17 September 2010|publisher=[[CNET]]|author=Tom Espiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention of control system security incidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityincidents.org|accessdate=14 October 2010|publisher=Security Incidents Organization|title=Repository of Industrial Security Incidents}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as from viral infections like Stuxnet, is a topic that is being addressed in both the public and the private sector.

The US Department of Homeland Security [[National Cyber Security Division]] (NCSD) operates the Control System Security Program (CSSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/|accessdate=14 October 2010|publisher=[[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]]|title=DHS National Cyber Security Division's CSSP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program operates a specialized [[computer emergency response team]] called the [[Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team]] (ICS-CERT), conducts a biannual conference ({{abbr|ICSJWG|Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group}}), provides training, publishes recommended practices, and provides a self-assessment tool. As part of a Department of Homeland Security plan to improve American computer security, in 2008 it and the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] (INL) worked with Siemens to identify security holes in the company's widely used Process Control System 7 (PCS 7) and its software Step 7. In July 2008, INL and Siemens publicly announced flaws in the control system at a Chicago conference; Stuxnet exploited these holes in 2009.&lt;ref name="broad20110115"&gt;{{cite news

The authors conclude:

{{quote|The attacks seem designed to force a change in the centrifuge’s rotor speed, first raising the speed and then lowering it, likely with the intention of inducing excessive vibrations or distortions that would destroy the centrifuge. If its goal was to quickly destroy all the centrifuges in the FEP [Fuel Enrichment Plant], Stuxnet failed. But if the goal was to destroy a more limited number of centrifuges and set back Iran’s progress in operating the FEP, while making detection difficult, it may have succeeded, at least temporarily.&lt;ref name=ISIS-1/&gt;}}

The ISIS report further notes that Iranian authorities have attempted to conceal the breakdown by installing new centrifuges on a large scale.&lt;ref name=ISIS-1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiege l 26 December 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,736604,00.html |title=Stuxnet-Virus könnte tausend Uran-Zentrifugen zerstört haben |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=26 December 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worm worked by first causing an infected Iranian IR-1 centrifuge to increase from its normal operating speed of 1,064 [[hertz]] to 1,410 hertz for 15 minutes before returning to its normal frequency. Twenty-seven days later, the worm went back into action, slowing the infected centrifuges down to a few hundred hertz for a full 50 minutes. The stresses from the excessive, then slower, speeds caused the aluminium centrifugal tubes to expand, often forcing parts of the centrifuges into sufficient contact with each other to destroy the machine.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stark, Holger|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,778912,00.html|title=Mossad's Miracle Weapon: Stuxnet Virus Opens New Era of Cyber War|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] cameras installed in the Natanz facility recorded the sudden dismantling and removal of approximately 900–1,000 centrifuges during the time the Stuxnet worm was reportedly active at the plant. Iranian technicians, however, were able to quickly replace the centrifuges and the report concluded that uranium enrichment was likely only briefly disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Warrick, Joby, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/15/AR2011021506501.html Iran's Natanz nuclear facility recovered quickly from Stuxnet cyberattack]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 16 February 2011, retrieved 17 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2011, the [[Institute for Science and International Security]] released a report concluding that:
{{quote|Assuming Iran exercises caution, Stuxnet is unlikely to destroy more centrifuges at the Natanz plant. Iran likely cleaned the malware from its control systems. To prevent re-infection, Iran will have to exercise special caution since so many computers in Iran contain Stuxnet.

Although Stuxnet appears to be designed to destroy centrifuges at the Natanz facility, destruction was by no means total. Moreover, Stuxnet did not lower the production of [[Enriched uranium#Low-enriched uranium (LEU)|low-enriched uranium (LEU)]] during 2010. LEU quantities could have certainly been greater, and Stuxnet could be an important part of the reason why they did not increase significantly. Nonetheless, there remain important questions about why Stuxnet destroyed only 1,000 centrifuges. One observation is that it may be harder to destroy centrifuges by use of cyber attacks than often believed.&lt;ref name=ISIS-2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/stuxnet-malware-and-natanz-update-of-isis-december-22-2010-reportsupa-href1/8|title=Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report|publisher=[[Institute for Science and International Security]] |date= 15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Associated Press]] reported that the semi-official [[Iranian Students News Agency]] released a statement on 24 September 2010 stating that experts from the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] met in the previous week to discuss how Stuxnet could be removed from their systems.&lt;ref name=APtehran /&gt; According to analysts, such as [[David Albright]], [[Western world|Western]] intelligence agencies had been attempting to [[sabotage]] the Iranian nuclear program for some time.&lt;ref name="sabotage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/iran/signs-of-sabotage-in-tehran-s-nuclear-programme-1.658481|title=Signs of sabotage in Tehran's nuclear programme|publisher=Gulf News|date=14 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120230019/http://gulfnews.com/news/region/iran/signs-of-sabotage-in-tehran-s-nuclear-programme-1.658481|archivedate=20 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EyesCyberwar&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Williams|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLV83872|title=Wary of naked force, Israel eyes cyberwar on Iran|publisher=Reuters|date=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant told [[Reuters]] that only the [[personal computer]]s of staff at the plant had been infected by Stuxnet and the state-run newspaper ''Iran Daily'' quoted [[Reza Taghipour]], Iran's telecommunications minister, as saying that it had not caused "serious damage to government systems".&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; The Director of Information Technology Council at the Iranian Ministry of Industries and Mines, Mahmud Liaii, has said that: "An [[Cyberwarfare|electronic war]] has been launched against Iran...

In response to the infection, Iran assembled a team to combat it. With more than 30,000 IP addresses affected in Iran, an official said that the infection was fast spreading in Iran and the problem had been compounded by the ability of Stuxnet to mutate.

An analysis by the FAS demonstrates that Iran’s enrichment capacity grew during 2010. The study indicated that Iran’s centrifuges appeared to be performing 60% better than in the previous year, which would significantly reduce Tehran’s time to produce bomb-grade uranium. The FAS report was reviewed by an official with the IAEA who affirmed the study.&lt;ref name=FAS&gt;{{cite web|author= Monica Amarelo |url=https://fas.org/press/news/2011/issuebrief_iran.html|title=New FAS Report Demonstrates Iran Improved Enrichment in 2010 |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Haaretz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/report-iran-s-nuclear-capacity-unharmed-contrary-to-u-s-assessment-1.338522 |title= Report: Iran's nuclear capacity unharmed, contrary to U.S. assessment |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Jeffrey Goldberg| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/01/report-irans-nuclear-program-going-full-speed-ahead/70031/ |title= Report: Report: Iran's Nuclear Program Going Full Speed Ahead |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European and US officials, along with private experts told Reuters that Iranian engineers were successful in neutralizing and purging Stuxnet from their country's nuclear machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/14/us-iran-usa-stuxnet-idUSTRE81D24Q20120214|title=Experts say Iran has "neutralized" Stuxnet virus|publisher=Reuters |date= 14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the growth in Iranian enrichment capability in 2010, the country may have intentionally put out [[misinformation]] to cause Stuxnet's creators to believe that the worm was more successful in disabling the Iranian nuclear program than it actually was.{{r|gross201104}}

In a March 2012 interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', retired [[US Air Force]] General [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] – who served as director of both the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[National Security Agency]] – while denying knowledge of who created Stuxnet said that he believed it had been "a good idea" but that it carried a downside in that it had legitimized the use of sophisticated cyber weapons designed to cause physical damage. Hayden said, "There are those out there who can take a look at this... and maybe even attempt to turn it to their own purposes". In the same report, Sean McGurk, a former cybersecurity official at the [[Department of Homeland Security]] noted that the Stuxnet source code could now be downloaded online and modified to be directed at new target systems. Speaking of the Stuxnet creators, he said, "They opened the box. They demonstrated the capability...

Sandro Gaycken from the [[Free University Berlin]] argued that the attack on Iran was a ruse to distract from Stuxnet's real purpose.

=== Deployment in North Korea ===
According to a report by Reuters, the NSA also tried to sabotage [[North Korea]]'s [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear program]] using a version of Stuxnet. The operation was reportedly launched in tandem with the attack that targeted Iranian centrifuges in 2009–10. The North Korean nuclear program shares many similarities with the Iranian, both having been developed with technology transferred by Pakistani nuclear scientist [[A.Q. Khan]]. The effort failed, however, because North Korea's extreme secrecy and isolation made it impossible to introduce Stuxnet into the nuclear facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menn|first1=Joseph|title=Exclusive: U.S. tried Stuxnet-style campaign against North Korea but failed – sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/29/us-usa-northkorea-stuxnet-idUSKBN0OE2DM20150529|accessdate=31 May 2015|agency=Reuters|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This malware was capable of spreading only by being physically installed, probably by previously contaminated field equipment used by contractors working on Siemens control systems within the complex. It is not clear whether this attack attempt was successful, but it being followed by a different, simpler and more conventional attack is indicative.

The Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] analyzed the malware, naming the threat '''Duqu'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crysys.hu/publications/files/bencsathPBF11duqu.pdf | title = Duqu: A Stuxnet-like malware found in the wild, technical report | publisher = Laboratory of Cryptography of Systems Security (CrySyS) | date = 14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crysys.hu/in-the-press.html |title=Statement on Duqu's initial analysis |publisher=Laboratory of Cryptography of Systems Security (CrySyS) |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B98SI8gJ?url=http://www.crysys.hu/in-the-press.html |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symantec]], based on this report, continued the analysis of the threat, calling it "nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose", and published a detailed technical paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_duqu_the_precursor_to_the_next_stuxnet.pdf |title=W32.Duqu – The precursor to the next Stuxnet (Version 1.2) |work= |publisher=[[Symantec]] |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main component used in Duqu is designed to capture information&lt;ref name=SonsOfStuxnet /&gt; such as keystrokes and system information. The exfiltrated data may be used to enable a future Stuxnet-like attack. On 28 December 2011, Kaspersky Lab's director of global research and analysis spoke to Reuters about recent research results showing that the platform Stuxnet and Duqu both originated from in 2007, and is being referred to as Tilded due to the ~d at the beginning of the file names. Also uncovered in this research was the possibility for three more variants based on the Tilded platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jim Finkle|title=Stuxnet weapon has at least 4 cousins: researchers|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/28/us-cybersecurity-stuxnet-idUSTRE7BR1EV20111228|publisher=Reuters|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flame ===
{{Main|Flame (malware)}}
In May 2012, the new malware "Flame" was found, thought to be related to Stuxnet.&lt;ref name=Zetter&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet 'Flame,' The Massive Spy Malware Infiltrating Iranian Computers |first=Kim |last=Zetter |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/flame/ |newspaper=Wired |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6834BiIOh?url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/flame/ |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers named the program "Flame" after the name of one of its modules.&lt;ref name=Zetter /&gt; After analysing the code of Flame, Kaspersky Lab said that there is a strong relationship between Flame and Stuxnet. An early version of Stuxnet contained code to propagate infections via USB drives that is nearly identical to a Flame module that exploits the same vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Resource_207_Kaspersky_Lab_Research_Proves_that_Stuxnet_and_Flame_Developers_are_Connected|title=Resource 207: Kaspersky Lab Research Proves that Stuxnet and Flame Developers are Connected|date=11 June 2012|publisher=Kaspersky Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Triton ===
In December 2017 it was reported that the safety systems of an unidentified power station, believed to be in [[Saudi Arabia]], were compromised, when the [[Triconex]] industrial safety technology made by Schneider Electric SE was targeted, in what is believed to have been a state sponsored attack. The computer security company [[Symantec]] claimed that the malware, known as "Triton", exploited a vulnerability in computers running the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/15/triton-hackers-malware-attack-safety-systems-energy-plant|title=Triton: hackers take out safety systems in 'watershed' attack on energy plant|last=Gibbs|first=Samuel|date=15 December 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 December 2017|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
Since 2010, there has been extensive international media coverage on Stuxnet and its aftermath. In early commentary, ''[[The Economist]]'' pointed out that Stuxnet was "a new kind of cyber-attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Meaning of Stuxnet|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17147862|publisher=The Economist|date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2011, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' then published an article detailing how network security experts were able to decipher the origins of Stuxnet. In that piece, Kim Zetter claimed that Stuxnet's "cost–benefit ratio is still in question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kim Zetter|title=How Digital Detectives Deciphered Stuxnet, the Most Menacing Malware in History|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet/|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentators tended to focus on the strategic significance of Stuxnet as a cyber weapon. Following the Wired piece, Holger Stark called Stuxnet the "first digital weapon of geopolitical importance, it could change the way wars are fought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Holger Stark|title=Mossad's Miracle Weapon: Stuxnet Virus Opens New Era of Cyber War|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/mossad-s-miracle-weapon-stuxnet-virus-opens-new-era-of-cyber-war-a-778912.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Eddie Walsh referred to Stuxnet as "the world's newest high-end asymmetric threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eddie Walsh|title=2011: The year of domestic cyber threat|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/01/20121181245291117.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, some claim that the "extensive media coverage afforded to Stuxnet has only served as an advertisement for the vulnerabilities used by various cybercriminal groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky|title=Sality &amp; Stuxnet – Not Such a Strange Coincidence|url=http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2010/Sality_Stuxnet_Not_Such_a_Strange_Coincidence|publisher=Kaspersky Lab|date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While that may be the case, the media coverage has also increased awareness of cyber security threats.

[[Alex Gibney]]'s 2016 documentary ''[[Zero Days]]'' covers the phenomenon around Stuxnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=16 February 2016 |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/us-hacked-into-irans-critical-civilian-infrastructure-for-ma |title=U.S. Hacked Into Iran's Critical Civilian Infrastructure For Massive Cyberattack, New Film Claims |work=[[BuzzFeed]] |first=James |last=Ball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 it was revealed that [[James Cartwright|General James Cartwright]], the former head of the U.S. Strategic Command, had leaked information related to Stuxnet. He later pleaded guilty for lying to FBI agents pursuing an investigation into the leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/us/marine-general-james-cartwright-leak-fbi.html|title=James Cartwright, Ex-General, Pleads Guilty in Leak Case|last=Savage|first=Charlie|date=17 October 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/world-war-three-by-mistake|title=World War Three, by Mistake|date=23 December 2016|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2017, he was granted a full pardon in this case by President Obama, thereby expunging his conviction.

== In popular culture ==
* In ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' [[List of Castle episodes#Season 8 (2015–16)|season 8, episode 18 "Backstabber"]] Stuxnet is revealed to have been (fictionally) created by [[MI-6]], and a version of it is used to take down the London power grid.
* ''Trojan Horse'' is a novel written by Windows utility writer, and novelist Mark Russinovich. It features the usage of the Stuxnet virus as a main plot line for the story, and the attempt of Iran to bypass it.
* In ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Arise]]'' Stuxnet is the name of the computer virus which infected [[Motoko Kusanagi|Kusanagi]] and Manamura allowing false memories to be implanted.
* In July 2017, MRSA ([[Mat Zo]]) released a track named "Stuxnet" through [[Hospital Records]].
* In Ubisoft's 2013 video game ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist]]'', the protagonist, Sam Fisher, makes use of a mobile, airborne headquarters ("Paladin") which is said at one point within the game's story mode to have been targeted by a Stuxnet-style virus, causing its systems to fail and the plane to careen towards the ocean, and would have crashed without Fisher's intervening.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o77cNhuoI4A&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Māori mythology|Māori tradition]], '''''Te Paepae-ki-Rarotonga''''' was one of the great [[Māori migration canoes|ocean-going, voyaging canoes]] that was used in the migrations that settled [[New Zealand]]. ''Te Paepae-ki-Rarotonga'' was captained by Waitaha-ariki-kore and is said to have landed near [[Matatā]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/CanoeTraditions/4/en Te Ara: Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

Waitaha-Ariki-Kore pulled down his house in Rarotonga and used it to build his waka ''Te Paepae-o-Rarotonga''.

He was guided to Aotearoa by two taniwha and made first landfall at the Rurima Islands. He approached the islands at speed and on striking them caused them to break apart. At Rurima he sought water at the spring which bears his name.

From Rurima he then crossed to the mainland landing at Te Awa o te Atua, near Matata, before proceeding past Otaramuturangi to Te Kohika. From here he travelled to the inland of the Bay of Plenty.

Ngatiawa expressly state that ''Te Paepae-o-Rarotonga'' arrived before the coming of ''Mātaatua'', and it is said to have been a very tapu craft; hence the place where it lay (The canoe is said to be lying, buried, at Tara-o-muturangi) was used as a burial-place.

Waiataha-ariki-kore married Hineteariki of Hapuoneone who had her pā at Otamarakau and inland to Waitahanui. Their daughter was Hahuru the mother of Tuwharetoa i te Aupouri.

According to Colonel Gudgeon, the Rarotongan natives have a tradition concerning a canoe called ''Te Paepae-o-Rarotonga''.

'''Theodore Robert Bundy''' (born '''Theodore Robert Cowell'''; November 24, 1946&amp;nbsp;– January 24, 1989) was an American [[serial killer]], [[kidnapping|kidnapper]], [[Rape|rapist]], [[Burglary|burglar]], and [[Necrophilia|necrophile]] who assaulted and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. Shortly before his execution and after more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 homicides that he committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. The true number of victims is unknown and possibly higher.

Many of Bundy's young female victims regarded him as handsome and charismatic, which were traits that he exploited to win their trust. He would typically approach them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes for hours at a time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until [[putrefaction]] and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He [[Decapitation|decapitated]] at least 12 of his victims, and for a period of time, he kept some of the severed heads as mementos in his apartment.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=378, 393}} On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.

In 1975, Bundy was jailed for the first time when he was incarcerated in [[Utah]] for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states. Facing murder charges in [[Colorado]], he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in [[Florida]] in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two separate trials.

Bundy was executed in the [[electric chair]] at [[Florida State Prison]] on January 24, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Barry|last1=Bearak|title=Bundy Electrocuted After Night of Weeping, Praying : 500 Cheer Death of Murderer|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-24/news/mn-1075_1_ted-bundy|accessdate=July 16, 2016|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=January 24, 1989|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160718145205/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-24/news/mn-1075_1_ted-bundy|archivedate=July 18, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Ann Rule]] described Bundy as "a sadistic [[sociopath]] who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death, and even after".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xiv}} He once called himself "the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet";{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=263}}&lt;ref name="Hare1999" /&gt; Attorney [[Polly Nelson]]—a member of his last defense team—wrote: "Ted was the very definition of heartless evil."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=319}}

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (known for most of her life as Louise) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lundvt.org/ Lund Family Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307150638/https://lundvt.org/ |date=March 7, 2017 }}, retrieved September 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. His father's identity was never determined with any degree of certainty. His birth certificate assigned paternity to a salesman and [[Air Force]] veteran named Lloyd Marshall,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=8}} but Louise later claimed that she had been seduced by "a sailor"{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xxxiii}} whose name may have been Jack Worthington.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=56, 330}} Years later, investigators would find no record of anyone by that name in [[United States Navy|Navy]] or [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] archives.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=308}} Some family members expressed suspicions that Bundy might have been fathered by Louise's own violent, abusive father, Samuel Cowell,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=56}} but no material evidence has ever been cited to support or refute this.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xxxiv}}

For the first three years of his life, Bundy lived in the [[Philadelphia]] home of his maternal grandparents, Samuel and Eleanor Cowell, who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside of wedlock at the time. Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. He eventually discovered the truth, although he had varied recollections of the circumstances. He told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a "bastard",{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=40–41}} but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and [[Hugh Aynesworth]] that he found the certificate himself.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=62}} Biographer and [[true crime]] writer [[Ann Rule]], who knew Bundy personally, believed that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=16–17}} Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=51–52}}

In some interviews, Bundy spoke warmly of his grandparents {{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=17–18}} and told Rule that he "identified with", "respected", and "clung to" his grandfather.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=9}} In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel Cowell was a tyrannical bully and a bigot who hated blacks, Italians, Catholics, and Jews. Bundy's grandfather beat his wife and the family dog and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. He once threw Louise's younger sister Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=330}} He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} and at least once he flew into a violent rage when the question of Ted's paternity was raised.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=330}} Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent [[electroconvulsive therapy]] for depression{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=501–08}} Ted occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior, even at that early age. Julia recalled awakening one day from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the Cowell kitchen; her three-year-old nephew was standing by the bed, smiling.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=505}}
[[File:Ted Bundy HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|right|Bundy as a senior in high school, 1965]]
In 1950, Louise abruptly changed her surname from Cowell to Nelson,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=8}} and at the urging of multiple family members, she left Philadelphia with her son to live with cousins Alan and Jane Scott in [[Tacoma, Washington]].{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=155}} In 1951 Louise met Johnny Culpepper Bundy, a hospital cook, at an adult singles night at Tacoma's First Methodist Church.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=57}} They married later that year and Johnny Bundy formally adopted Ted.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=57}} Johnny and Louise conceived four children of their own, and although Johnny tried to include his adoptive son in camping trips and other family activities, Ted remained distant. He later complained to his girlfriend that Johnny wasn't his real father, "wasn't very bright", and "didn't make much money."{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=51}}

Bundy had different recollections of Tacoma when he spoke to his biographers. When he talked to Michaud and Aynesworth, he described how he roamed his neighborhood, picking through trash barrels in search of pictures of naked women.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=22}} When he spoke to Polly Nelson, he explained how he perused detective magazines, crime novels, and true crime documentaries for stories that involved sexual violence, particularly when the stories were illustrated with pictures of dead or maimed bodies.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=277–78}} In a letter to Rule, he asserted that he "never, ever read fact-detective magazines, and shuddered at the thought [that anyone would]".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=612}} In his conversation with Michaud, he described how he would consume large quantities of alcohol and "canvass the community" late at night in search of undraped windows where he could observe women undressing, or "whatever [else] could be seen."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=74–77}}

Bundy also varied the accounts of his social life. He told Michaud and Aynesworth that he "chose to be alone" as an adolescent because he was unable to understand interpersonal relationships.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=64}} He claimed that he had no natural sense of how to develop friendships. "I didn't know what made people want to be friends," he said. "I didn't know what underlay social interactions."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=66}} Classmates from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] told Rule, however, that Bundy was "well known and well liked" there, "a medium-sized fish in a large pond".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=13}}

Snow skiing was Bundy's only significant athletic avocation; he enthusiastically pursued the activity by using stolen equipment and forged lift tickets.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=62}}

During high school, he was arrested at least twice on suspicion of burglary and auto theft. When he reached age 18, the details of the incidents were expunged from his record, which is customary in Washington State and most other states.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=13–14}}

=== University years ===
After graduating from high school in 1965, Bundy spent a year at the [[University of Puget Sound]] (UPS) before he transferred to the [[University of Washington]] (UW) in 1966 to study Chinese.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=14}} In 1967, he became romantically involved with a UW classmate who is identified by several pseudonyms in Bundy biographies, most commonly Stephanie Brooks.&lt;ref name="akaLeslieHolland" /&gt; In early 1968 he dropped out of college and worked at a series of minimum-wage jobs. He also volunteered at the Seattle office of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s presidential campaign&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; and in August attended the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] in [[Miami]] as a Rockefeller delegate.{{sfn|Larsen|1980|pp=5, 7}} Shortly thereafter Brooks ended their relationship and returned to her family home in California, frustrated by what she described as Bundy's immaturity and lack of ambition. Psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis|Dorothy Lewis]] would later pinpoint this crisis as "probably the pivotal time in his development".{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=279}} Devastated by Brooks's rejection, Bundy traveled to Colorado and then farther east, visiting relatives in [[Arkansas]] and Philadelphia and enrolling for one semester at [[Temple University]].{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=19}} It was at this time in early 1969, Rule believes, that Bundy visited the office of birth records in Burlington and confirmed his true parentage.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=53}}

Bundy was back in Washington in the fall of 1969 when he met Elizabeth Kloepfer (identified in Bundy literature as Meg Anders, Beth Archer, or Liz Kendall), a divorcée from [[Ogden, Utah]]. She worked as a secretary at the University of Washington School of Medicine.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=74}} Their stormy relationship would continue well past his initial incarceration in Utah in 1976.

In mid-1970, Bundy was now focused and goal oriented, and he re-enrolled at UW, this time as a psychology major. He became an honor student and was well regarded by his professors.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=18–20}} In 1971, he took a job at Seattle's Suicide Hotline Crisis Center, where he met and worked alongside Ann Rule. Rule was a former Seattle police officer and aspiring crime writer who would later write one of the definitive Bundy biographies, ''[[The Stranger Beside Me]]''. She saw nothing disturbing in Bundy's personality at the time and described him as "kind, solicitous, and empathetic".{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=22–33}}

After graduating from UW in 1972,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=76}} Bundy joined Governor [[Daniel J. Evans]]' re-election campaign.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=39}} Posing as a college student, he shadowed Evans' opponent, former governor [[Albert Rosellini]], and recorded his stump speeches for analysis by Evans' team.{{sfn|Larsen|1980|pp=7–10}}&lt;ref name="Ellensburg1973-08-30" /&gt; After Evans was re-elected, Bundy was hired as an assistant to Ross Davis, Chairman of the [[Washington State Republican Party]]. Davis thought well of Bundy and described him as "smart, aggressive&amp;nbsp;... and a believer in the system".{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=46}} In early 1973, Bundy was accepted into the law schools of UPS and the [[S.J. Quinney College of Law|University of Utah]] despite mediocre [[Law School Admission Test]] scores. He got in on the strength of letters of recommendation from Evans, Davis, and several UW psychology professors.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=22, 43–44}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=79}}

During a trip to California on Republican Party business in the summer of 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional who was seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, and neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973, Bundy [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at UPS Law School{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=45–46}} and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=51}} In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" and hung up. She never heard from him again.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=52}}  He later explained, "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her";{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=16}} but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=52}}

By then, Bundy had begun skipping classes at law school; by April, he had stopped attending entirely,{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=44–47}} as young women began to disappear in the [[Pacific Northwest]].{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=81–84}} The year the murders began, he was the assistant director of the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Commission and wrote a pamphlet for women on rape prevention.&lt;ref name="nyt 1989"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Nordheimer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/us/bundy-is-put-to-death-in-florida-after-admitting-trail-of-killings.html|title=Bundy Is Put to Death in Florida After Admitting Trail of Killings|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 25, 1989|accessdate=September 7, 2018|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022194108/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/us/bundy-is-put-to-death-in-florida-after-admitting-trail-of-killings.html |archive-date=October 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundy joked with local newsmen that after his eight weeks in Salt Lake City’s jail system, before being released on bail, he had a beneficial experience for studying the law, thus giving him new insights for improving the criminal justice system. His first order of action was to focus on addressing the bail‐bond system and improving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Keller |title=Bundy: Portrait of a Serial Killer: The Shocking True Story of Ted Bundy |publisher=Robert Keller |date=2017|isbn=978-1548730673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First two series of murders ==

=== Washington, Oregon ===
There is no consensus on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=400}} He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in [[Ocean City, New Jersey]], but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=282–84}} He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="DailyNews" /&gt;{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=57}} He hinted but refused to elaborate to homicide detective [[Robert D. Keppel]] that he committed a murder in Seattle in 1972,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=387}} and another murder in 1973 that involved a hitchhiker near [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]].{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=396}} Rule and Keppel both believed that he might have started killing as a teenager.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=526}}{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=399–400}} Circumstantial evidence suggested that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma when he was 14 years old in 1961; this was an allegation that he repeatedly denied.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=387}} His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By his own admission, he had mastered the necessary skills—in the era before [[DNA profiling]]—to leave minimal incriminating forensic evidence at the crime scene.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=87}}

Shortly after midnight on January 4, 1974 (around the time that he terminated his relationship with Brooks), Bundy entered the [[basement apartment]] of 18-year-old Karen Sparks{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=389}} (identified as Joni Lenz,{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=57}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=27}} Mary Adams,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1983|p=27}} or Terri Caldwell{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=14}} by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] her with either the same rod,{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=56-7}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=16}} or a metal [[speculum (medical)|speculum]],{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=27}} causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days,{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=14}} but survived with permanent physical and mental disabilities.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=28}} In the early morning hours of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=60–62}}

During the first half of 1974, female college students  disappeared at the rate of about one per month. On March 12, Donna Gail Manson, a 19-year-old student at [[The Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], {{convert|60|mi|round=5|spell=in}} southwest of Seattle, left her dormitory to attend a jazz concert on campus, but never arrived. On April 17, Susan Elaine Rancourt disappeared while on her way to her dorm room after an evening advisers meeting at [[Central Washington University|Central Washington State College]] in [[Ellensburg, Washington|Ellensburg]], {{convert|110|mi|round=5}} east-southeast of Seattle.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=71}}&lt;ref name="Spokesman-Review" /&gt; Two female Central Washington students later came forward to report encounters—one on the night of Rancourt's disappearance, the other three nights earlier—with a man wearing an arm sling, asking for help carrying a load of books to his brown or tan [[Volkswagen Beetle]].{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=42–46}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=31–33}} On May 6, Roberta Kathleen Parks left her dormitory at [[Oregon State University]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], {{convert|85|mi|round=5}} south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], to have coffee with friends at the [[Memorial Union (Oregon State University)|Memorial Union]], but never arrived.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=75–76}}

Detectives from the [[King County Sheriff's Office|King County]]&lt;!-- was "King Co. Police" then--&gt; and [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle]] police departments grew increasingly concerned. There was no significant physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=73–74}} On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in [[Burien, Washington|Burien]], near [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]]. She was last seen in the parking lot, talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=77}} In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann &lt;!-- spelling of first name is correct, please do not change --&gt; Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=37}} The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a [[criminalist]] combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=82}} After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night who was in an alley behind a nearby dormitory; he was on crutches with a leg cast and was struggling to carry a briefcase.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=38}} One woman recalled that the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=75}}

During this period, Bundy was working in Olympia at the Department of Emergency Services (DES), a state government agency involved in the search for the missing women. There, he met and dated Carole Ann Boone, a twice-divorced mother of two who, six years later, would play an important role in the final phase of his life.&lt;ref name="Michaud-trutv" /&gt;

[[File:Ted Bundy volkswagen.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A light tan rusty Volkswagen is positioned for display behind a chain made of handcuffs|Ted Bundy's 1968 Volkswagen Beetle, where he committed many of his crimes. Vehicle on display at the now-defunct [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]]&lt;ref name="Kennicott-wapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CrimeMuseum-car" /&gt;]]
Reports of the six missing women and Sparks' brutal beating appeared prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=81}} Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=76}} Pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=77}} but the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=vi}} Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, within a week of midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=90–91}}

The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on July 14, with the broad daylight abductions of two women from a crowded beach at [[Lake Sammamish State Park]] in [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]], a suburb {{convert|20|mi|round=5|spell=in}} east of Seattle.&lt;ref name=bbapdent74&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6DlYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1580%2C3631677 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Dental records establish identities of two women  |date=September 11, 1974 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as "Ted," he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him as far as his car, saw that there was no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation case worker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story, and watched her leave the beach in his company.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=3–6}} About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=99–101}} Bundy told Stephen Michaud that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that he forced one to watch as he murdered the other{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=45}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=139–42}}—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis on the eve of his execution.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=294–295}}

The King County police were finally provided with a detailed description of the suspect and his car when they posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect;{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=61–62}} but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=40}}—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=103–05}}

On September 6, two grouse hunters stumbled across the skeletal remains of Ott and Naslund near a service road in Issaquah, {{convert|2|mi|0|spell=in}} east of Lake Sammamish State Park.&lt;ref name=bbapdent74/&gt;{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=8–15}} An extra [[femur]] and several [[human vertebra|vertebrae]] found at the site were later identified by Bundy as Georgann Hawkins'.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=18}} Six months later, forestry students from [[Green River Community College]] discovered the skulls and [[human mandible|mandibles]] of Healy, Rancourt, Parks, and Ball on Taylor Mountain, where Bundy frequently hiked, just east of Issaquah.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=25–30}} Manson's remains were never recovered.

In August 1974, Bundy received a second acceptance from the [[University of Utah]] [[S.J. Quinney College of Law|Law School]] and moved to [[Salt Lake City]], leaving Kloepfer in Seattle. While he called Kloepfer often, he dated "at least a dozen" other women.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=130–31}} When he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, "he was devastated to find out that the other students had something, some intellectual capacity, that he did not. He found the classes completely incomprehensible. 'It was a great disappointment to me,' he said."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=55}}

A new string of homicides began the following month, including two that would remain undiscovered until Bundy confessed to them shortly before his execution. On September 2, he raped and strangled a still-unidentified hitchhiker in [[Idaho]], then either disposed of the remains immediately in a nearby river,{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=86}} or returned the next day to photograph and dismember {{nowrap|the corpse.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=257–59}}{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=527}}}} On October 2, he seized 16-year-old Nancy Wilcox in [[Holladay, Utah|Holladay]], a suburb of Salt Lake City,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=91}} and dragged her into a wooded area, intending to "de-escalate" his pathological urges, he claimed, by raping and then releasing her; but he strangled her—accidentally, he said—in the process of trying to silence her screams.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=143–46}}  Her remains were buried near [[Capitol Reef National Park]], some {{convert|200|mi|round=5|spell=in}} south of Holladay, but were never found.&lt;ref name="Psychics" /&gt;

On October 18, Melissa Anne Smith—the 17-year-old daughter of the police chief of [[Midvale, Utah|Midvale]] (another Salt Lake City suburb)—disappeared after leaving a pizza parlor. Her nude body was found in a nearby mountainous area nine days later. Postmortem examination indicated that she may have remained alive for up to seven days following her disappearance.{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=96}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=92–93}} On October 31, Laura Ann Aime, also 17, disappeared {{convert|25|mi}} south in [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]] after leaving a café just after midnight.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=112}} Her naked body was found by hikers {{convert|9|mi|spell=in}} to the northeast in [[American Fork Canyon]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]].&lt;ref name="Deseret1977" /&gt; Both women had been beaten, raped, [[sodomy|sodomized]], and strangled with nylon stockings.&lt;ref name="Bell-KillingSpree" /&gt;{{sfn|Rule|1989|pp=112–13}} Years later, Bundy described his postmortem rituals with the corpses of Smith and Aime, including hair shampooing and application of makeup.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=486}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=334–35}}

In the late afternoon of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at [[Fashion Place|Fashion Place Mall]] in [[Murray, Utah|Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JXm3zfQuNEUC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=fashion+place+mall+bundy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NgFzncrGwm&amp;sig=WjQ55lmIzE1jKLJgGxJAJW221Qw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J_oNVeTDBISFyQTG-YGYCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fashion%20place%20mall%20bundy&amp;f=false |title= Ted Bundy: The FBI File  |quote= Bundy was convicted of kidnaping Carol DaRonch, 19, from Fashion Place Mall earlier that day. |accessdate= March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than a mile from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as "Officer Roseland" of the Murray Police Department and told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car. He asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out to Bundy that he was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the car door and escape.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=93–95}} Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at [[Viewmont High School]] in [[Bountiful, Utah|Bountiful]], {{convert|20|mi|round=5|spell=in}} north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother.&lt;ref name="map-Murray2Bountiful" /&gt; The school's drama teacher and a student told police that "a stranger" had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=95–97}} Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=101}}

In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer called King County police a second time after she read that young women were now disappearing in towns surrounding Salt Lake City. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify him from a photo lineup.{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=78–79}} In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy's name was added to their list of suspects, but at that time no credible evidence linked him to the Utah crimes.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=148–49}} In January 1975 Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three separate occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=149–50}}

In 1975, Bundy shifted much of his criminal activity eastward, from his base in Utah to [[Colorado]]. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in [[Snowmass Village, Colorado|Snowmass Village]], {{convert|400|mi|-1}} southeast of Salt Lake City.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=126}} Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She had been killed by blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=132–36}} {{convert|100|mi|spell=In}} northeast of Snowmass, on March 15, [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]] ski instructor Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a secondary site near [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]], {{convert|90|mi|spell=in}} west of Vail.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=402–07}} Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7431–98}}

Denise Lynn Oliverson, 25, disappeared near the Utah–Colorado border in [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] on April 6 while riding her bicycle to her parents' house; her bike and sandals were found under a viaduct near a railroad bridge.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=110}} On May 6, Bundy lured 12-year-old Lynette Dawn Culver from Alameda Junior High School in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], Idaho, {{convert|160|mi|round=5}} north of Salt Lake City. He drowned and then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room,{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|pp=137–38}} before disposing of her body in a river north of Pocatello (possibly the [[Snake River|Snake]]).&lt;ref name="Culver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moscow"/&gt;

In mid-May, three of Bundy's Washington State DES coworkers, including Carole Ann Boone, visited him in Salt Lake City and stayed for a week in his apartment. Bundy subsequently spent a week in Seattle with Kloepfer in early June and they discussed getting married the following Christmas. Again, Kloepfer made no mention of her multiple discussions with the King County Police and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, and Bundy disclosed neither his ongoing relationship with Boone nor a concurrent romance with a Utah law student known in various accounts as Kim Andrews{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=140–41}} or Sharon Auer.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=164–65}}

On June 28, Susan Curtis vanished from the campus of [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], {{convert|45|mi|round=5}} south of Salt Lake City. Curtis's murder became Bundy's last confession, tape-recorded moments before he entered the execution chamber.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=343}} The bodies of Wilcox, Kent, Cunningham, Culver, Curtis, and Oliverson were never recovered.

In August or September 1975, Bundy was baptized into [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], although he was not an active participant in services and ignored most church restrictions.&lt;ref name="Smith1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett-Connaughton1978" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=158}}: "Bundy joined the Mormon Church that September."&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be excommunicated by the LDS Church following his 1976 kidnapping conviction.&lt;ref name="Smith1979" /&gt; When asked his religious preference after his arrest, Bundy answered "Methodist", the religion of his childhood.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=389}}

In Washington state, investigators were still struggling to analyze the Pacific Northwest murder spree that had ended as abruptly as it had begun. In an effort to make sense of an overwhelming mass of data, they resorted to the then-innovative strategy of compiling a database. They used the King County payroll computer, a "huge, primitive machine" by contemporary standards, but the only one available for their use. After inputting the many lists they had compiled—classmates and acquaintances of each victim, Volkswagen owners named "Ted", known sex offenders, and so on—they queried the computer for coincidences. Out of thousands of names, 26 turned up on four separate lists; one was Ted Bundy. Detectives also manually compiled a list of their 100 "best" suspects, and Bundy was on that list as well. He was "literally at the top of the pile" of suspects when word came from Utah of his arrest.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=62–66}}

== Arrest and first trial ==
[[File:Ted Bundy murder kit.JPG|right|thumb|upright|alt=The murder kit includes a sports bag, garbage bags, ski mask, nylon stocking with holes, flashlight, crowbar, an ice pick, and some gloves.|Items found in Bundy's Volkswagen, Utah, 1975]]

On August 16, 1975, Bundy was arrested by a Utah Highway Patrol officer in [[West Valley City, Utah|Granger]] (another Salt Lake City suburb). The officer had observed Bundy cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours; Bundy fled the area at high speed after seeing the patrol car.&lt;ref name="Gehrke2000" /&gt; The officer searched the car after he noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, he had found the handcuffs in a [[dumpster]], and the rest were common household items.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=98–99, 113–15}} However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, which matched Bundy's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=71}} and a brochure that advertised the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful, where Debra Kent had disappeared.{{sfn|Sullivan|2009|p=151}} The police did not have sufficient evidence to detain Bundy, and he was released on his own [[recognizance]]. Bundy later said that searchers missed a collection of [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] photographs of his victims; he destroyed the photographs after he was released.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=258}}

Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle with two other detectives to interview Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy's move to Utah, she had discovered objects that she "couldn't understand" in her house and in Bundy's apartment. These items included crutches, a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house, and a meat cleaver that was never used for cooking. Additional objects included surgical gloves, an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment, and a sack full of women's clothing.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=167}} Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected that he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he possessed. When she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, "If you tell anyone, I'll break your fucking neck."{{sfn|Kendall|1981|p=74}} She said Bundy became "very upset" whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken in the middle of the night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a [[lug wrench]], taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=187–94}} Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=96–100}}

[[File:Ted-bundy.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Bundy is facing right in the first photo and facing front in the second. He has medium long hair and is wearing a turtleneck sweater.|Bundy's 1975 Utah [[mug shots]]]]

In September, Bundy sold his Volkswagen Beetle to a Midvale teenager.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=226–27}} Utah police impounded it, and FBI technicians dismantled and searched it. They found hairs matching samples obtained from Caryn Campbell's body.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=188}} Later, they also identified hair strands "microscopically indistinguishable" from those of Melissa Smith and Carol DaRonch.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=250}} FBI lab specialist Robert Neill concluded that the presence of hair strands in one car matching three different victims who had never met one another would be "a coincidence of mind-boggling rarity".{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=189–91}}

On October 2, detectives put Bundy into a lineup. DaRonch immediately identified him as "Officer Roseland". In the same lineup, witnesses from Bountiful picked him as the stranger who lurked about the high school auditorium.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=178–79}} There was insufficient evidence to link him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but more than enough evidence to charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents,{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=24}} and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. "When Ted and I stepped out on the porch to go somewhere," Kloepfer wrote, "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500."{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=119–20}}

In November, the three principal Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met in [[Aspen, Colorado]] and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=213–15}} While officials left the meeting (later known as the Aspen Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could be charged with any of the murders.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=163–65}}

On February 23, 1976, Bundy stood trial for the DaRonch kidnapping. On the advice of his attorney, John O'Connell, Bundy waived his right to a jury due to the negative publicity surrounding the case. On March 1, after a four-day [[bench trial]] and a weekend of deliberation, Judge Stewart Hanson Jr. found him guilty of kidnapping and assault.{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=140–141}}{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=205}} On June 30, he was sentenced to serve a minimum of one to a maximum of 15 years in the Utah State Prison.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=24}} In October, he was found hiding in bushes in the prison yard carrying an "escape kit"—road maps, airline schedules, and a social security card—and spent several weeks in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=265–267}} Later that month, Colorado authorities charged him with Caryn Campbell's murder. After a period of resistance, he waived [[extradition]] proceedings and was transferred to Aspen in January 1977.{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=219}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=25}}

== Escapes ==
[[File:Pitkin County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A two-story brick building with a tall tower is partially obscured by trees.| Pitkin County Courthouse. Bundy jumped from the second window from the left, second story.{{sfn|Winn|Merrill|1980}}]]
On June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported {{convert|40|mi}} from the Garfield County jail in [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]] to [[Pitkin County Courthouse]] in Aspen for a preliminary hearing. He had elected to [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|serve as his own attorney]], and as such, was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=285}} During a recess, he asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case. Bundy was concealed behind a bookcase when he opened a window and jumped from the second story, spraining his right ankle as he landed. After shedding an outer layer of clothing he walked through Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked southward onto [[Aspen Mountain (Colorado)|Aspen Mountain]]. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=197}} The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, he broke into a camping trailer on Maroon Lake, {{convert|10|mi}} south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; but instead of continuing southward, he walked back north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=286–291}} Three days later, he stole a car at the edge of Aspen Golf Course. Cold, sleep-deprived, and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=203–05}} In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Caryn Campbell's body (as his own attorney, Bundy had rights of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]), indicating that his escape was not a spontaneous act, but had been planned.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=290–293}}

Back in jail in Glenwood Springs, Bundy ignored the advice of friends and legal advisors to stay put. The case against him, already weak at best, was deteriorating steadily as pretrial motions consistently resolved in his favor and significant bits of evidence were ruled inadmissible.{{sfn|Winn|Merrill|1980|pp=204–208}} "A more rational defendant might have realized that he stood a good chance of acquittal, and that beating the murder charge in Colorado would probably have dissuaded other prosecutors ... with as little as a year and a half to serve on the DaRonch conviction, had Ted persevered, he could have been a free man."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=206}} Instead, Bundy assembled a new escape plan. He acquired a detailed floor plan of the jail and a hacksaw blade from other inmates, and accumulated $500 in cash, smuggled in over a six-month period, he later said, by visitors—Carole Ann Boone in particular.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=306}} During the evenings, while other prisoners were showering, he sawed a hole about one foot (0.30 m) square between the steel reinforcing bars in his cell's ceiling and, having lost {{convert|35|lb}}, was able to wriggle through it into the crawl space above.&lt;ref name="ChiOmegaKiller" /&gt; In the weeks that followed he made a series of practice runs, exploring the space. Multiple reports from an informant of movement within the ceiling during the night were not investigated.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=209}}

By late 1977, Bundy's impending trial had become a [[cause célèbre]] in the small town of Aspen, and Bundy filed a motion for a [[change of venue]] to [[Denver]].{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=302–03}}  On December 23 the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=304–05}} On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on [[furlough]] with their families,{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=305}} Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, and climbed into the crawlspace. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=308}}—changed into street clothes from the jailer's closet, and walked out the front door to freedom.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=209–11}}

After stealing a car, Bundy drove eastward out of Glenwood Springs, but the car soon broke down in the mountains on [[Interstate 70]]. A passing motorist gave him a ride into Vail, {{convert|60|mi}} to the east. From there he caught a bus to Denver, where he boarded a morning flight to [[Chicago]]. In Glenwood Springs, the jail's skeleton crew did not discover the escape until noon on December 31, more than 17 hours later. By then Bundy was already in Chicago.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=212–13}}

== Florida ==
[[File:TedBundyprisonFlorida.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Bundy casually leans on the wall while dressed in prison garb.|Bundy in Tallahassee during his triple murder indictment, July 1978]]

From Chicago, Bundy traveled by train to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. There, on January 2 in a local tavern, he watched his alma mater UW defeat [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in the [[1978 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]].{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=215–16}} Five days later he stole a car and drove to [[Atlanta]], where he boarded a bus and arrived in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], on the morning of January 8. He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the [[Florida State University]] (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police;{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=7}} but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=31}} He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=318}}

In the early hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU's [[Chi Omega]] sorority house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=332}} Beginning at about 2:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=34}} He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle.{{sfn|Rule|1989|pp=278–79}} In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger.&lt;ref name="EveningIndependent" /&gt; Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=332}} After leaving the sorority house, Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness, and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=340}} On Thomas's bed, police found a semen stain and a pantyhose "mask" containing two hairs "similar to Bundy's in class and characteristic".{{sfn|Rule|1989|p=277}}{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=339}}

On February 8, Bundy drove {{convert|150|mi}} east to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], in a stolen FSU van. In a parking lot he approached 14-year-old Leslie Parmenter, the daughter of Jacksonville Police Department's Chief of Detectives, identifying himself as "Richard Burton, Fire Department", but retreated when Parmenter's older brother arrived and challenged him.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=243–44}} That afternoon, he backtracked {{convert|60|mi}} westward to [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]]. At Lake City Junior High School the following morning, 12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach was summoned to her [[homeroom]] by a teacher to retrieve a forgotten purse; she never returned to class. Seven weeks later, after an intensive search, her partially mummified remains were found in a pig farrowing shed near [[Suwannee River State Park]], {{convert|35|mi}} northwest of Lake City.&lt;ref name="FL-HighwayPatrol" /&gt;{{sfn|Rule|1989|pp=324–25}}

On February 12, with insufficient cash to pay his overdue rent and a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him,{{sfn|Winn|Merrill|1980|pp=245–246}} Bundy stole a car and fled Tallahassee, driving westward across the [[Florida Panhandle]]. Three days later, at around 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., he was stopped by [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] police officer David Lee near the [[Alabama]] state line after a "wants and warrants" check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen.&lt;ref name="pensacolapolice" /&gt; When told he was under arrest, Bundy kicked Lee's legs out from under him and took off running. Lee fired a warning shot followed by a second round, gave chase and tackled him. The two struggled over Lee's gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested Bundy.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=366}} In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students, 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=367}} Also found were a pair of dark-rimmed non-prescription glasses and a pair of plaid slacks, later identified as the disguise worn by "Richard Burton, Fire Department" in Jacksonville.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=398}} As Lee transported his suspect to jail, unaware that he had just arrested one of the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]], he heard Bundy say, "I wish you had killed me."{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=321–23}}

== Florida trials, marriage ==
[[File:TedBundyincustody.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A smiling Bundy holds a sheaf of papers and enters a vehicle. He is escorted by two police officers.|Departing a preliminary hearing, Miami, 1979]]

Following a change of venue to Miami, Bundy stood trial for the Chi Omega homicides and assaults in June 1979.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=274}} The trial was covered by 250 reporters from five continents and was the first to be televised nationally in the United States.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=10}} Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense. From the beginning, he "sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion", Nelson later wrote. "Ted [was] facing murder charges, with a possible death sentence, and all that mattered to him apparently was that he be in charge."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=87, 91}}

According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee public defender and member of the defense team, a pre-trial [[plea bargain]] was negotiated in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because "prospects of losing at trial were very good."{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=124}} Bundy, on the other hand, saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a "tactical move": he could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=271–72; attorney Millard Farmer devised this strategy as a means of "selling" Bundy on the plea deal, according to this account}}{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=125}} At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal. "It made him realize he was going to have to stand up in front of the whole world and say he was guilty", Minerva said. "He just couldn't do it."&lt;ref name="Word1999-01-24" /&gt;

At trial, crucial testimony came from Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy in the vicinity of the Chi Omega House that evening,{{sfn|Dekle|2011|pp=154–155}} and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=227, 283}}&lt;ref name="St.Petersburg1" /&gt; Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic [[odontologist]]s Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=230, 283–85}}{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=156}} The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979, of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary.

Six months later, a second trial took place in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], for the abduction and murder of Kimberly Leach.&lt;ref name="Bell-KimberlyLeach" /&gt; Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=303}} Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=306–07}}

During the penalty phase of the trial, Bundy took advantage of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, in the presence of a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified on his behalf during both trials, and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=308–10}}&lt;ref name="AP1981-09-30wife-pregnant" /&gt;

Shortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, Bundy initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth. Speaking mostly in third person to avoid "the stigma of confession", he began for the first time to divulge details of his crimes and thought processes.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=15–17}}

He recounted his career as a thief, confirming Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=37–39}} "The big payoff for me," he said, "was actually ''possessing'' whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken." Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=41}} Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to "totally possess" his victims.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=102–14}} At first, he killed his victims "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [being] caught"; but later, murder became part of the "adventure". "The ''ultimate'' possession was, in fact, the taking of the life", he said. "And then ... the physical possession of the remains."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=124–26}}

Bundy also confided in Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI [[Behavioral Analysis Unit]]. Hagmaier was struck by the "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" that Bundy took in murder. "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... [the victim] becomes a part of you, and you [two] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them." Bundy told Hagmaier that he considered himself to be an "amateur", an "impulsive" killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his "prime" or "predator" phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=380–96}}

In July 1984, Raiford guards found two hacksaw blades that Bundy had hidden in his cell. A steel bar in one of the cell's windows had been sawed completely through at the top and bottom and glued back into place with a homemade soap-based adhesive.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=528}}&lt;ref name="DN-trials" /&gt; Several months later, guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in the cell, and Bundy was again moved to a different cell .{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=532}}
[[File:Ted Bundy mug shot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An unsmiling Bundy faces the camera. |Mug shot taken the day after sentencing for the murder of Kimberly Leach]]
Sometime during this period, Bundy was attacked by a group of his fellow death row inmates. Though he denied having been assaulted, a number of inmates confessed to the crime, characterized by one source as a "gang rape".{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=216}} Shortly thereafter, he was charged with a disciplinary infraction for unauthorized correspondence with another high-profile criminal, [[John Hinckley, Jr.|John Hinckley, Jr]].{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=155–156}} In October 1984, Bundy contacted [[Robert D. Keppel|Robert Keppel]] and offered to share his self-proclaimed expertise in serial killer psychology{{sfn|Rule|2009|p = 532}} in the ongoing hunt for his successor in Washington, the [[Gary Ridgway|Green River Killer]].{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p = 176}} Keppel and Green River Task Force detective [[Dave Reichert]] interviewed Bundy, but [[Gary Leon Ridgway]] remained at large for a further 17 years.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp = 33, 101, 135}} Keppel published a detailed documentation of the Green River interviews,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p = }} and later collaborated with Michaud on another examination of the interview material.{{sfn|Keppel|Michaud|2011|loc = Kindle location 1690}} Bundy coined the nickname "The Riverman" for [[Gary Ridgway]], which was later used for the title of Keppel's book, ''The Riverman: Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Peyton|last=Whitely|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/aug/07/ted-bundy-helped-green-river-investigation/|title=Ted Bundy Helped Green River Investigation Detective Says Bundy Met With King County Officials Probing Killings|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|date=August 7, 1995|access-date=May 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1986, an execution date (March 4) was set on the Chi Omega convictions; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled.{{sfn|Mello|1997|pp=103–104}} In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was the full range of his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing bodies until [[putrefaction]] forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7431–98}} In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless face, and he repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. "If you've got time," he told Hagmaier, "they can be anything you want them to be."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=334–35}} He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw,&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=339}} and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment for a period of time before disposing of them.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=378, 393}}

Less than 15 hours before the scheduled July 2 execution, the [[Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case for review on multiple technicalities—including Bundy's mental competency to stand trial, and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6–6 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=111}}—that, ultimately, was never resolved.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bundy v.

Within hours of that final denial, a firm execution date of January 24, 1989, was announced.{{sfn|Mello|1997|pp=103–106}} Bundy's journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: "Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved Bundy as fast as they could ... Even the prosecutors acknowledged that Bundy's lawyers never employed delaying tactics. Though people everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, Ted Bundy was actually on the fast track."{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=297}}

With all appeal avenues exhausted and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. He confessed to Keppel that he had committed all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides for which he was the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities).{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=337}} He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=516}} but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things I did to [Kloepfer]," he told Keppel, "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz."){{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=395}}

He described in graphic detail his abduction of Georgann Hawkins from the brightly lit UW alley; how he had lured her to his car before rendering her unconscious with a crowbar he had earlier placed beside the vehicle before handcuffing her and driving her to Issaquah, where he had strangled her,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=367–78}} before spending the entire night with her body, and later revisited her corpse on three later occasions.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=336}}  He also admitted, for the first time, that he returned to the UW alley the morning after Hawkins's abduction and murder. There, in the very midst of a major crime scene investigation, he located and gathered Hawkins's earrings and one of her shoes, where he had left them in the adjoining parking lot, and departed, unobserved. "It was a feat so brazen," wrote Keppel, "that it astonishes police even today."{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=22}}

"He described the Issaquah crime scene [where the bones of Ott, Naslund, and Hawkins were found], and it was almost like he was just there", Keppel said. "Like he was seeing everything. He was infatuated with the idea because he spent so much time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time."{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=519}} Nelson's impressions were similar: "It was the absolute [[misogyny]] of his crimes that stunned me," she wrote, "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=258}}

Bundy confessed to detectives from Idaho, Utah, and Colorado that he had committed numerous additional homicides, including several that were unknown to the police. He explained that when he was in Utah he could bring his victims back to his apartment, "where he could reenact scenarios depicted on the covers of detective magazines."&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; A new ulterior strategy quickly became apparent: he withheld many details, hoping to parlay the incomplete information into yet another stay of execution. "There are other buried remains in Colorado", he admitted, but refused to elaborate.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7600–05}} The new strategy—immediately dubbed "Ted's bones-for-time scheme"—served only to deepen the resolve of authorities to see Bundy executed on schedule, and yielded little new detailed information.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=352–358}} In cases where he did give details, nothing was found.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=363}} Colorado detective Matt Lindvall interpreted this as a conflict between his desire to postpone his execution by divulging information and his need to remain in "total possession—the only person who knew his victims' true resting places."{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7550–58}}

When it became clear that no further stays would be forthcoming from the courts, Bundy supporters began lobbying for the only remaining option, executive clemency. Diana Weiner, a young Florida attorney and Bundy's last purported love interest,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=136–137, 255, 302–304}} asked the families of several Colorado and Utah victims to petition Florida Governor [[Bob Martinez]] for a postponement to give Bundy time to reveal more information.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=264}} All refused.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=518}} "The families already believed that the victims were dead and that Ted had killed them", wrote Nelson. "They didn't need his confession."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=256}} Martinez made it clear that he would not agree to further delays in any case. "We are not going to have the system manipulated", he told reporters. "For him to be negotiating for his life over the bodies of victims is despicable."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=335–36}}

Boone had championed Bundy's innocence throughout all of his trials and felt "deeply betrayed" by his admission that he was, in fact, guilty. She moved back to Washington with her daughter and refused to accept his phone call on the day that he was executed. "She was hurt by his relationship with Diana [Weiner]," Nelson wrote, "and devastated by his sudden wholesale confessions in his last days."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=271, 303}}

Hagmaier was present during Bundy's final interviews with investigators. On the eve of his execution, he talked of suicide. "He did not want to give the state the satisfaction of watching him die", Hagmaier said.&lt;ref name="Word1999-01-24" /&gt;

== Death ==
Bundy died in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on January 24, 1989; he was 42 years old. Hundreds of revelers—including 20 off-duty police officers, by one account&lt;ref name="Bundy'sWill"/&gt;—sang, danced and set off fireworks in a pasture across the street from the prison as the execution was carried out,&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2,000 Cheer"/&gt; then cheered loudly as the white hearse containing his corpse departed the prison.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=311–321}} His body was cremated in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]],{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=323}} and his ashes scattered at an undisclosed location in the [[Cascade Range]] of Washington State, in accordance with his [[will (law)|will]].&lt;ref name="Bundy'sWill"/&gt;{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=xxxvi–xxxvii}}

== Modus operandi and victim profiles ==

Bundy was an unusually organized and calculating criminal who used his extensive knowledge of law enforcement methodologies to elude identification and capture for years.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=283–285}} His crime scenes were distributed over large geographic areas; his victim count had risen to at least 20 before it became clear that numerous investigators in widely disparate jurisdictions were hunting the same man.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=285}} His assault methods of choice were blunt trauma and strangulation, two relatively silent techniques that could be accomplished with common household items.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=30}} He deliberately avoided firearms due to the noise they made and the [[ballistics|ballistic]] evidence they left behind.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=111}} He was a "meticulous researcher" who explored his surroundings in minute detail, looking for safe sites to seize and dispose of victims.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=257}} He was unusually skilled at minimizing physical evidence.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=87}} His fingerprints were never found at a crime scene, nor any other incontrovertible evidence of his guilt, a fact he repeated often during the years in which he attempted to maintain his innocence.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=16}}
[[File:Ted Bundy in court.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bundy is seen from the side. He is wearing a striped business suit and has his hand positioned near his chin.|Bundy in a Miami courtroom in 1979, ten years before his execution]]
Other significant obstacles for law enforcement were Bundy's generic, essentially anonymous physical features,{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=80}} and a curious [[chameleon]]-like ability to change his appearance almost at will.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=159}} Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=vii}} In person, "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't even sure you were looking at the same person", said Stewart Hanson, Jr., the judge in the DaRonch trial. "He [was] really a changeling."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=176}} Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=73}} He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=241}} Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=172}}

Bundy's ''[[modus operandi]]'' evolved in organization and sophistication over time, as is typical of serial murderers, according to FBI experts.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Early on, it consisted of forcible late-night entry followed by a violent attack with a blunt weapon on a sleeping victim. Some victims were sexually assaulted with inert objects; all except Healy were left as they lay, unconscious or dead.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=14–16}} As his methodology evolved Bundy became progressively more organized in his choice of victims and crime scenes. He would employ various ruses designed to lure his victim to the vicinity of his vehicle where he had pre-positioned a weapon, usually a crowbar. In many cases he wore a plaster cast on one leg or a sling on one arm, and sometimes hobbled on crutches, then requested assistance in carrying something to his vehicle. Bundy was regarded as handsome and charismatic by many of his victims, traits he exploited to win their confidence.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=3–6}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=12}}&lt;ref name="Time25crimes" /&gt; "Ted lured females", Michaud wrote, "the way a lifeless silk flower can dupe a honey bee."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=14}} Once near or inside his vehicle the victim would be overpowered, bludgeoned, and restrained with handcuffs. Most were sexually assaulted and strangled, either at the primary crime scene or (more commonly) after transport to a pre-selected secondary site, often a considerable distance away.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=12–13}}  In situations where his looks and charm were not useful, he invoked authority by identifying himself as a police officer or firefighter. Toward the end of his spree, in Florida, perhaps under the stress of being a fugitive, he regressed to indiscriminate attacks on sleeping victims.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

At secondary sites he would remove and later burn the victim's clothing,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=196}} or in at least one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a [[Goodwill Industries]] collection bin.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7481}} Bundy explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=196}} (A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to Kimberly Leach.){{sfn|Rule|2009|p=279}} He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=334}} and to groom or dress up the cadavers.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7583–91, 7655}} Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen.&lt;ref name="Mystique" /&gt; He took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. "When you work hard to do something right," he told Hagmaier, "you don't want to forget it."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=334–35}} Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an "essential component", he told Keppel, and later Michaud; he needed to be "extremely drunk" while on the prowl{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=379}}{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7046}} in order to "significantly diminish" his inhibitions and to "sedate" the "dominant personality" that he feared might prevent his inner "entity" from acting on his impulses.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=76–77}}

All of Bundy's known victims were white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all were between the ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He apparently never approached anyone he might have met before.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=283–285}} (In their last conversation before his execution, Bundy told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her "when he felt the power of his sickness building in him."){{sfn|Kendall|1981|p=182}} Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long straight hair, parted in the middle—like Stephanie Brooks, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that Bundy's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=431–32}} Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: "[T]hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive", he told Hugh Aynesworth. "Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ... [but] almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=156}} He did concede that youth and beauty were "absolutely indispensable criteria" in his choice of victims.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=85}}

After Bundy's execution, Ann Rule was surprised and troubled to hear from numerous "sensitive, intelligent, kind young women", who wrote or called to say they were deeply depressed because Bundy was dead. Many had corresponded with him, "each believing that she was his only one". Several said they suffered [[nervous breakdown]]s when he died. "Even in death, Ted damaged women," Rule wrote. "To get well, they must realize that they were conned by the master conman. They are grieving for a shadow man that never existed."{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=612-3}}

== Pathology ==
Bundy underwent multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the [[New York University School of Medicine]] and an authority on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]],{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=152}} but later changed her impression more than once.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=331}} She also suggested the possibility of a [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person&amp;nbsp;... [she] suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality&amp;nbsp;... that was the day I was afraid of him.{{' "}}{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=231–232}}

While experts found Bundy's precise diagnosis elusive, the majority of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other [[Psychosis|psychoses]],&lt;ref name="Mack1999" /&gt; and toward [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD).{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=13}}  Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as "sociopaths" or "[[psychopathy|psychopaths]]"&lt;ref name="ASPD diagnosis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobbert|first=Duane|title=Understanding Personality Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBAE1Z1xaeoC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=July 1, 2013 |year=2007|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-275-98960-6|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade;&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior;&lt;ref name="LilienfeldArkowitz2007-11-28" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[Ted knew the difference] between right and wrong, but it didn't matter, because ''he'' was special, and ''he'' deserved to have and do what he wanted. ''He'' was the center of the world; we were all paper-doll figures who didn't matter."{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=611–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an absence of guilt or remorse.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt; "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not having to deal with guilt."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=281}} There was also evidence of [[narcissism]], poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. "Sociopaths", prosecutor [[George R. Dekle, Sr.|George Dekle]] wrote, "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody."{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=131}} "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=288}} In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson.

On the afternoon before he was executed, Bundy granted an interview to [[James Dobson]], a psychologist and founder of the [[Evangelicalism|Christian evangelical]] organization [[Focus on the Family]].&lt;ref name="BundyDobsonInterview" /&gt; He used the opportunity to make new claims about violence in the media and the [[pornography|pornographic]] "roots" of his crimes. "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it."&lt;ref name="Shapiro2005" /&gt; Violence in the media, he said, "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys "down the road to being Ted Bundys."&lt;ref name="Meyers" /&gt; The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=319}} "You are going to kill me," he said, "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."&lt;ref name="Meyers" /&gt;

While Nelson was apparently convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=319}} most biographers,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=320}}{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=611}}{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=401–02}} researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=P.|last=Hyatt|title=Ted Bundy's Final Interview|url=http://statement-analysis.blogspot.com/2012/10/statement-analysis-ted-bundys-final.html|website=Statement Analysis|publisher=[[Blogspot.com]]|date=October 3, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2013|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907141045/http://statement-analysis.blogspot.com/2012/10/statement-analysis-ted-bundys-final.html |archive-date=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other observers&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt; have concluded that his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=318}} He told Dobson that "true crime" detective magazines had "corrupted" him and "fueled [his] fantasies ... to the point of becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [on only] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up."{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=611–12}} He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=340}} "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. "The problem was Bundy."{{sfn|Dekle|2011|p=219}}  "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," wrote Rule. "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on ''himself'', but on ''us''."{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=611}}

Rule and Aynesworth both noted that for Bundy, the fault always lay with someone or something else. While he eventually confessed to 30 murders, he never accepted responsibility for any of them, even when offered that opportunity prior to the Chi Omega trial—which would have spared him the death penalty.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=603–04}} He deflected blame onto a wide variety of scapegoats, including his abusive grandfather, the absence of his biological father, the concealment of his true parentage, alcohol, the media, the police (whom he accused of planting evidence), "society" in general, violence on television and, ultimately, true crime periodicals and pornography.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=216–22, 250}} He blamed television programming—which he watched mostly on sets that he had stolen—for "brainwashing" him into stealing credit cards.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=404}} On at least one occasion he even tried to [[Victim blaming|blame his victims]]: "I have known people who ... radiate vulnerability", he wrote in a 1977 letter to Kloepfer. "Their facial expressions say 'I am afraid of you.' These people invite abuse ... By expecting to be hurt, do they subtly encourage it?"{{sfn|Kendall|1981|p=167}}

A significant element of delusion permeated his thinking: &lt;blockquote&gt;Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed that one of his victims was missing, because he imagined America to be a place where everyone is invisible except to themselves. And he was always astounded when people testified that they had seen him in incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=288–289}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. "He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," she said.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=340}} "A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt," Keppel wrote, "walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=xi}}  Nelson agreed. "Each time he was forced to make an actual confession," she wrote, "he had to leap a steep barrier he had built inside himself long ago."{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=280}}

== Victims ==
The night before his execution, Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published estimates have run as high as 100 or more,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=C.R.|last=Douglas|title=Ted Bundy's lawyer: Bundy killed more than 100 women -- and a man|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-05-23/news/kcpq-bundys-lawyer-he-killed-over-100-women--and-a-man-20120523_1_ted-bundy-serial-killers-murder|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Orlando, Florida|date=May 23, 2012|accessdate=November 11, 2013|page=Q3|dead-url=no|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131110140852/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-05-23/news/kcpq-bundys-lawyer-he-killed-over-100-women--and-a-man-20120523_1_ted-bundy-serial-killers-murder |archivedate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=257}} He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder "publicized", there "could be one that was not."{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=199}} When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it."{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=335}} Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=257}} but Robert Keppel wrote that "[Ted] and I both knew [the total] was much higher."{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=399–400}} "I don't think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's [[last rites]]. "That was my impression, my strong impression."{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|p=363}}

On the evening before his execution, Bundy reviewed his victim tally with Bill Hagmaier on a state-by-state basis for a total of 30 homicides:{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=339}}

=== Other possible victims ===
Bundy remains a suspect in several unsolved homicides, and is likely responsible for others that may never be identified; in 1987 he confided to Keppel that there were "some murders" that he would "never talk about", because they were committed "too close to home", "too close to family", or involved "victims who were very young".{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7375}}
* Ann Marie Burr, age 8, vanished from her Tacoma home on August 31, 1961,&lt;ref name="NamUS4593" /&gt; when Bundy was 14. The Burr house was on Bundy's newspaper delivery route. The victim's father was certain that he saw Bundy in a ditch at a construction site on the nearby UPS campus the morning his daughter disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, R.

* Flight attendants Lisa E. Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a piece of lumber as they slept in their basement apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966&lt;ref name="SpokaneDaily" /&gt; near the [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7135}} Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss as a result of the attack, later contacted Ann Rule: "I know that it was Ted Bundy who did that to us," she wrote, "but I can't tell you how I know."{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=509}} In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=386}}
* Vacationing college friends Susan Davis and Elizabeth Perry, both 19, were stabbed to death on May 30, 1969.&lt;ref name="DailyNews" /&gt; Their car was found that day abandoned beside the [[Garden State Parkway]] outside [[Somers Point, New Jersey]], near Atlantic City, {{convert|60|mi}} south of Philadelphia; and their bodies—one nude, one fully clothed—were found in nearby woods three days later.&lt;ref name="Free Lance" /&gt; Bundy attended Temple University from January through May 1969 and apparently did not move west until after Memorial Day weekend. While Bundy's accounts of his earliest crimes varied considerably between interviews, he told forensic psychologist Art Norman that his first murder victims were two women in the Philadelphia area.&lt;ref name="DailyNews" /&gt; Biographer Richard Larsen believed that Bundy committed the murders using his feigned-injury ruse, based on an investigator's interview with Julia, Bundy's aunt: Ted, she said, was wearing a leg cast due to an automobile accident on the weekend of the homicides, and therefore could not have traveled from Philadelphia to the [[New Jersey Shore|Jersey Shore]]; there is no official record of any such accident.&lt;ref name="'69 Killings3" /&gt; Bundy is considered a "strong suspect", but the case remains open.&lt;ref name="'69 Killings3" /&gt;

* Joyce LePage, 21, was last seen on July 22, 1971, on the campus of [[Washington State University]], where she was an undergraduate. Nine months later, her skeletal remains were found wrapped in carpeting and military blankets, bound with rope, in a deep ravine south of [[Pullman, Washington]].

'''''The Flash''''' is an American [[superhero fiction|superhero]] television series developed by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Andrew Kreisberg]], and [[Geoff Johns]], airing on [[The CW]]. It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen / Flash]], a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to move at superhuman speeds. It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', existing in the same [[Arrowverse|fictional universe]]. The series follows [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Allen]], portrayed by [[Grant Gustin]], a crime scene investigator who gains super-human speed, which he uses to fight criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities.

Initially envisioned as a [[backdoor pilot]], the positive reception Gustin received during two appearances as Barry on ''Arrow'' led to executives choosing to develop a full pilot to make use of a larger budget and help flesh out Barry's world in more detail. [[Colleen Atwood]], costume designer for ''Arrow'', was brought in to design the Flash's suit. The creative team wanted to make sure that the Flash would resemble his comic book counterpart, and not simply be a poor imitation. The series is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada.

''The Flash'' premiered in North America on October 7, 2014, where the pilot became the second-most watched premiere in the history of The CW, after ''[[The Vampire Diaries (TV series)|The Vampire Diaries]]'' in 2009. It has been well received by critics and audiences, and won the [[People's Choice Award]] for "Favorite New TV Drama" in 2014.  The series, together with ''Arrow'', has spun characters out to their own show, ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', which premiered on January 21, 2016. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]], which premiered on October 9, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |title='Riverdale,' 'Flash,' 'Supernatural' Among 10 CW Renewals |last=Goldberg |first=Leslie |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=April 2, 2018 |accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PremiereDate"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/the-cw-fall-2018-premiere-dates-charmed-all-american-legacies-1202414400/ |title=The CW Sets Fall Premiere Dates, Including Sunday Lineup &amp; Three Series Debuts |last=Pedersen |first=Erik |date=June 20, 2018 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621004604/https://deadline.com/2018/06/the-cw-fall-2018-premiere-dates-charmed-all-american-legacies-1202414400/ |archive-date=June 21, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of The Flash episodes}}
In season one, after witnessing his mother's supernatural murder, Barry Allen is taken in by Detective Joe West and his family. Barry becomes a brilliant but socially awkward crime scene investigator for the [[Central City Police Department]]. A particle accelerator malfunctions, bathing the city center with a radiation during a thunderstorm, and Barry is struck by lightning. Awakening after a coma, he discovers he can move at superhuman speeds. Harrison Wells, the accelerator's designer, describes Barry's nature as "[[metahuman]]". Barry vows to use his gifts to protect [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. As the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Barry also pursues his mother's murderer, the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]].&lt;ref name="S1LogLine"/&gt;

In season two, after a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] event occurs, the Flash is recognized as Central City's hero. However, the event brings a new threat from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel earth]]: [[Hunter Zolomon#Television|Zoom]], a demonic speedster who seeks to eliminate all speedsters throughout the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]]. Harrison Wells' parallel universe counterpart nicknamed "Harry", and his daughter [[Jesse Quick|Jesse]], work to help Barry stop Zoom and explore the multiverse. Joe and his daughter, Iris, struggle with the arrival of Iris's brother [[Wally West]]. After Zoom kills Barry's father, and following Zoom's defeat, Barry travels back in time to save his mother's life.

In season three, by changing his past, Barry alters the timeline, resulting in the alternate timeline "Flashpoint". Though he is somewhat able to restore the timeline, this creates new threats, including the emergence of [[Savitar (comics)#Television|Savitar]], a god-like speedster with a grudge against Barry. After Harry and Jesse return to Earth-2, another Wells [[doppelgänger]] is recruited: the novelist "H.R." Wells. Both Wally and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] begin to manifest metahuman abilities; Wally suits up as the speedster [[Kid Flash]], while Caitlin is forced to suppress her ice-powers to prevent Killer Frost from emerging. When Barry accidentally travels to the future and sees Iris killed by Savitar, he becomes desperate to change the future to prevent that from happening. After saving Iris and defeating Savitar, Barry takes his place in the Speed Force in order to repent for his creation of Flashpoint.

In season four, following Barry's departure, Wally and Cisco have barely been able to protect Central City. When a new foe defeats them easily, requesting a battle against the Flash, the team decides to bring Barry back. While they manage to do so, Barry's return releases dark matter, turning a dozen people on a city bus into metahumans. One of these metas is private detective [[Ralph Dibny]], who joins the Flash's team. The team later encounters [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Clifford DeVoe]], an adversary with the fastest mind alive, who has orchestrated Barry's return from the Speed Force as well as the creation of the bus metas. Harry Wells, with his parallel universe counterparts, establish an alliance coined the Council of Wells to assist Team Flash in stopping DeVoe. Following the Thinker's defeat, the team is approached by Barry and Iris' daughter from the future, [[Tornado Twins|Nora West-Allen]], who claims to have made "a big, big mistake".

In season five, Barry is approached by his daughter, Nora West-Allen, who has arrived from the future to spend time with him. However, the team quickly discovers that Nora's presence not only altered the timeline, but unleashed a new threat in the form of Cicada, a serial killer bent on killing metahumans. In addition, they discover that meta-technology was created following their battle with the Thinker, meaning anyone wielding meta-tech can utilize the power of a metahuman. The Council of Wells sends one of their doppelgängers, detective Sherloque Wells, to aid Team Flash in countering these crises.&amp;nbsp;

==Production==

===Development===
On July 30, 2013, it was announced that ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' co-creators [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Andrew Kreisberg]], ''Arrow'' pilot director [[David Nutter]], and DC Comics CCO [[Geoff Johns]] would develop a television series based on the Flash for [[The CW]], and it would detail Barry Allen's origin.&lt;ref name="DeadlineAnnouncement"/&gt; Kreisberg revealed after the announcement that Allen would first appear as a recurring character on ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' in three episodes of season two—all written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns—and the last of the episodes would act as a [[backdoor pilot]] for the new show. Kreisberg added that Allen would be a forensic scientist and the introduction of his superpowers, as well as the reactions to this, will be very human and grounded. Johns stated that the character of the Flash in the show would resemble his comic book counterpart, complete with his trademark red costume, and not be a poor imitation. Kreisberg elaborated: "No sweat suits or strange code names; he ''will be'' The Flash." While researching the best way to depict the Flash's lightning speed, Johns stated it would not just be the standard "blurring around".&lt;ref name="THRJuly2013"/&gt;

Barry ultimately appeared twice in ''Arrow''{{'s}} second season, with the planned backdoor pilot cancelled in favor of a traditional pilot by The CW executives, who had been impressed by early cuts of Barry's first two episodes on ''Arrow''. This allowed the creative team to flesh out Barry's story and his world on a bigger budget, as opposed to a backdoor pilot's constraint of incorporating characters from the parent show. The pilot was officially ordered on January 29, 2014, and was written by Berlanti, Kreisberg, and Johns, and directed by Nutter.&lt;ref name="DeadlinePilot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PilotOrdered"/&gt; On May 8, 2014, ''The Flash'' was officially picked up as a series, with an initial order of 13 episodes.&lt;ref name="PickUp" /&gt; Three more scripts were ordered in September 2014 following a positive response to newly completed episodes by executives,&lt;ref name="Deadline3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2014/09/the-flash-jane-the-virgin-additional-scripts-cw-838768/ |title=CW's 'The Flash' &amp; 'Jane The Virgin' Get Backup Script Orders Ahead Of Premieres |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=September 23, 2014 |accessdate=September 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925082725/http://deadline.com/2014/09/the-flash-jane-the-virgin-additional-scripts-cw-838768/ |archivedate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a back ten was ordered the next month for a full 23-episode season.&lt;ref name="S1SeasonOrder" /&gt;

With the commencement of production on the series' second season, former ''Arrow'' and ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' writer [[Gabrielle Stanton]] was promoted to executive producer and showrunner; after having served as consulting producer and writer on the first season's finale "Fast Enough".&lt;ref name="Stanton1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2015/08/17/once-upon-a-time-season-5-belle-merida-spoilers/ |title=Matt's Inside Line: Scoop on Once, Arrow, Castle, The Flash, Scandal, Gotham, Reign, Haven and More |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |work=[[TV Line]] |date=August 17, 2015 |accessdate=August 18, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064756/http://tvline.com/2015/08/17/once-upon-a-time-season-5-belle-merida-spoilers/ |archivedate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later reported that Kreisberg would be returning to sole showrunner duties at an unspecified time.&lt;ref name="THRdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/andrew-kreisberg-deal-warner-bros-831387 |title='The Flash' Boss Andrew Kreisberg Inks Overall Deal With Warner Bros.

In May 2017, it was reported that [[Aaron and Todd Helbing|Aaron Helbing]] would be departing the series. Helbing had served as a writer since the first season, and as co-showrunner, along with his brother [[Aaron and Todd Helbing|Todd]] and Kreisberg, since the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/05/22/aaron-helbing-off-the-flash-in-season-4/ |title=Aaron Helbing Off the Flash in Season 4 |last=Burlingame |first=Russ |publisher=Comicbook.com |date=May 22, 2017 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
The costume was designed by [[Colleen Atwood]], who also designed the costumes for ''Arrow''.&lt;ref name="Costume" /&gt; It features a burgundy color scheme, a masked helmet, and gold accents throughout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2578617/First-photo-Grant-Gustin-costume-The-Flash-new-TV-series-revealed.html |title=Ride the lightning!

According to Atwood "It was all about a costume that could sell speed, Grant [Gustin] was continually moving in the suit, so it had to be designed to make that all happen visually and functionally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fashionista.com/2015/03/superhero-costume-design |title=How Superhero Costumes are Made |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2015 |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Yag1w5Nr?url=http://fashionista.com/2015/03/superhero-costume-design |archivedate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It initially took Gustin approximately 40 minutes to get into his costume, as the first cowl was prosthetic and had to be zipped and glued to his face. This was cut down to approximately 15 minutes by episode eight, when designers were able to develop a new cowl that easily slid over Gustin's face and locked into place.&lt;ref name="AccessHoll"/&gt; Maya Mani replaced Atwood as the costume designer for the second season and made slight changes to the Flash costume, such as changing the color of his crest from yellow to white, being faithful to the Flash costume from the comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fashionista.com/2015/09/fall-tv-costume-design-october |title=Costume secrets from the upcoming seasons of 'Reign,' 'The Good Wife' and more |date=September 28, 2015 |website=Fashionista |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929040254/http://fashionista.com/2015/09/fall-tv-costume-design-october |archive-date=September 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |access-date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Production on the pilot began in March 2014, with filming taking place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2014/03/flash-runs-past-vancouver-art-gallery/ |title=Flash Running After Villains in Vancouver (Photos &amp; Videos) |publisher=Vancity Buzz |date=March 2014 |accessdate=June 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621050930/http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2014/03/flash-runs-past-vancouver-art-gallery/ |archivedate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional filming for the series takes place in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="PortlandFilming" /&gt; On how action sequences are shot for the series, compared to ''Arrow'', Gustin said, "When [''Arrow''] shoot[s] action sequences, pretty much what you see is what you get and they're really doing everything. We do a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we're going to be in and then they're putting us in later in [[Post-production|post]]. I do a lot of the fighting. I don't have to do it full speed and then they ramp it up and a lot of people have to freeze and I keep moving. Then I have to clear frame and step back into frame. It's really tedious stuff that we have to do. On theirs, they learn fight choreography and they shoot it from the perfect angles and what you see is what you get."&lt;ref name="FightShooting" /&gt; Production on the third season began in early July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/content/flash-season-3-started-filming |title=The Flash Season 3 Started Filming |publisher=Cosmic Book News |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710052206/http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/content/flash-season-3-started-filming |archivedate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arrow'' composer [[Blake Neely]] is the primary composer of the series, and was first hired in April 2014 to score the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/04/10/blake-neely-to-score-the-cws-the-flash/ |title=Blake Neely to Score The CW's 'The Flash' |publisher=''Film Music Reporter'' |date=April 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 5, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925110912/http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/04/10/blake-neely-to-score-the-cws-the-flash/ |archivedate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neely" /&gt; He had previously composed a theme for Barry Allen which was featured in ''Arrow''{{'}}s [[List of Arrow episodes#Season 2 (2013–14)|season two]] episodes "The Scientist" and "Three Ghosts". The theme was titled "The Scientist" when it was released on the [[Arrow (TV series)#Music|''Arrow: Season 2'' soundtrack]]. According to Neely, "It had to be different [from ''Arrow''] ... but it also couldn't be so different that it couldn't fit in the ''Arrow'' universe, ... it had to be in a style that could hold hands with ''Arrow''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neely |first1=Blake |title=CBR TV: Super Composer Finds "Flash" &amp; "Arrow" Inspiration for "Legends," Makes "Supergirl" Fun |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/cbr-tv-super-composer-finds-flash-arrow-inspiration-for-legends-makes-supergirl-fun |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=September 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920100039/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/cbr-tv-super-composer-finds-flash-arrow-inspiration-for-legends-makes-supergirl-fun |archivedate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 18, 2014, WaterTower Music released a selection of music from ''The Flash''/''Arrow'' crossover episodes, as well as two bonus tracks from their respective 2014 midseason finales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watertower-music.com/releases_spotlight.php?search=WTM39625 |title=The Flash vs. Arrow: Music Selections from the Epic 2-Night Event |work=WaterTower Music |accessdate=December 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220000519/http://www.watertower-music.com/releases_spotlight.php?search=WTM39625 |archivedate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season, two-disc soundtrack was released on October 16, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/08/12/la-la-land-records-to-release-soundtrack-album-for-the-cws-the-flash/ |title=La-La Land Records to Release Soundtrack Album for The CW's 'The Flash' |publisher=Film Music Reporter |date=August 12, 2015 |accessdate=September 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925104507/http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/08/12/la-la-land-records-to-release-soundtrack-album-for-the-cws-the-flash/ |archivedate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season's soundtrack was released digitally on July 22, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Flash: Original Television Soundtrack – Season 2 |url=http://www.watertower-music.com/releases/release.php?title=flash2 |website=WaterTower Music |publisher=WaterTower Music |accessdate=August 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819002607/http://www.watertower-music.com/releases/release.php?title=flash2 |archivedate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in CD format on July 26, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE FLASH – SEASON 2 |website=La-La Land Records |publisher=La-La Land Records |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound design===
The sound design for the show is handled by Mark Camperell. The sound effect for Barry is made up of elements of thunder, electricity, jets, fireballs, and various custom whooshes and impacts. Speaking about designing the sound for The Flash's ability, Mark says: "My approach for the sounds of The Flash's ability was to editorially treat him like a really aggressively driven hot rod. This doesn't mean that I used car sounds for him, though. What I mean is that when thinking about how to edit his sounds, I thought about it like cutting a car chase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asoundeffect.com/the-flash-sound-design/ |title=Sounds for Superheroes: Behind the Supersonic Sound Design for The Flash |publisher=Asoundeffect.com |date=October 5, 2015 |accessdate=October 6, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006181824/http://www.asoundeffect.com/the-flash-sound-design/ |archivedate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Gustin's debut as Barry Allen in ''Arrow'' and the potential for a series, [[IGN]]'s Jesse Schedeen stated his concern: "Gustin doesn't come across as leading man material. His awkward bumbling intertwining with Felicity's was cute, but rarely did I get the impression that this character could or should be given his own spinoff series."&lt;ref name="IGNScientistReview" /&gt; Schedeen eventually warmed up to the character, however, once the "dorkiness and social awkwardness" were downplayed a bit and the emphasis was placed on "his keen scientific mind".&lt;ref name="IGNBlastRadiusReview" /&gt;

The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 97% approval rating with an average rating of 7.5/10 based on 58 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "''The Flash'' benefits from its purposefully light atmosphere, making it a superhero show uniquely geared toward genre fans as well as novices."&lt;ref name="S1RT" /&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 73 out of 100, based on 27 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="S1MC" /&gt; IGN's Eric Goldman and Joshua Yehl praised the show's premise and cast after viewing a press screening copy of the pilot. Goldman and Yehl favorably compared it to ''Arrow'', stating that ''The Flash'' progresses with a confidence that ''Arrow'' did not get until later in the series.&lt;ref name="IGNPilotThoughts" /&gt; Reviews for the series became increasingly positive as the season progressed, with the finale receiving critical acclaim. Noel Murray of [[The A.V. Club]] gave the season a B+ overall, giving praise to the pacing of the plot, the performances of the cast and the special effects, and also pointing out the series' boldness to embrace its comic book influences, something that conventional superhero shows tend not to do.&lt;ref name="AVClubS1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/flashs-first-season-brought-fun-back-live-action-s-219446 |last=Murray |first=Noel |title=The Flash's first season brought the fun back to live-action superheroes |publisher=The Onion A.V.

He also gave high praise to the emotional value and performances of the cast, as well as the cliffhanger and multiple easter eggs found in the episode.&lt;ref name="S1FinaleAVClub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/flash-fast-enough-219671 |title=The Flash: "Fast Enough" |last=Von Doviak |first=Scott |publisher=The Onion A.V.

"'''The Ghost of Harrenhal'''" is the fifth episode of the [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second season]] of [[HBO]]'s [[medieval fantasy]] television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The episode is written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] and directed, for the second time in this season, by [[David Petrarca]]. It premiered on April 29, 2012.

“The Ghost of Harrenhal” is how [[Arya Stark]] describes herself while at Harrenhal in ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', the novel on which the season is based, although the phrase is not heard in the episode.

This episode marks the final appearance of [[Gethin Anthony]] ([[Renly Baratheon]]).

==Plot==

===In the Stormlands===
King Renly Baratheon and Catelyn Stark negotiate an alliance in his tent with Brienne of Tarth standing guard, when the shadow creature birthed by Melisandre suddenly enters and fatally stabs Renly before disappearing. Two of Renly's guards enter the tent and, taking Brienne for the murderer, attack her. She slays them and is convinced by Catelyn to escape with her so that Brienne may at least avenge Renly someday. During their journey, Brienne swears allegiance to Catelyn, who promises not to interfere with Brienne's vengeance on Stannis Baratheon, whom she believes played a role in Renly's murder.

Meanwhile, Renly's death causes confusion amongst his men. Ser Loras Tyrell also holds Stannis responsible for Renly's death and wants revenge, but Petyr Baelish and Renly's widow Margaery Tyrell convince him that they must escape before Stannis' fleet arrives. As Stannis reaches the camp, his dead brother's bannermen swear fealty to him, but Davos Seaworth warns him to stay away from Melisandre because his men whisper that she is controlling him. Stannis takes Davos's advice not to bring Melisandre with him during his forthcoming assault on King's Landing, and gives a reluctant Davos the command of the fleet in the coming siege of King's Landing.

===In King's Landing===
Tyrion blackmails more information out of his cousin Lancel, who reveals that Cersei has been stockpiling massive amounts of "wildfire," a dangerous flammable substance. While crossing the city with Bronn, Tyrion is unsurprised at hearing an agitator rail against the incest-born king, but surprised and hurt to hear himself blamed for Joffrey's misdeeds. He visits the royal pyromancer, Wisdom Hallyne, who reveals a secret cache of close to eight thousand pots of wildfire that Joffrey intends to catapult onto Stannis' forces when they attack the city. Bronn doubts the effectiveness of the plan, but Tyrion decides to use it and claims the cache for himself.

===At Lordsport===
Theon Greyjoy has been made the captain of a single ship, with orders to raid fishing villages on the northern coast. Before even setting sail, Theon's crew openly disrespect him and abandon him on shore. Theon's first mate Dagmer Cleftjaw comes to his assistance and suggests that Theon will need to win the respect of the men with a more impressive deed. When Dagmer proposes an assault on the Northern town of Torrhen's Square, Theon disagrees at first, saying that the raid will attract the attention of Winterfell's forces, but later realizes that Dagmer intends to besiege Torrhen's Square in order to leave Winterfell poorly defended for his takeover.

===At Winterfell===
Bran receives the news that Torrhen's Square is under assault, and urges Ser Rodrik Cassel to raise a force to defend it. Later he tells Osha of his recent dreams wherein the ocean floods, destroying Winterfell and its inhabitants. He also asks Osha about the "three-eyed raven" that appears in his dreams, but Osha deflects his inquiries.

===At the Fist of the First Men===
On their trek northwards, the Night's Watch meet up with the legendary ranger Qhorin Halfhand at the Fist of the First Men, an ancient fortification. Qhorin warns that the wildlings have become more organized and dangerous under the leadership of former ranger Mance Rayder (the King Beyond the Wall). With a small party, Qhorin intends to approach and eliminate a wildling watchpost. Jon Snow volunteers to join Qhorin, which he is eventually allowed to do.

===In Qarth===
Daenerys Targaryen enjoys holding court at Qarth and watching her dragons grow. At a party given by her rich host Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the warlock Pyat Pree invites Daenerys to visit the "House of the Undying," while the masked Quaithe warns Ser Jorah Mormont of dangers that face Daenerys. Later, Xaro asks Daenerys for her hand in marriage in exchange for enough wealth and power to take King's Landing. Jorah vehemently opposes this, arguing that she needs to win the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] on her own rather than as a perceived foreign puppet. After questioning Jorah's motives, Daenerys eventually hears him out and agrees with him.

===At Harrenhal===
Arya Stark serves as cupbearer for Lord Tywin Lannister. During a meeting with his lieutenants regarding the war, Tywin deduces that she is a Northerner, but remains unaware of her identity. Later, Arya encounters Jaqen H'ghar, whom she had rescued along with Rorge and Biter, and who is now disguised as a Lannister guardsman. Jaqen offers to return her past favor by offering her "three lives" he will claim for the Red God, as a compensation for the three lives she saved. Arya designates "The Tickler," Harrenhal's cruel interrogator, as her first victim. Soon enough, he is found dead with a broken neck, and Jaqen signals to Arya that the first debt has been paid.

==Production==

===Writing===
[[File:D. B. Weiss and David Benioff.jpg|right|thumb|The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.]]
"The Ghost of Harrenhal" is the fifth episode of the second season written by the two [[showrunner]]s [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]], and the fifteenth in the whole series. The script is based on the chapters Daenerys II, Arya VII, Catelyn IV, Jon IV, Bran V, Catelyn V, and Jon V (28, 31, 34, 35, 36, 40, and 44) from [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Clash of Kings]]''. Tyrion's scenes with the Pyromancers and Cersei are taken from the chapters Tyrion V and Tyrion VIII (21 and 37).&lt;ref name="westeros" /&gt;

There are numerous divergences from the source material: in the books Lord Baelish is sent by the Council to negotiate with the Tyrells only after Renly is dead; Theon's departure from Pyke is not shown, and Dagmer Cleftjaw is a scarred old master-at-arms who is fond of Theon because Cleftjaw trained him when Theon was a boy; Arya is a scullion instead of a cupbearer and is not able to interact with Lord Tywin; and the character of Xaro Xhoan Daxos has been drastically changed making him a heterosexual of humble origins and giving him a vault that is never mentioned in the books.&lt;ref name="westeros"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Episodes/Entry/The_Ghost_of_Harrenhal/Book_Spoilers/|title=EP205: The Ghost of Harrenhal|work=westeros.org|first=Elio|last=Garcia|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
The episode introduces the character of the pyromancer "Wisdom" Hallyne, played by the British actor [[Roy Dotrice]]. Dotrice is a personal friend of [[George R. R. Martin]], since the two met while working on the 1980s hit TV series, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (Martin as a producer, and Dotrice playing "Father"). Years later, Dotrice was Martin's choice to read the audiobooks of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', a work that brought Dotrice a Guinness World Record for the largest number of characters voiced in an audiobook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=

After the series was greenlighted, Martin wanted to involve Dotrice, suggesting Maester Aemon, Rodrik Cassel or Grand Maester Pycelle as possible roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/86651.html?thread=6098299|title=The Beans Are Spilled|work=Not a Blog|first=George R.

R.|last=Martin|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he had to withdraw from the show for medical reasons and [[Julian Glover]] was cast to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/168109.html|title=A Change on the Small Council|work=Not a Blog|first=George R. R.|last=Martin|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second season, with his health recovered, he was given the role of Hallyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/231396.html?thread=14435300|title=Hot New Casting Hints|work=Not a Blog|first=George R. R.|last=Martin|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other characters introduced in the episode are the Night's Watch ranger Qhorin Halfhand, played by Simon Armstrong, and the mysterious Quaithe, played by the German actress Laura Pradelska. This is also the first episode in which Pyat Pree (briefly seen standing in Episode 4) has any lines.

===Filming locations===
The episode's interior shots were filmed at [[The Paint Hall]] studios, close to Belfast, where the main sets are located. Also in Northern Ireland were filmed the scenes at Harrenhal (in a set built near Banbridge) and Pyke (at the port of Ballintoy). Renly's camp was once again filmed on the country's northern coast.
[[File:Snæfellsjökull19Ice.JPG|thumb|The crew used the Icelandic volcano of [[Snæfellsjökull]] to represent the vast mountain chains of the Frostfangs.]]
After having filmed the Night's Watch storyline beyond the Wall in Irish forests for the first four episodes of the season, the producers decided that the unexplored land further to the north would be filmed in Iceland. According to the creator George R. R. Martin's vision of the setting, "the area closest to my Wall is densely forested (...). And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into tundra and ice fields and it becomes more of an arctic environment. You have plains on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other."

Co-Producer Chris Newman said that until then they had been able to reproduce the lands north of the Wall by adding artificial snow, but now they needed a bigger landscape. According to David Benioff, they always "wanted something shatteringly beautiful and barren and brutal for this part of Jon's journey, because he's in the true North now."

To represent the Frostfangs and The Fist of the First Men, the production filmed at the glacier at [[Snæfellsjökull]], and also at the glacier of Svínafellsjökull in Smyrlabjörg and the hills of Höfðabrekkuheiði (near [[Vík í Mýrdal|Vík]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartertravel.com/blogs/today-in-travel/game-of-thrones-in-the-real-world-see-where-the-hbo-hit-was-filmed.html?id=10712211

[[File:Lokrum - former abbey.JPG|thumb|left|The Benedictine monastery of [[Lokrum]] was used as a Qartheen garden.]]
The other main location introduced in the episode was the gardens of Qarth, which were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of the Croatian island of Lokrum. The abandoned monastery was built in Gothic-Renaissance style in the 15th century.

The island of Lokrum is only 680 metres offshore from Dubrovnik, the location used for King Landing's exteriors, and can be reached by boat in 15 minutes. Coincidentally, Lokrum shares with its fictional counterpart of Qarth having peacocks among its distinctive features: Lokrum is inhabited by families of peacocks that were introduced to the island in the 19th century by the Austrian archduke [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.autoeurope.com/destination-spotlight/game-of-travel

==Reception==

|quote = "A central challenge of Game of Thrones is that it presented most of its central cast together, then scattered them to (more or less, as of now) a half-dozen different locations. Generally the series has done a remarkable job, even as it rushes through a lot of story, of making their threads feel connected, even when they’re not in each other's presence. Jon Snow and his men in black have felt like the most disconnected from the rest of the story this season: they're playing the show's long game, the existential threat of the White Walkers. (...) As rich as their story is in mystery and mythology–this week we get some information about the 'First Men' who colonized Westeros thousands of years ago–it can feel like watching a separate show within a show."

One of VanDerWerff's criticisms of the episode is that it was too cluttered for him, treating important moments such as Renly's death in a matter of moments and moving away fast to the next thing.&lt;ref name="av2"/&gt; In his opinion this was because this was the first episode of the season to incorporate all the locations instead of omitting one or two.  Elio Garcia of Westeros.org shared this view, saying that while many individual scenes were very good he missed a strong narrative thread connecting the multiple storylines.

Renly's death received many criticisms: David Sims wrote that Renly's death "came out of nowhere,"&lt;ref name="av1"/&gt; Todd VanderWerff found it too rushed, and Elio Garcia said that due to director David Petrarca's mediocre direction choices, the effect of what should have been one of the most shocking scenes of the season was ruined. Garcia extended his harsh criticism to the scene depicting the aftermath of Renly's death and specially the decision to portray Loras' reaction to the murder of his lover with a contained grief instead of the book's homicidal rage.

On the other hand, the exchange between Arya and Tywin was unanimously praised, both in terms of acting and direction.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="av1"/&gt; Writing for ''The Huffington Post'', Maureen Ryan commended Maisie Williams for being able to hold her own in a scene with the charismatic Charles Dance.&lt;ref name="huf"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/game-of-thrones-recap_b_1459282.html|title='Game of Thrones' Recap: Finding Light Amid The Darkness|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|accessdate=May 4, 2012|date=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scene that was usually highlighted was Brienne's pledge of fealty to Catelyn Stark. Lacob described Christie's acting superlative, rendering a tragic air to Brienne,&lt;ref name="telev"/&gt; while VanDerWerff noted how Fairley's subtle performance with just a hint of tears and wavering voice made the scene almost a perfect one.&lt;ref name="av2"/&gt;

Other aspects that were praised by the reviewers were the production choice of filming in Iceland due to the magnificence and beauty of the shots, and good work done by the CGI team in making the dragon look like a real animal.&lt;ref name="huf"/&gt; Also, the reviewer Myles McNutt who coined the term "[[sexposition]]" to describe the use of sex in the show, noted that this was the first episode that did not feature nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cultural-learnings.com/2012/04/29/game-of-thrones-the-ghosts-of-harrenhal/|title=Game of Thrones – "The Ghosts of Harrenhal"|work=Cultural Learnings|first=Myles|last=McNutt|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ranking of the episodes of the series, Adam B. Vary of [[BuzzFeed]] criticized the episode, placing it at number 47 and citing "tedious setup" for his reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Every "Game Of Thrones" Episode Ranked From Worst To Best|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/all-30-game-of-thrones-episodes-ranked-from-worst-to-best#.ijwXdpYY1e|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Koch of WhatCulture was less critical, though he conceded that "the episode is pretty bare in terms of plot developments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Game Of Thrones: Ranking All Episodes From Worst To Best|url = http://whatculture.com/tv/game-thrones-ranking-episodes-worst-best.php/3|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Calvin Coolidge receiving statue of Boy Scout outside the White House 1927.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Calvin Coolidge]] receiving a copy of the statuette, outside the White House, 1927.]]
McKenzie sat on the executive board of the Boy Scouts organization in [[Philadelphia]] for more than 20 years. Asked to produce a figure of "an ideal scout," the sculptor chose several young scouts to model in uniform. In 1915, he gave the executive board an 18-inch bronze figure, together with rights to the royalties resulting from sales of copies. He said that the boy's uncovered head denoted reverence, obedience to authority, and discipline. The hatchet held by the scout is a symbol of truthfulness and the hope it would never be unsheathed for wanton destruction, but "applied unceasingly to the neck of treachery, treason, cowardice, discourtesy, dishonesty, and dirt." &lt;ref name= Buck&gt;Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). ''Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook'', p. 49. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenzie's life-sized version of the work was unveiled at Philadelphia's Cradle of Liberty Council on June 12, 1937.

A replica in [[Ottawa, Illinois]], adorns the grave of [[William D. Boyce]] (1858–1929), founder of the Boy Scouts of America, who modeled the organization on Great Britain's [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts Association]].

===Cradle of Liberty Council===
{{main|Cradle of Liberty Council v. City of Philadelphia}}
The Philadelphia headquarters was built by the Boy Scouts of America on city-owned land in 1929, with the council paying a nominal $1-per-year rent. In 2008, the City of Philadelphia filed an anti-discrimination lawsuit in response to the BSA's national policy of excluding openly gay scout leaders, demanding that the Cradle of Liberty Council defy the BSA policy, pay a market-rate rent on the building, or vacate it. The council won the lawsuit in Federal court, and the judge ordered the city to pay its $877,000 in legal fees. Instead, the city settled with the council, paying the bulk of its legal fees but requiring it to vacate the building. ''The Ideal Scout'' was removed in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">In [[linguistics]], '''transformational syntax''' is a derivational approach to [[syntax]] that developed from the extended standard theory of [[generative grammar]] originally proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in his books ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' and ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]''.&lt;ref name="Akmajian"&gt;Akmajian, Adrian; Heny, Frank ''An Introduction To The Principles Of Transformational Syntax'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|9780262510226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged from a need to improve on approaches to [[grammar]] in [[structural linguistics]]. 

Particularly in early incarnations, transformational syntax adopted the view that [[phrase structure grammar]] must be enriched by a transformational grammar, with [[syntactic rules]] or [[syntactic operations]] that alter the base structures created by phrase structure rules. In more recent theories, including [[Government and Binding Theory]] but especially in [[Minimalist program|Minimalism]], the strong distinction between phrase structure and transformational components has largely been abandoned, with operations that build structure ([[phrase structure rules]]) and those that change structure ([[transformational rules]]) either interleaved, or unified under a single operation (as in the Minimalist operation [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]]). 

==Overview==
{{Main|Transformational grammar}}
According to the Chomskyan tradition, [[language acquisition]] is easy for children because they are born with a [[universal grammar]] in their minds. The tradition also distinguishes between [[linguistic competence]], what a person knows of a language, and [[linguistic performance]], how a person uses it. Finally, grammars and metagrammars are ranked by three [[levels of adequacy]]: observational, descriptive, and explanatory. A core aspect of the original Standard Theory is a distinction between two different representations of a sentence, called [[deep structure]] and [[surface structure]]. The two representations are linked to each other by a set of transformation rules, the totality of these rules is what constitute grammar, and what a grammatical description of a language should present. Under this theory, a speaker must have access to both structures to interpret an expression.

Under this model, syntax was placed in the center of linguistic research and sought to go beyond description. Scholars explored the formalism of syntax and psychology of grammar under this model. This led to more systematic research on linguistic data such as [[native speaker]] judgments and distinctions in [[grammaticality]].

Many notable linguists have written on the topic, including [[Andrew Radford (linguist)|Andrew Radford]],&lt;ref name="radford"&gt;Radford, Andrew (1982). ''Transformational Syntax: A Student's Guide to Chomsky's Extended Standard Theory'' Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521285742}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodney Huddleston]],&lt;ref name="huddleston"&gt;Huddleston, Rodney D. (1976). ''An Introduction to English Transformational Syntax.'' Longman, {{ISBN|9780582550629}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Fowler]].&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;Fowler, Roger (1971). ''An Introduction to Transformational Syntax.''  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, {{ISBN|9780389041528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of transformational syntax were revised or replaced under the [[Minimalist program]].&lt;ref name="Stabler"&gt;Stabler, Edward P. (2000). Minimalist grammars and recognition. Manuscript for the SFB340 workshop at Bad Teinach&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-transformational syntax===

Non-transformational syntax describes competing models. The main non-transformational syntactic frameworks include [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], [[lexical-functional grammar]], [[categorial grammar]], and [[simpler syntax]].&lt;ref name="borsley"&gt;Borsley, Robert; Börjars, Kersti, eds. (2011). ''Non-Transformational Syntax: Formal and Explicit Models of Grammar .'' Wiley-Blackwell {{ISBN|978-0631209652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The voluntary return of asylum seekers who no longer want to wait for a decision on their asylum application or who have changed their mind about the application and rather want to go back to their country of origin.
* Destitute migrants, such as homeless people, who cannot afford the journey back home. Some homelessness charities provide funding for these journeys.
* The "voluntary" return of rejected asylum seekers or [[Illegal immigration|irregular migrant]]s to their countries of origin. Leaving voluntarily in this context can be somewhat euphemistic, as the alternative is often [[immigration detention]] and eventual [[deportation]].
* The most preferred of the [[UNHCR]]'s three [[Refugee#Durable solutions|durable solutions]] for [[refugee]]s because it is what most  refugees seek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/449aa7c92.pdf Voluntary Repatriation], UNHCR&lt;/ref&gt; Once the reasons for being displaced or having fled have disappeared and it is safe again to live in this country refugees are free to go back to their country of origin. The so-called returnees are still people of concern to the UNHCR and are as such under their legal protection. The UNHCR is monitoring returnee operations and offers support to returnees even after they have arrived in their countries of origin.

Some voluntary return programmes offer assisted voluntary return (AVR) and some voluntary return is spontaneous and independent without assistance.

==Voluntary return of refugees==
===Legal basis===
The concept of voluntary repatriation was first developed in the 1969 [[Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]]. It was agreed that:

:"The sending state, in collaboration with the receiving state, must make adequate arrangements for the safe return of refugees who request repatriation, while the country of origin must facilitate their resettlement and grant them the full rights and privileges of nationals of the country, and subject them to the same obligations."&lt;ref&gt;http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/5818395-581.art.Sharpe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
* The UNHCR and the hosting countries usually encourage the refugees to return voluntarily. The [[1969 Refugee Convention]] expects states of origin to advertise repatriation, by using the news and media as well as [[Organisation of African Unity]], in order to invite refugees back home. Equally the host countries are expected to spread such information and to ensure it is received. &lt;ref&gt;http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/5818395-581.art.Sharpe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the information that is spread about the improved and safer situation in the country of origin may be exaggerated, blurred or untrue and refugees may be encouraged to return home before the dangers and risks are fully removed.  

* As refugees are protected from deportation (or [[Non-refoulement|refoulement]]) by the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] some host countries may indirectly force them to leave by gradually decreasing refugees' living standards and living conditions or by spreading lies about them to make them feel less welcome. This is similar to [[self-deportation]].

* Some countries offer financial support to refugees and rejected asylum seekers in order to facilitate the process of starting a new life in their country of origin. This could be considered as residency buyouts.

===Support offered===
The UNHCR and the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily and to other people in need of support for returning to their home countries. This includes administrative, logistical, financial and reintegration support. Many developed countries also provide assistance and voluntary return programmes independent from the IOM and the UNHCR. Support includes making travel arrangements and paying for the journey. Support may also include financial support so that returnees can make sustainable investments and can build their lives again. Connecting people with networks and groups in the country of origin so that they will get support from local organisations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

When one takes part in assisted voluntary return programs (AVR), the applicant is giving up their claim as a refugee or asylum-seeker. Many times this includes a five year travel ban restricting the individual from returning to the host country &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Encinas|first=Monica|date=May 2016|title=Assisted Voluntary Return: implications for women and children|url=|journal=Forced Migration Review|volume=1|pages=84-86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, similar to deportation. According to interviews with IOM workers and files on return migrants who took part in their program, it is not uncommon for return migrants to feel pressured into applying to AVR programs due to financial hardships, lack of employment, fear of deportation, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leekes|first=Arjen|date=November 2017|title=What drives 'soft deportation'?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5106">The [[personification]] of [[wisdom]], typically as a righteous woman, is a motif found in religious and philosophical texts, most notably in the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other Jewish and Christian texts.

The Greek [[Septuagint]], and both the [[Qumran]] and [[Masada]] Hebrew versions of [[Ben Sira]] conclude with a first-person character speaking in Wisdom's voice as in the Book of Proverbs, though it is not certain that this was not appended to Ben Sira from another work. A less clear personification of Wisdom is also found in the Cave 11 Psalm Scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Harrington ''Wisdom texts from Qumran''  - 1996 Page 28 "It is not crucial for our purposes to decide this debate. What is important is that in Sirach 51:13—30 we have evidence at Qumran for the vivid personification of Wisdom as a female figure"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wisdom literature]] is a [[genre]] of [[literature]] common in the [[ancient Near East]]. This genre is characterized by sayings of [[wisdom]] intended to teach about divinity and about [[virtue]]. The key principle of wisdom literature is that while techniques of traditional story-telling are used, books also presume to offer insight and wisdom about nature and reality.

==Old Testament and Jewish texts==

The [[Sapiential Books]] or "Books of Wisdom" is a term used in [[biblical studies]] to refer to a subset of the books of the [[Jewish Bible]] in the [[Septuagint]] version. There are seven of these books, namely the books of [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], the [[Book of Wisdom]], the [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Solomon), and [[Wisdom of Sirach|Sirach]]. Not all the Psalms are usually regarded as belonging to the Wisdom tradition.

In [[Judaism]], the Books of Wisdom are regarded as part of the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' or "Writings". In [[Christianity]], Job, Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are included in the [[Old Testament]] by all traditions, while Wisdom, Song of Songs and Sirach are regarded in some traditions as [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]].

Sapiential books are in the broad tradition of [[wisdom literature]] that was found widely in the [[Ancient Near East]], and includes writings from many religions other than Judaism.

===Septuagint===
{{Further|Chokhmah}}
The Greek noun ''sophia'' is the translation of "wisdom" in the Greek [[Septuagint]] for [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|חכמות}} ''{{lang|he-Latn|Ḥokmot}}''. Wisdom is a central topic in the "sapiential" books, i.e. [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Psalms]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Wisdom]], [[Wisdom of Sirach]], and to some extent [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] (the last three are [[Biblical Apocrypha|Apocryphal]] / [[Deuterocanonical books]] of the [[Old Testament]].)

===Philo and the Logos===
{{Further|Logos}}
[[Philo]], a Hellenised Jew writing in Alexandria, attempted to harmonise Platonic philosophy and Jewish scripture. Also influenced by [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophical concepts, he used the Greek term ''[[logos]]'', "word," for the role and function of Wisdom, a concept later adapted by the author of the [[Gospel of John]] in the opening verses and applied to Jesus Christ as the eternal Word (Logos) of God the Father.&lt;ref name="Harris John"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "John" p. 302-310&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus==
According to Perkins, in early [[Gnosticism]] (1st-2nd century CE) a wisdom tradition developed, in which Jesus' sayings were interpreted as pointers to an esoteric wisdom, in which the soul could be divinized through identification with wisdom.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}} According to [[Earl Doherty]], a prominent proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]], the [[Q source|Q-authors]] may have regarded themselves as "spokespersons for the Wisdom of God," with Jesus being the embodiment of this Wisdom. In time, the gospel-narrative of this embodiment of Wisdom became interpreted as the literal history of the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name="JP-PPCO"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Jesus Puzzle: Pieces in a Puzzle of Christian Origins |last=Doherty |first=Earl |journal=[[Journal of Higher Criticism]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1997 |url=http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins further that a mythical story developed in early Gnosticism about the descent of a heavenly creature to reveal the Divine world as the true home of human beings.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}} Jewish Christianity saw the Messiah, or Christ, as "an eternal aspect of God's hidden nature, his "spirit" and "truth," who revealed himself throughout sacred history."{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3516}}

[[Image:Womanless Wedding in a Methodist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio.jpg|thumb|A womanless wedding taking place at a Methodist church in Cincinnati, Ohio in the early 20th century]]
A '''womanless wedding''' is a traditional community "ritual of inversion" performance, popular in the United States in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647878931|title=Southern masculinity : perspectives on manhood in the South since Reconstruction|date=2009|publisher=University of Georgia Press|others=Friend, Craig Thompson,|isbn=0820336742|location=Athens|oclc=647878931}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this comic ritual, the all male cast would act out all roles of a traditional [[wedding party]] – including those of [[bridesmaid]]s, [[flower girl]]s, and the mother of the bride – while dressed in gowns and dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/staged-womanless-weddings-once-drew-crowds/article_90cb4423-5c36-59b3-b03a-df3896124409.html |title= Staged ‘womanless weddings’ once drew crowds |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2015-07-12 |accessdate= 2016-04-18 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event often raised money for charities, civic organizations, and churches.&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt;

The performances were so popular that [[Manuscript|scripts]] were developed around the idea, and the [[do-it-yourself]] [[theatrical production]]s were passed along from city to city.&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt; Some of the stagings included [[impersonation]]s of notable Americans, such as [[Henry Ford]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt; The performances were often performed by known groups, such as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Colin R.|date=Summer 2007|title=Camp Life: The Queer History of "Manhood" in the Civilian Conservation Corps, 1933-1937|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=ea65d37b-d864-4887-956d-4c1305959650%40sessionmgr4009&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=35517482&amp;db=aph|journal=American Studies|volume=48 (2)|pages=19–35|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early modern Europe, and American prior to the 19th century, used womanless weddings as a way to safely express social strains between [[Social class|classes]]. The actors were lower-class; would ridicule the social position of the upper-class through skits for entertainment purposes. The upper-class citizens benevolently approved of these acts as cultural acknowledgement of their status in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Womanless weddings were performed throughout the United States, but most prominently in the upper Midwest and the South.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Southern towns were already staging [[burlesque shows]], and womanless weddings gave another opportunity to raise funds in the form of an admission fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of North Carolina: Womanless Weddings|url=http://ncpedia.org/womanless-weddings|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Womanless weddings traditionally raised funds for causes and organizations, such as a North Carolina womanless wedding which was attended by more than 1000 people to raise funds for the [[Parent-Teacher Association|Parent Teacher Association]].&lt;ref name="ForestCity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest City Courier from Forest City, North Carolina 1922|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/64238220/|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s actors were compelled to confront their personal apprehensions with “[[cross-dressing]], [[same-sex intimacy]], and [[homosexuality]]”, as portraying [[Femininity|feminine]] roles within the skits no longer signified unwavering [[masculinity]] within the culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the 21st century, social changes and wanting to make a more “family-friendly” show caused performances of womanless weddings to adopt changing social standards, rather than slander others. Womanless Weddings were altered by removing all suggestive “[[Gender Confusion|gender confusion]]” through the sexual allusions of the scripts.

=== Social Implications ===
A womanless wedding would include a skit of a wedding ceremony, sometimes followed by a reception. The skits would elaborately make fun of [[gender stereotypes]] or other gendered qualities that went against the cultural norms of the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common themes included opinionated women, premarital pregnancies, males who expressed more feminine qualities than societal standards, [[Minority group|racial minorities]], and “rural folk.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prominent male members of a community would typically be the actors of the womanless performances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their status would allow for their outlandish performances of stereotypical imitations of the minorities of a community, and the conditions of a community that went against the [[social norm]]s of the culture in the spirit of entertainment to be accepted by the community with humor, rather than backlash and their [[masculinity]] being questioned by a community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Horn was jailed for nearly three weeks for [[contempt of court]] after refusing to testify for the prosecution in the 1972 [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] trial of the "[[Harrisburg Seven]]" anti-war activists.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Horn was born in [[Odessa, Ukraine]] in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Horn 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Provoking&gt;Bryant 2004&lt;/ref&gt; to a secular Jewish family of small businessmen and shopkeepers.&lt;ref name=Provoking/&gt; She emigrated with her family to Canada in 1926 at the age of 8, then to New York City&lt;ref name=Provoking/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt; where she attended [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[Pratt Institute School of Information and Library Science|Pratt Institute Library School]].&lt;ref name=Provoking/&gt; She first began working at a library in 1942.&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

In 1964, she won a Humanities Fellowship to the [[University of Oregon]] where she became active in librarians' organizations and conferences.&lt;ref name=Provoking/&gt; She began working at the [[University of California, Los Angeles Library|UCLA library]] in 1965, where she participated in daily vigils protesting the [[Vietnam War]]. She later recalled that she attended the protests "always wearing good shoes and gloves, the proper lady-librarian," hoping to show that war protestors were "ordinary folks."&lt;ref name=Provoking/&gt; In 1968, she was hired as Head of the Reference Department at [[Bucknell University]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]], where she continued to work with peace activists.&lt;ref name=Provoking/&gt;

===Harrisburg Seven trial===

In January 1971, Horn was contacted by the [[FBI]], seeking evidence involving [[Philip Berrigan]].&lt;ref name=Zoia&gt;Horn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Berrigan, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and anti-war activist, was serving a sentence in a [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary|nearby federal prison]] for burning [[conscription|draft]] files concerning the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=SFGate&gt;Egelko 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Berrigan, from his jail cell, was alleged to be plotting along with six other individuals ([[Harrisburg Seven]]), to blow up heating tunnels beneath [[Washington, D.C.]], and to kidnap [[Henry Kissinger]], the national security adviser to President [[Richard Nixon]].

Boyd Douglas, a prisoner in [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]] on a work/study program who also worked at the Bucknell library, relayed letters, allegedly including anti-war plot details and love letters, from fellow anti-war activists, including Sister Liz McAlistair, to Berrigan in prison. Horn and another library employee at Bucknell testified before a grand jury. During the trial, they were subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution, but Horn refused to testify at the trial on the grounds that her forced testimony would threaten intellectual and academic freedom.&lt;ref name=Zoia /&gt; Horn served 20 days in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]] Jail, but was released after the prosecution's case was found unreliable.&lt;ref name=Zoia/&gt; At the time, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a [[United Press International|UPI]] photograph of Horn being taken from the courthouse in handcuffs and reported: "Mrs. Zoia Horn Galloway, a former Bucknell University librarian, was jailed for contempt ... after refusing to testify despite being granted immunity."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson (March 4, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Horn was jailed for almost three weeks,&lt;ref name=nelsonfeb72&gt;Nelson (February 25, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; "for refusing to testify for the prosecution in the sensational trial of anti-war activists accused of a terrorist plot."&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt; Horn stated: "To me it stands on: Freedom of thought — but government spying in homes, in libraries and universities inhibits and destroys this freedom."&lt;ref name=Zoia/&gt;

===Later work for academic freedom===
[[File:Zoia Horn presenting an Intellectual Freedom Award to Brewster Kahle.jpg|thumb|Zoia Horn presenting an Intellectual Freedom Award to [[Brewster Kahle]] at the [[Internet Archive]] (2010)]]
After her release from prison, Horn continued to speak out on issues of [[academic freedom|academic]] and [[intellectual freedom]]. At first, the [[American Library Association]]'s Executive Board refused publicly to support Horn's stand against the government's attempts to intimidate and silence Vietnam War protesters.&lt;ref name=Zoia/&gt; Later, after questioning Horn for hours, the Board reversed its stance and officially commended Horn for her "commitment...in defense of intellectual freedom."&lt;ref name=Zoia/&gt; Eventually she was given assistance by the association's Social Responsibilities Round Table, as well as the Leroy Merritt Humanitarian Fund and the [[Freedom to Read Foundation]]. [[Judith Krug]], longtime director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom, has called Horn "the first librarian who spent time in jail for a value of our profession."&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

In 1995, Horn published her memoirs, titled ''ZOIA! Memoirs of Zoia Horn, Battler for the People's Right to Know.''&lt;ref name=Zoia /&gt; In its review of Horn's memoirs, the [[Library Journal]] called Horn "a courageous crusader."&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Horn continued to speak out on issues of intellectual freedom, including writing an article on a small-city Oklahoma librarian who was dismissed by the City Commission after being accused of supplying "subversive" materials (including subscriptions to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''Soviet Russia Today'') at the library.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 2002&lt;/ref&gt; She also defended a gay librarian in [[Oakland, California]] who was "attacked for creating a display of gay library materials," and speaking out against the [[Patriot Act]].&lt;ref name=Provoking/&gt; She spoke in opposition to libraries' proposals to charge fees, arguing that the "payment of any fee in a public library" resembles [[censorship]] in creating "barriers to information access."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she was awarded the Jackie Eubanks Memorial Award and the [[Intellectual freedom#Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award|Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Phenix 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Patriot Act===

Horn was outspoken in her opposition to the provisions of the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] concerning library surveillance, and allowing the FBI to obtain a warrant from a secret court for library or bookstore records of anyone connected to an investigation concerning terrorism or spying.&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Chadwell 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed at age 84 by the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Horn was asked about the FBI's monitoring of America's libraries. Horn said that her first thought was: "Here we go again."&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt; Horn has criticized the law on grounds that it does not require any showing that evidence of wrongdoing is likely to be found or that the target of its investigation is involved in a crime.&lt;ref name=Zoia/&gt; A librarian could be served with a warrant and must surrender records of the patron's book borrowing or Internet use and is prohibited from revealing the search to anyone &amp;mdash; including the patron.&lt;ref name=Zoia/&gt; Horn has encouraged librarians to protest against the Patriot Act by refusing to comply. She noted: "They have (another) option, the option I took, to say this is not appropriate, this is not ethical in the library profession. It undermines the very essence of what a publicly supported library is."&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;
