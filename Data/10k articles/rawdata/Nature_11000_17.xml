The '''2008 Bulgarian Energy Crisis''' was a crisis in [[Bulgaria]]. The crisis affected more than a million households, mainly in the capital [[Sofia]] but also in [[Burgas]], [[Pleven]], and [[Vratsa]]. As of late September 2008, the issue was not resolved.

==Background ==
Bulgaria imports [[natural gas]] from [[Russia]]. It is used in combined heating plants in most Bulgarian cities in order to produce electricity during the [[summer]] months and heat during [[winter]]. In 2001, the Russian [[Gazprom]] signed an agreement with former Bulgarian Energy Minister [[Rumen Ovcharov]] which stated that Bulgaria would receive Russian gas at lower cost as a way to compensate for allowing the transfer of Russian gas through Bulgarian pipelines to other parts of [[Europe]]. Gas remained relatively cheap in Bulgaria until 2008 when Gazprom changed the terms of the contract. By then the price of gas had skyrocketed and Gazprom refused to sell cheap gas to Bulgaria.
Meanwhile, a large [[embezzlement]] scandal raged in Sofia. The managing director of the central heating plant in Sofia [[Valentin Dimitrov]] was charged with fraud and stealing more than one million [[levs|lev]] from the company. The trial is ongoing. A new board of directors was appointed. The citizens of Sofia were unable to pay the higher bills, some outright refused. In 2008 this led to huge losses of the Toplofikacia company and it ran into debt with the Bulgarian energy provider [[Bulgargas]]. Less than 50% of Sofia residents paid their bills regularly. Bulgargas started reducing the amount of gas to the company saying payment was long overdue.

==Vicious circle==
With more than 50% of all consumers in Sofia refusing to pay their bills, Toplofikacia ran into debt with the Bulgarian energy provider Bulgargas. Bulgargas in turn said it was no longer able to pay to the Russian giant [[Gazprom]]. Gas supply has been restricted and even shut down in some cities. On September 25 Toplofikacia Sofia issued a statement saying it will not be able to provide enough heat to all residents of Sofia and that winter was fast approaching. As of late September the issue is unresolved.

==Shutting down pipes==
Bulgargas shut down pipes providing gas to heating plants in [[Vratsa]], [[Burgas]] and [[Pleven]]. Hospitals and [[kindergartens|kindergarten]] took emergency measures and installed boilers. Toplofikacia Sofia shut down the hot water of more than 100 buildings in Sofia where 90 to 100 percent of residents refused to pay.

==Political reaction==
The Bulgarian energy minister [[Peter Dimitrov]] said customers were to blame as they refused to pay their bills. He said the municipality should help the company. The mayor of Sofia, [[Boyko Borisov]] said the state should interfere. As of late September 2008 the issue is unresolved and Gazprom will shut down supply of gas to all companies who were in debt, including the four plants in Sofia.

==Fears of grid failure==
The combined heating plant in Sofia produces heat and electricity from natural gas. With supplies rapidly diminishing and winter fast approaching, more and more residents are switching on electrical heating devices and also boilers for hot water which usually Toplofikacia supplies. The National Electricity Company [[NEK EAD]] said grid failure was imminent if all households start using electricity for heating in the cold winter months.

==Outraged residents==
The media have picked up the story and are broadcasting daily reports on the current crisis showing angry residents complaining that water was too cold, bills were exceptionally high or that their home will remain cold in winter because their neighbours have refused to pay their bills and Toplofikacia shuts down supply to all customers in the building. Around 80% of all Sofia residents live in apartment buildings eight stories or higher. If several families in the building refuse to pay, Toplofikacia shuts down supply to the whole building. This has caused huge outrage among the population, with reports of bickering among neighbours in the media. As of September 2008 the issue is unresolved and more and more buildings in Sofia are left with no hot water and no central heating.

'''{{mp|2018 DV|1}}''' is a micro-[[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]], approximately {{convert|6|-|12|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in diameter. It was first observed on 26 February 2018, by astronomers of the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]], Arizona, five days prior to its sub-lunar close encounter with Earth at less than 0.3 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2018 DV|1}} belongs to the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]] of asteroids,&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; which [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|cross the orbit of Earth]]. Contrary to the much larger [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]]s, Atens have a [[semi-major axis]] of less than 1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], that is, a period less than a year (Earth).&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

Based on an [[observation arc]] of less than 2 days, it orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.82–1.15&amp;nbsp;AU once every 12 months (358 days; semi-major axis of 0.986&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.17 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 5[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's observation arc begins at Mount Lemmon with its first observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close encounters ===

==== 2018 flyby ====

On 2 March 2018, at 05:54 [[Universal Time|UT]], this object passed Earth at a nominal distance of {{convert|0.00075|AU|LD|abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=2 |order=flip}} which corresponds to a distance of {{convert |112600 |km |mi |abbr=off |lk=off}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The object also approached the [[Moon]] at a similar distance of {{convert |133300 |km |mi |abbr=on |lk=off}} the day before.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It was the 18th known asteroid to flyby Earth within 1&amp;nbsp;[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] (LD) since the start of 2018 and 6th closest. Five days earlier, a similar object, {{mp|2018 DU}},&lt;ref name="jpldata-2018 DU" /&gt; came within 175,000 miles (284,000&amp;nbsp;km). However, the two encounters were unrelated and neither of them represent any hazard to the Earth ''(also see {{section link|List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2018|List}})''.&lt;ref name="Earthsky" /&gt;

2018_DV1-skyview.png|Hourly motion of asteroid across sky on 2 March 2018
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== MOID and projections ====

{{mp|2018 DV|1}} has a notably low [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert |0.000159 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, or 0.06&amp;nbsp;LD.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The asteroid's next encounter with Earth will be on 26 February 2019 at a much larger distance of {{convert|0.130|AU|LD|abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=2 |order=flip}}. It closest future approach is predicted to occur on 28 February 2064, then at a nominal distance of {{convert|0.0628|AU|LD|abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=2 |order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, {{mp|2018 DV|1}} measures between 6 and 12 meters in diameter, for an [[absolute magnitude]] of 28.4, and an assumed [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.057 and 0.20, which represent typical values for [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] and [[S-type asteroid|stony]] asteroids, respectively.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt; As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of this object has been obtained from [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations. The body's [[rotation period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] has neither been numbered nor [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''Aeroecology''' is the discipline for studying how airborne life forms utilize and interact with other biotic and abiotic components of the lower atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080801094258.htm Science Daily] Retrieved 2011-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; The aerosphere is viewed as habitat &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713000670 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2013.02.015 | volume=28 | issue=7 | title=The airspace is habitat | year=2013 | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | pages=377–379 | last1 = Diehl | first1 = Robert H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the way that organisms respond to and take advantage of the dynamic aeroscape has relevance to the ecology, evolution, and conservation of many of the world's bird, bat, insect, and plant species.

The interactions and properties in the [[aerosphere]], the zone that is closest to the Earth's surface, provide selective pressures that influence the size and shape of organisms, their behavioral, sensory, metabolic, and respiratory functions. In contrast to organisms that spend their entire lives on land or in water, organisms that use the aerosphere are almost immediately affected by changing conditions such as winds, [[air density]], oxygen concentrations, precipitation, air temperature, sunlight, polarized light, moonlight, and geomagnetic and gravitational forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/cecb/bats/aeroecology/ Center for Ecology and Conservation Biology] Retrieved 2011-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeroecology has relied upon traditional ecological field studies such as direct observation or detection of organisms flying overhead (e.g., moon watching, thermal cameras, or [[bioacoustics]]). However, the field has been greatly advanced by the inclusion of remotely sensed data, in particular Doppler weather radar or [[NEXRAD]]. In March 2012, an international and interdisciplinary Radar Aeroecology Workshop was held at the National Weather Center on the University of Oklahoma campus in Norman, OK, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3440989 | pmid=22628093 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0384 | volume=8 | issue=5 | title=Radar aeroecology: exploring the movements of aerial fauna through radio-wave remote sensing | journal=Biol Lett | pages=698–701 | last1 = Chilson | first1 = PB | last2 = Bridge | first2 = E | last3 = Frick | first3 = WF | last4 = Chapman | first4 = JW | last5 = Kelly | first5 = JF | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experts in the fields of ecology and meteorology discussed how various radar technologies could be applied to aeroecological questions.  Aeroecology research groups at both the University of Oklahoma &lt;ref&gt;[http://animalmigration.org/ Radar Aeroecology at OU]&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Delaware &lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.udel.edu/aeroecologyprogram/ Aeroecology at the University of Delaware]&lt;/ref&gt; continue to advance the development and integration of remotely sensed data to quantify, qualify, and track biological utilization of the lower aerosphere.

==History==
Aeroecology is a relatively new field of study. It was first introduced as a concept by [[Boston University]] researcher [[Thomas Kunz]] et. al in a paper published in 2008, "Aeroecology: probing and modeling the aerosphere."&lt;ref name="Kunz 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/icb/icn037|pmid=21669768|title=Aeroecology: Probing and modeling the aerosphere|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1–11|year=2007|last1=Kunz|first1=T. H|last2=Gauthreaux|first2=S. A|last3=Hristov|first3=N. I|last4=Horn|first4=J. W|last5=Jones|first5=G|last6=Kalko|first6=E. K. V|last7=Larkin|first7=R. P|last8=McCracken|first8=G.

==Observational aeroecology==
In the traditional sense, aeroecology has been limited to observations taken from the ground of biological organisms occupying the airspace above.  This may include near-surface foraging behavior or moon-watching passage migrants using human observers equipped with optics.  With the advent and adoption of technologies such as [[thermographic cameras]], [[marine radar]], and [[NEXRAD]] to aeroecological studies, the ability to detect and track sufficiently large animals in the aerospere was revolutionized.

==Radar aeroecology==
Aeroecological studies using weather radar were pioneered by Dr. Sidney A. Gauthreaux during his graduate studies at [[Louisiana State University]] and later as a professor at [[Clemson University]].  His initial work with radar images produced by the [[WSR-57]] network revealed much about the trans-Gulf of Mexico arrivals and departures of [[Neotropical]] migratory birds.

===Reflectivity===
Radar beams will reflect off sufficiently dense objects, such as water droplets, airplane fuselages, or flying animals.  The [[reflectance]] of the object will depend upon its [[radar cross-section]], which is dictated by the size, shape, and material composition of the object.  Weather radar reflectivity data represents the sum reflectivity of all objects within the sampled airspace and therefore is a generalization of the amount of rain or, for aeroecological purposes, the abundance of animals in that volume of air.  Aeroecologists use the term "bioscatter" to describe radar reflectance from biological objects.

===Relative velocity===
Weather radars are capable of detecting [[Doppler shift]] in returning waveforms.  This information is used to extrapolate a mean [[relative velocity]] for all objects within the sampled airspace.  Aeroecologists have used this information to distinguish among objects drifting with the wind (particulates such as dust, seeds, or pollen), from objects moving slightly faster/angular to the wind (e.g., insects), and objects moving at least 5–6&amp;nbsp;m/s faster than and/or moving against the predominant direction of the wind (e.g., birds and bats).

===Dual-pol radar===
An upgrade of weather radars to allow [[dual polarization]] of the radar beam promises to provide greater characterization and discrimination of airborne targets.  For aeroecology this promises to allow better capability to distinguish migrating birds from insects, weather, or suspended particulates.  Ratios of horizontal versus vertical beam reflectivity and Doppler shift also hold much potential for gauging discrepancies between the orientation of birds relative to their realized movement paths, providing the means to assess drift compensation among migratory birds.

Although attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent.

For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Types of attitudinal ambivalence ==

=== Felt ambivalence ===
The psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  One, often called '''subjective ambivalence''' or felt ambivalence, represents the [[Subjective experience|psychological experience]] of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Thompson, M. M., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Griffin, D. W. (1995). Let's not be indifferent about (attitudinal) ambivalence. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 361-386). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103114000134|title = Wanting other attitudes: Actual-desired attitude discrepancies predict feelings of ambivalence and ambivalence consequences|author1=DeMarree K.G. |author2=Wheeler S.C. |author3=Brinol P. |author4=Petty R.E. |date = July 2014|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2014.02.001|pmid =|volume=53|pages=5–18|hdl = 10486/666333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Subjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct [[self-report]] measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Attitudes and Attitude Change: Attitudinal Ambivalence|author1=Conner M |author2=Armitage C.J. |publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = 261–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted ''of'' my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be [[Metacognition|metacognitive]]. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways.

Priester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced "no conflict at all") to 10 (as in the subject experienced "maximum conflict").&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Potential ambivalence ===
Another measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called '''objective ambivalence''' or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Objective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present.

Kaplan initially operationalized ambivalence as the lesser of the two reactions (i.e., positive or negative evaluations), also called conflicting reactions (and contrasted with dominant reactions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 2 in this example).

&lt;u&gt;Kaplan's measure yields the formula&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = S+L - |S-L|=S&lt;/math&gt;

Here, S is representative of the smaller rating or reaction, and the L is representative of the larger rating or reaction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

However, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/47/6/1191/|title = Empirical validation of affect, behavior, and cognition as distinct components of attitude|author= Breckler, Steven J.|date = 1984|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = November 12, 2014|doi =10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1191 |pmid =|volume=47|issue = 6|pages=1191–1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three conditions are as follows:
# If the larger value is maintained, while the smaller rating increases, ambivalence will increase. 
# If the smaller value is maintained, while the larger rating increases, ambivalence will decrease.
# If both the larger and smaller values are the same, ambivalence will increase when both ratings increase (as the difference between the two will increase) or decrease as the values decrease.
&lt;u&gt;Thompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence= (S+L)/2-|S-L|&lt;/math&gt;

The creation of this formula was pivotal because it accounts for both subjective and objective ratings.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Predictors of felt ambivalence ===
Research has shown only a moderate [[correlation]] between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scope of Social Psychology: Theory and Applications (A Festschrift for Wolfgang Stroebe)|authors = Jonas, K., &amp; Ziegler, R.|publisher = Psychology|year = 2007|isbn = 9781135419745|location = |pages = 32–34|title-link = Wolfgang Stroebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness.

There are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: ''simultaneous accessibility'' and ''preference for consistency''.

'''Simultaneous accessibility''' is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Preference for consistency''' uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.

== Dimensions of attitudinal assessment as applied to ambivalence   ==

=== One-dimensional perspective ===
Traditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional—from positive to negative—but given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a [[Love hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Attitudes and Attitude Change|author1=Maio, Gregory |author2=Haddock, Geoffrey |publisher = Sage Publications Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-4129-2974-5|location = Thousand Oaks, California|pages = 33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect  how attitudes function and are experienced.

=== Two-dimensional perspective ===
The two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual’s positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone.  These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models.

=== Multidimensional perspective ===
The Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor.

Continued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however it should be noted that the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding
them, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to “fire together” they  will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence.

=== Meta-cognitive model ===
Not all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that [[meta-cognition]] has to do with "knowing about knowing." The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petty, P.E., Brinol, P., DeMarree, K. (2007). The
meta-cognitive model of attitudes: Implications for Attitude measurement,
change, and strength. [[Attitude (psychology)|Social Cognition.]]Vol 25, No. 5, 662, p.[[Attitude (psychology)|657-686]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consistency theories and ambivalence ==

=== Overview ===
Cognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the ''perceived ''[[paradoxical]] state itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Balance theory ===
[[Fritz Heider]] established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; [[balance theory]] seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. [[Triadic relation]]ships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement.

Social ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self ''(p)'', another person ''(o), ''and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus ''(x)''. According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved).

The overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory ===
Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude.

“Ambivalence is a function of the ''amount of conflict'' within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the ''magnitude of the difference'' between evaluations.”&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Attitudes |last= Albarracin |last2=Johnson |last3=Zanna |first= Dolores |first2=Blair |first3=Mark |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Mahwah, New Jersey|page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different.

The two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Past studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
The feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in [[social psychology]] ever since. In 1957, [[Leon Festinger]] was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Concepts of Balance, Congruity, and Dissonance |last=Zajonc |first=Robert B. |author-link=Robert Zajonc |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |date=Summer 1960 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=280–296 |doi=10.1086/266949 |jstor=2746406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any ''two ''conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention.

Dissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/39/6/735.full.pdf+html|title = Feeling Conflicted and Seeking Information: When Ambivalence Enhances and Diminishes Selective Exposure to  Attitude-Consistent Information |authors=Sawicki, Wegener, Clark, Fabrigar, Smith, Durso |date=2013 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |doi=10.1177/0146167213481388 |pmid=23482502 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=735–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self-image.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to [[self-esteem]] evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance:
# Justify the behavior by changing the dissonant cognition
# Justify the behavior by adding new cognitions
# Change the behavior to meet the dissonant cognition

== Motivation and information processing ==
As noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so.

=== Heuristic-systematic model ===
Information processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Conner, M., &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2008). Attitudinal ambivalence. In W. D. Crano &amp; R. Prislin (Eds.), ''Attitudes and attitude change'' (pp. 261-286). New York, NY: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Antecedents of ambivalence ==

=== Behavioral indicators ===
Researchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).

&lt;u&gt;The Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = (P + N) / 2 - |P-N|&lt;/math&gt;

Here, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, '''interpersonal ambivalence''', the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priester | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Petty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Park | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Whence univalent ambivalence? From the anticipation of conflicting reactions | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 11–21 | doi = 10.1086/513042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Individual differences ===
Individual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the [[need for cognition]], or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Individuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most.

Additionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Goal conflicts ===
Ambivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves.

Many decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence
every day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Harreveld | first1 = F. | last2 = van der Pligt | first2 = J. | last3 = de Liver | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The agony of ambivalence and ways to resolve it: Introducing the MAID model | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 45–61 | doi = 10.1177/1088868308324518 | pmid=19144904}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the "pleasure" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict.

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"/&gt;

=== Value conflicts ===
Ambivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. [[Social constructs]] and perceived norms and [[values]] within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter.

Conflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur.

The attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values.

=== Affective-cognitive ambivalence ===
Affective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of “''the heart vs. mind conflict.''”

When each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

That is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hass | first1 = R.

== Consequences of ambivalence as a dimension of attitude strength ==

=== Attitude stability ===
Ambivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Krosnick, J. A., &amp; Petty, R. E. (1995). Attitude strength: An overview. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 1-24). Mahwah, NJ:  Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/26/11/1421.short|title = Attitudinal Ambivalence: A Test of Three Key Hypothesis|last = Armitage |last2=Conner|first =Christopher J. | first2= Mark |date = 2000|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi =10.1177/0146167200263009 |pmid =|volume=26|issue = 11|pages=1421–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haddock | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Making a party leader less of a party member: The impact of ambivalence on assimilation and contrast effects in political party attitudes | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 769–780 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-9221.2003.00353.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Attitude pliability ===
Ambivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may [[bias]] or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially "anchored in knowledge structures".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Armitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low-fat diet.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any.

In situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Ambivalence in clinical psychology ==
=== Bleuler's tripartite scheme ===
The concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by [[Eugen Bleuler]], who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article ''Vortrag über Ambivalenz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal | last=Bleuler |first=Eugen |authorlink=Eugen Bleuler |title=Vortrag über Ambivalenz |trans-title=Lecture on Ambivalence |url=http://www.sgipt.org/medppp/gesch/ambiv-g.htm#Aus%20dem%20Zentralblatt%20f%C3%BCr%20Psychoanalyse%201,%201911,%20S. |journal=Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse [Central Journal for Psychoanalysis] |location=[[Bern]] |year=1910 |issue=1 |pages=266-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laplanche |first1=Jean |last2=Pontalis |first2=Jean-Bertrand |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Ambivalence (pp. 26–28) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Ambivalence+Ambivalenz |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |page=[https://books.google.it/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Bleuler,+E.+%27Vortrag+iiber+Ambivalenz%27+(1910)%22 28]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards ed, Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 128n.&lt;/ref&gt; Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action—what [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] called "a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires".&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through [[Buridan's ass]], starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 81-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual ambivalence—the [[Philosophical scepticism|sceptical belief]] that "There is no reason but hath a contrary to it"&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; —also follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to [[Sextus Empiricus]] and [[Pyrrho]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ed, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 715-6 and p. 842.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Freud]] considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them).&lt;ref&gt;E. Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

While mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the [[Splitting (psychology)|psychological splitting]] of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how "in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freudian usage ===
Freud was swift to pickup Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co-existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulse&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p.  261&lt;/ref&gt;—what Freud called "pairs of contrary component instincts" such as looking and being looked at.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Abraham]] explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning—something he thought to be a universal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leader, ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 61-6&lt;/ref&gt; Others in [[psychoanalysis]] have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 72-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Defences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include [[psychological repression]], [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 157 and p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, an [[analysand|analytic patient]]'s love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed—while his "hate" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis.  A [[Substance dependence|drug addict]] may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the "high"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded ''imperative'', rather than as a behavioral ''choice'', complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.)

Another relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of "ambivalence" sees it as engendered by all [[neurosis|neurotic]] [[Emotional conflict|conflict]], a person's everyday "mixed feelings" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Ambivalence in philosophy==
Philosophers such as Hili Razinsky consider how ambivalence relates to other aspects of the human experience, such as personhood, action, and judgement, and what it means that strict ambivalence is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Razinsky |first=Hili |title=Ambivalence.

{{Orphan|date=March 2015}}

'''Astrooceanography''' is the study of [[ocean]]s outside planet [[Earth]]. Unlike other planetary sciences like [[astrobiology]], [[astrochemistry]] and [[planetary geology]], it only began after the discovery of underground oceans in Saturn's [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]&lt;ref&gt;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/28jun_titanocean/&lt;/ref&gt; and Jupiter's [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/03/12/theres-an-underground-ocean-on-jupiters-largest-moon/&lt;/ref&gt; This field remains speculative until further missions reach the oceans beneath the rock or ice layer of the moons. There are many theories related to celestial bodies in the [[Solar System]], from oceans made of diamond in Neptune to a gigantic ocean of liquid hydrogen that may exist underneath Jupiter's surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://listverse.com/2015/04/03/10-mind-boggling-oceans-that-exist-in-space/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/09aug_juno3/&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrooceanography is closely related to Astrobiology, as oceans are expected to have higher chances to house simple forms of life.

'''''Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics''''' is an [[open access]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by the [[European Geosciences Union]]. It covers research on the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and the underlying chemical and physical processes, including the altitude range from the land and ocean surface up to the [[turbopause]], including the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], and [[mesosphere]]. The main subject areas comprise [[atmospheric modelling]], field measurements, remote sensing, and laboratory studies of gases, [[aerosol]]s, clouds and precipitation, [[isotope]]s, radiation, dynamics, and [[biosphere]] and [[hydrosphere]] interactions. Article types published are research and review articles, technical notes, and commentaries.

The journal has a two-stage publication process. In the first stage, papers that pass a rapid access peer-review are immediately published on the ''Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions'' forum website. They are then subject to interactive [[public peer review]], including the referees' comments (anonymous or attributed), additional comments by other members of the scientific community (attributed), and the authors' replies. In the second stage, if accepted, the final revised papers are published in the journal. To ensure publication precedence for authors, and to provide a lasting record of the scientific discussion, both the journal and the forum are permanently archived and fully citable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19039">In computing, '''autonomous peripheral operation''' is a hardware feature found in some modern [[microcontroller]] architectures to off-load certain tasks into embedded '''autonomous peripherals''' in order to minimize [[latency (engineering)|latencies]] and improve [[throughput]] in [[hard real-time]] applications as well as to save energy in [[ultra-low-power]] designs.

==Overview==
Forms of autonomous peripherals in microcontrollers were first introduced around 2005. Allowing embedded [[peripheral]]s to work independently of the [[CPU]] and even interact with each other in certain pre-configurable ways off-loads event-driven communication into the peripherals to help improve the [[real-time computing|real-time]] performance due to lower [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and allows for potentially higher data [[throughput]] due to the added parallelism. Since 2009, the scheme has been improved in newer implementations to continue functioning in [[sleep mode]]s as well, thereby allowing the CPU to remain dormant for longer periods of time in order to save energy. This is partially driven by the [[Internet of things|IoT]] market.&lt;ref name="R26"/&gt;

Conceptually, autonomous peripheral operation can be seen as a generalization of and mixture between [[direct memory access]] (DMA) and [[hardware interrupt]]s. Peripherals that issue event signals are called ''event generators'' or ''producers'' whereas target peripherals are called ''event users'' or ''consumers''. In some implementations, peripherals can be configured to pre-process the incoming data and perform various peripheral-specific functions like comparing, windowing, filtering or averaging in hardware without having to pass the data through the CPU for processing.

The '''Bond albedo''', named after the American astronomer [[George Phillips Bond]] (1825–1865), who originally proposed it, is the fraction of [[power (physics)|power]] in the total [[electromagnetic radiation]] incident on an astronomical body that is scattered back out into space.

Because the Bond albedo accounts for all of the light scattered from a body at all [[wavelength]]s and all [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angles]], it is a necessary quantity for determining how much energy a body absorbs.  This, in turn, is crucial for determining the [[equilibrium temperature]] of a body.

Because bodies in the outer Solar System are always observed at very low phase angles from the Earth, the only reliable data for measuring their Bond albedo comes from spacecraft.

==Phase integral==
The Bond albedo (''A'') is related to the [[geometric albedo]] (''p'') by the expression

:&lt;math&gt;A = pq&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is termed the ''phase integral'' and is given in terms of the directional scattered flux ''I''(''α'') into phase angle ''α'' (averaged over all wavelengths and azimuthal angles) as

:&lt;math&gt;q = 2\int_0^\pi \frac{I(\alpha)}{I(0)} \sin\alpha \, d\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase [[angle]] ''α'' is the angle between the source of the radiation (usually the Sun) and the observing direction, and varies from zero for light scattered back towards the source, to 180° for observations looking towards the source. For example, during opposition or looking at the full moon, α is very small, while backlit objects or the new moon have α close to 180°.

==Examples==
The Bond albedo is a value strictly between 0 and 1, as it includes all possible scattered light (but not radiation from the body itself).  This is in contrast to other definitions of  [[albedo]] such as the geometric albedo, which can be above 1. In general, though, the Bond albedo may be greater or smaller than the geometric albedo, depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question.

'''Brewer–Dobson circulation''' is a [[Model (abstract)|model]] of atmospheric circulation, proposed by [[Alan West Brewer|Alan Brewer]] in 1949 and [[Gordon Dobson]] in 1956, which attempts to explain why tropical air has less [[ozone]] than polar air, even though the tropical [[stratosphere]] is where most atmospheric ozone is produced. It is a simple circulation model that posits the existence of a slow [[Air current|current]] in the winter [[Sphere|hemisphere]] which redistributes air from the tropics to the extratropics.  The Brewer–Dobson circulation is driven by [[atmospheric waves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281990%29047%3C0392%3AOTGEOM%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | title= On the Global Exchange of Mass between the Stratosphere and Troposphere|author = J.R.

A '''coronal cloud''' is the cloud of hot plasma gas surrounding a [[coronal mass ejection]]. It is usually made up of [[proton]]s and [[electrons]]. When a coronal mass ejection occurs, it is the coronal cloud that usually reaches Earth and causes damage to electrical equipment and space satellites, not the ejection or flare itself. The damage is mostly the result of the high amount of [[electricity]] moving through the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="globalbioweather Coronal Mass Ejection"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://globalbioweather.com/coronal_mass_ejection.html|title = Coronal Mass Ejection|publisher = Global BioWeather Inc|author = Manfred Kaiser|year = 2007|accessdate = 2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coronal cloud is released when a [[solar flare]] becomes a coronal mass ejection; the coronal cloud often contains more radioactive particles than the mass ejection itself. A coronal mass ejection occurs when a solar flare becomes so hot that it snaps and breaks in two, becoming a "rope" of heat and magnetism that stretches between two [[sunspot]]s. The resulting coronal mass ejection can be compared to a horseshoe magnet, the sunspots being the poles and the oscillating magnetic connector the handle. Coronal mass ejections typically do not last very long, because they cool down as the coronal cloud of gas is released and begins to hurtle away from the sun.&lt;ref name="Space Weather: Sunspots, Solar Flares &amp; Coronal Mass Ejections"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.space.com/11506-space-weather-sunspots-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejections.html|title = Space Weather: Sunspots, Solar Flares &amp; Coronal Mass Ejections|publisher = TechMediaNetwork|author = N/A|accessdate = 2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and solar detachment==
[[File:Cloud Halfplasma Halfgas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=An image of a coronal cloud, half expanded into space|An example of a coronal cloud at half expansion. The inner portion is still plasma with the magnetic rope visible, but the outer area is gaseous and already expanded quite far into space.]]
When a coronal cloud occurs, it can take several days for the plasma to grow cool enough to detach from the sun. This usually happens before the coronal mass ejection is able to cool enough for the magnetism to dissipate, at which point the solar flare cycle begins again. While the gas cloud is still cool enough to be in a semi-liquid [[Plasma (physics)|plasma state]], it clings tightly to the mass ejection, insulating it from the cold temperature of extra-solar space.&lt;ref name="Cartwheel Coronal Mass Ejection"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/27may_cartwheelcme/|title = Cartwheel Coronal Mass Ejection|publisher = [[NASA]]|author =  Tony Philips|date = 2008-05-27|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the outer edges of the cloud begin to cool, the mass ejection's [[magnetism|magnetic]] rope begins to cool, thereby decentralizing what remains of the flare by weakening its magnetic pull. After the cloud begins to cool, it gradually cools further and further into its core. The mass ejection expands into space as its insulating [[Magnetic cloud|cloud]] weakens, weakening the magnet even more. By this point, the sun spots are all but gone.&lt;ref name="Coronal Cloud Prominences And Their Association With Coronal Mass Ejections"&gt;{{Cite web|bibcode = 2006SPD....37.0121L|title = "Coronal Cloud" Prominences And Their Association With Coronal Mass Ejections|publisher = Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, Norway|author1=Lin Yong |author2=S.F. Martin |author3=O. Engvold |date = June 2006|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the coronal cloud changes completely from [[gas]] to [[liquid]], the cycle of detachment begins. The inner, liquid [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] area of the cloud is relatively small and being heated by the mass ejection, not the other way around. The mass ejection loses its magnetism almost immediately, and cools to gas form or falls back into the sun within hours. However, the coronal cloud is still attached to it.&lt;ref name="Coronal Cloud Prominences And Their Association With Coronal Mass Ejections" /&gt;

The coronal cloud (no longer coronal) and what is left of the mass ejection detach from the sun. The cloud of gas, radioactive particles, and electrons, however, is still in the sun's gravitational pull. One of two things can happen:
* The cloud can be pulled back into the sun, causing the cycle to restart.
* The cloud can detach from the sun's orbit and begin hurtling out into space.

If the cloud begins hurtling into space, it usually becomes trapped in the planets' orbital gravity. By the time it gets to Earth, enough of the cloud has been absorbed by Mercury and Venus that the [[Magnetosphere|Earth's magnetosphere]] can deflect what's left into the outer [[solar system]]. Occasionally, though, an abnormally large and fast cloud can pass a portion of its mass into the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Coronal Mass Ejections ASA"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/env/spwx/cme/cme.htm|title = Coronal Mass Ejections|publisher = Australian Space Academy|author = Australian Space Academy|year = 2000|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A [[magnetic cloud]] (as it is now termed) can travel toward Earth at speeds that can exceed {{Convert|7000000|mi|km}} per hour. On average, it usually takes them about 13½ hours to reach Earth. The cloud hurtling through space is called a [[solar wind]]. As many as five&lt;!--at once?  in a day?  in the entire solar max?--&gt; can be ejected from the sun during [[solar maximum]]. When they reach the Earth, the large amounts of radioactive and electric energy can temporarily disrupt or even destroy electrical grids, antennae, communications devices, electric appliances, and near anything electric.&lt;ref name="Space Weather: Sunspots, Solar Flares &amp; Coronal Mass Ejections" /&gt; Minor damage may also be done to living organisms due to the low level radiation that gets through the [[magnetosphere]].&lt;ref name="Space Weather: Sunspots, Solar Flares &amp; Coronal Mass Ejections" /&gt;

Specific reasons as to why these clouds are dangerous to electronic and communication equipment include the overloading of large power transformers, which can cause lengthy power outages over wide geographical areas. Long, metallic structures like oil and gas pipes, water pipes, and communications antennae can also carry excessive electric current from the air, causing them to corrode faster than normal. This can possibly lead to early, unexpected ruptures. These signals also create anomalies in the ionosphere, disrupting wireless technologies such as [[GPS]], [[cellular phone]]s, television, and radio.&lt;ref name="Space Weather: Sunspots, Solar Flares &amp; Coronal Mass Ejections" /&gt;

{{main|List of solar storms}}

* '''[[Solar storm of 1859|September 1, 1859]]:''' English astronomers [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] and Richard Hodgson observed solar flares for the first time in recorded history, working independently and in ignorance of each other. We now know that one of the resulting coronal clouds was the largest and most powerful ever produced. The [[Geomagnetic storm|resulting electric storm]] was so powerful that the [[Aurora Borealis]] and [[Aurora Australis|Australis]] could both be seen far from the poles, extending to near the equator. [[Telegraph]] equipment users reported so much electric energy that their equipment delivered an [[electrical shock]] when touched as current flowed through the person inadvertently acting as a [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. Even after the devices were disconnected from their batteries, because telegraphs were simple switches to make or break the circuit between stations, that is, they contained no electronic components, like [[Microprocessor|micro-circuitry]] to be destroyed, they could still be used to send messages, thanks to the electric current induced in the wires by the storm.&lt;ref name="Space Weather: Sunspots, Solar Flares &amp; Coronal Mass Ejections" /&gt;

* '''[[Aurora of November 17, 1882|November 17, 1882]]:''' This cloud was first witnessed by two men named Dr. Brendel and Herr Raschen in the Alten Fjörd, [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]], [[Finland]] who came there to study auroras in January of that year.&lt;ref name="What is a Aurora?"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.todayinsci.com/M/McAdie_Alexander/McAdieAurora.htm|title = What is a Aurora?|website = Today in Science|author = Alexander McAdie|date = October 1897|accessdate = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nicknamed "The Transit of Venus Storm", and caused telegraph systems in the [[Ohio River|Ohio River valley]] region to cease to function, which incapacitated the [[Chicago Stock Exchange]]. On November 17, an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] occurred, perhaps the most famous example of the phenomenon in history. This aurora's most prominent feature was a round beam of green light shaped like a cigar. It appeared in the [[east]]ern sky and crossed to the [[west]] at an extremely fast pace, faster than that of any known stars at the time, before disappearing. These events transpired less than a month prior to the [[Transit of Venus, 1882|1882 transit of Venus]], leading to the storm's nickname.&lt;ref name="The Transit of Venus Storm"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.solarstorms.org/SS1882.html|title = November 17, 1882 - The Transit of Venus Storm|publisher = The Kansas City Evening Star|author = C.

* '''[[May 1921 geomagnetic storm|May 13–15, 1921]]:''' The most powerful coronal cloud of the 20th century passed through the Earth's atmosphere on May 13, and continued to take out electrical equipment as late as May 16. The most notable effect was that telegraph service was completely taken down around the world due to blown fuses,  an extreme example was a New York City telegraph operator whose equipment caught fire and soon burned down the whole building at a cost of 6,000 1921 U.S. dollars. Furthermore, at 7:04 AM May 15, the [[New York City Subway]] system south of [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]] was rendered non-functional by a massive control tower fire, another fire also took out the central [[Central New England Railway]] as well. [[Aurora (astronomy)|Auroras]] were visible all over the world, and scientists at the time thought the Auroras directly caused the damage.&lt;ref name="Low-latitude auroras"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=usafresearch|title = Low-latitude auroras: the magnetic storm of 14–15 May 1921|publisher = University of Nebraska Lincoln|author1=S.

* '''[[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|March 13, 1989]]:''' The second largest known solar storm erupted three days earlier, on March 10. The [[Coronal mass ejection|CME]] that caused the cloud was 36 times the size of Earth, and it had reached the Earth by March 12. The most notable effect of this storm is that it took the electrical grid off line in all of [[Quebec]], Canada. [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], and [[Quebec City]] were all without power, along with the rest of Quebec and some parts of Eastern Ontario that were hooked up to the same grid (including Toronto). The Canadian blackouts lasted for a total of nine hours, as much as a day in some Northern areas. Perhaps lesser known is that the blackout also affected much of the rest of North America. New York State's power grid lost 150 megawatts of energy, New England lost 1,410 megawatts (96 utility companies reported lost power), and over 200 other power grids around the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] also lost power. The electrical disruption was so strong, that currents could be felt in the ground across the continent and several NASA satellites and ships, including [[TDRS-1]] and [[Space Shuttle Discovery]],  spun out  of control for several hours.&lt;ref name="A Scary 13th"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=geomagnetic-storm-march-13-1989-extreme-space-weather|title = A Scary 13th: 20 Years Ago, Earth Was Blasted with a Massive Plume of Solar Plasma [Slide Show]|publisher = The Scientific American|author = Adam Hadhazy|date = 2009-03-13|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solar Superstorm"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/23oct_superstorm/|title = Solar Superstorm|publisher = NASA|author = NASA|date = 2003-10-23|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Day the Sun Brought Darkness"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/sun_darkness.html|title = The Day the Sun Brought Darkness|publisher = NASA|author =  Sten Odenwald|date = 2009-03-13|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Bastille Day event|July 14, 2000]]:''' One of the strongest flares of the 1990s [[solar minimum]], colloquially termed the "[[Bastille Day Event]]", was recorded on the morning of this day by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] satellites. The coronal cloud of [[proton]]s and radioactive material took 15 minutes to reach Earth, at which point it had many adverse effects on [[Magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] satellites, most notably those owned by [[NASA]]. The storm was four times more intense than any other detected since 1995 by the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[Advanced Composition Explorer|ACE]] solar monitoring systems by noon that day, and still intensifying. This particular event was causing aurora to appear very far South, in fact there was a red aurora photographed in North Carolina on April 6.&lt;ref name="A Solar Radiation Storm"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast14jul_2m/|title = A Solar Radiation Storm|publisher = NASA|author = Ruth Netting|date = 2000-06-14|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''June 16, 2012:''' A major solar episode occurred during the third week of June 2012. From June 13 to 20, an abnormally large amount of [[Solar flare#Classification|Class-M solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s were fired off by the sun in a relatively short period of time. No dangerous levels of radiation made it through the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], therefore no damage was done to any surface-bound electronics or communications. However, minor damage was done to the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]'s electronics and some Mars exploration vehicles.&lt;ref name="June 2012 CME"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112609310/incoming-coronal-mass-ejection-coming-on-june-16/|title = Incoming Coronal Mass Ejection Coming On June 16|publisher = redOrbit.com|author = Lee Rannals|date = 2012-06-15|accessdate = 2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

: On July 23, a '''[[Solar storm of 2012|series of CMEs]]''' peaked with a storm considered to be a Carrington-class event, although the coronal cloud missed Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11007">{{short description|A global agenda for action in marine conservation}}
'''''Defying Ocean's End''''' (DOE) is a global agenda for action in [[marine conservation]] compiled in a 2004 [[Island Press]] book.  It is also the title of a 2003 [[Los Cabos]] ([[Mexico]]) conference, where the agenda was formulated.

The ''DOE'' website describes itself as "a practical agenda of action to safeguard the ocean for future generations to come.  This dynamic strategy-including costs and recommendations-is a collective voice for those seeking to reverse the disturbing trends we are witnessing in the ocean today.  As never again, we have an opportunity now to respond to this crisis, by moving beyond localized and ''ad hoc'' initiatives - however good they might be - to coordinated global action."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org ''Defying Ocean's End'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The website also lists a "DOE Office" charged with distributing the agenda.  The office is composed of Dr. [[Sylvia Earle]], [[Arlo Hemphill]], Tim Noviello and Linda K. Glover:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp ''Defying Ocean's End'' Office Biographies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090309/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Cabos conference==
''Defying Ocean's End'' was launched at a conference held in Los Cabos, Mexico on May 29 to June 3, 2003.  The conference was organized by [[Conservation International]]; convened by American [[oceanographer]], Dr. Sylvia Earle, and [[Intel Corporation]] co-founder, [[Gordon Moore]]; and chaired by Graeme Kelleher. It included the participation of nearly 150 experts from more than 20 countries, representing the fields of [[ocean science]], finance, and conservation.  A select group of senior representatives from world governments, corporations and the media were also in attendance.  In addition to Conservation International, a number of large, international conservation organizations collaborated on the conference.  These included [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[The Ocean Conservancy]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp ''DOE'' Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201095229/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conference was sponsored by the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], [[BP]], [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]], [[Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines]] and the Alexander Henry Foundation.

The conference was structured into 5 regional case studies, 7 thematic working groups, and a business team focused on developing Action Plans which addressed specific issues and outcomes - with priorities, and costs identified—for 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year timeframes. Five case studies were presented to all Conference participants, which addressed lessons learned and recommendations in very different regions: The [[Caribbean]], [[Seamounts]], [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic Waters]], The [[Coral Triangle]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

Break-out discussions were divided into seven Thematic Working Groups on widely ranging science, conservation, social, economic and legal topics:

*Ocean-Use Planning and [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]]
*Economic Incentives and Disincentives
*Land-Ocean Interface
*Maintaining/Restoring Functional [[Marine Ecosystems]]
*Communication
*Ocean Governance
*The Unknown Ocean

A Business Team led by Larry Linden of [[Goldman Sachs]] worked with all groups to identify key cost drivers and estimate reasonable total solution costs.

===Results===
The DOE website lists the following "high level" results:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp About DOE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201084945/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Global Governance: Treat the 60% of the world ocean outside of national Exclusive Economic Zones as a World Ocean Public Trust. Establish legal and implementation approaches concerning ocean uses in the high seas - including fisheries - under coordinated, international multi-use zoning regimes.
* Fisheries Reform: Use market-based mechanisms and changes to subsidies to reform fisheries through development of [[sustainable fishing]] projects, and the establishment of a global fund to provide incentives for the adoption of sustainable practices.
* Communications: Implement global and regional communications plans; focus on educating the general public worldwide to ocean problems. Initiate global all-media campaigns on major issues. In developing nations, tailor the message to local cultural concerns, understanding and information networks (e.g., tribal elders), and build local capacity for disseminating the message.
* Marine Protected Areas/Large Marine Ecosystems: Create, consolidate, and strengthen marine protected areas (MPAs) into a globally representative network. Develop/implement coordinated, global large marine ecosystem (LME) programs in identified priority regions. Provide more robust multi-use zoning and enforcement mechanisms to protect these LMEs. Establish LME/MPA protections over 5% of the world ocean within the next 10 years (0.7% currently).
* Global Science: Develop an expanded applied research program focused on top priority marine environments high in endemism and biodiversity - seamounts, shallow- and deep-water reefs, continental slopes, caves and blue holes.

'''Devil's Millhopper Geological State Park''' is a [[Florida State Parks|Florida State Park]] located in the north-westernmost part of [[Gainesville, Florida]], off County Road 232, northwest of the [[University of Florida]].

The park is maintained by the Florida State Parks system, a division of the [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]]. The park is adjacent to San Felasco County Park and is near the [[San Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park]].

==Geology==
The cutaway, [[limestone]] sides of the [[sinkhole]] provide an easily visible geological record of the area. Twelve [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], some more visible than others, feed the pond at the bottom of the sinkhole. In the summer, the bottom of the sinkhole is dramatically cooler than the air at the surface due to the depth and shade from the canopy above. Significant fossil deposits include shark teeth, marine shells, and the fossilized remains of extinct land animals.&lt;ref&gt;Devils Millhopper Geological State Park
 http://www.floridastateparks.org/devilsmillhopper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Even though the park is only {{convert|71|acre|ha}}, three distinct ecological environments exist in the park, based on exposure to sun, fire, and water. In the [[sandhill]] environment, the sandy soil and regular fires result in [[pine]] trees being the predominant vegetation. The moist soils of the [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]] support broadleaf trees and more low vegetation, while the [[swamp]] areas only support flora and fauna adapted to year-around wet conditions.

==History==
The 120 foot (40 m) deep, 500 foot (150 m) wide [[sinkhole]] got its name from its similar appearance to the [[wikt:hopper|hopper]] of a [[Mill (grinding)|mill]], along with the bones found at the bottom, suggesting animals entered it on the way to meeting the [[devil]]. The Millhopper was owned for a time by the science department at the University of Florida and used as a research site for the students. Its unique ecosystem made it an invaluable resource for study. However, the Millhopper was often used by students as a place to socialize and have parties, which led to problems with litter and erosion from foot traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, John G. “Saving a Sinkhole”, ''The Independent Florida Aligator'', February 20, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; 

The site was purchased by the state in 1974, and a set of 236 wooden steps, along with boardwalks and an observation deck at the bottom were completed in 1976 to allow access to the sink for visitors without further soil erosion.

The formation was designated a [[National Natural Landmark]] in 1974, and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (in part for its surviving [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] infrastructure) in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28727">{{See also|Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions}}

An '''emission intensity''' (also '''carbon intensity''', '''C.I.''') is the emission rate of a given [[pollutant]] relative to the intensity of a specific activity, or an industrial production process; for example [[gram]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] released per [[megajoule]] of energy produced, or the ratio of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions produced to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Emission intensities are used to derive estimates of [[air pollutant]] or greenhouse gas emissions based on the amount of fuel [[combustion|combusted]], the number of animals in [[animal husbandry]], on industrial production levels, distances traveled or similar activity data. Emission intensities may also be used to compare the environmental impact of different fuels or activities. In some case the related terms '''emission factor''' and '''carbon intensity''' are used interchangeably. The jargon used can be different, for different fields/industrial sectors; normally the term "carbon" excludes other pollutants, such as particulate emissions. One commonly used figure is '''carbon intensity per kilowatt-hour''' ('''CIPK'''), which is used to compare emissions from different sources of electrical power.

==Methodologies==
Different methodologies can be used to assess the carbon intensity of a process. Among the most used methodologies there are:
* The whole [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA): this includes not only the carbon emissions due to a specific process, but also those due to the production and end-of-life of materials, plants and machineries used for the considered process. This is a quite complex method, requiring a big set of variables.
* The well-to-wheels (WTW), commonly used in the Energy and Transport sectors: this is a simplified LCA considering the emissions of the process itself, the emissions due to the extraction and refining of the material (or fuel) used in the process (also "Upstream emissions", but excluding the emissions due to the production and end-of-life of plants and machineries. This methodology is used, in the U.S.A., by the [[GREET model]] and in Europe in the [http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/about-jec/jec-well-wheels-analyses-wtw JEC WTW].
* WTW-LCA hybrid methods, trying to fill in the gap between the WTW and LCA methods. In example, for an Electric Vehicle, an hybrid method considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emissions 10-13% higher, compared to the WTW  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess |volume=22|pages=4–14|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Methods not considering LCA aspects but only the emissions occurring during a specific process; i.e. just the combustion of a fuel in a power plant, without considering the Upstream emissions.&lt;ref&gt;This method is used by the [[International Energy Agency]] in the annual report: [https://www.iea.org/statistics/relateddatabases/co2emissionsfromfuelcombustion/ CO2 emissions from fuel combustion].&lt;/ref&gt;

Different calculation methods can lead to different results. The results can largely vary also for different geographic regions and timeframes (see, in example, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920916307933 how C.I. of electricity varies, for different European countries, and how varied in a few years]: from 2009 to 2013 the C.I. of electricity in the European Union fell on average by 20%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment|volume=64|pages=5–14|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while comparing different values of Carbon Intensity it is important to correctly consider all the boundary conditions (or initial hypotheses) considered for the calculations. For example, Chinese oil fields emit between 1.5 to more than 40 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq per MJ with about 90% of all fields emitting 1.5–13.5 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq.&lt;ref name="Masnadi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masnadi|first1=M.|title=Well-to-refinery emissions and net-energy analysis of China's crude-oil supply|journal=Nature Energy|date=2018|volume=3|issue=3|pages=220–226|doi=10.1038/s41560-018-0090-7|bibcode=2018NatEn...3..220M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such highly skewed carbon intensity patterns necessitate disaggregation of seemingly homogenous emission activities and proper consideration of many factors for understanding.&lt;ref name="Höök2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höök|first1=M|title=Mapping Chinese supply|journal=Nature Energy|date=2018|volume=3|issue=3|pages=166–167|doi=10.1038/s41560-018-0103-6|bibcode=2018NatEn...3..166H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:AirPollutionSource.jpg|thumb|right|155px|An air pollution emission source]]

== Estimating emissions ==

Emission factors assume a linear relation between the intensity of the activity and the emission resulting from this activity:

''Emission&lt;sub&gt;pollutant&lt;/sub&gt; = Activity * Emission Factor&lt;sub&gt;pollutant&lt;/sub&gt;''

Intensities are also used in projecting possible future scenarios such as those used in the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] assessments, along with projected future changes in population, economic activity and energy technologies. The interrelations of these variables is treated under the so-called [[Kaya identity]].

The level of uncertainty of the resulting estimates depends significantly on the source category and the pollutant. Some examples: 
*[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions from the combustion of fuel can be estimated with a high degree of certainty regardless of how the fuel is used as these emissions depend almost exclusively on the [[carbon]] content of the fuel, which is generally known with a high degree of precision. The same is true for [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), since sulphur contents of fuels are also generally well known. Both carbon and sulphur are almost completely oxidized during combustion and all carbon and sulphur atoms in the fuel will be present in the [[flue gas]]es as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.
*In contrast, the levels of other air pollutants and non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gas emissions from combustion depend on the precise technology applied when fuel is combusted. These emissions are basically caused by either incomplete combustion of a small fraction of the fuel ([[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], [[non-methane volatile organic compound]]s) or by complicated chemical and physical processes during the combustion and in the smoke stack or tailpipe. Examples of these are [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, a mixture of [[nitric oxide]], NO, and [[nitrogen dioxide]], NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*[[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions from agricultural soils are highly uncertain because they depend very much on both the exact conditions of the soil, the application of [[fertilizers]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions.

==Energy sources emission intensity per unit of energy generated==
{{Main|Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions}}
A literature review of numerous total life cycle energy sources {{CO2}} emissions per unit of electricity generated, conducted by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] in 2011, found that the {{CO2}} emission value, that fell within the 50th [[percentile]] of all total life cycle emissions studies were as follows.&lt;ref name="IPCC Annex II"&gt;Moomaw, W., P.

In 2009 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity of GDP in the OECD countries reduced by 2.9%  and amounted to 0.33 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p in the OECD countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yearbook.enerdata.net/CO2-intensity-data.html|title=CO2 intensity - Map World CO2 Intensity by region - Enerdata|website=yearbook.enerdata.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("$05p" = 2005 US dollars, using purchasing power parities). The USA posted a higher ratio of 0.41 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p while Europe showed the largest drop in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity compared to the previous year (−3.7%). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity continued to be roughly higher in non-OECD countries. Despite a slight improvement, China continued to post a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity (0.81 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity in Asia rose by 2% during 2009 since energy consumption continued to develop at a strong pace. Important ratios were also observed in countries in CIS and the Middle East.

=== Carbon intensity in Europe ===

Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy use were 5% below their 1990 level in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/|title=Energy Efficiency Trends &amp; Policies - ODYSSEE-MURE|website=www.odyssee-indicators.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the period 1990–2007, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy use have decreased on average by 0.3%/year although the economic activity (GDP) increased by 2.3%/year. After dropping until 1994 (−1.6%/year), the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have increased steadily (0.4%/year on average) until 2003 and decreased slowly again since (on average by 0.6%/year). Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per capita decreased from 8.7 t in 1990 to 7.8 t in 2007, that is to say a decrease by 10%.
Almost 40% of the reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity is due to increased use of energy carriers with lower emission factors.
Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per unit of GDP, the “CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity”, decreased more rapidly than energy intensity: by 2.3%/year and 1.4%/year, respectively, on average between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;This section deals with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy combustion published in official inventories from the European Environment Agency. The indicators are not expressed under normal climate conditions (i. e. with climate corrections) to comply with the official definition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inventories. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of final consumers include the emissions of auto producers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commodity Exchange Bratislava]] (CEB) has calculated carbon intensity for [[Voluntary Emissions Reduction]] projects carbon intensity in 2012 to be 0.343 tn/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbb.sk/files/calculation-of-cabon-intensity-2012.pdf Calculation of carbon intensity in 2012] kbb.sk, Slovakia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emission factors for greenhouse gas inventory reporting ==

One of the most important uses of emission factors is for the reporting of national [[Greenhouse gas inventory|greenhouse gas inventories]] under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The so-called [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I Parties]] to the UNFCCC have to annually report their national total emissions of greenhouse gases in a formalized reporting format, defining the source categories and fuels that must be included.

The UNFCCC has accepted the '''Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs6.html |title=Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |publisher=IPCC |author=Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |year=1996 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) as the emission estimation methods that must be used by the parties to the convention to ensure transparency, completeness, consistency, comparability and accuracy of the national greenhouse gas inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2004/sbsta/08.pdf |title=FCCC/SBSTA/2004/8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These IPCC Guidelines are the primary source for default emission factors. Recently IPCC has published the '''2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories'''. These and many more greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on IPCC's Emission Factor Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php |title=Emission Factor Database – Main Page |publisher=IPCC |year=2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially applicable organisational greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on the search engine, EmissionFactors.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emissionfactors.com/ |title=Emission Factors |work=emissionfactors.com |year=2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly for non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, there is often a high degree of uncertainty associated with these emission factors when applied to individual countries. In general, the use of country-specific emission factors would provide more accurate estimates of emissions than the use of the default emission factors. According to the IPCC, if an activity is a major source of emissions for a country ('key source'), it is 'good practice' to develop a country-specific emission factor for that activity.

== Emission factors for air pollutant inventory reporting ==
The [[UNECE|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] and the EU [[National Emission Ceilings Directive]] (2016) require countries to produce annual National Air Pollution Emission Inventories under the provisions of the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (CLRTAP).

The [[European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme]] (EMEP) Task Force of the [[European Environment Agency]] has developed methods to estimate emissions and the associated emission factors for air pollutants, which have been published in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/emep-eea-air-pollutant-emission-inventory-guidebook EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook].eea.europa.eu, 2016, retrieved 13.7.2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emep.int/|title=EMEP Home|website=www.emep.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Emission Inventories and Projections TFEIP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080315073635/http://tfeip-secretariat.org/unece.htm TFEIP], 2008-03-15 tfeip-secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intensity targets ==
[[Image:GHG intensity 2000.svg|thumb|400px|Greenhouse gas intensity in 2000 including land-use change]]

The U.S. plans to cut carbon intensity per dollar of GDP by 18% by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070420-9.html White house fact sheet: Earth day 2007] (see section on ''providing a Realistic growth-orientated approach to climate change''&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised by the World Resources Institute as this approach does not ensure absolute reductions if GDP grows faster than intensity declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wri.org/stories/2007/04/chinas-carbon-intensity-target# |title=China's Carbon Intensity Target |author=Tim Herzog |publisher=World resources Institute |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 2000, the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy declined by 17%, yet total emissions increased by 14%.&lt;ref name=bfr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/index.php?/indicators/C52/carbon_emissions_2002 |title=Carbon Emissions Climbing |publisher=Earth Policy Institute |accessdate=2006-08-12 |year=2001 |last=Fischlowitz-Roberts |first=Bernie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the U.S. National Environmental trust labelled carbon intensity, "a bookkeeping trick which allows the administration to do nothing about global warming while unsafe levels of emissions continue to rise."&lt;ref name=net.org&gt;[http://www.net.org/reports/rollbacks/warming.vtml "National Environmental Trust Special Reports", 2002.

The environment is the subject of ministries at the federal and provincial level in [[Canada]], with the current highest environmental government official being the national [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Catherine McKenna]]. Canada's large land mass and coastline make it very susceptible to any [[climate change]]s, so any contemporary changes of climate in the country are of national concern.  Of the factors caused by human intervention that can affect this [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], activities that sustain the [[economy of Canada]] such as oil and gas extraction, mining, forestry and fishing are influential. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions in Canada between 1990 and 2015 was mainly due to larger emissions from mining, oil, and gas extraction and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html|title=Greenhouse gas emissions - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Environment and Climate Change|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 United Nations said Canada's environment was the best in the world.

Several governmental programs have been created to mitigate 20th and 21st century climate change, such as the [[One-Tonne Challenge]].  In late 2005 Canada hosted the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]].

Hundreds of [[environmental organizations]] have been founded in Canada.

'''Environmental degradation''' is the deterioration of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] through [[depletion of resources]] such as [[air]], [[water]] and [[soil]]; the destruction of [[ecosystems]]; [[habitat destruction]]; the [[extinction]] of [[wildlife]]; and [[pollution]]. It is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E. Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson.  1997.  Meanings of environmental terms.  Journal of Environmental Quality 26: 581–589.&lt;/ref&gt; As indicated by the [[I=PAT]] equation, environmental impact (I) or degradation is caused by the combination of an already very large and increasing human population (P), continually increasing [[economic growth]] or per capita affluence (A), and the application of resource-depleting and polluting technology (T).&lt;ref&gt;Chertow, M.R., "The IPAT equation and its variants", ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'', 4 (4):13–29, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 6, "Sustainability or Collapse?", New Society Publishers, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the [[High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]] of the [[United Nations]]. The [[United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction]] defines environmental degradation as "the reduction of the 
capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisdr.org/eng/library/lib-terminology-eng%20home.htm |title=ISDR : Terminology |publisher=The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction |accessdate=2010-06-09 |date= 2004-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation is of many types. When [[habitat destruction|natural habitats are destroyed]] or natural resources are depleted, the environment is degraded. Efforts to counteract this problem include [[environmental protection]] and [[environmental resources management]].

== Biodiversity loss ==

== Water degradation ==
One major component of environmental degradation is the depletion of the resource of fresh water on Earth.  Approximately only 2.5g% of all of the water on Earth is fresh water, with the rest being salt water.  69% of fresh water is frozen in [[ice caps]] located on Antarctica and Greenland, so only 30% of the 2.5% of fresh water 
is available for consumption.&lt;ref name=water&gt;[http://www.climate.org/topics/water.html ”Water.”] Climate Institute. Web. Retrieved 2011-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fresh water is an exceptionally important resource, since life on Earth is ultimately dependent on it.  Water transports nutrients, minerals and chemicals within the [[biosphere]] to all forms of life, sustains both plants and animals, and moulds the surface of the Earth with transportation and deposition of materials.&lt;ref name=issues&gt;Young, Gordon J., James Dooge, and John C. Rodda. Global Water Resource Issues.  Cambridge UP, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current top three uses of fresh water account for 95% of its consumption; approximately 85% is used for [[irrigation]] of farmland, golf courses, and parks, 6% is used for domestic purposes such as indoor bathing uses and outdoor garden and lawn use, and 4% is used for industrial purposes such as processing, washing, and cooling in manufacturing centers.&lt;ref name=change&gt;Frederick, Kenneth D., and David C. Major.  “Climate Change and Water Resources.” Climatic Change 37.1 (1997): p 7-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that one in three people over the entire globe are already facing water shortages, almost one-fifth of the [[world population]] live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], and almost one quarter of the world's population live in a [[developing country]] that lacks the necessary infrastructure to use water from available rivers and aquifers.  Water scarcity is an increasing problem due to many foreseen issues in the future, including population growth, increased urbanization, higher standards of living, and climate change.&lt;ref name=water/&gt;

=== Climate change and temperature ===

[[Climate change]] affects the Earth's water supply in a large number of ways. It is predicted that the mean global temperature will rise in the coming years due to a number of forces affecting the climate, the amount of [[atmospheric CO2|atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] will rise, and both of these will influence water resources; [[evaporation]] depends strongly on temperature and moisture availability, which can ultimately affect the amount of water available to replenish [[groundwater]] supplies.

[[Transpiration]] from plants can be affected by a rise in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can decrease their use of water, but can also raise their use of water from possible increases of leaf area. Temperature rise can reduce the snow season in the winter and increase the intensity of the melting snow leading to peak runoff of this, affecting soil moisture, flood and drought risks, and storage capacities depending on the area.&lt;ref name=arid&gt;Ragab, Ragab, and Christel Prudhomme. "Soil and Water: Climate Change and Water Resources Management in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions: Prospective Challenges for the 21st Century". Biosystems Engineering 81.1 (2002): p 3-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warmer winter temperatures cause a decrease in [[snowpack]], which can result in diminished water resources during summer. This is especially important at mid-latitudes and in mountain regions that depend on glacial runoff to replenish their river systems and groundwater supplies, making these areas increasingly vulnerable to water shortages over time; an increase in temperature will initially result in a rapid rise in water melting from [[glaciers]] in the summer, followed by a retreat in glaciers and a decrease in the melt and consequently the water supply every year as the size of these glaciers get smaller and smaller.&lt;ref name=water/&gt;

[[Thermal expansion]] of water and increased melting of oceanic glaciers from an increase in temperature gives way to a rise in sea level, which can affect the fresh water supply of coastal areas as well; as river mouths and deltas with higher [[salinity]] get pushed further inland, an intrusion of saltwater results in an increase of salinity in reservoirs and aquifers.&lt;ref name=change/&gt; Sea-level rise may also consequently be caused by a depletion of groundwater,&lt;ref name=groundwater&gt;Konikow, Leonard F. "Contribution of Global Groundwater Depletion since 1990 to Sea-level Rise". ''Geophysical Research Letters'' 38.17 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; as climate change can affect the [[hydrologic cycle]] in a number of ways.   Uneven distributions of increased temperatures and increased precipitation around the globe results in water surpluses and deficits,&lt;ref name=arid/&gt; but a global decrease in groundwater suggests a rise in sea level, even after [[meltwater]] and thermal expansion were accounted for,&lt;ref name=groundwater/&gt; which can provide a [[positive feedback]] to the problems sea-level rise causes to fresh-water supply.

A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation, as the water would become more susceptible to [[bacterial growth]]. An increase in water temperature can also affect [[ecosystems]] greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature, and also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature.&lt;ref name=water/&gt;

=== Climate change and precipitation ===

A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation, but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of [[soil erosion]], and mass movement of land, a decline in [[water quality]] is probable, while water will carry more nutrients, it will also carry more contaminants.&lt;ref name=water/&gt;  
While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and [[greenhouse effect]], some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, [[evapotranspiration]], runoff, and soil moisture.  It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases.

[[Climate model]]s show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation,&lt;ref name=arid/&gt; such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics; this will ultimately cause a latitudinal variation in water distribution.&lt;ref name=water/&gt; The areas receiving more precipitation are also expected to receive this increase during their winter and actually become drier during their summer,&lt;ref name=arid/&gt; creating even more of a variation of precipitation distribution.  Naturally, the distribution of precipitation across the planet is very uneven, causing constant variations in water availability in respective locations.

Changes in precipitation affect the timing and magnitude of floods and droughts, shift runoff processes, and alter groundwater recharge rates.  Vegetation patterns and growth rates will be directly affected by shifts in precipitation amount and distribution, which will in turn affect agriculture as well as natural ecosystems.  Decreased precipitation will deprive areas of water, causing water tables to fall and reservoirs and wetlands, rivers, and lakes to empty,&lt;ref name=arid/&gt; and possibly an increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration, depending on the accompanied rise in temperature.&lt;ref name=change/&gt; Groundwater reserves will be depleted, and the remaining water has a greater chance of being of poor quality from saline or contaminants on the land surface.&lt;ref name=water/&gt;

=== Population growth ===

[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|World population growth in a [[Semi-log plot|lin-log scale]]]]
{{See also|Human overpopulation}}
[[Human population growth|The human population on Earth is expanding rapidly]] which goes hand in hand with the degradation of the environment at large measures. Humanity's appetite for needs is disarranging the environment's natural equilibrium. Production industries are venting smoke and discharging chemicals that are polluting water resources. The smoke that is emitted into the atmosphere holds detrimental gases such as carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The high levels of pollution in the atmosphere form layers that are eventually absorbed into the atmosphere. Organic compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s) have generated an unwanted opening in the ozone layer, which emits higher levels of ultraviolet radiation putting the globe at large threat.

The available fresh water being affected by the climate is also being stretched across an ever-increasing global population. It is estimated that almost a quarter of the global population is living in an area that is using more than 20% of their renewable water supply; water use will rise with population while the water supply is also being aggravated by decreases in streamflow and groundwater caused by climate change.   Even though some areas may see an increase in freshwater supply from an uneven distribution of precipitation increase, an increased use of water supply is expected.&lt;ref name=armed&gt;Raleigh, Clionadh, and [[Henrik Urdal]]. “Climate Change, Environmental Degradation, and Armed Conflict.” Political Geography 26.6 (2007): 674–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

An increased population means increased withdrawals from the water supply for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, the largest of these being agriculture,&lt;ref name=sustain&gt;MacDonald, Glen M. "Water, Climate Change, and Sustainability in the Southwest". PNAS 107.50 (2010): p 56-62.&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be the major non-climate driver of environmental change and water deterioration.  The next 50 years will likely be the last period of rapid [[agricultural expansion]], but the larger and wealthier population over this time will demand more agriculture.&lt;ref name=agriculture&gt;Tilman, David, Joseph Fargione, Brian Wolff, Carla D'Antonio, Andrew Dobson, Robert Howarth, David Scindler, William Schlesinger, Danielle Simberloff, and [[Deborah Swackhamer]]. "Forecasting Agriculturally Driven Global Environmental Change". ''Science'' 292.5515 (2011): p 281-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population increase over the last two decades, at least in the United States, has also been accompanied by a shift to an increase in urban areas from rural areas,&lt;ref name=human&gt;Wallach, Bret. ''Understanding the Cultural Landscape''. New York; Guilford, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; which concentrates the demand for water into certain areas, and puts stress on the fresh water supply from industrial and human contaminants.&lt;ref name=water/&gt;  [[Urbanization]] causes overcrowding and increasingly unsanitary living conditions, especially in developing countries, which in turn exposes an increasingly number of people to disease.  About 79% of the world's population is in developing countries, which lack access to sanitary water and sewer systems, giving rises to disease and deaths from contaminated water and increased numbers of disease-carrying insects.&lt;ref name=disease&gt;[http://www.slideboom.com/presentations/32220/Environmental-Degradation]. Powell, Fannetta. "Environmental Degradation and Human Disease". Lecture. SlideBoom. 2009. Web. Retrieved 2011-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===

[[File:Water pollution in the Wairarapa.JPG|thumb|[[Water pollution]] due to dairy farming in the [[Wairarapa]] in New Zealand]]

Agriculture is dependent on available soil moisture, which is directly affected by climate dynamics, with precipitation being the input in this system and various processes being the output, such as evapotranspiration, [[surface runoff]], drainage, and percolation into groundwater.  Changes in climate, especially the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration predicted by climate models, will directly affect soil moisture, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge. 

In areas with decreasing precipitation as predicted by the climate models, soil moisture may be substantially reduced.&lt;ref name=arid/&gt;  With this in mind, agriculture in most areas needs irrigation already, which depletes fresh water supplies both by the physical use of the water and the degradation agriculture causes to the water. Irrigation increases salt and nutrient content in areas that would not normally be affected, and damages streams and rivers from damming and removal of water. Fertilizer enters both human and livestock waste streams that eventually enter groundwater, while nitrogen, phosphorus, and other chemicals from fertilizer can acidify both soils and water.  
Certain agricultural demands may increase more than others with an increasingly wealthier global population, and meat is one commodity expected to double global food demand by 2050,&lt;ref name=agriculture/&gt; which directly affects the global supply of fresh water.  Cows need water to drink, more if the temperature is high and humidity is low, and more if the production system the cow is in is extensive, since finding food takes more effort.  Water is needed in processing of the meat, and also in the production of feed for the livestock. Manure can contaminate bodies of freshwater, and slaughterhouses, depending on how well they are managed, contribute waste such as blood, fat, hair, and other bodily contents to supplies of fresh water.&lt;ref name=meat&gt;[http://sites/google.com/site/redmeatimplications "Environmental Implications of the Global Demand for Red Meat"]. Web. Retrieved 2011-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of water from agricultural to urban and suburban use raises concerns about agricultural sustainability, rural socioeconomic decline, food security, an increased [[carbon footprint]] from imported food, and decreased foreign trade balance.&lt;ref name=sustain/&gt;  The depletion of fresh water, as applied to more specific and populated areas, increases fresh water scarcity among the population and also makes populations susceptible to economic, social, and political conflict in a number of ways; rising sea levels forces [[Human migration|migration]] from coastal areas to other areas farther inland, pushing populations closer together breaching borders and other geographical patterns, and agricultural surpluses and deficits from the availability of water induce trade problems and economies of certain areas.&lt;ref name=armed/&gt; Climate change is an important cause of involuntary migration and forced displacement&lt;ref&gt;Bogumil Terminski, Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges http://www.cedem.ulg.ac.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, global greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture exceeds that of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wang|first=George C.|date=April 9, 2017|title=Go vegan, save the planet|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/08/opinions/go-vegan-save-the-planet-wang/|work=[[CNN]] |location= |access-date= April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water management ===

[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|thumb|A stream in the town of [[Amlwch]], Anglesey which is contaminated by [[acid mine drainage]] from the former copper mine at nearby [[Parys Mountain]]]]

The issue of the depletion of fresh water can be met by increased efforts in water management.&lt;ref name=issues/&gt;  While water management systems are often flexible, adaptation to new hydrologic conditions may be very costly.&lt;ref name=arid/&gt;  Preventative approaches are necessary to avoid high costs of inefficiency and the need for rehabilitation of [[water supply|water supplies]],&lt;ref name=issues/&gt; and innovations to decrease overall demand may be important in planning water sustainability.&lt;ref name=sustain/&gt;

Water supply systems, as they exist now, were based on the assumptions of the current climate, and built to accommodate existing river flows and flood frequencies.  Reservoirs are operated based on past hydrologic records, and [[irrigation]] systems on historical temperature, water availability, and crop water requirements; these may not be a reliable guide to the future.   Re-examining engineering designs, operations, optimizations, and planning, as well as re-evaluating legal, technical, and economic approaches to manage water resources are very important for the future of water management in response to water degradation.   Another approach is water privatization; despite its economic and cultural effects, service quality and overall quality of the water can be more easily controlled and distributed.  Rationality and [[sustainability]] is appropriate, and requires limits to [[overexploitation]] and pollution, and efforts in conservation.&lt;ref name=issues/&gt;

__NOTOC__
In [[stratigraphy]], [[paleontology]], [[geology]], and [[geobiology]] an '''erathem''' is the total [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] unit deposited during a certain corresponding span of time during an [[era (geology)|era]] in the [[geologic timescale]].

It can therefore be used as a [[chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] unit of time which delineates a large span of years — less than a [[eon (geology)|geological eon]], but greater than its successively smaller and more refined subdivisions ([[period (geology)|geologic periods]], [[epoch (geology)|epochs]], and [[age (geology)|geologic ages]]). By 3,500 [[million years ago]] (mya) simple life had developed on earth (the oldest known [[microbe|microbial]] fossils in Australia are dated to this figure).&lt;ref
name="Rockmans" /&gt; The atmosphere was a mix of noxious and poisonous gases ([[Methane]], [[Ammonia]], [[Sulphur]] compounds, etc.&lt;ref name="Rockmans" /&gt;— a so-called [[reducing atmosphere]]&lt;ref&gt;basis for the [[Miller–Urey experiment]]&lt;/ref&gt; lacking much free [[oxygen]] which was bound up in compounds).

These simple organisms, [[Cyanobacteria]] ruled the still cooling earth for approximately a thousand million (over a [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]]) years&lt;ref name="Rockmans" /&gt; and gradually transformed the atmosphere to one containing free oxygen. These changes, along with [[tectonics|tectonic activity]] left chemical trails ([[red bed]] formation, etc.) and other physical clues (magnetic orientation, layer formation factors) in the rock record, and it is these changes along with the later richer [[fossil record]] which specialists use to demarcate times early in planet earth's history in various disciplines.

Erathems are not often used in practice. While they are subdivisions of [[eonothem]]s and are themselves subdivided into [[system (geology)|systems]], dating experts prefer the finer resolution of smaller spans of time when evaluating strata.

Erathems have the same names as their corresponding eras.
:The Phanerozoic eonothem can thus be divided into a
:: [[Cenozoic]], a [[Mesozoic]] and a [[Paleozoic]] erathem or matching era name.

Similarly, the [[Proterozoic]] eonothem is divided youngest to oldest into the
::[[Neoproterozoic]], [[Mesoproterozoic]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] erathems,
:and the [[Archean]] eon and eonothem are divided similarly into the
::[[Neoarchean]], [[Mesoarchean]], [[Paleoarchean]] and the [[Eoarchean]], for which a lower (oldest) limit is undefined.&lt;ref name="ICS Chart"

'''Europe''' is a [[continent]] located entirely in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. It is bordered by the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. It comprises the westernmost part of [[Eurasia]].

Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered to be [[Borders of the continents#Europe and Asia|separated from Asia]] by the [[drainage divide|watershed divides]] of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] and [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] Seas and the waterways of the [[Turkish Straits]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe&amp;nbsp;... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "continent" implies [[physical geography]], the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The border does not follow political boundaries, with [[Turkey]], [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] being [[list of transcontinental countries|transcontinental countries]].

Europe covers about {{convert|10,180,000|km2|sqmi}}, or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|fifty sovereign states]] of which the [[Russian Federation]] is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a [[Demographics of Europe|total population]] of about 741 million (about 11% of the [[world population]]) {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The [[European climate]] is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at [[latitudes]] along which the climate in Asia and [[North America]] is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.

Europe, in particular [[ancient Greece]], was the birthplace of [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Covert|title=Ancient Greece: Birthplace of Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVMYJNvUiYkC&amp;pg=PP5|year=2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-6831-6|page=5|quote=Ancient Greece is often called the cradle of western civilization. ...

[[Renaissance humanism]], [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]], [[Renaissance art|art]] and [[Renaissance science|science]] led to the [[modern era]]. Since the [[Age of Discovery]] started by [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers [[European colonialism|controlled]] at various times the [[Americas]], almost all of [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]] and the majority of Asia.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]], the subsequent [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in [[Western Europe]] and eventually the wider world. Both [[world war]]s took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] took prominence.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"&gt;National Geographic, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the West and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the East, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] and [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]].

In 1949 the [[Council of Europe]] was founded, following a speech by Sir [[Winston Churchill]], with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Vatican City]]. Further [[European integration]] by some states led to the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.ee/iesp/No11/articles/03_Gabriel_Hazak.pdf|title=The European union—a federation or a confederation?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU originated in Western Europe but has been [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding eastward]] since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the [[euro]], is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's [[Schengen Area]] abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The [[European Anthem]] is "[[Ode to Joy (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]", and states celebrate peace and unity on [[Europe Day]].

In classical [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''Eurṓpē'') is the name of either a [[Phoenicia]]n princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements εὐρύς (''eurús''), "wide, broad"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Deu%29ru%2Fs εὐρύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; and ὤψ (''ōps'', gen. ὠπός, ''ōpós'') "eye, face, countenance",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dw%29%2Fy ὤψ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; hence their composite ''Eurṓpē'' would mean "wide-gazing" or "broad of aspect". ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of Earth herself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and the poetry devoted to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=Indo-European poetry and myth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |pages=178–179 |isbn=978-0-19-928075-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second part compare also the divine attributes of [[Athena#Cult and attributes|"grey-eyed" Athena]] (γλαυκῶπις, ''glaukōpis'') or [[Hera|ox-eyed Hera]] (βοῶπις, ''boōpis'').

There have been attempts to connect ''Eurṓpē'' to a Semitic term for "west", this being either [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning "to go down, set" (said of the sun) or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] '' 'ereb'' "evening, west",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe "Europe"] in the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is at the origin of Arabic [[Maghreb]] and Hebrew ''ma'arav''. [[Michael A. Barry]], professor in [[Princeton University]]'s Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word ''Ereb'' on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of "night, [the country of] sunset", in opposition to ''Asu'' "[the country of] sunrise", i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to "cartographic convention" appears in Greek Ἀνατολή (''Anatolḗ'' "[sun] rise", "east", hence [[Anatolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Barry: "L’Europe et son mythe : à la poursuite du couchant". In: ''Revue des deux Mondes'' (November/December 1999) p. 110. {{ISBN|978-2-7103-0937-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=The east face of Helicon: west Asiatic elements in Greek poetry and myth |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=451 |isbn=978-0-19-815221-7 |oclc= |doi=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next to these hypotheses there is also a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;regʷos'', meaning "darkness", which also produced Greek ''[[Erebus]]''.

Most major world languages use words derived from ''Eurṓpē'' or ''Europa'' to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word ''Ōuzhōu'' (歐洲/欧洲); a similar Chinese-derived term {{nihongo||欧州|Ōshū}} is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, {{nihongo||欧州連合|Ōshū Rengō}}, despite the [[katakana]] {{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}} being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' ("land of the [[Franks]]") is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.&lt;ref name="davison"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether countries are considered in Europe or Asia can vary in sources, for example in the classification of the [[CIA World Factbook]] or that of the [[BBC]]. Note also that certain countries in Europe, such as France, have [[List of countries spanning more than one continent#Non-contiguous|territories lying geographically outside Europe]], but which are nevertheless considered integral parts of that country.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'''Key:''' &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt;: [[transcontinental country|states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia]];

The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century.
Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the [[Ural River]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the southeast, including the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Black Sea]] and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007 |title=Europe |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html |accessdate=27 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbxqnne?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570768/Europe.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence [[Iceland]] is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of [[Greenland]] is usually assigned to [[North America]]. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. [[Cyprus]] is closest to [[Anatolia|Anatolia (or Asia Minor)]], but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. [[Malta]] was considered an island of [[Northwest Africa]] for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer, William; Falconer, Thomas.

(1817.), p. 50, {{ISBN|1-113-68809-2}} ''These islands Pliny, as well as Strabo and Ptolemy, included in the African sea''&lt;/ref&gt;

"Europe" as used specifically in [[British English]] may also refer to [[Continental Europe]] exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=europe|title=Europe&amp;nbsp;— Noun|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the concept===

====Early history====
[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|A medieval [[T and O map]] from 1472 showing the three continents as domains of the sons of [[Noah]] — Asia to Sem ([[Shem]]), Europe to Iafeth ([[Japheth]]), and Africa to Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]])]]
The first recorded usage of ''Eurṓpē'' as a geographic term is in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Delian Apollo]], in reference to the western shore of the [[Aegean Sea]]. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]].

The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the [[Western Church]], as opposed to both the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches and to the [[Islamic world]].

A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of [[Christendom|Latin Christendom]] coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with [[Byzantium]] and [[Islam]], and limited to northern [[Iberia]], the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F.

The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of [[Muscovy]] began to include Northern Asia.

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (ancient [[Tanais]]). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was adopted by the Russian Empire, and introduced the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard, but not without criticism by many modern analytical geographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Europe: A History |page=8 |publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2010|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|date=1996|author1=Davies|first1=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108153922/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=8 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a "controversy" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the "best possible", citing support from various "modern geographers".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 Journey in the Caucasus]", ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13-14, 1869.
Cited as de facto convention by Baron von Haxthausen, ''Transcaucasia'' (1854); review [https://books.google.com/books?id=SN0EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 Dublin University Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E.M.

The [[European Neolithic]] period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in [[Greece]] and the [[Balkans]], probably influenced by earlier farming practices in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="Borza"&gt;{{Citation | last = Borza | first = E.N. | title = In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon | page = 58 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC&amp;pg=PA58 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992| isbn = 978-0691008806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]] ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) and along the [[Mediterranean coast]] ([[Cardial Ware|Cardial culture]]).

During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "[[Age of Migrations]]". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later on, the [[Vikings]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Magyars]].&lt;ref name="mieawl"/&gt; [[Renaissance]] thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1.

Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire]], also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]] that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and brought the Christian church under state control.&lt;ref name="natgeo 135"&gt;National Geographic, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring [[Sasanids|Sasanid Persians]] were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]], the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into [[Asia Minor]].

The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.&lt;ref name="natgeo 143"&gt;National Geographic, 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [[Clovis&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 162"&gt;National Geographic, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "[[Holy Roman Emperor]]" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 166"&gt;National Geographic, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Central Europe]] saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of [[Christianity]] (circa 1000 AD). The powerful [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] state of [[Great Moravia]] spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] and causing a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]]. Further south, the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic states]] emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted [[Christianity]]: the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] (later [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]]), and the [[Duchy of Croatia]] (later [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]). To the East, the [[Kievan Rus]] expanded from its capital in [[Kiev]] to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [[Vladimir the Great]] adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] as the religion of state.{{sfn|Bulliet|Crossley|Headrick|Hirsch|2011|page=250}}{{sfn|Brown|Anatolios|Palmer|2009|page=66}} Further East, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mako, "The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|High Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Medieval demography}}
The period between the year 1000 and 1300 is known as the [[High Middle Ages]], during which the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]] a leading role in the European scene.

[[File:Philip II and Tancred meeting in Messina - British Library Royal MS 16 G vi f350r (detail).jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|[[Tancred of Sicily]] and [[Philip II of France]], during the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–1192)]]

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]] developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"&gt;National Geographic, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A struggle for influence between the [[nobility]] and the [[monarchy]] in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 186"&gt;National Geographic, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"/&gt;

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 192"&gt;National Geographic, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics. In [[Spain]], the [[Reconquista]] concluded with the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 199"&gt;National Geographic, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laiou|Morisson|2007|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1979|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire was weakened following the defeat at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] and was weakened considerably by the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople in 1204]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name="DuikerSpielvogel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in [[Florence]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a [[Renaissance humanism|new humanism]] was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] and Arabic knowledge from [[Monasticism|monastic]] libraries, often translated from Arabic into [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Weiss|Weiss, Roberto]] (1969) ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', {{ISBN|1-59740-150-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Jacob Burckhardt]]|origyear=1878|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2074 |title=The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy|edition=translation by S.G.C Middlemore|year=1990|isbn=978-0-14-044534-3|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of [[Renaissance art|art]], [[philosophy]], [[music]], and the [[History of science in the Renaissance|sciences]], under the joint patronage of [[Royal family|royalty]], the nobility, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and an emerging merchant class.&lt;ref name="natgeo 254"&gt;National Geographic, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, De Lamar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe'', {{ISBN|0-395-88947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=Early Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrons in Italy, including the [[Medici]] family of Florentine bankers and the [[Pope]]s in [[Rome]], funded prolific [[quattrocento]] and [[cinquecento]] artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 292"&gt;National Geographic, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=High Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [[Western Schism]]. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in [[Avignon]] and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.&lt;ref name="natgeo 193"&gt;National Geographic, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=John Morris Roberts|title=Penguin History of Europe|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-026561-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 296"&gt;National Geographic, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration reached the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in the Atlantic and the Southern tip of Africa. [[Christopher Columbus]] reached the [[New World]] in 1492, and [[Vasco da Gama]] opened the ocean route to the [[Orient|East]] linking the Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s in 1498. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (a traveler in the Indian Ocean and [[Southeast Asia]] on previous voyages traveling east) reached Asia westward across the Atlantic and the [[Pacific Ocean]]s, resulting in the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] of the Globe, completed by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] (1519-1522). Soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing large global empires in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.&lt;ref name="natgeo 338"&gt;National Geographic, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia.

The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by [[The Ninety-Five Theses|the works]] of German theologian [[Martin Luther]], an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic faiths.&lt;ref name="natgeo 256"&gt;National Geographic, 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics History of Europe – Demographics].

In parallel, the [[Eastern Question]] grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the [[Great Power]]s struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The [[Russian Empire]] stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804) and [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the [[Balkans]], which ended with the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912-1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=3044&amp;HistoryID=ac79], ''Ottoman Empire – 19th century'', Historyworld&lt;/ref&gt; Formal recognition of the ''de facto'' independent principalities of [[Montenegro]], [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Romania]] ensued at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.

Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918.

Russia was plunged into the [[Russian Revolution]], which threw down the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist monarchy]] and replaced it with the [[communist]] [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 480"&gt;National Geographic, 480.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The [[Treaty of Versailles]], which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.&lt;ref name="natgeo 443"&gt;''National Geographic'', 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the [[Russian Civil War]] (including the postwar [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]]) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mark Harrison| title = Accounting for War: Soviet Production, Employment, and the Defence Burden, 1940–1945| url = https://books.google.com/?id=yJcD7_Q_rQ8C&amp;pg=PA167| date = 18 July 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-89424-1| page = 167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932–1933, under [[Stalin]]'s leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932-1933|second Soviet famine]] which caused millions of deaths;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6179818.stm Legacy of famine divides Ukraine]".

The [[social revolution]]s sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following [[The Great War]]: in 1919, with the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany, and the [[First Austrian Republic]]; in 1922, with [[Mussolini]]'s one party [[Fascism|fascist]] government in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and in [[Ataturk]]'s [[Turkish Republic]], adopting the Western alphabet, and state [[secularism]].
Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought about the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, [[Fascism|fascist movements]] developed throughout Europe placing [[Adolf Hitler]] in power of what became [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|publisher=Vintage|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-73005-7|title=The Age of Extremes: A history of the world, 1914–1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 438"&gt;''National Geographic'', 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [[Saarland]] and [[Rhineland]] in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [[Austria]] became a part of Germany following the [[Anschluss]]. Later that year, following the [[Munich Agreement]] signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the [[Sudetenland]], which was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]]. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of [[appeasement]].

With tensions mounting between Germany and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] over the future of [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the [[European Theatre of World War II]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 465"&gt;National Geographic, 465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=A. J. P.|title= The Origins of the Second World War|year=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=978-0-684-82947-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Baltic countries]] and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at [[Battles of Narvik|Narvik]] and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The [[Phoney War]] continued.

In May 1940, Germany [[Battle of France|attacked France]] through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a [[Battle of Britain|bombing offensive on Britain]], but failed to convince the Britons to give up.&lt;ref name="natgeo 510"&gt;''National Geographic'', 510.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 532"&gt;''National Geographic'', 532.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 1941 [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the [[British Empire]] and other [[Allies of World War II|allied]] forces.&lt;ref name="natgeo 511"&gt;''National Geographic'', 511.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 519"&gt;''National Geographic'', 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the staggering [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The [[Battle of Kursk]], which involved the largest [[Battle of Prokhorovka|tank battle]] in history, was the last major German offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally [[Battle of Berlin|fell in 1945]], ending World War II in Europe.

World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an "[[Iron Curtain]]". The United States and Western Europe
established the [[NATO]] alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 530"&gt;National Geographic, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Schuman Declaration]] led to the creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. It began the [[European integration|integration process]] of the [[European Union]] ([[Europe Day|9 May]] 1950, at the [[French Foreign Ministry]]).]]

The two new [[superpower]]s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on [[nuclear proliferation]]. At the same time [[decolonisation]], which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"/&gt; In the 1980s the [[glasnost|reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"/&gt;

[[European integration]] also grew after World War II. The [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 established the [[European Economic Community]] between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.&lt;ref name="natgeo 536"&gt;National Geographic, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the EEC, [[European Coal and Steel Community]] and [[Euratom]] formed the [[European Community]], which in 1993 became the [[European Union]]. The EU established a [[European Parliament|parliament]], [[European Court of Justice|court]] and [[European Central Bank|central bank]] and introduced the [[euro]] as a unified currency.&lt;ref name="natgeo 537"&gt;National Geographic, 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding the EU]] to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.&lt;ref name="natgeo 535"&gt;National Geographic, 535.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2016 the people of the United Kingdom, in a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|non-binding referendum]] on EU membership voted to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Europe}}
[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions]]

Europe makes up the western fifth of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Cuper |first = Simon |date = 23 May 2014 |title = Why Europe works |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/51dd9432-db03-11e3-8273-00144feabdc0.html |publisher = [[Financial Times|ft.com]] |accessdate = 28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Europe]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate |title=European Climate |website=World Book |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=World Book, Inc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109230709/http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight%2Fclimates%2Feuropean_climate |archivedate=9 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is {{convert|16|°C}}, while it is only {{convert|12|°C}} in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around {{convert|8|C-change}} higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost {{convert|22|C-change}} higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.&lt;ref name="climate"/&gt; Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a temperate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is {{convert|9.05|C|F}}. However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of {{convert|-6.5|C|F}}, giving it a nearly subarctic climate.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Europe|Geological history of Europe}}
[[File:Mount Elbrus May 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Elbrus]] in [[Russia]] is the highest mountain in Europe.]]

The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, followed by the [[Volgo–Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&amp;nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&amp;nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |title=Europe |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015044/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |archivedate=4 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gibraltar-Europa-Point-LH-from-the-sea.jpg|thumb|Europa Point as seen from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].]]
The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

===Flora===

Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]

Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&amp;geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf and mixed]] forests, [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

===Fauna===
{{main|Fauna of Europe}}
[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|right|thumb|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]

Glaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the [[small tortoiseshell]] butterfly, add to the biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, S., Thomas, C. and Bale, J. (1997), Nettle-feeding nymphalid butterflies: temperature, development and distribution. Ecological Entomology, 22: 390–398. {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2311.1997.00082.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html|title=Paleolithic Man and his Environment in Malta|last1=Savona-Ventura|first1=C.|last2=Mifsud|first2=A.|date=9 April 1997|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:39:06|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]], which has also been signed by the [[European Community]] as well as non-European states.

{{Supranational European Bodies|size=300px|align=right}}

The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is [[parliamentary democracy]], in most cases in the form of [[Republic]]; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the [[Monarchies in Europe|Monarchy]]. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies&lt;ref&gt;not counting the microstate of [[Vatican City]]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]].

[[European integration]] is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the [[Council of Europe]] since the end of [[World War II]]
The [[European Union]] has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.

28 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free [[Schengen Area]] and 19 of the monetary union [[Eurozone]]. Among the smaller European organizations are the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Visegrád Group]].

Several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or in close proximity to Europe. This includes Åland (a [[region of Finland]]), two constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three [[Crown dependencies]], and two [[British Overseas Territories]]. Svalbard is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three [[countries of the United Kingdom]] with devolved powers and the two [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal]], which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as [[Heligoland]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are also not included for this reason.

{{Main|Economy of Europe|List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP)}}

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7&amp;nbsp;trillion compared to North America's $27.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fineman |first=Josh |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128110049/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |title=Global Wealth Stages a Strong Comeback |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520174617/http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]]; some of the [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an economies are still emerging from the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].

The European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. 19 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=The CIA World Factbook – GDP (PPP)|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008|publisher=[[CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is [[Moldova]] with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=12&amp;id=4&amp;CNO=2|title=The World Bank DataBank |website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco]] is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.

As a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Some data refers to IMF staff estimates but some are actual figures for the year 2017, made in 12 April 2017.

===Economic history===
;Industrial growth (1760–1945)
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517172857/http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism |date=17 May 2014 }}. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

;Cold War (1945–1991)
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking International Organisation: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19540-9|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).&lt;ref name="loc-cs"&gt;"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US Department of State Office of the historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

;Reunification (1991–present)
[[File:Carte zone euro.svg|thumb| [[Eurozone]] (blue colour)]]
With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and [[Slovenia]] adopted them reasonably quickly, while [[Ukraine]] and Russia are still in the process of doing so.

After [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.

By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepropheticyears.com/reasons/The%20rise%20of%20the...oman%20empire.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}{{Better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the population of Europe was estimated to be 742 million according to {{UN_Population|source}}, which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. This number includes Asian Russia (Siberia, about 36 million people) but excludes the European part of Turkey, Cyprus and the Transcaucasian countries.
A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the [[world population|world's population]].&lt;ref name="World Population Growth, 1950–2050"&gt;[http://www.prb.org/Educators/TeachersGuides/HumanPopulation/PopulationGrowth.aspx?p=1 World Population Growth, 1950–2050].

Most of Europe is in a mode of [[Sub-replacement fertility]], which means that each new(-born) generation is being less populous than the older.
The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is the [[microstate]] of [[Monaco]].

===Ethnic groups===
{{main|Ethnic groups in Europe}}

Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "peoples of Europe", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Pan, Beate Sibylle Pfeil, ''Minderheitenrechte in Europa.

According to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653&amp;nbsp;million people (medium variant, 556 to 777&amp;nbsp;million in low and high variants, respectively).&lt;ref name="UNPP 2006" /&gt; Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to [[Human overpopulation|fertility rates]].

Today, [[European diaspora|large populations of European descent]] are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]], while most of the other [[Latin America]]n countries also have a considerable [[White Latin American|population of European origins]]). [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [[Cape Verde]] and probably [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in [[Northern Asia]] (specifically [[Russians]]) and some parts of Northern [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}

Europe has about 225 indigenous languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edl.ecml.at/LanguageFun/LanguageFacts/tabid/1859/Default.aspx Language facts – European day of languages], Council of Europe. Retrieved 30 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; mostly falling within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (that is, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

A distinct non-Indo-European family of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]]) is spoken mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], and parts of Russia. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe ([[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]], [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Nogai language|Nogai]], and [[Tatar language|Tatar]]). [[Kartvelian languages]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan language|Svan]]) are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], most notably including [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Avar language|Avar]], and [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]]; and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], most notably including [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]). [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only European [[language isolate]].

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

==Culture==
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette|Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette]]'', 1876, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]
{{Main|Culture of Europe}}
{{further|European folklore|European art}}
"Europe" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|its culture]].
The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of [[Christendom]] (or more specifically [[Latin Christendom]]), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially [[Islamic conquests|against Islam]], as in the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilarie Belloc]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8442 Europe and the Faith], Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;

This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into [[Slavic Europe|Slavic]], [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin (Romance)]] and [[Germanic Europe|Germanic]], but with several components not part of either of these group (notably [[Greek culture|Greek]] and [[Celtic Europe|Celtic]]).
Cultural contact and mixtures characterise much of European regional cultures; Kaplan (2014) describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".{{clarify|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andreas M.

Among Protestants, the most popular are historically state-supported European denominations such as [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Reformed faith]]. Other Protestant denominations such as historically significant ones like [[Anabaptists]] were never supported by any state and thus are not so widespread, as well as these newly arriving from the [[United States]] such as [[Pentecostalism]], [[Adventism]], [[Methodism]], [[Baptists]] and various [[Evangelical Protestants]]; although Methodism and Baptists both have European origins. The notion of "Europe" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religions, including Judaism, [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's [[Republic of Kalmykia]]). The 20th century saw the revival of [[Neopaganism]] through movements such as [[Wicca]] and [[Druidry]].

The '''Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desert''' is a coastal [[ecoregion]] on the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Oman]] in [[Oman]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] at the northeastern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The climate is hot and dry; the ecoregion contains a mixture of habitats including [[mangrove]] swamps, lagoons and mudflats on the coast, and gravelly plains and [[savanna]] with thorny acacia trees inland. The mangrove areas are dominated by ''[[Avicennia marina]]'' and the savanna by ''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'' and ''[[Vachellia tortilis]]''. [[Masirah Island]] is an important breeding area for the [[loggerhead sea turtle]] and other sea turtles also occur here, as well as a great variety of birds, some resident and some migratory. There are some protected areas, but in general the habitats have been degraded by the grazing of livestock, especially camels and goats; they are also at risk from oil spills, off-road driving and poaching.

==Location and description==
In Oman this ecoregion includes the [[Musandam Peninsula]], the enclave of Oman within the UAE on the [[Strait of Hormuz]],  the entrance to the [[Persian Gulf]]. In the main part of Oman it includes the coastal plain of the [[Al Batinah Region]] on the Gulf of Oman continuing along past [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] to the beaches and dunes of the [[Ash Sharqiyah Region (Oman)|Ash Sharqiyah Region]]. From the [[Ras al Hadd]] point it runs south along the coast to the desert island of [[Masirah Island|Masirah]]. It also includes an inland strip running along to the southwest of the [[Al Hajar Mountains]]. In the UAE it covers the plains around the Al Hajar mountains in the east, in the emirates of [[Dubai]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] and [[Ras Al-Khaimah]], and the country's Al Batinah coast around [[Fujairah]].

This dry ecoregion contains a mixture of habitats including [[mangrove]] swamps, lagoons and mudflats on the coast, gravelly plains and [[savanna]] with thorny [[acacia]] trees inland with a background of the Musandam and Al Hajar mountains. The climate is hot and dry with temperatures up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 °F) and little rainfall, especially on the Persian Gulf coast of the UAE. There is more rainfall on the Gulf of Oman and humidity provides moisture on both coasts.

==Flora==
The coastal mangrove consists of ''[[Avicennia marina]]'', trees of the inland savanna include ''[[Ziziphus spina-christi]]'', ''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'' and the Umbrella Thorn ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'' while the mountains are home to ''[[Ficus cordata]] salicifolia'', and ''Acacia tortilis''. Finally the traditional flora of the Al Batinah coast is ''Acacia tortilis'' and ''Prosopis cineraria''. Some of these species are found across the Persian Gulf in [[Iran]].

==Fauna==
The world's largest population of [[loggerhead sea turtle]] ''(Caretta caretta)'' breeds on Masirah Island and other turtles that come to these coasts include the [[olive ridley]] ''(Lepydochelys olivacea)'', [[green turtle]] ''(Chelonia mydas)'' and the endangered [[hawksbill turtle]] ''(Eretmochelys imbricata)''. The area is extremely rich in birdlife including a large migration between Asia and Africa. Endemic birds include a species of [[collared kingfisher]]. Mammals include the endangered [[Arabian leopard]] ''(Panthera pardus nimr)'' in the mountains and [[Arabian tahr]], as well as [[caracal]]s but all these are vulnerable to hunting.

==Threats and preservation==
Habitats have been degraded by the grazing of livestock, especially camels and goats. The Al Batinah coastal strip of Oman is the country's most densely populated area and is intensively farmed, partly by Oman's large community of [[Baloch people]] of [[Pakistan]]i origin. Urban areas in this ecoregion in Oman include the country's capital and largest city, the historical port of Muscat, and the fishing towns of [[Barka, Oman|Barka]], famous for its bull-butting, and [[Sohar]], legendarily the home of [[Sindbad the Sailor]], and the resort of [[Al Sawadi, Oman|Al Sawadi]]. Other tourist attractions along this coast include the historic castles of [[Nakhal Fort]] and [[Rustaq]], the [[Wahiba Sands]] and the turtle beaches at Ras Al Hadd and [[Ras al-Jinz]]. Cities of the UAE in this ecoregion include the huge commercial centre of Dubai and the nearby city of Sharjah. A popular excursion from Dubai is to the Hajar Mountains enclave of [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]].

Other threats to the ecoregion include oil spills in the sea, poaching of wildlife and off-road driving to locations such as [[Wadi Bani Awf]]. Protected areas include [[Ras Al Khor]] in [[Dubai]], famous for its wintering [[flamingo]]s, and an area of mangroves at [[Khor Kalba Nature Reserve]] on the Gulf of Oman in the UAE near the border with Oman.

'''''Hevea brasiliensis''''', the '''Pará rubber tree''', '''''sharinga'' tree, seringueira''', or, most commonly, the '''rubber tree''' or '''rubber plant''', is a tree belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Euphorbiaceae]]. It is the most economically important member of the genus ''[[Hevea]]'' because the milky [[latex]] extracted from the tree is the primary source of [[natural rubber]].

==Description==
''H. brasiliensis'' is a tall deciduous tree growing to a height of up to  {{convert|43|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the wild, but cultivated trees are usually much smaller because drawing off the latex restricts the growth of the tree. The trunk is cylindrical and may have a swollen, bottle-shaped base. The bark is some shade of brown, and the inner bark oozes [[latex]] when damaged. The leaves have three leaflets and are spirally arranged. The inflorescence include separate male and female flowers. The flowers are pungent, creamy-yellow and have no petals. The fruit is a capsule that contains three large seeds; it opens explosively when ripe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:349913-1 |title=''Hevea brasiliensis'' (Willd. ex A.Juss.) Müll.Arg. |work=Plants of the World online |publisher=Kew Science |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rubber tree plantation==
[[Image:Hevea semillas2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rubber tree seeds]]
In the wild, the tree can reach a height of up to {{convert|140|ft|m}}. The white or yellow latex occurs in latex vessels in the [[Bark (botany)|bark]], mostly outside the [[phloem]]. These vessels spiral up the tree in a right-handed [[helix]] which forms an [[angle]] of about 30 degrees with the horizontal, and can grow as high as 45&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name=FAO/&gt;

In plantations, the trees are generally smaller for two reasons: 1) trees grow more slowly when they are tapped for latex, and 2) trees are generally cut down after only 30 years, because latex production declines as trees age, and they are no longer economically productive. The tree requires a tropical or subtropical climate with a minimum of about 1,200&amp;nbsp;mm per year of rainfall, and no frost.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; If frost does occur, the results can be disastrous for production. One frost can cause the rubber from an entire plantation to become brittle and break once it has been refined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/AD221E/AD221E01.htm |title=The rubber tree |author= |date= |work= |publisher=FAO |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latex tapping===
{{Main|Rubber  tapping}}
[[Image:The face of rubber tree's trunk.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rubber tree trunk]]
[[image:Tapped rubber tree.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Latex being collected from an incised rubber tree and a bucket of collected latex]]
Harvesters make incisions across the latex vessels, just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the tree's growth, and the latex is collected in small buckets. This process is known as [[rubber tapping]]. Latex production is highly variable from tree to tree and across clone types.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/AD221E/AD221E06.htm |title=Rubber tapping |publisher=FAO |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood harvesting===
{{Main|Rubberwood}}
As latex production declines with age, rubber trees are generally felled when they reach the age of 25 to 30 years. The earlier practice was to burn the trees, but in recent decades, the wood has been harvested for furniture making.&lt;ref name=FAO/&gt;

==History==
The South American rubber tree grew only in the [[Amazon rainforest]], and increasing demand and the discovery of the [[vulcanization]] procedure in 1839 led to the [[Amazon rubber boom|rubber boom]] in that region, enriching the cities of [[Belém]], [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém]], [[Manaus]] and [[Iquitos]], [[Peru]], of 1840 to 1913. In Brazil, the initial name of the plant was ''pará rubber tree.''  The name of the tree derives from [[State of Grão-Pará and Rio Negro|Grão-Pará and Rio Negro]] or only Grão-Pará (Great-Pará), the largest Brazilian province until 1850, the capital of which is Belém, where most of the fluid, also called ''[[latex]]'', was extracted and exported.  In Peru, in addition to the hispanic-speaking countries of the Amazon region, the name given was ''árbol del caucho'', with the fluid extracted called ''caucho''. These trees were used to obtain rubber by the natives who inhabited its geographical distribution. The [[Olmec]] people of [[Mesoamerica]] extracted and produced similar forms of primitive rubber from analogous latex-producing trees such as ''[[Castilla elastica]]'' as early as 3,600 years ago. The rubber was used, among other things, to make the balls used in the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maya-archaeology.org/Mayan_anthropology_ethnography_archaeology_art_history_iconography_epigraphy_ethnobotany/rubber_hule_Castilla_elastica_incense_idols_ball_game_balls_Guatemala_Chiapas_Mexico_Belize_Hevea_brasiliensis.php |title=Introduction to Rubber Usage among the Maya |author=Langenheim, J.H. |date=13 January 2010 |publisher=Maya Archaeology |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts were made in 1873 to grow ''H. brasilensis'' outside [[Brazil]]. After some effort, 12 seedlings were germinated at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. These were sent to [[India]] for cultivation, but died. A second attempt was then made, some 70,000 seeds being smuggled to Kew in 1875, by [[Henry Wickham (explorer)|Henry Wickham]], in the service of the British Empire.&lt;ref name=df&gt;"The Brazilian Armed Forces: Current changes, new challenges", ''Dreifuss, R.

The cultivation of the tree in South America (Amazon) ended early in the 20th century because of [[blight]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Elastomer-The rubber tree", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The blight, called South American leaf blight, is caused by the [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], ''[[Microcyclus ulei]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantwise.org/knowledgebank/datasheet.aspx?dsid=33893 South American Leaf Blight of rubber (Microcyclus ulei)], plantwise.org&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Pseudocercospora ulei''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104750#pone-0104750-g006 Erasing the Past: A New Identity for the Damoclean Pathogen Causing South American Leaf Blight of Rubber]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==
The toxicity of arsenic to [[insect]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]] has led to the heavy use of [[arsenic trioxide]] on rubber plantations, especially in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Sabina C. Grund, Kunibert Hanusch, Hans Uwe Wolf | title = Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a03_113.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the rubber trees in Southeast Asia are clones of varieties highly susceptible to the South American leaf blight—''Microcyclus ulei''.  For these reasons, environmental historian Charles C. Mann, in his 2011 book, ''1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created'', predicted that the Southeast Asian rubber plantations will be ravaged by the blight in the not-too-distant future, thus creating a potential calamity for international industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Charles C.|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|year=2011|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-26572-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7055">'''Holznot''' (German for '''wood shortage''') is a historic term for an existing or imminent supply crisis of wood.

== Historical use ==
[[File:GemmageCrot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Resin worker]]s were seen as outdated and damaging to modern forestry]]
In particular, the concept was applied to Central Europe around the end of the 16th century till the start of the early 19th century in numerous sources. In almost all German-speaking regions, a wood shortage and resulting wood-saving measures became an important topic. &lt;ref&gt;[[Joachim Radkau]], Technik in Deutschland. Vom 18. Jahrhundert bis heute. Frankfurt/New York 2008, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = wood&gt; [http://www.historeinonline.org/index.php/historein/article/viewFile/180/176 review of Joachim Radkau Wood: A History Cambridge: Polity Press, 2012. 399 pp. by Vaso Seirinidou University of Athens]&lt;/ref&gt;
Forestry and history scholars did not dispute the wood shortage ''per se'' for a long time. Besides the [[tragedy of the commons]] legend, the alleged Holznot was critical to motivate the shift from forest use as part of [[Subsistence economy|subsistence agriculture]] to modern professional forestry and was an important base of the development of modern forestry science around 1800. Around the 1980s, [[Environmental history|environmental historian]] [[Joachim Radkau]] raising doubts about the alleged 18th-century wood shortage started a research controversy among German historians, called the "Holznotdebatte". Radkau debated e.g. with [[Rolf Peter Sieferle]] about the existence, extent, and spatial and social impact of perceived or real existing wood shortages and the associated ideological and economic background.&lt;ref name=wein&gt;Elisabeth Weinberger: ''Waldnutzung und Waldgewerbe in Altbayern im 18. und beginnenden 19. Jahrhundert.'' Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 2001, {{ISBN|3-515-07610-7}}. (Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte: Beihefte Band 157)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Uekötter, Umweltgeschichte im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. Enzyklopädie deutscher Geschichte, Bd. 81, (hg. v. [[Lothar Gall]]), München 2007, S.  8. &lt;/ref&gt; Radkau doubted the Holznot had existed at all. Similar as with the [[tragedy of the commons]] he saw a strong ideological motive to get rid of the traditional farmers' forest access.&lt;ref name = wood/&gt;

Radkau repeats [[Werner Sombart]]’s notion of the pre-industrial phase as a “Wooden Age”, where wood
constituted the key substance for fuel energy, construction and machinery. While Sombart was positive about the change to an "iron age", Radkau is critical about the alleged decline of “wooden civilisation”. Before the industrial century, the “wood brake”, as he names it, was a component of stability, of the ecology and the traditional economic and social order. In connection  with the first [[Berggeschrey| medieval mining rushes]] regional wood shortages gave rise to the first use of [[sustainability]] in German forestry.

However the situation began to change in the 16th century, as meeting point of the capitalist expansion and the formation of the absolutist state. From the 16th century, world maritime trade, housing construction in Europe and the mountain mining industry brought a sharp rise in timber consumption. The absolutist state asked for a new order of the use of forests and area property rights at the expense of livestock grazing and traditional forest use, as in [[Resin extraction]]. Complaints about wood shortages served according Radkau to legitimate state intervention and to exclude of traditional groups of users, as [[resin worker]]s and [[wood pasture]] in favour of more profitable timber consumers.&lt;ref name = wood/&gt;

== Peak wood ==
The term '''peak wood''' refers to the point in time when the maximum rate of wood harvesting is reached. The term 'peak' refers to the [[Hubbert peak]] of a resource. Thus peak wood and [[peak oil]] cannot be compared directly.&lt;ref name=ind2010&gt;{{cite web

Unlike resources such as [[petroleum]], which are destroyed in use, wood continually grows and recycled, but it requires habitat (forests, woodland and timber plantations).

In the 2011 book ''[[Life Without Oil]]'' by [[Steve Hallett]], the author argues that the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] may have been linked to a peak wood scenario in the Mediterranean basin.  He suggests that, as wood had to be hauled from ever further away, the [[law of diminishing returns]] undermined the economic performance of Roman industry, leaving Rome vulnerable to the other, well documented problems of invasion and internal division. The issue is discussed as cautionary tale comparing it to contemporary society's potential fate under a post-[[peak oil]] scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Without Oil: Why We Must Shift to a New Energy Future |last=Hallett |first=Steve |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |accessdate=24 July 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XhGp1vJ2wkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its relevance for ancient and current times is however disputed strongly.

'''John Ormsbee Simonds''' was born in [[Jamestown, North Dakota]] on March 11, 1913. He was a visionary [[landscape architect]], planner, educator, and [[environmentalist]]. Simonds was an original modernist landscape architect and one of the most influential and well-known of his time.

== Career ==
In 1935 he graduated with a B.S. in Landscape Architecture from [[Michigan State University]]. He went on to receive a Master's from [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]. After finishing school, Simonds and his brother Phil established their company, Simonds and Simonds, later known as Environmental Planning and Development Partnership. While continuing his company he published his first book, ''Landscape Architecture: The Shaping of Man's Natural Environment''. In 1973 Simonds received his first and most honorable award, the [[American Society of Landscape Architects|ASLA]] medal. Shortly after being awarded, Simonds released another publication titled, ''Earthscape: A Manual of Environmental Planning''. In 1983 and 1998 he released the second and then third edition of his publication ''Landscape Architecture''. Before his death in May 2005, Simonds received his last award, the ASLA President's Centennial Medal in 1998.

== Influences ==
The first most important influence was Simonds' father, Guy Wallace, a [[Presbyterian]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]. Simonds' father helped him to develop a love and appreciation for nature, and the ability to speak to others with great enthusiasm. As his designs developed, the use of incorporating nature with quality and balance became his foremost goal and attribute to design.

Simonds' design was also greatly influenced by his travels to [[Asia]]. He began to use aspects of the [[Zen]] [[philosophy]] and their idea of the garden being harmonious. Simonds wanted the garden to become a way for humans to create a relationship with plants. With his travels to Asia and studies under modern architects [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] at [[Harvard]], Simonds' designs became the best they could be and remain a part of today's society, influencing rising architects.

== Accomplishments ==
The basis of Simonds' firm was centered on parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, urban area and space, and many large gardens.

[[Mellon Square]], in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], was built in 1951 and is one of Simonds major designs. The garden was one of the first and few placed on top a parking garage. "Mellon Square was intended by Simonds to be an oasis, a civic movement, and a gathering space in the midst of downtown office towers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tclf.org/pioneers/simonds.htm |author=Slade, Nancy |title=Remembering John Ormsbee Simonds, FASLA |year=2007 |publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222114129/http://www.tclf.org/pioneers/simonds.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social movement of [[World War II]] and the Pittsburgh [[Renaissance]] both greatly influenced Simonds' work. During this time Pittsburgh was in the need of deep restoration. The Simonds and Simonds Company became very popular, taking in many new commissions, the Mellon Square being one of the first and most important reconstructions of civic space.

In 1960 the company, now the Environmental Planning and Design Partnership, expanded their work away from Pittsburgh. The [[Chicago Botanic Garden]] became well known for its impact on landscape architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobotanic.org/info/index.php |title=About the Chicago Botanical Garden |publisher=Chicago Botanical Garden Organization |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020040027/http://www.chicagobotanic.org/info/index.php |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The botanic garden was built from an unpleasant source of land in [[Glencoe, Illinois]]. "The site covers over 300 acres, featuring a series of island gardens with an administration and visitor education center on the largest island."&lt;ref name=Smathers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/SPEC/exhibits/simonds.pdf| title=John Ormsbee Simonds Remembered| publisher=George Smathers Library| year=2006| accessdate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simonds created a garden that incorporated an area for education of plants and actual touchable exhibits. Like the Mellon Square, the focus of creating relationships between human and plant can be seen within this design.

In the 1970s, [[Florida]] was in the process of creating new communities. During this time, Simonds changed his focus to large scale developments, allowing Florida's new communities to be options of work. [[Pelican Bay, Florida|Pelican Bay]], located in [[Naples, Florida]], became one of Simonds' great large-scale projects. He also established and developed the term PUD, [[Planned Unit Development]], within the bay community. The greatness of this design was the combination of nature and community with nothing overpowering the scene. The design involved the use of nature features, which enabled the area to preserve the [[ecology]] of the region.&lt;ref name=Smathers/&gt; Pelican Bay became widely appreciated and recognized after receiving the New Community Development Award for Excellence by the [[Urban Land Institute]].

Simonds took part in 500 projects and was a planner of 80 communities and 4 new towns. Some of his famous works include:
*Pittsburgh Aviary - Conservatory [http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/manuscript/guides/Simonds.htm]
*[[Interstate 66]] in Virginia
*Allegheny Commons [http://www.post-gazette.com/neigh_city/20011124commonscity1p1.asp]

== Significance to landscape architecture ==
Simonds moved the focus in landscape architecture from plants to the idea of plants and human relationship. He created a movement of change from landscape specialists to landscape [[environmentalists]], [[urban design]]ers, and [[regional planning|regional planners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/manuscript/guides/Simonds.htm| title=A Guide to the John Ormsbee Simonds Collection.| author=Nemmers, John| page=3| publisher=George Smathers Libraries, University of Florida| year=2006| accessdate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style in which he created was no longer just a design, but rather it became a place for people to experience. John Ormsbee Simonds will always have a great impact on Landscape Architecture and will continue to influence many landscape designs.

The '''list of Florida hurricanes from 1950 to 1974''' encompasses 85 Atlantic [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s that affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in about $7.04&amp;nbsp;billion (2017&amp;nbsp;USD) in damage, primarily from [[Hurricane Donna|Hurricanes Donna]] and [[Hurricane Dora|Dora]]. Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were directly responsible for 93&amp;nbsp;fatalities during the period, as well as responsible for 23 indirect deaths. Several tropical cyclones produced over 20&amp;nbsp;inches (500&amp;nbsp;mm) of rainfall in the state, including [[Hurricane Easy (1950)|Hurricane Easy]] which is the highest total during the time period. The [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969 season]] was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, with a total of 8 systems. The [[1954 Atlantic hurricane season|1954]] and [[1967 Atlantic hurricane season|1967 seasons]] were the only years during the time period in which a storm did not affect the state.

This is the '''List of Wetlands of International Importance''' as defined by the [[Ramsar Convention]] for the [[conservation movement|conservation]] and [[sustainable use]] of [[wetland]]s, recognizing the fundamental [[ecological]] functions of wetlands and their [[economic]], [[cultural]], [[scientific]], and [[recreational]] value.&lt;ref name="Ramsar list"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramsar List|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/sitelist.pdf|publisher=Ramsar.org|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wetlands.org/RSDB/default.htm Ramsar Sites Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714104645/http://www.wetlands.org/RSDB/default.htm |date=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention establishes that "wetlands should be selected for the list on account of their international significance in terms of [[ecology]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[limnology]] or [[hydrology]]." Over the years, the Conference of the Contracting Parties has adopted more specific criteria interpreting the Convention text.

The complete list of Wetlands of International Importance is accessible from the Ramsar website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org|title=Homepage - Ramsar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of submarine topographical features''', oceanic [[landform]]s and [[topographic]] elements.

==Abyssal plain==
An [[abyssal plain]] is an underwater [[plain]] on the deep [[ocean floor]], usually found at depths between {{convert|3000|m|sp=us}} and {{convert|6000|m|sp=us}}. Lying generally between the foot of a [[Continental shelf#Topography|continental rise]] and a [[mid-ocean ridge]], abyssal plains are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored regions on Earth.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of [[oceanic basin]]s (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking [[abyssal hill]]s). In addition to these elements, ''active'' oceanic basins (those that are associated with a moving [[Plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] boundary) also typically include an [[oceanic trench]] and a [[subduction|subduction zone]]. Abyssal plains cover more than 33% of the ocean floor (about 23% of Earth’s surface),&lt;ref name="Harris, P.T. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harris P.T., MacMillan-Lawler M., Rupp J., Baker E.K. | year = 2014 | title = Geomorphology of the oceans | url = | journal = Marine Geology | volume = 352 | issue = | pages = 4–24 | doi=10.1016/j.margeo.2014.01.011| bibcode = 2014MGeol.352....4H}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are poorly preserved in the [[Geologic record|sedimentary record]] because they tend to be consumed by the subduction process.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;&lt;ref name=CRS2008&gt;{{cite journal

The abyssal plain is formed when the lower [[oceanic crust]] is melted and forced upwards by the [[asthenosphere]] layer of the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. As this [[basalt]]ic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained [[sediment]]s, mainly [[clay]] and [[silt]]. Much of this sediment is deposited from [[turbidity current]]s that have been channeled from the [[continental margin]]s along [[submarine canyon]]s down into deeper water. The remainder of the sediment is composed chiefly of [[pelagic sediments]].

Use of a continuously recording [[Fishfinder|fathometer]] enabled Tolstoy &amp; Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tolstoy1949/&gt; This plain, located to the south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], is now known as the [[Sohm Abyssal Plain]].&lt;ref name=Tolstoy1949&gt;{{cite journal

==Oceanic trenches==
[[File:Marianatrenchmap.png|300px|thumb|right|Location of the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]]]]
[[Oceanic trench]]es are long, narrow [[topography|topographic]] depressions of the [[seabed]]. They are the deepest parts of the ocean floor, and they define one of the most important natural boundaries on the Earth's solid surface: the one between two [[Lithosphere|lithospheric]] plates. Trenches are a distinctive morphological feature of [[Plate boundaries#Types of plate boundaries|plate boundaries]]. Trenches are found in all oceans with the exception of the Arctic Ocean and they are most common in the North and South Pacific Oceans.&lt;ref name="Harris, P.T. 2014"/&gt;

There are three types of lithospheric plate boundaries: 1.) [[Divergent boundary|divergent]] (where lithosphere and oceanic crust is created at mid-ocean ridges), 2.) [[Convergent boundary|convergent]] (where one lithospheric plate sinks beneath another and returns to the mantle), and 3.) [[Transform fault|transform]] (where two lithospheric plates slide past each other).

An oceanic trench is a type of convergent boundary at which two oceanic lithospheric slabs meet; the older (and therefore denser) of these slabs flexes and subducts beneath the other slab. Oceanic lithosphere moves into trenches at a global rate of about a tenth of a square meter per second. Trenches are generally parallel to a [[High island|volcanic]] [[island arc]], and about 200&amp;nbsp;km from a [[volcanic arc]]. Oceanic trenches typically extend 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;km (1.9 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;mi) below the level of the surrounding oceanic floor. The greatest ocean depth to be sounded is in the [[Challenger Deep]] of the [[Mariana Trench]], at a depth of 10,911 m (35,798&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level.

==Oceanic plateau==
An '''[[oceanic plateau]]''' is a large, relatively flat submarine region that rises well above the level of the ambient seabed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424535/oceanic-plateau oceanic plateau]. (2008). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved June 27, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; While many oceanic plateaus are composed of [[continental crust]], and often form a step interrupting the [[continental margin|continental slope]], some plateaus are undersea remnants of [[large igneous province]]s. Continental crust has the highest amount of [[silicon]] (such rock is called [[felsic]]). Oceanic crust has a smaller amount of silicon ([[mafic]] rock).

The anomalous [[volcanism]] associated with the formation of oceanic plateaux at the time of the [[Cenomanian]]-[[Turonian]] boundary (90.4 [[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|million years]]) ago may have been responsible for the environmental disturbances that occurred at that time. The physical manifestations of this were elevated atmospheric and oceanic temperatures, a significant sea-level transgression, and a period of widespread [[anoxic event|anoxia]], leading to the extinction of 26% of all [[Genus|genera]].&lt;ref name=Kerr1998&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eruptions would also have resulted in the emission of large quantities of [[carbon dioxide]] into the atmosphere, leading to [[global warming]]. Additionally, the emission of [[sulfur monoxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[halogen]]s into the oceans would have made seawater more [[acid]]ic resulting in the dissolution of [[carbonate]], and further release of {{CO2}}. This [[runaway greenhouse effect]] was probably put into reverse by the decline of the anomalous volcanic activity and by increased {{CO2}}-driven productivity in oceanic surface waters, leading to increased [[organic carbon]] burial, black [[shale]] deposition, anoxia and [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] in the ocean basins.&lt;ref name=Kerr1998/&gt;

==Mid-ocean ridges==
A [[mid-ocean ridge]] is a general term for an [[underwater]] [[mountain range|mountain system]] that consists of various mountain ranges (chains), typically having a valley known as a [[rift]] running along its spine, formed by [[plate tectonics]]. This type of oceanic ridge is characteristic of what is known as an oceanic spreading center, which is responsible for [[seafloor spreading]].

{{ocean habitat topics|image=Littoral Zones.jpg|caption=Different disciplines and agencies divide the littoral zone into different subregions, according to how they want to view the zone.}}

The '''littoral zone''' is the part of a sea, lake or river that is close to the shore. In coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the [[high water mark]], which is rarely inundated, to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged. It always includes this [[intertidal zone]] and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone. However, the meaning of "littoral zone" can extend well beyond the intertidal zone.

There is no single definition. What is regarded as the full extent of the littoral zone, and the way the littoral zone is divided into subregions, varies in different contexts (lakes and rivers have their own definitions). The use of the term also varies from one part of the world to another, and between different disciplines. For example, military commanders speak of the littoral in ways that are quite different from marine biologists.

The adjacency of water gives a number of distinctive characteristics to littoral regions. The [[erosion|erosive]] power of water results in particular types of [[landform]]s, such as [[sand dune]]s, and [[estuary|estuaries]]. The natural movement of the littoral along the coast is called the [[littoral drift]]. Biologically, the ready availability of water enables a greater variety of plant and animal life, and particularly the formation of extensive [[wetlands]]. In addition, the additional local [[humidity]] due to evaporation usually creates a [[microclimate]] supporting unique types of organisms.

The word "littoral" is used both as a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]]. It derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] noun ''litus, litoris'', meaning "shore". (The doubled 't' is a late medieval innovation and the word is sometimes seen in the more classical-looking spelling 'litoral'.)

==In oceanography and marine biology==

{{wiktionary|littoral}}
{{wiktionary|circumlittoral|infralittoral|sublittoral|supralittoral}}

In [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]], the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Starting from the shoreline, the littoral zone begins at the spray region just above the high tide mark. From here, it moves to the intertidal region between the high and low water marks, and then out as far as the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. These three subregions are called, in order, the [[Littoral zone#Supralittoral zone|supralittoral zone]], the [[Littoral zone#Eublittoral zone|eulittoral zone]] and the [[Littoral zone#Sublittoral zone|sublittoral zone]].

===Supralittoral zone===
{{main|Supralittoral zone}}

The ''supralittoral zone'' (also called the ''splash'', ''spray'' or ''supratidal zone'') is the area above the spring high tide line that is regularly splashed, but not submerged by ocean water. Seawater penetrates these elevated areas only during storms with high tides. Organisms here must cope also with exposure to fresh water from rain, cold, heat and [[predation]] by land animals and seabirds. At the top of this area, patches of dark [[lichen]]s can appear as crusts on rocks. Some types of [[Common periwinkle|periwinkles]], [[Neritidae]] and detritus feeding [[Isopod]]a commonly inhabit the lower supralittoral.&lt;ref name="Yip and Madl"&gt;Yip and Madl&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eulittoral zone===
{{see also|Intertidal zone}}

The ''eulittoral zone'' (also called the ''midlittoral'' or ''mediolittoral zone'') is the ''intertidal zone'' also known as the ''foreshore''. It extends from the spring high tide line, which is rarely inundated, to the spring low tide line, which is rarely not inundated. The wave action and turbulence of recurring tides shapes and reforms cliffs, gaps, and caves, offering a huge range of habitats for sedentary organisms. Protected rocky shorelines usually show a narrow almost homogenous eulittoral strip, often marked by the presence of [[barnacle]]s. Exposed sites show a wider extension and are often divided into further zones. For more on this, see [[intertidal ecology]].

===Sublittoral zone===
{{see also|Neritic zone}}

The ''sublittoral zone'' starts immediately below the eulittoral zone. This zone is permanently covered with seawater and is approximately equivalent to the [[neritic zone]].

In [[physical oceanography]], the sublittoral zone refers to coastal regions with significant tidal flows and energy dissipation, including non-linear flows, [[internal wave]]s, river outflows and oceanic fronts. In practice, this typically extends to the edge of the [[continental shelf]], with depths around 200 meters.

In marine biology, the sublittoral refers to the areas where sunlight reaches the ocean floor, that is, where the water is never so deep as to take it out of the [[photic zone]]. This results in high [[primary production]] and makes the sublittoral zone the location of the majority of sea life. As in physical oceanography, this zone typically extends to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. The benthic zone in the sublittoral is much more stable than in the intertidal zone; temperature, water pressure, and the amount of sunlight remain fairly constant. Sublittoral corals do not have to deal with as much change as intertidal corals. [[Coral|Corals]] can live in both zones, but they are more common in the sublittoral zone.

Within the sublittoral, marine biologists also identify the following:
*The '''infralittoral zone''' is the algal dominated zone to maybe five metres below the low water mark.
*The '''circalittoral zone''' is the region beyond the infralittoral, that is, below the algal zone and dominated by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals such as [[oyster]]s.

Shallower regions of the sublittoral zone, extending not far from the shore, are sometimes referred to as the '''subtidal zone'''.

==In freshwater ecosystems==
[[File:Moon Lake shoreline - Riding Mountain National Park.JPG|thumb|right|Shoreline of a lake with nearly unvegetated littoral zone]]

In freshwater situations, littoral zones occur on the edge of large lakes and rivers, often with extensive areas of [[wetland]]. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as fringing wetlands. Here, the effects of tides are minimal, so other definitions of "littoral" are used. For example, the [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] defines littoral as that portion of the lake that is less than 15&amp;nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]] in depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/surveys.html#littoral|title=Fisheries lake surveys| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The littoral zone may form a narrow or broad fringing wetland, with extensive areas of aquatic plants sorted by their tolerance to different water depths.  Typically, four zones are recognized, from higher to lower on the shore: wooded wetland, [[wet meadow]], [[marsh]] and [[aquatic vegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative areas of these four types depends not only on the profile of the shoreline, but upon past water levels.  The area of wet meadow is particularly dependent upon past water levels;&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; in general, the area of wet meadows along lakes and rivers increases with natural water level fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, D.A, Thompson, T.A., Booth, R.K. and Nicholas, J.R. 2007. Lake-level variability and water availability in the Great Lakes. USGS Circular 1311. 25 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, F.M.R. (ed.). 2003. The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests. FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the animals in lakes and rivers are dependent upon the wetlands of littoral zones, since the rooted plants provide habitat and food. Hence, a large and productive littoral zone is considered an important characteristic of a healthy lake or river.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt;

Littoral zones are at particular risk for two reasons.  First, human settlement is often attracted to shorelines, and settlement often disrupts breeding habitats for littoral zone species.  For example, many turtles are killed on roads when they leave the water to lay their eggs in upland sites.  Fish can be negatively affected by docks and retaining walls which remove breeding habitat in shallow water.  Some shoreline communities even deliberately try to remove wetlands since they may interfere with activities like swimming. Overall, the presence of human settlement has a demonstrated negative impact upon adjoining wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houlahan|first1=J. E.|last2=Keddy|first2=P. A.|last3=Makkay|first3=K.|last4=Findlay|first4=C. S.|title=The effects of adjacent land use on wetland species richness and community composition|journal=Wetlands|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=79–96|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[79:TEOALU]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally serious problem is the tendency to stabilize lake or river levels with dams.  Dams removed the spring flood which carries nutrients into littoral zones, and reduces the natural fluctuation of water levels upon which many wetland plants and animals depend.&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, B. A. (ed.) 2002. Flood Pulsing in Wetlands: Restoring the Natural Hydrological Balance. John Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, over time, dams can reduce the area of wetland from a broad littoral zone to a narrow band of vegetation.  Marshes and wet meadows are at particular risk.

For the purposes of naval operations, the [[United States Navy]] divides the littoral zone in the ways shown on the diagram at the top of this article. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have their own definitions, and these have legal implications.

'''Microlite''' was once{{when|date=April 2018}} known as a pale-yellow, reddish-brown, or black [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric]] [[mineral]] composed of [[sodium]] [[calcium]] [[tantalum]] [[oxide]] with a small amount of [[fluorine]]  (Na,Ca)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(O,OH,F). Today{{when|date=April 2018}} it is a name of a group of oxide minerals of a similar stoichiometry having tantalum prevailing over titanium and niobium. The microlite group belongs to a large [[pyrochlore]] supergroup that occurs in [[pegmatite]]s and constitutes an [[ore]] of tantalum. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.5 and a variable [[specific gravity]] of 4.2 to 6.4. It occurs as disseminated  microscopic subtranslucent to opaque octahedral [[crystal]]s with a [[refractive index]] of 2.0 to 2.2. Microlite is also called djalmaite, but both names are now obsolete.

"Microlite" occurs as a primary mineral in lithium-bearing granite pegmatites, and in [[Miarolitic cavity|miarolitic cavities]] in granites. Association minerals include: [[albite]], [[lepidolite]], [[topaz]], [[beryl]], [[tourmaline]], [[spessartine]], [[tantalite]] and [[fluorite]].

"Microlite" was first described in 1835 for an occurrence on the Island of Uto, State of Stockholm, [[Sweden]]. A [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] is the Clark Ledges pegmatite, Chesterfield, [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts]]. The name is from Greek ''mikros'' for "small" and ''lithos'' for "stone."

'''Nacientes del Biobío Formation''' ({{lang-es|Formación Nacientes del Biobío}}) is a [[geological formation]] that [[outcrop|crops out]] near the uppermost reaches of [[Bío Bío River]], in south-central [[Chile]], and nearby areas of [[Argentina]]. The formation is made up of [[basalt]] and [[pyroclastic rock]]s and marine sedimentary rocks, such as [[sandstone]] and [[mudstone]]. Some less abundant sedimentary lithologies are [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[volcaniclastic|volcaniclastic sedimentary rock]]. The formation is intruded by ''Grupo Plutónico Galletué'' which is of [[Late Jurassic]] to [[Late Cretaceous]] age. Further north in Chile the formation is similar to Nacientes del Teno Formation while in Argentina it is similar to [[Los Molles Formation]] and [[Lotena Formation]].&lt;ref name=SuarezEmparan1997&gt;Suárez, M. and Emparan, C. (1997). Hoja Curacautín, Carta geológica de Chile.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subunits==
Suárez and Emparan have identified three interdigitating members of the formation the older one being Miembro Icalma, the youngest one being Miembro Lonquimay and Miembro Lolén-Pacunto being in-between.&lt;ref name=SuarezEmparan1997/&gt; The ages of the formation as well of that of the members have been established through fossil [[ammonite]] findings.&lt;ref name=delacruzsuarez1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=De la Cruz |first=Rita |last2=Suárez |first2=Manuel |date=1997 |title=El Jurásico de la cuenca de Neuquén en Lonquimay, Chile: Formación Nacientes del Biobío (38-39°8) |url= |journal=[[Andean Geology|Revista geológica de Chile]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=3–24 |doi= |access-date=|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miembro Icalma contains [[basalt]]ic [[pillow lava]] and other features indicative of deep marine eruptions. Volcanic rocks, including basalt, belong to the [[Tholeiitic magma series|tholeiitic]] and [[calc-alkaline magma series|calc-alkaline]] series showing [[geochemistry|geochemical]] affinities with [[island arc]] [[magma]]s.&lt;ref name=SuarezEmparan1997/&gt;  Miembro Icalma do also contains marine fossils of ''[[Harpoceratinae]]'' and ''[[Atacamiceras]]'' in its sedimentary strata that indicate a [[Pliensbachian]] to [[Toarcian|Mid-Toarcian]] age for the sub-unit.&lt;ref name=SuarezEmparan1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=delacruzsuarez1997/&gt;

Miembro Lolén-Pacunto is made up chiefly of mudstone and sandstone. Miembro Lonquimay stands out for containing limestone and [[paleochannel]]s filled with sandstone.&lt;ref name=SuarezEmparan1997/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The formation is interpreted as indicative of a [[Jurassic]] [[marine regression]] showing a successive shallowing of deep marine environments (pillow lavas, [[turbidite]]s) to shallow marine environments (limestone) and culminating with an upper region displaying a continental environment (paleochannels).  Tectonically the formation is assumed to have deposited either in the westernmost fringes of [[Neuquén Basin]] or in an [[intra-arc basin]]. In both cases the formation must have been deposited very close to a [[volcanic arc]] active in the Jurassic.&lt;ref name=SuarezEmparan1997/&gt;

In [[power engineering]], '''nodal admittance matrix''' (or just '''admittance matrix''') or '''Y Matrix''' or '''Ybus''' is an ''N x N'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] describing a power system with ''N'' [[Bus (power engineering)|buses]].  It represents the nodal [[admittance]] of the buses in a power system.  In realistic systems which contain thousands of buses, the Y matrix is quite sparse. Each bus in a real power system is usually connected to only a few other buses through the [[electric power transmission|transmission line]]s.  The Y Matrix is also one of the data requirements needed to formulate a [[power flow study]].

== Context ==
[[Power engineering|Electric power transmission]] needs optimization in order to determine the necessary real and reactive power flows in a system for a given set of loads, as well as the voltages and currents in the system. Power flow studies are used not only to analyze current power flow situations, but also to plan ahead for anticipated disturbances to the system, such as the loss of a transmission line to maintenance and repairs. The power flow study would determine whether or not the system could continue functioning properly without the transmission line. Only [[computer simulation]] allows the complex handling required in power flow analysis because in most realistic situations the system is very complex and extensive and would be impractical to solve by hand. The Y Matrix is a tool in that domain. It provides a method of systematically reducing a complex system to a matrix than can be solved by a computer program.  The equations used to construct the Y matrix come from the application of Kirchhoff’s current law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law to a circuit with steady-state sinusoidal operation. These laws give us that the sum of currents entering a node in the circuit is zero, and the sum of voltages around a closed loop starting and ending at a node is also zero. These principles are applied to all the nodes in a power flow system and thereby determine the elements of the admittance matrix, which represents the admittance relationships between nodes, which then determine the voltages, currents and power flows in the system.


== Construction ==

Starting from the [[One-line diagram|single line diagram]] of a power system, there are three main steps before writing the equations that form the &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; Matrix.  First, the single line diagram is converted to an impedance diagram. Next, all voltage sources are converted to their equivalent current source representations. From here, the impedance diagram is then converted to an admittance diagram. Following these three steps, the admittance matrix can be created in a straightforward manner: For an admittance diagram with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; buses, the admittance between the bus in consideration, ''k'', and another bus, ''i'', connected to ''k'', can be described by &lt;math&gt;y_{ik} = g_{ik} + j b_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;. The term &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; should be introduced here; this term accounts for the admittance of linear loads connected to bus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; as well as the admittance-to-ground at bus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The general mathematical expression follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y_{ij} = \begin{cases}
  y_{i} + \sum_{k=1, 2, \ldots, N \atop k \neq i} {y_{ik}}, &amp; \mbox{if} \quad i = j \\
  -y_{ij},  &amp; \mbox{if} \quad i \neq j
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that &lt;math&gt;y_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero only where a physical connection exists between two buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCalley|first1=James|title=The Power Flow Equations|url=http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~jdm/ee458_2011/PowerFlowEquations.pdf|website=Iowa State Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration is not seen in the following example because each node is connected to both of the other nodes. Each &lt;math&gt;y_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; defines one element of the &lt;math&gt;N\times{N}&lt;/math&gt; matrix. From the general case where N is greater than 2, it is desirable to solve these equations as a system, namely through matrix algebra. The general matrix appears as follows:
The nodal admittance matrix form:
&lt;math&gt;
Y = \begin{bmatrix}
  Y_{11} &amp; Y_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{1n} \\
  Y_{21} &amp; Y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{2n} \\ 
  \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots \\
  Y_{n1} &amp; Y_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:3 bus network.jpg|400px|thumbnail|The admittance diagram of a three bus network.]]

Once the admittance matrix has been formed, the admittance matrix can be input to solve the matrix form of Ohm's Law--the equation &lt;math&gt;Y*V=I&lt;/math&gt;. In this instance &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;N\times{1}&lt;/math&gt; vector of the voltage at each node and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N\times{1}&lt;/math&gt; vector of corresponding currents. In matrix form, Ohm's Law is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  Y_{11} &amp; Y_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{1N} \\
  Y_{21} &amp; Y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{2N} \\
  \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots \\
  Y_{NN} &amp; Y_{N2} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{NN} \\
\end{pmatrix} *

\begin{pmatrix}
 V_1 \\
 V_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 V_N \\
\end{pmatrix} =

\begin{pmatrix}
 I_1 \\
 I_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 I_N \\
\end{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;
To illustrate this process with the admittance matrix of the three bus network in the figure would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = \begin{pmatrix}
  y_{1} + y_{12} + y_{13} &amp; - y_{12} &amp; - y_{13} \\
  -y_{12} &amp; y_{2} + y_{12} + y_{23} &amp; - y_{23} \\
  -y_{13} &amp; - y_{23} &amp; y_{3} + y_{13} + y_{23} \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The Y Matrix diagonal elements &lt;math&gt;Y_{11}, Y_{22}, ..., Y_{nn}&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''self-admittances'' at the nodes, and each equals the sum of all the admittances terminating on the node identified by the repeated subscripts. The other admittances are the ''mutual admittances'' of the nodes, and each equals the negative of the sum of all admittances connected directly between the nodes identified by the double subscripts. The admittance matrix &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is typically a [[symmetric matrix]] as &lt;math&gt;y_{mn} = y_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;.  However, extensions of the line model and models of other components such as transformers may make &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; asymmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Grainger |year=1994 |title=Power System Analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math |isbn=978-0070612938 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-System-Analysis-John-Grainger/dp/0070612935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For small transmission systems of about less than 10 nodes or buses, the Y matrix can be calculated manually. But for a realistic system with relatively large number of nodes or buses, say 1000 nodes, a computer program for computing Y is more practical to use. 

[[File:Node Network.gif|thumb|Node Network Courtesy of scialert.net]]
To help motivate the importance of using a system of equations in matrix form, see the adjacent figure. Not only does it become impractical to calculate the current vector &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; by hand, it becomes necessary to use computational power to form the admittance matrix itself. 


Example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grainger|first1=John|title=Power System Analysis|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math|isbn=978-0070612938|pages=240-241|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two Node Power Flow Diagram.png|thumb|left|Two node power flow diagram courtesy of Grainger and Stevenson]]
To take a look at a generalizable &lt;math&gt;2\times2&lt;/math&gt; matrix, consider the figure of the two-node network. By [[Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_current_law_.28KCL.29|Kirchhoff's Current Law]], it can be shown that :&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} I_m \\ I_n \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \end{pmatrix} * I_a &lt;/math&gt; since there are no other currents entering or exiting nodes &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage drop across the line can be expressed as :&lt;math&gt; V_a = \begin{pmatrix} 1 * -1 \\ \end{pmatrix}*\begin{pmatrix} V_m \\ V_n \\ \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. Next, use [[Ohm's Law]] with admittance instead of impedance. Using substitution to get :&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} Y_a &amp; -Y_a \\ -Y_a &amp; Y_a \end{pmatrix}*\begin{pmatrix} V_m \\ V_n \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} I_m \\ I_n \\ \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. To reintroduce some generality, &lt;math&gt; Y_{11} = Y_{mm}, Y_{21} = Y_{nm},Y_{12} = Y_{mn},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y_{22} = Y_{nn} &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, this example can be taken as a first step in understanding how to generally construct an &lt;math&gt;NxN&lt;/math&gt; matrix by hand.

The '''Pincoya''' is, according to local mythology, a female "water spirit" of the [[Chiloé Island|Chilot]]an Seas. The Pincoya is said to have long blond hair, be of incomparable beauty, be cheerful and sensual, and rise from the depths of the sea.

==Legends==
[[File:ECH 519 53 - Pincoya, La.djvu|left|thumb|Spanish article about the Pincoya from the [[Enciclopedia Chilena]] project, done by the [[Chilean Library of Congress]]]]
Naked and pure, she personifies the fertility of marine species. Through her [[ritual dance]] she provides the ''chilote'' (resident of Chiloé) with an abundance or deficiency of fish and seafood. If she performs her dance facing the sea, it means that these shores will have an abundance of fish.  When she dances facing the mountains, her back to the sea, seafood will be scarce. [[Chiloean mythology]] is appreciative of the Pincoya, believed to be good, beautiful and humanitarian. According to other legends, Pincoya is the daughter of [[Millalobo]] (king of sea, in chilote mythology) and the human [[Huenchula]]. Her sister is the ''[[Sirena chilota]]'' (a type of [[Mermaid]]) and  her brother is ''[[Pincoy]]'' (who also is her husband). The three siblings lead and guide  the drowned sailors onto a large phantom ship, ''the [[Caleuche]]'', sailing the seas at night around the southern island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]] in southern [[Chile]]. The ship appears briefly intact with sounds of a party on board, but quickly vanishes. Myth has it that, once on board, the dead can resume an existence as if they were alive again.

==Media==
* The Pincoya appears various times in [[The Luke Coles Book Series]] by [[Americans|American]] [[author]] [[Josh Walker (author)|Josh Walker]]. She is first mentioned in Josh Walker's 2014 novel, [[Luke Coles and the Flower of Chiloe]]. In [[Luke Coles and the Forest Assassin]] she brings the spirits of shipwreck victims to the Caleuche before returning to the ocean. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.joshwalkerbooks.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
* It is also mentioned (along with this article) in [[Marisha Pessl]]'s Night Film: A Novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pessl|first=Marisha|authorlink=Marisha Pessl|title=Night Film: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDOGofAtJ_YC|date=20 August 2013|publisher=Random House LLC|isbn=978-0-307-36822-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Pincoya is playable character in roguelike platform action-adventure game [[Abyss Odyssey]].

==Scientific name use==
In 2013, the newly discovered [[Pincoya Storm Petrel]] (''Oceanites pincoyae'') was named after Pincoya.

==Biography==
Platt served in WW I as a lieutenant in Battery F, Three Hundred Twenty-Third Field Artillery and, with [[McDonald H. Riggs]], wrote a history of his unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quarterly Journal of the New York State Historical Association|year=1921|pages=108–109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K90TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his bachelor's degree from Yale in 1918.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In the early 1920s he was employed on the editorial staffs of ''[[The World's Work]]'' and of [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Page &amp; Company]]. He then became a corporate officer of Platt-Forbes, Inc., an advertising agency which represented several food and industrial companies, including [[Vought|Chance Vought Aircraft Corporation]]. In the mid‐1950s he became president of Platt Productions Educational Films, specializing in nature films.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

He attended classes at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]] and by 1930 had become keenly interested in nature and, in particular, photography of plant life.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Language of Trees: On a Walk with Rutherford Platt|journal=American Forests|volume=124|issue=1|date=Spring 2018|author=Wojtech, Michael|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-527473078/the-language-of-trees-on-a-walk-with-rutherford-platt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Mr. Platt was botanist with Rear Adm. [[Donald B. MacMillan]]'s Arctic expeditions in 1947 and 1954. He was biology adviser to the Disney True Life Films in the early nineteen‐fifties and was the author of “Walt Disney's Secrets of Life,” published in 1957.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;}}

Journal and remarks. 1832–1836. | place =London | publisher =[[Henry Colburn]] | page=619 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.3&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1 The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[List of meteorological phenomena|weather phenomenon]] in which luminous [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is created by a [[coronal discharge]] from a sharp or pointed object in a strong [[electric field]] in the [[atmosphere]] (such as those generated by [[thunderstorm]]s or created by a [[volcanic eruption]]).

St. Elmo's fire is named after St. [[Erasmus of Formia]] (also called St. Elmo, one of the two Italian names for St. Erasmus, the other being St. Erasmo), the [[patron saint]] of sailors. The phenomenon sometimes appeared on ships at sea during thunderstorms and was regarded by sailors with religious awe for its glowing ball of light, accounting for the name.&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sailors may have considered St. Elmo's fire as a good omen (as a sign of the presence of their patron saint).&lt;ref name="Over the Edge of the World"&gt;Bergreen, Laurence. Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe. New York: Morrow, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

St. Elmo's fire is a bright blue or violet glow, appearing like fire in some circumstances, from tall, sharply pointed structures such as [[lightning rod]]s, [[mast (sailing)|masts]], [[spire]]s and [[chimney]]s, and on [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft wings]] or nose cones. St. Elmo's fire can also appear on leaves and grass, and even at the tips of cattle horns.&lt;ref name="island"&gt;Heidorn, K., Ph.D. ''[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/stelmo.htm Weather Elements: The Fire of St. Elmo]''. Retrieved on July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Often accompanying the glow is a distinct hissing or buzzing sound.  It is sometimes confused with [[ball lightning]].

In 1751, [[Benjamin Franklin]] hypothesized that a [[lightning rod|pointed iron rod]] would light up at the tip during a lightning storm, similar in appearance to St. Elmo's fire.&lt;ref name="GentMag"&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Doren |first=Carl |title=Benjamin Franklin |publisher=The Viking Press |location=New York |date=1938 |page=159}} Quoted text from May 1751 letter published in ''Gentleman's Magazine''. Excerpt at {{cite web |title=Franklin — The Scientist |url=http://www.math.tamu.edu/~stecher/489/Ben/science.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFPapers"&gt;Additional reference may be made from Yale University's collection, {{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/franklinpapers/index.html |title=The Papers of Benjamin Franklin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214030435/http://www.yale.edu/franklinpapers/index.html |archive-date=2006-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==

St. Elmo's fire is a form of plasma. The [[electric field]] around the object in question causes [[ionization]] of the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Conditions that can generate St. Elmo's fire are present during thunderstorms, when high voltage differentials are present between clouds and the ground underneath. A local [[electric field]] of approximately 100 kV/m is required to induce a discharge in air. The magnitude of the electric field depends greatly on the geometry (shape and size) of the object. Sharp points lower the necessary voltage because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high [[curvature]], so discharges preferably occur and are more intense at the ends of pointed objects.

The [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere cause St. Elmo's fire to [[fluoresce]] with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes [[neon sign|neon lights]] to glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What causes the strange glow known as St. Elmo's Fire? Is this phenomenon related to ball lightning?| work = Scientific American | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=quotwhat-causes-the-stran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In ancient Greece, the appearance of a single one was called ''Helene'' ({{lang-el|Ἑλένη}}), literally meaning ''[[torch]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lyd. Ost. 5; the term was also used of a special wicker basket used at the cult of Artemis at Brauron in Attica (Poll. 10.191).&lt;/ref&gt; and two were called [[Kastor and Polydeuces]]&lt;ref&gt;Also known as '''Castor''' and '''Pollux''', ''Homeric Hymn 33'' describes a generic epiphany of these fraternal heroes, collectively called the Dioskouroi, in the midst of a storm at sea. Here they are said to rush through the air "with tawny wings" and to bring relief to terrified mariners.&lt;/ref&gt; (names of the mythological twin brothers of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]). Occasionally, it was associated with the [[Classical element|Greek element]] of [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], as well as with one of [[Paracelsus]]'s elementals, specifically the [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]], or, alternatively, with a similar creature referred to as an acthnici.&lt;ref name=About.com&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516011605/http://altreligion.about.com/library/texts/bl_mphelementals5.htm ''The Elements and Their Inhabitants'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* Welsh mariners knew it as ''canwyll yr ysbryd'' ("spirit-candles") or ''canwyll yr ysbryd glân'' ("candles of the Holy Ghost"), or the "candles of [[St. David]]".&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;{{cite book |title=Folk-lore and folk-stories of Wales |chapter=The Sea, Lakes, Rivers and Wells |chapter-url=http://vwales.co.uk/Folklore/trevelyan/welshfolklore/chapt1.htm |via=V Wales |author=[[Marie Trevelyan]] |date=1909 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929002856/http://vwales.co.uk/Folklore/trevelyan/welshfolklore/chapt1.htm |archive-date=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many Russian sailors have seen them throughout the years. To them, they are "Saint Nicholas" or "Saint Peter's lights".&lt;ref name="Welsh"/&gt; They were also sometimes called [[Helen of Constantinople|St. Helen]]'s or [[St. Hermes]]' fire, perhaps through linguistic confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inamidst.com/lights/wisp/brand1777 Will With A Wisp: John Brand (1777)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* St. Elmo's fire is reported to have been seen during the [[Fall of Constantinople|Siege of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. It reportedly was seen emitting from the top of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] attributed it to a sign that the Christian God would soon come and destroy the conquering Muslim army. According to [[George Sphrantzes]], it disappeared just days before Constantinople fell, ending the Byzantine Empire.
* Accounts of Magellan's first circumnavigation of the globe refer to St. Elmo's fire being seen around the fleet's ships multiple times off the coast of South America. The sailors saw these as favorable omens.
* On 26 August 1883, the British warship ''Charles Ball'' sailing the [[Sunda Strait]] en route to Hong Kong came within 20&amp;nbsp;km of the exploding [[Krakatoa|Krakatau volcano]] and witnessed a great deal of static electricity in the atmosphere, generated by the movement of tiny particles of rocks and droplets of water from the volcano's steam, which caused spectacular brush discharges taking place from the masts and rigging of the ship.
* St Elmo's fire was also seen during the [[1955 Great Plains tornado outbreak]] in Kansas and Oklahoma (US).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=events-19550525-stormelectricity Storm Electricity Aspects of the Blackwell/Udall Storm of May 25, 1955 – Don Burgess, University of Oklahoma (CIMMS)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Among the phenomena experienced on [[British Airways Flight 9]] on 24 June 1982 were glowing light flashes along the leading edges of the aircraft, which were seen by both passengers and crew. While it shared similarities with St Elmo's fire, the glow experienced was from the impact of ash particles on the leading edges of the aircraft, similar to that seen by operators of [[sandblasting]] equipment.
* St. Elmo's fire was observed and its optical spectrum recorded during a University of Alaska research flight over the Amazon in 1995 to study [[sprite (lightning)|sprites]].&lt;ref&gt;Wescott et al. (1996) "The optical spectrum of aircraft St. Elmo's fire", Geophys. Res.

* The ill-fated [[Air France Flight 447]] flight from [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport|Rio de Janeiro–Galeão (GIG)]] to Paris [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in 2009 is understood to have experienced St. Elmo's fire 23 minutes prior to crashing into the Atlantic Ocean. However, the phenomenon was not a factor on the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/crashes/what-really-happened-aboard-air-france-447-6611877 "Air France 447 Flight-Data Recorder transcript – What Really Happened Aboard Air France 447 – Popular Mechanics"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bea.aero/docspa/2009/f-cp090601.en/pdf/f-cp090601.en.pdf "Final Report On the accident on 1st June 2009 to the Airbus A330-203 registered F-GZCP operated by Air France flight AF 447 Rio de Janeiro - Paris."] Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses.

== Notable observations ==
===Julius Caesar===
References to St. Elmo's fire can be found in the works of [[Julius Caesar]] (''[[De Bello Africo]]'', 47), [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', book 2, par. 101), Alcaeus frag. 34, and [[Antonio Pigafetta]]'s journal of his voyage with [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. St. Elmo's fire, also known as "corposants" or "corpusants" from the Portuguese ''corpo santo''&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/p/corposants "Corposants"] ''The American Heritage Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; ("holy body"), was a phenomenon described in ''[[The Lusiads]]''.

===Zheng He===
In 15th-century [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]], Admiral [[Zheng He]] and his associates composed the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions, the two epitaphs of the [[treasure voyages]] where they made a reference to St. Elmo's fire as a divine omen of [[Tianfei]] (天妃), the goddess of sailors and seafarers.&lt;ref name=dr-need&gt;{{cite book | last=Dreyer | first=Edward L. | title=Zheng He: China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405–1433 | year=2007 | publisher=Pearson Longman | location=New York | isbn=978-0-321-08443-9 | authorlink=Edward L.

===Robert Burton===
[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] wrote of St. Elmo's fire in his ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]'': "Radzivilius, the Lithunian duke, calls this apparition Sancti Germani sidus; and saith moreover that he saw the same after in a storm, as he was sailing, 1582, from Alexandria to Rhodes". This refers to the voyage made by [[Mikołaj Krzysztof "the Orphan" Radziwiłł]] in 1582–1584.

===John Davis===
On 9 May 1605, while on the second voyage of [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] commanded by Sir [[Edward Michelborne]] to the East Indies, an unknown writer aboard the ''Tiger'' describes the phenomenon; "In the extremity of our storm appeared to us in the night, upon our maine Top-mast head, a flame about the bigness of a great Candle, which the Portugals call Corpo Sancto, holding it a most divine token that when it appeareth the worst is past. As, thanked be God, we had better weather after it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=Albert|title=Voyages and Works of John Davis|year=1880|publisher=The Hakluyt Society|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact nature of these [[List of meteorological phenomena|weather phenomena]] cannot be certain, they appear to be mostly about two observations of St. Elmo's fire with perhaps some [[ball lightning]] and even a direct [[lightning]] strike to the ship thrown into the mix.

===James Braid===
On 20 February 1817,&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is highly significant that this was during the period of extraordinary atmospheric effects and dramatic reduction in temperatures following an earlier series of massive volcano eruptions that were, ultimately responsible for the [[Year Without a Summer]].&lt;/ref&gt; during a severe electrical storm, [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], surgeon at [[John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun#Children by first marriage|Lord Hopetoun]]'s mines at [[Leadhills]], [[Lanarkshire]], had an extraordinary experience whilst on horseback:

{{quotation|
On Thursday 20th, I was gratified for a few minutes with the luminous appearance described above [viz., "such flashes of lightning from the west, repeated every two or three minutes, sometimes at shorter intervals, as appeared to illumine the whole heavens"]. It was about nine o'clock, P.M. I had no sooner got on horseback than I observed the tips of both the horse's ears to be quite luminous: the edges of my hat had the same appearance. I was soon deprived of these luminaries by a shower of moist snow which immediately began to fall. The horse's ears soon became wet and lost their luminous appearance; but the edges of my hat, being longer of getting wet, continued to give the luminous appearance somewhat longer.&lt;br&gt;I could observe an immense number of minute sparks darting towards the horse's ears and the margin of my hat, which produced a very beautiful appearance, and I was sorry to be so soon deprived of it.&lt;br&gt;The atmosphere in this neighbourhood appeared to be very highly electrified for eight or ten days about this time. Thunder was heard occasionally from 15th to 23d, during which time the weather was very unsteady: frequent showers of hail, snow, rain, &amp;c.&lt;br&gt;I can find no person in this quarter who remembers to have ever seen the luminous appearance mentioned above, before this season,—or such a quantity of lightning darting across the heavens,—nor who have heard so much thunder at that season of the year.&lt;br&gt;This country being all stocked with sheep, and the herds having frequent occasion to pay attention to the state of the weather, it is not to be thought that such an appearance can have been at all frequent, and none of them to have observed it.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Braid also writes that one of his friends had a similar experience on the evening of the preceding Saturday: in which, his friend reported, he had seen " his horse's ears being the same as two burning candles, and the edges of his hat being all in a flame" (p.471).&lt;/ref&gt;|James Braid, 1817&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Braid, J. |title=Account of a Thunder Storm in the Neighbourhood of Leadhills, Lanarkshire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsQCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA471 |magazine=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine |volume=1 |issue=5 |date=August 1817 |pages=471–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Weeks earlier, reportedly on 17 January 1817, a luminous snowstorm occurred in Vermont and New Hampshire. Saint Elmo's fire appeared as static discharges on roof peaks, fence posts, and the hats and fingers of people. Thunderstorms prevailed over central New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myforecast.com/bin/weatherfacts.m |title=San Francisco, CA Weather Facts |publisher=Myforecast.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Darwin===
[[Charles Darwin]] noted the effect while aboard the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]''. He wrote of the episode in a letter to [[John Stevens Henslow|J. S. Henslow]] that one night when the ''Beagle'' was anchored in the estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]]:

===Richard Henry Dana===
In ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'', [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] describes seeing a corposant in the [[Horse latitudes]] of the northern Atlantic Ocean. However, he may have been talking about [[ball lightning]]; as mentioned earlier it is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's fire: "There, directly over where we had been standing, upon the main top-gallant mast-head, was a ball of light, which the sailors name a corposant (corpus sancti), and which the mate had called out to us to look at. They were all watching it carefully, for sailors have a notion, that if the corposant rises in the rigging, it is a sign of [[fair weather]], but if it comes lower down, there will be a storm".&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Richard Henry Jr., (1840) ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]''. Chapter 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikola Tesla===
[[Nikola Tesla]] created St. Elmo's Fire in 1899 while testing out a [[Tesla coil]] at his laboratory in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], USA. St. Elmo's fire was seen around the coil and was said to have lit up the wings of butterflies with blue halos as they flew around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nikola |last1=Tesla |first2=David H. |last2=Childress |last-author-amp=yes |date=1993 |title=The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla |location=Stelle, Ill. |publisher=Adventures Unlimited |isbn=0-932-81319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark Heald===
A minute before the [[Hindenburg disaster|crash of the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin's ''LZ 129 Hindenburg'']] on 6 May 1937, Professor Mark Heald (1892-1971) of Princeton saw St. Elmo's Fire flickering along the airship's back. Standing outside the main gate to the Naval Air Station, he watched, together with his wife and son, as the airship approached the mast and dropped her bow lines. A minute thereafter, by Heald's estimation, he first noticed a dim "blue flame" flickering along the backbone girder about one-quarter the length abaft the bow to the tail. There was time for him to remark to his wife, "Oh, heavens, the thing is afire," for her to reply, "Where?" and for him to answer, "Up along the top ridge" – before there was a big burst of flaming hydrogen from a point he estimated to be about one-third the ship's length from the stern.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Douglas. ''LZ-129 Hindenburg''. New York: Arco Publishing Co, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;
(Added by K.G.H. Nicholes: My father is History Professor Mark M. Heald's son, physicist Mark A. Heald. They did indeed witness the Hindenburg tragedy, but my grandfather had no prior experience of St. Elmo's Fire, and no background to support his identification of what he saw as such. My father has protested people's uncritical passing along of his father's assumption on many occasions.)

===William L. Laurence===
St. Elmo's fire was reported by New York Times reporter [[William L. Laurence]] on August 9, 1945 as he was aboard [[Bockscar]] on the way to [[Nagasaki]].
{{quotation|I noticed a strange eerie light coming through the window high above in the Navigator's cabin and as I peered through the dark all around us I saw a startling phenomenon. The whirling giant propellers had somehow become great luminous discs of blue flame. The same luminous blue flame appeared on the plexiglass windows in the nose of the ship, and on the tips of the giant wings it looked as though we were riding the whirlwind through space on a chariot of blue fire. It was, I surmised, a surcharge of static electricity that had accumulated on the tips of the propellers and on the dielectric material in the plastic windows. One's thoughts dwelt anxiously on the precious cargo in the invisible ship ahead of us. Was there any likelihood of danger that this heavy electric tension in the atmosphere all about us may set it off? I express my fears to Captain Bock, who seems nonchalant and imperturbed at the controls. He quickly reassures me: "It is a familiar phenomenon seen often on ships. I have seen it many times on bombing missions. It is known as St. Elmo's Fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eyewitness Account of Atomic Bomb Over Nagasaki |author=William L.

== In literature ==
{{More footnotes|date=June 2013}}
One of the earliest references to the phenomenon appears in [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]]'s Fragment 34a about the Dioscuri, or [[Castor and Pollux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkatz.web.wesleyan.edu/Images2/cciv243.Alcaeus.html|title=Alcaeus|publisher=[[Wesleyan University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referenced in [[Homeric Hymn]] 33 to the Dioscuri who were from Homeric times associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomericHymns3.html#33|title=Homeric Hymns 5&amp;ndash;33|publisher=Theoi Greek Mythology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Homeric Hymn antedates the Alcaeus fragment is unknown.

St. Elmo's Fire is also mentioned in the novel, ''[[Castaways of the Flying Dutchman]]'' by [[Brian Jacques]].

The phenomenon appears to be described first in the ''[[Gesta Herwardi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://boar.org.uk/ariwxo3FNQsupXXIX.htm |title=Gesta Herwardi, Chapter XXIX |access-date=2009-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108134524/http://boar.org.uk/ariwxo3FNQsupXXIX.htm |archive-date=2009-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; written around 1100 and concerning an event of the 1070s. However, one of the earliest direct references to St. Elmo's fire made in fiction can be found in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s epic poem ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516). It is located in the 17th canto (19th in the revised edition of 1532) after a storm has punished the ship of Marfisa, Astolfo, Aquilant, Grifon, and others, for three straight days, and is positively associated with hope:

{{quotation|
But now St. Elmo's fire appeared, which they had so longed for, it settled at the bows of a fore stay, the masts and yards all being gone, and gave them hope of calmer airs.|Ludovico Ariosto, 1516
}}

In [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' (c. 1623), Act I, Scene II, St. Elmo's fire acquires a more negative association, appearing as evidence of the tempest inflicted by Ariel according to the command of Prospero:

{{quotation|
 PROSPERO
:Hast thou, spirit,
:Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

 ARIEL
:To every article.
:I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
:Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
:I flamed amazement: sometime I'd divide,
:And burn in many places; on the topmast,
:The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
:Then meet and join.
| Act I, Scene II
| ''[[The Tempest]]''
}}

The fires are also mentioned as "death fires" in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. 
{{quotation| 
About, about, in reel and rout, The death fires danced at night; The water, like a witch's oils, Burnt green and blue and white.}}

Later in 18th century and 19th century literature associated St. Elmo's fire with bad omen or [[divine judgment]], coinciding with the growing conventions of [[Romanticism]] and the [[Gothic novel]]. For example, in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), during a thunderstorm above the ramparts of the castle:

{{quotation|
"And what is that tapering of light you bear?" said Emily, "see how it darts upwards,—and now it vanishes!"

"This light, lady", said the soldier, "has appeared to-night as you see it, on the point of my lance, ever since I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell".

"This is very strange!" said Emily.

"My fellow-guard", continued the man, "has the same flame on his arms; he says he has sometimes seen it before...he says it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good".

"And what harm can it bode?" rejoined Emily.

"He knows not so much as that, lady".

| ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]''
}}

In [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', Starbuck points out "corpusants" during a thunder storm in the Japanese sea in chapter 119 "The Candles".

St. Elmo's fire makes an appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic, ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', by [[Hergé]]. [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] recognizes the phenomenon on [[Captain Haddock]]'s [[ice-axe]].

In [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', [[Billy Pilgrim]] sees the phenomenon on soldiers' helmets and on rooftops. Vonnegut's ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' also notes the phenomenon affecting Winston Niles Rumfoord's dog, Kazak, the Hound of Space, in conjunction with solar disturbances of the chrono-synclastic infundibulum.

In "On The Banks of Plum Creek" by Laura Ingalls Wilder St. Elmo's fire is seen by the girls and Ma during one of the blizzards. It was described as coming down the stove pipe and rolling across the floor following Ma's knitting needles; it didn't burn the floor (pages 309-310).  The phenomenon as described, however, is more similar to [[ball lightning]].

== In television ==

On the children's television series ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), Episode 4 shows St. Elmo's Fire affecting the ship as it sailed past the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The real-life footage at the end of the episode has snippets of an interview with Japanese sailor Fukunari Imada, whose comments were translated to "Although I've never seen St. Elmo's Fire, I'd certainly like to. It was often considered a bad omen as it played havoc with compasses and equipment". The TV series also referred to St. Elmo's Fire as being a bad omen during the cartoon. The footage was captured as part of his winning solo yacht race in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/html/cd/1981/198107/19810723/19810723006_6.html Japanese wins solo yacht race across Pacific.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the American television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in a 1959 episode titled "Incident of the Blue Fire", [[Droving|cattle drovers]] on a stormy night see St. Elmo's Fire glowing on the horns of their steers, which the men regard as a deadly omen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/rawhide/incident-of-the-blue-fire-135393/ "Incident of the Blue Fire",] ''Rawhide'' (S02E11), originally aired December 11, 1959.

Retrieved April 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  St. Elmo's Fire is also referenced in a 1965 episode of ''[[Bonanza]]'' in which religious pilgrims staying on the Cartwright property believe an experience with St. Elmo's Fire is the work of [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JDTLFGWiBaw "Devil on Her Shoulder",] ''Bonanza'' (S07E06), originally aired October 17, 1965.

== In movies ==
St. Elmo's fire is featured in the movie ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), when Captain Ahab is stopped by it from killing Starbuck.

In the movie ''[[The Last Sunset (film)|The Last Sunset]]'' (1961), Outlaw/Cowhand Brendan 'Bren' O'Malley ([[Kirk Douglas]]) rides in from the herd and leads the recently widowed, and his former flame, Belle Breckenridge ([[Dorothy Malone]]) to an overview of the cattle. As he takes the rifle from her he proclaims, ''"Something out there, you could live five lifetimes, and never see again,"'' the audience is then shown a shot of the cattle with a blue or violet glow coming from their horns. ''"Look. St. Elmo's Fire. Never seen it except on ships,"'' O'Malley says as Belle says, ''"I've never seen it anywhere. What is it?"''  Trying to win her back he says, ''"Well a star fell and smashed and scattered its glow all over the place."''

In [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', the phenomenon is clearly observed in the opening sequence and later in the film as the [[rogue planet]] Melancholia approaches Earth for an [[impact event]].

== In music ==

[[Brian Eno]]'s third studio album ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975) contains a song titled "St. Elmo's Fire" in which guesting [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] (credited with playing "Wimshurst guitar" in the liner notes) improvises a lightning-fast solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a [[Wimshurst machine|Wimshurst high voltage generator]].

Michael Frank's song "St Elmo's Fire" was released on his album "The Art of Tea" in 1976. His song has since been sampled various times by artists like Absolutely Fabolous, &amp; more.

The first song in [[Susumu Hirasawa]]'s album [[Aurora (Susumu Hirasawa album)|Aurora]], "Stone Garden" (石の庭 ''Ishi no Niwa''), contains a line which translates to &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;That day when I melted away into the sky

'''''The Survivalist''''' is the generic title of [[Jerry Ahern]]'s long-lived series of 29 [[pulp novel]]s centering around John Rourke, an ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer turned weapons and survival expert, in the aftermath of a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].  

==Background==

{{Original research|date=October 2009}}

Ahern produced twenty-seven novels in numbered sequence, plus two un-numbered novels which fit between 15/16 and 21/22, selling 3.5 million copies in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/nukepop/85.html The Survivalist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first few books cover Rourke's attempts to find his family, on the way fighting invading [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops as well as typical [[post-apocalyptic]] villains such as [[biker gang]]s, [[mutant]]s and [[cannibal]]s in extended scenes of graphic violence. Later books head more into science fiction with [[cryonics]], [[Doomsday device|doomsday weapons]] and underwater cities.

Starting in 2007, audio versions started to be released by Graphic Audio covering the entire series of novels. The last book released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphicaudio.net/c-38-survivalist.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215062205/http://www.graphicaudio.net/c-38-survivalist.aspx |archivedate=2009-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was long out of print, until the continuation of the series in ''The Inheritors of Earth'' which was released June 2013.  However e-book versions of the entire series are available.

Some of the books were translated into Polish. Also a French publisher (see below) extended the series.{{fact|date=November 2017}}. The Finnish translations were titled as ”Voittaja” (meaning "the Winner") series. However the original ”Survivalist” logo was included as well on the Finnish version covers.

==Major characters==

===John Thomas Rourke===

Doctor, survival and weapons expert, and ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[paramilitary]] operations [[intelligence officer|officer]]. He has keen sight, but is consequently sensitive to bright light and is usually wearing sunglasses, even at night. He is always armed with a pair of [[Detonics]] Combat Master .45 pistols in Alessi shoulder holsters, [[Colt Python]] and [[Colt Lawman]] revolvers, an A.G. Russell Sting 1A boot knife, and a shoulder sling with either a [[CAR-15]] assault rifle or a [[Steyr Mannlicher|Steyr-Mannlicher]] [[SSG 82|SSG]] [[sniper rifle]].

===Sarah Rourke===

Rourke's wife (later wife of Col. Wolfgang Mann) Children's Author and Illustrator before the war. She carries a stock Government [[M1911]].45 while fleeing the Soviets with her children. The weapon becomes rust pitted and badly maintained because of her limited understanding of guns. Later she is gifted a custom .45 with "Trapper Gun" etched on the slide. It was based on a [[Colt Combat Commander]], similar in size to Rourke's Detonics pistols. Sarah also utilizes different [[M16 rifle|M16]]'s throughout the series.

===Michael Rourke===

John and Sarah Rourke's son. Natalia Tiemerovna's lover and husband. Michael Rourke adopts 2 single action [[.44 Magnum|.44 Magnums]] in his 5-year tutorage (along with Annie) by Rourke while the rest of the family cryogenically sleep. Realising they are to slow to load in a combat situation he acquires two [[Beretta 92]]SBF's from Eden stores. Carries them in a double shoulder holster rig like his father. He also receives a Crain Life Support System I knife replica, a gift from an [[Iceland|Icelandic]] knife maker.

===Annie Rourke===

John and Sarah Rourke's daughter. Paul Rubenstein's eventual wife.

===Paul Rubenstein===

John Rourke's sidekick, fellow survivor of the [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] airliner crash on the night of the war. Fond of his looted [[Browning Hi-Power]] 9 mm pistol and vintage WW II "Schmeisser" [[MP-40]] submachine gun. Wields a Gerber Mk II fighting knife later in the series given to him by Rourke.

===Major Natalia Tiemerovna===
Adopted surreptitiously as a niece by General Varakov, after her real parents were killed by the [[KGB]]. After her surrogate parents died in a road accident, Natalia trained as a KGB agent, reaching the rank of major by the beginning of the war. Married to the unpredictable and often exceedingly ruthless Vladimir Karamatzov—the head of the KGB in the U.S.—whom she eventually left after being beaten and otherwise mistreated—she developed a close relationship with Rourke. Tiemerovna's favorite weapons include a suppressed [[Walther arms|Walther]] pistol, an [[M16 rifle|M16]] and a [[Balisong (knife)|Balisong]] knife.

===General Ishmael Varakov===

Natalia's uncle, and leader of the Soviet occupation forces in the U.S., Varakov many times shows himself to be a patriotic, honorable and reasonable Soviet soldier, who at times helps Rourke to stop some of the more extreme plans of the KGB. Varakov  is at his best when he spews withering insults upon one of his country's intelligence assets who has survived to become a person of importance in the remnants of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]]. Varakov tells this spy (controlled by [[blackmail]] due to his [[pedophilia]]) that if the spy makes the slightest error for any reason, Varakov will reveal him to the Americans. On the other hand, if the spy ever harms another child and Varakov learns of it, Varakov warns that he will kill the spy by hand. Eventually, Rourke holds the injured spy at gunpoint and promises him [[morphine]] in exchange for the means to radio Varakov, but rather than doing as he said, Rourke shoots the spy dead for his misdeeds.

===Vladimir Karamatsov===

Nemesis of Rourke, husband of Natalia Tiemerovna, head of the North American branch of the KGB. Rourke shot Karamatsov at General Varakov's request, since it was politically impossible for Varakov himself to take revenge for the mistreatment of Natalia. Karmatsov somehow survived Rourke's attack, but was later killed by Natalia herself.

===Colonel Nehemiah Rozhdestvenskiy===

Head of the KGB after Karamatzov's death. So power-crazed he even shoots down an airliner carrying the surviving members of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Politburo]] to the U.S.

==Plot overview==

&lt;!-- book 1 --&gt;
[[Soviet Army]] troops cross the [[Khyber Pass]] from [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] into [[Pakistan]].  John Rourke is conducting classes in Pakistan and witnesses the invasion.  Rourke then attempts to return home to the United States.

The Soviet leaders launch a nuclear strike against the U.S. and the [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] retaliates in kind. Nearly two hundred million Americans and over a hundred million Soviets are killed in the ensuing [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear exchange]], and tsunamis hit both [[California]] and [[New York City|New York]]. Rourke is on a Boeing 747 bound for [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] when the missiles hit, and the pilots are blinded by the explosions. Rourke manages to crash-land the plane near [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] and teams up with Paul Rubenstein, another survivor of the crash.

With Soviet [[Russian Airborne Troops|airborne forces]] landing on U.S. soil, and almost every other major U.S. politician dead, the U.S. president commits suicide to prevent a forced surrender. Rourke's family become refugees after a gang of looters attack their farm.

&lt;!-- Nightmare Begins goes here --&gt;
&lt;!-- book 3 --&gt;
Searching for a [[NASA]] astronaut who knows about a mysterious "Eden Project", Rourke enters Soviet-occupied [[Athens, Georgia]], and is captured. Varakov has a job for him: Rourke is to kill Karamatzov, who has beaten Natalia on suspicion of adultery with Rourke.
&lt;!-- 4-6 go here --&gt;

&lt;!-- book 7 --&gt;
A [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] officer joins forces with a cult of wild-men to infiltrate a remaining [[Missile launch facility|missile silo]] and use the missiles to destroy [[Chicago]]. While Rourke's family fight with the resistance and the Soviets experiment with cryonic suspension, Rourke and Natalia fight the wild-men to save the city.

&lt;!-- book 8 --&gt;
Rourke finally finds his family in [[Tennessee]], and takes them to his survival retreat. To save themselves from war-induced climate change (specifically, the ionization of the atmosphere due to unexplained side effects of the nuclear exchange), the [[KGB]] loot Eden Project [[cryonics]] research from the [[Johnson Space Center]], while Rourke and Natalia fight through Soviet troops, feral dogs, and cannibals to discuss the coming 'end of the world' with Varakov in Chicago.

&lt;!-- book 9 --&gt;
Rourke and Natalia break into 'The Womb', a Soviet survival habitat in what used to be [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]], to prevent the KGB from destroying the Eden Project shuttles on their return to Earth. The two take cryonics equipment allowing the Rourkes, Paul, and Natalia to survive the impending climatic catastrophe. Almost all life on the Earth's surface is wiped out, with Varakov dying in Chicago. Rozhdestvenskiy, searching for Rourke in Georgia, dies in a climactic shootout with him, even as the world's atmosphere ignites above them.

&lt;!-- book 10 --&gt;
Having planned a five hundred year cryogenic sleep to await the returning Eden Project shuttles, Rourke awakens Annie and Michael early, raising them until their late teens. He then returns himself to cryogenic suspension so they'll be adults by the time that he and the others awaken. Michael explores the post-apocalypse world, finding tribes of cannibals surrounding a pre-war [[fallout shelter]] where the occupants rigorously maintain a limited population, sending excess workers outside to die.

The Eden Project (an international project) returns and lands in Georgia at a makeshift runway created by the Rourkes and they form a colony there. The [[Soviet Union]] has survived in massive underground shelters and continues their conflict with the Rourke family across the globe. [[Nazi Germany]] also survived in an underground shelter in South America but the Nazi regime is overthrown through the efforts of Rourke and his family. The now democratic German colony become staunch allies of Rourke. [[Iceland]]'s inhabitants survived in hollow volcanoes and join the Rourke family in their battles. A particularly dramatic book, Mid-Wake, details how the United States survived in an underwater colony in the Pacific. A Soviet colony nearby also survived and both colonies have continued the war over the last five centuries. The [[China|Chinese]] survived in three underground cities and become involved in battles as well. The books end with an alliance of the freedom-loving states defeating the evil regime states and peace returning to the Earth.

==Weapons and equipment details==
Ahern is very meticulous in his description of the weapons and equipment used by characters in the story, particularly with regard to his hero's preferences. So, for instance, John Thomas Rourke does not carry a .357 Magnum as his backup gun, he carries a Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver customized by Mag-na-port and Metalife, firing Federal Premium jacketed hollowpoint ammunition.

Such detail regarding the brands and specific products endorsed by Rourke extends to all sorts of items that appear in the series. This list is representative, but by no means complete. John Thomas Rourke favors:

*Handguns by [[Detonics]]
*The Colt Python revolver
*The Steyr-Mannlicher SSG sharpshooting rifle
*The Colt [[CAR-15]] assault rifle
*Federal ammunition
*Custom recoil suppression by Mag-na-port
*Firearms refinishing by Metalife Industries
*Alessi leather holsters
*[[Safariland]] speedloaders
*Pachmayr handgun grips
*The "Six Pack" ammunition pack by Milt Sparks
*The Loco Pack backpack by Lowe Alpine Systems

*[[Zippo]] cigarette lighters
*The Sting IA fighting knife by AG Russell
*The Life Support System survival knife by Jack Crain
*Mountain House freeze-dried meals
*A black-faced [[Rolex]] Sub-mariner wristwatch

==French novels==

A French publisher produced at least 51 books based on ''The Survivalist''. The first 7 match the English titles fairly well so could be translations, the rest are different.

Published by Vaugirard.
Text for 31 and 51 (and the rest?) by Frederic Charpier (possibly a pseudonym used by multiple authors). 31 and 51 published in 1990 and 1993 respectively. Www.Chapitre.Com has listed copies for sale in the past.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2015}}

{{Thermoelectric effect|cTopic=Principles}}
The '''thermoelectric effect''' is the direct conversion of [[temperature]] differences to electric [[voltage]] and vice versa via a [[thermocouple]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_spring2007.web.dir/sedona_price/phys_212_webproj_peltier.html&lt;/ref&gt; A thermoelectric device creates voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature [[gradient]] causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.

This effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is determined by the polarity of the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.

The term "thermoelectric effect" encompasses three separately identified effects: the '''Seebeck effect''', '''Peltier effect''', and '''Thomson effect'''. The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the '''Peltier–Seebeck effect''' (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] and [[Baltic German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]]). The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier–Seebeck model and is credited to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].

[[Joule heating]], the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a resistive material, is related, though it is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect. The Peltier–Seebeck and Thomson effects are [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|thermodynamically reversible]],&lt;ref&gt;As the "figure of merit" approaches infinity, the Peltier–Seebeck effect can drive a heat engine or refrigerator at closer and closer to the [[Heat engine#Efficiency|Carnot efficiency]]. {{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.285.5428.703|title=Thermoelectric Cooling and Power Generation|date=1999|last1=Disalvo|first1=F. J.|journal=Science|volume=285|issue=5428|pages=703–6|pmid=10426986}} Any device that works at the Carnot efficiency is thermodynamically reversible, a consequence of [[Thermodynamics|classical thermodynamics]].&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Joule heating is not.

== Seebeck effect ==
[[File:Thermoelectric Generator Diagram.svg|thumb|A thermoelectric circuit composed of materials of different Seebeck coefficients (p-[[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] and n-doped semiconductors), configured as a [[thermoelectric generator]]. If the load resistor at the bottom is replaced with a [[voltmeter]], the circuit then functions as a temperature-sensing [[thermocouple]].]]

The '''Seebeck effect''' is the conversion of [[heat]] directly into [[electricity]] at the junction of different types of wire. Originally discovered in 1794 by Italian scientist [[Alessandro Volta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goupil|first1=Christophe|last2=Ouerdane|first2=Henni|last3=Zabrocki|first3=Knud|last4=Seifert|first4=Wolfgang|last5=Hinsche|first5=Nicki F.|last6=Müller|first6=Eckhard|editor1-last=Goupil|editor1-first=Christophe|title=Continuum Theory and Modeling of Thermoelectric Elements|date=2016|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=9783527413379|pages=2–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQemCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Thermodynamics and thermoelectricity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 1794, Volta found that if a temperature difference existed between the ends of an iron rod, then it could excite spasms of a frog's leg.  His apparatus consisted of two glasses of water.  Dipped in each glass was a wire that was connected to one or the other hind leg of a frog.  An iron rod was bent into a bow and one end was heated in boiling water.  When the ends of the iron bow were dipped into the two glasses, a thermoelectric current passed through the frog's legs and caused them to twitch.  See:

( … I dipped into boiling water one end of such an arc [of iron rod] for about half a minute, then I took it out and without giving it time to cool, resumed the experiment with the two glasses of cool water; and [it was] at this point that the frog in the bath convulsed; and this [happened] even two, three, four times, [upon] repeating the experiment; until, [having] cooled – by such dips [that were] more or less long and repeated, or by a longer exposure to the air – the end of the iron [rod that had been] dipped earlier into the hot water, this arc returned [to being] completely incapable of exciting convulsions of the animal.)  &lt;/ref&gt; it is named after the [[Baltic German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]], who in 1821 independently rediscovered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seebeck|title=Magnetische Polarisation der Metalle und Erze durch Temperatur-Differenz|journal=Abhandlungen der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin|date=1822|pages=265-373|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435055147011;view=1up;seq=311|trans-title=Magnetic polarization of metals and ores by temperature differences|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that a compass needle would be deflected by a closed loop formed by two different metals joined in two places, with a temperature difference between the joints. This was because the electron energy levels in each metal shifted differently and a [[potential difference]] between the junctions created an electrical current and therefore a [[magnetic field]] around the wires. Seebeck did not recognize that there was an electric current involved, so he called the phenomenon "thermomagnetic effect". Danish physicist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] rectified the oversight and coined the term "thermoelectricity".&lt;ref&gt;See:

The Seebeck effect is a classic example of an [[electromotive force]] (emf) and leads to measurable currents or voltages in the same way as any other emf. Electromotive forces modify [[Ohm's law]] by generating currents even in the absence of voltage differences (or vice versa); the local [[current density]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = \sigma (-\nabla V + \mathbf E_\text{emf}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[voltage]],&lt;ref&gt;The voltage in this case does not refer to electric potential but rather the "voltmeter" voltage &lt;math&gt;V = -\mu/e&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi level]].&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. In general, the Seebeck effect is described locally by the creation of an electromotive field

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_\text{emf} = -S \nabla T,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Seebeck coefficient]] (also known as thermopower), a property of the local material, and  &lt;math&gt;\nabla T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient.

The Seebeck coefficients generally vary as function of temperature and depend strongly on the composition of the conductor. For ordinary materials at room temperature, the Seebeck coefficient may range in value from −100&amp;nbsp;μV/K to +1,000&amp;nbsp;μV/K (see [[Seebeck coefficient]] article for more information).

If the system reaches a steady state, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the voltage gradient is given simply by the emf: &lt;math&gt;-V = S \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;. This simple relationship, which does not depend on conductivity, is used in the [[thermocouple]] to measure a temperature difference; an absolute temperature may be found by performing the voltage measurement at a known reference temperature. A metal of unknown composition can be classified by its thermoelectric effect if a metallic probe of known composition is kept at a constant temperature and held in contact with the unknown sample that is locally heated to the probe temperature. It is used commercially to identify metal alloys. Thermocouples in series form a [[thermopile]]. [[Thermoelectric generator]]s are used for creating power from heat differentials.

== Peltier effect ==
[[File:Thermoelectric Cooler Diagram.svg|thumb|The Seebeck circuit configured as a [[Thermoelectric cooling|thermoelectric cooler]]]]

The '''Peltier effect''' is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors and is named after French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]], who discovered it in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peltier|title=Nouvelles expériences sur la caloricité des courants électrique|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1834|volume=56|pages=371–386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA371#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|trans-title=New experiments on the heat effects of electric currents|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a current is made to flow through a junction between two conductors, A and B, heat may be generated or removed at the junction. The Peltier heat generated at the junction per unit time is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = (\Pi_\text{A} - \Pi_\text{B}) I,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; are the Peltier coefficients of conductors A and B, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the electric current (from A to B). The total heat generated is not determined by the Peltier effect alone, as it may also be influenced by Joule heating and thermal-gradient effects (see below).

The Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. Since charge current must be continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; are different. The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the [[Counter-electromotive force|back-emf]] in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed, then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (by the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction. The close relationship between Peltier and Seebeck effects can be seen in the direct connection between their coefficients: &lt;math&gt;\Pi = T S&lt;/math&gt; (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]).

A typical Peltier [[heat pump]] involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric heat pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do [[thermoelectric cooling]] devices found in refrigerators.

== Thomson effect ==
In different materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not constant in temperature, and so a spatial gradient in temperature can result in a gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient, then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur. This '''Thomson effect''' was predicted and subsequently observed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (William Thomson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On a mechanical theory of thermo-electric currents|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1851|volume=3|issue=42|pages=91–98|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/19876#page/111/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It describes the heating or cooling of a current-carrying conductor with a temperature gradient.

If a current density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J&lt;/math&gt; is passed through a homogeneous conductor, the Thomson effect predicts a heat production rate per unit volume

:&lt;math&gt;\dot q = -\mathcal K \mathbf J \cdot \nabla T,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K&lt;/math&gt; is the Thomson coefficient. The Thomson coefficient is related to the Seebeck coefficient as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K = T \tfrac{dS}{dT}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]). This equation, however, neglects Joule heating and ordinary thermal conductivity (see full equations below).

== Full thermoelectric equations ==

{{see also|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}

Often, more than one of the above effects is involved in the operation of a real thermoelectric device. The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; the effects of [[Joule heating]] and ordinary heat conduction are included as well. As stated above, the Seebeck effect generates an electromotive force, leading to the current equation&lt;ref name="fsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/nt_pelt.html |title=A.11 Thermoelectric effects |publisher=Eng.fsu.edu |date=2002-02-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = \sigma (-\boldsymbol \nabla V - S \nabla T).&lt;/math&gt;

To describe the Peltier and Thomson effects the flow of energy must be considered. To start, the dynamic case where both temperature and charge may be varying with time can be considered. The full thermoelectric equation for the energy accumulation, &lt;math&gt;\dot e&lt;/math&gt;, is&lt;ref name="fsu"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot e = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) - \nabla \cdot (V + \Pi) \mathbf J + \dot q_\text{ext},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]]. The first term is the [[Thermal conduction#Fourier's law|Fourier's heat conduction law]], and the second term shows the energy carried by currents. The third term, &lt;math&gt;\dot q_\text{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, is the heat added from an external source (if applicable).

In the case where the material has reached a steady state, the charge and temperature distributions are stable, so one must have both &lt;math&gt;\dot e = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf J = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Using these facts and the second Thomson relation (see below), the heat equation then can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;-\dot q_\text{ext} = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) + \mathbf J \cdot \left(\sigma^{-1} \mathbf J\right) - T \mathbf J \cdot \nabla S.&lt;/math&gt;

The middle term is the Joule heating, and the last term includes both Peltier (&lt;math&gt;\nabla S&lt;/math&gt; at junction) and Thomson (&lt;math&gt;\nabla S&lt;/math&gt; in thermal gradient) effects. Combined with the Seebeck equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J&lt;/math&gt;, this can be used to solve for the steady-state voltage and temperature profiles in a complicated system.

If the material is not in a steady state, a complete description will also need to include dynamic effects such as relating to electrical capacitance, inductance, and heat capacity.

==Thomson relations==

{{see also|Onsager reciprocal relations|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}

In 1854, Lord Kelvin found relationships between the three coefficients, implying that the Thomson, Peltier, and Seebeck effects are different manifestations of one effect (uniquely characterized by the Seebeck coefficient).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On the dynamical theory of heat. Part V. Thermo-electric currents|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1854|volume=21|pages=123–171|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/126375#page/147/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Thomson relation is&lt;ref name="fsu"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal K \equiv \frac{d\Pi}{dT} - S,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K&lt;/math&gt; is the Thomson coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is the Peltier coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the Seebeck coefficient. This relationship is easily shown given that the Thomson effect is a continuous version of the Peltier effect. Using the second relation (described next), the first Thomson relation becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K = T \tfrac{dS}{dT}&lt;/math&gt;.

The second Thomson relation is

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi = TS.&lt;/math&gt;

This relation expresses a subtle and fundamental connection between the Peltier and Seebeck effects. It was not satisfactorily proven until the advent of the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager relations]], and it is worth noting that this second Thomson relation is only guaranteed for a time-reversal symmetric material; if the material is placed in a magnetic field or is itself magnetically ordered ([[ferromagnetic]], [[antiferromagnetic]], etc.), then the second Thomson relation does not take the simple form shown here.&lt;ref&gt;There is a generalized second Thomson relation relating anisotropic Peltier and Seebeck coefficients with reversed magnetic field and magnetic order. See, for example, {{cite book| isbn = 9781420038903| title = Thermoelectrics Handbook: Macro to Nano| editor1-last = Rowe| editor1-first= D. M. | date = 2010 | publisher = [[CRC Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thomson coefficient is unique among the three main thermoelectric coefficients because it is the only one directly measurable for individual materials. The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients can only be easily determined for pairs of materials; hence, it is difficult to find values of absolute Seebeck or Peltier coefficients for an individual material.

If the Thomson coefficient of a material is measured over a wide temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and Seebeck coefficients. This needs to be done only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise Seebeck coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the reference material. For more details on absolute Seebeck coefficient determination, see [[Seebeck coefficient]].

==Applications==
{{see also|Thermoelectric materials}}

===Thermoelectric generators===
{{main|Thermoelectric generator}}

The Seebeck effect is used in thermoelectric generators, which function like [[heat engine]]s, but are less bulky, have no moving parts, and are typically more expensive and less efficient. They have a use in power plants for converting [[waste heat]] into additional electrical power (a form of [[energy recycling]]) and in automobiles as [[automotive thermoelectric generator]]s (ATGs) for increasing [[fuel efficiency]]. Space probes often use [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s with the same mechanism but using radioisotopes to generate the required heat difference.
Recent uses include stove fans,&lt;ref&gt;"https://stovefanreviews.com/teg-module-and-seebeck-effect/"&lt;/ref&gt; body-heat—powered lighting&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.gizmag.com/lumen-flashlight/39893/&lt;/ref&gt; and a smartwatch powered by body heat.&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602874/body-heat-powers-this-smart-watch"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peltier effect ===
{{Main|Thermoelectric cooling}}
The Peltier effect can be used to create a [[refrigerator]] that is compact and has no circulating fluid or moving parts. Such refrigerators are useful in applications where their advantages outweigh the disadvantage of their very low efficiency. The Peltier effect is also used by many [[thermal cyclers]], laboratory devices used to amplify DNA by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). PCR requires the cyclic heating and cooling of samples to specified temperatures. The inclusion of many thermocouples in a small space enables many samples to be amplified in parallel.

===Temperature measurement===
{{Main|Thermocouple}}
[[Thermocouple]]s and [[thermopile]]s are devices that use the Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two objects.
Thermocouples are often used to measure high temperatures, holding the temperature of one junction constant or measuring it independently ([[thermocouple|cold junction compensation]]). Thermopiles use many thermocouples electrically connected in series, for sensitive measurements of very small temperature difference.

Right now, people are conserving the [[Tropical]] Rain Forests in many ways, including ecotourism and rehabilitation. Rebuilding and restarting forests in certain areas is becoming a common practice to try to increase the rain forest density. By communicating with the local people living in, and around, the rainforest, conservationists can learn more about what might allow them to best focus their conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Rain forests globally are important to the sustainability and preservation of biodiversity. Although they may vary in location and inhabited species of plants and animals, they remain important worldwide to the production of resources and land use.  It is important to take into consideration the differing species and the biodiversity that exists across different rainforest types in order to accurately implement methods of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Shapcott, A., Yining, L., Howard, M., Forster, P.

''International Journal Of Plant Sciences'', ''178''(3), 211-229. doi:10.1086/690022&lt;/ref&gt;×

== Ecotourism ==
Ecotourism is conducting tours of a specific area in efforts to teach the public about often threatened environments. It is a practice that represents one imperative solution to saving endangered habitat. Tourists and tour guides alike often make generous donations to conservation efforts in the regions they visit, greatly helping the preservation of the Amazon rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, E. (1991). ECOTOURISM: New Hope for Rainforests?. ''American Forests'', ''97''(3/4), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Experts are continuously and commonly discussing with conservationists, policy‐makers, and local politicians and leaders about ecotourism and its impacts on surrounding ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;STRONZA, A. (2005), HOSTS AND HOSTS: THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF COMMUNITY‐BASED ECOTOURISM IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON. NAPA Bulletin, 23: 170-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecotourism can contribute to the conservation and sustainability of biodiversity in rain forests.

== Amazon Rain Forest ==
One of the world's largest and most dense rain forests is the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] rain forest in South America. Rain forests are disappearing across the world, at an alarming rate in Brazil's Amazonian rain forest. Since the 1980s, more than 153,000 square miles of Amazonian rain forest has fallen victim to deforestation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tollefson, J. (2013). A Light in the Forest. ''Foreign Affairs'', ''92''(2), 141-151.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil has helped feed the growing global demand for food supply of soybeans and beef with the newly cleared land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Amazon easily makes up one of the world’s biggest and most biodiverse ecological reserves, once lush, think, highly diverse basin, that has now been cleared in many areas for soy fields and cattle ranches. Recently, Brazil has worked to immensely slow the destruction of its rain forests, reducing the rate of deforestation by over 80%.

Experts have effectively slowed the deforestation with several methods, by implementing regulations of stricter land use and creating areas in the Amazon that are protected by authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Greenhouse gas emissions, which are largely due to the alarming rates of rainforest destruction, are one of the largest contributors to climate change in the Amazon region. The national government of Brazil aids better social and economic planning of specific areas with significant similarities with national policies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ferreira, H. S., Serraglio, D.

Environmental Policy &amp; Law, 419-424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 alone, Brazil acknowledged an issue and accepted the challenge presented to reduce its carbon emissions by 36–38 percent by 2020 in efforts to in turn reduce the amounts of gases being emitted into the air.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Carbon Credits ==
Another way conservation has become the most economically beneficial option is through [[carbon credits]]. Under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries must reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide by 5% below the 1990 levels before 2012.  Countries can meet their mandatory cuts in emissions by offsetting some of those emissions some other way. Through conservation or reforestation of the rainforest, countries can receive credits.

Some worldwide companies have stated publicly that they refuse to purchase products that originate from recently cleared areas of the rainforest. Beef commonly comes from farms that are located on land previously inhabited by rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=12B30BD943E41418&amp;p_docnum=3&amp;p_queryname=4; Provided by: Financial Times Information Limited; Index Terms: Agricultural Issues; Company News; Conservation; Environment; General News; Marketing; Greenpeace; Location(s): Brazil; Americas; Latin America; South America; Record Number: 74364647 Copyright 2009 Guardian Newspapers Ltd, Source: The Financial Times Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to conserve the [[rainforest]] because many resources for things we use everyday come from the rainforest, including rubber for tires and spices such as cinnamon and many other common items.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eduplace.com/kids/sla/5/rainforest.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative to life on earth that the rainforest be conserved, as the trees take in carbon dioxide to provide oxygen. About a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from [[deforestation]] and destruction of rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=12B1150EB5B75BA8&amp;p_docnum=5p_queryname=5; Section: NEWS; Record Number: 1791858 Copyright: Euclid Infotech Pvt.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Rajarani Temple 03.jpg|thumb|Varuna iconography at the 11th-century Rajarani [[Hindu temple]].&lt;ref name="Michell1977p45"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Michell|title= The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to Its Meaning and Forms |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ajgImLs62gwC |year= 1977|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0-226-53230-1|pages= 4, 44–45 with Figure 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The theonym ''Varuṇa'' is a derivation from the verbal   ''vṛ'' ("to surround, to cover" or "to restrain, bind") by means of a suffigal ''-uṇa-'', for an interpretation of the name as  "he who covers or binds", in reference to the cosmological [[Oceanus|ocean or river]] encircling the world, but also in reference to the "binding" by universal law or ''[[Ṛta]]'' .&lt;ref name="Snodgrass1992p121"/&gt;

[[Georges Dumézil]] (1934) made a cautious case for the identity of Varuna and the Greek god ''[[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]]'' at the earliest [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] cultural level.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, ''Ouranós-Váruna: Étude de mythologie comparée indo-européenne'' (Paris:Maisonneuve 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Dumézil&gt;Georges Dumézil, ''Ouranos-Varuna - Essai de mythologie comparée indo-européenne'' (Paris: G.-P. Maisonneuve, 1934).&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymological identification of the name ''Ouranos'' with the Sanskrit ''Varuṇa'' is based in the derivation of both names from the   [[PIE root]] ''*ŭer'' with a sense of "binding" — the Indic king-god ''Varuṇa'' binds the wicked, the Greek king-god ''Ouranos'' binds the Cyclopes. While the derivation of the name ''Varuṇa'' from this root is undisputed, this derivation of the Greek name is now widely rejected in favour of derivation from the root  *''wers-'' "to moisten, drip" (Sanskrit vṛṣ "to rain, pour").&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Mayrhofer]], ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen'', vol. 2, s.v. “Váruṇa” (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1996), 515–6.

== Texts ==
=== Vedas ===
In the earliest layer of the ''Rigveda'', Varuna is the guardian of moral law, one who punishes those who sin without remorse, and who forgives those who err with remorse.&lt;ref name=dhavamony167&gt;{{cite book|author=Mariasusai Dhavamony|title=Classical Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DD0w_IMFA8gC |year=1982|publisher=Gregorian |isbn=978-88-7652-482-0|pages=167–168 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffiths1991p132"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Gwyn Griffiths|title=The Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDbjjKglE1kC&amp;pg=PA132 |year= 1991|publisher= BRILL|isbn= 90-04-09231-5|pages= 132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned in many Rigvedic hymns, such as 7.86–88, 1.25, 2.27–30, 8.8, 9.73 and others.&lt;ref name=dhavamony167/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snodgrass1992p121"/&gt; His relationship with waters, rivers and oceans is mentioned in the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Oldenberg1988p104"&gt;{{cite book|author= Hermann Oldenberg|title=The Religion of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKeubCiBOPQC |year=1988|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn =978-81-208-0392-3|page= 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedic poets describe him as an aspect and one of the plural perspectives of the same divine or spiritual principle.&lt;ref name=oldenberg51/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C |year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0264-3|pages=91–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, hymn 5.3 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' states:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
You at your birth are Varuna, O [[Agni]].
When you are kindled, you are [[Mitra]].
In you, O son of strength, all gods are centered.
You are [[Indra]] to the mortal who brings oblation.
You are [[Aryaman]], when you are regarded as having
 the mysterious names of maidens, O Self-sustainer.

According to [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]], a professor of Indology focusing on religion, Varuna-Mitra pair is an ambiguous deity just like [[Rudra]]-[[Shiva]] pair.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan1997p48"/&gt; Both have wrathful-gracious aspects in Indian mythology.&lt;ref name="Macey2010p2"/&gt; Both Varuna and Rudra are synonymous with "all comprehensive sight, knowledge", both were the guardian deity of the north in the Vedic texts (Varuna later gets associated with west), both can be offered "injured, ill offerings", all of which suggest that Varuna may have been conceptually overlapping with Rudra.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan1997p48"/&gt; Further, the Rigvedic hymn 5.70 calls Mitra-Varuna pair as ''rudra'', states Srinivasan.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan1997p48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|title=Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC&amp;pg=PA48|year =1997|publisher= BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10758-4|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Samuel Macey and other scholars, Varuna had been the more ancient Indo-Aryan deity in 2nd millennium BCE, who gave way to Rudra in the Hindu pantheon, and Rudra-Shiva became both "timeless and the god of time".&lt;ref name="Macey2010p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel L.

In ''Vajasaneyi Samhita'' 21.40 (''[[Yajurveda]]''), Varuna is called the patron deity of physicians, one who has "a hundred, a thousand remedies".&lt;ref name="Srinivasan1997p48"/&gt; His capacity and association with "all comprehensive knowledge" is also found in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' (~1000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Srinivasan | first=Doris | title=The Religious Significance of Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda | journal=Numen | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=25 | issue=3 | year=1978 | doi=10.1163/156852778x00245 | pages=198–200, context: 193–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varuna also finds a mention in the early [[Upanishad]]s, where his role evolves. In verse 3.9.26 of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' (~800 BCE), for example, he is stated to be the god of the western quarter, but one who is founded on "water" and dependent ultimately on "the heart" and the fire of soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Upanishads: Annotated Text and Translation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lsp18ZvstrcC |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535242-9|pages=98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Katha Upanishad]]'', Aditi is identified to be same as the goddess earth.

In [[Yajurveda]] it is said: "In fact Varuna is [[Vishnu]] and Vishnu is Varuna and hence the auspicious offering is to be made to these deities." ||8.59|| &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=1h-Go8i3iPcC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq="varuna+is+vishnu"&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-58Qq7_05w&amp;sig=Xi-LTn0gAHuDxD2zxHkNSs3cKxo&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqxJyjlsvYAhWG2CwKHRujDYAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22varuna%20is%20vishnu%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ramayana ===
[[File:Rama-Varuna.jpg|thumb|Varuna himself arose from the depth of the ocean and begged Rama for forgiveness.]]
Rama interacts with Varuna in the Hindu epic ''Ramayana''. For example, faced with the dilemma of how to cross the ocean to [[Lanka]], where his abducted wife [[Sita]] is held captive by the demon king [[Ravana]], [[Rama]] (an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]) performs a ''pravpavesha'' (prayer, [[tapasya]]) to Varuna, the Lord of Oceans, for three days and three nights, states Ramesh Menon.&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376"/&gt; Varuna does not respond, and Rama arises on the fourth morning, enraged. He states to his brother Lakshamana that "even lords of the elements listen only to violence, Varuna does not respect gentleness, and peaceful prayers go unheard".&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramesh Menon|title=The Ramayana: A Modern Retelling of the Great Indian Epic |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kEEXjAagUzsC |year=2004|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4668-2625-0|pages=376–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his bow and arrow, Rama prepares to attack the oceans to burn up the waters and create a bed of sand for his army of monkeys to cross and thus confront Ravana. Lakshmana appeals to Rama, translates Menon, that he should return to "peaceful paths of our fathers, you can win this war without laying waste the sea".&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376"/&gt; Rama shoots his weapon sending the ocean into flames. As Rama increases the ferocity of his weapons, Varuna arises out of the oceans. He bows to Rama, stating that he himself did not know how to help Rama because the sea is deep, vast and he cannot change the nature of sea. Varuna asked Rama to remember that he is "the soul of peace and love, wrath does not suit him". Varuna promised to Rama that he will not disturb him or his army as they build a bridge and cross over to Lanka.&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376"/&gt;

=== In Tolkappiyam ===
The [[Tolkāppiyam]], a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar work from 3rd century BCE divides the people of ancient [[Tamilakam]] into 5 [[Sangam landscape]] divisions: ''kurinji, mullai, paalai, marutham'' and ''neithal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=8uP7LHS3cDMC&amp;pg=PT124&amp;dq=sangam+landscape&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA7PnD8bnXAhVsG5oKHfLeDsEQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=sangam%20landscape&amp;f=false|title=Tamil Oratory and the Dravidian Aesthetic: Democratic Practice in South India|last=Bate|first=Bernard|date=2010-06-01|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9780231519403|location=|pages=100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each landscape are designated with different gods.

== East Asian Buddhism ==
[[File:Tokyo Suitengu 201604a.jpg|thumb|[[Suitengū (Tokyo)]] is a [[Shinto shrine]] to Varuna.]]
In [[East Asian Buddhism]], Varuna is one of the twelve deities (''[[:ja:十二天|Jūniten]]'' 十二天), guardian deities who are found in Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en Twelve Heavenly Deities (Devas)] Nara National Museum, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; Varuna was called ''Shuitian'' in Chinese or ''Suiten'' in Japanese (水天, lit. "Watery Sky").&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Snodgrass (2007), The Symbolism of the Stupa, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807815}}, pages 120-124, 298-300&lt;/ref&gt; Varuna joins the other eleven deities: Indra (Jap. ''Taishakuten''), Agni (''Katen''), Yama (''Emmaten''), Nirrti (''Rasetsuten''), Vayu (''Futen''), Ishana (''Ishanaten''), Kubera (''Tamonten''), Brahma (''Bonten''), Prithvi (''Chiten''), Surya (''Nitten''), Chandra (''Gatten'').&lt;ref&gt;Willem Frederik Stutterheim et al (1995), Rāma-legends and Rāma-reliefs in Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-8170172512}}, pages xiv-xvi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Biswas (2000), Art of Japan, Northern, {{ISBN|978-8172112691}}, page 184&lt;/ref&gt; From Buddhism, Suiten was also incorporated into the Shinto religion of Japan.

== Shinto ==
Varuna is also worshipped in Japan's [[Shinto]] religion. One of the Shinto shrines dedicated to him is the [[Suitengū (Tokyo)|''Suitengū'']] ("Palace of Suiten") in [[Tokyo]]. After the Japanese emperor issued the ''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]'', the separation of Shinto and Buddhist practices as part of the [[Meiji Restoration]], Varuna/Suiten was identified with the Japanese supreme God, [[Amenominakanushi]].&lt;ref&gt;"Tokyo Suitengu monogatari" 1985 Kodansha, {{ISBN|406202117X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White squall.jpg|thumb|A white squall on 25 October 2009 in the [[Strait of Magellan]]]]

A '''white squall''' is a sudden and violent [[windstorm]] at sea which is not accompanied by the black [[cloud]]s generally characteristic of a [[squall]]. It manifests as a sudden increase in wind velocity in tropical and sub-tropical waters, and may be a [[microburst]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[USA Today]]'': [https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/waoceans.htm "Answers: Oceans, waves, tides."] Retrieved March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to the white-capped [[wave]]s and broken water, its meager warning to any unlucky [[seaman]] caught in its path.  A white squall was allegedly behind the sinking of the brigantine ''[[Albatross (1920 schooner)|Albatross]]'' on May 2, 1961.{{Fact|date=October 2018}} White squalls are rare at sea, but common on the [[Great Lakes]] of [[North America]].

==Historical incidents==
White squalls are the culprits of many [[nautical fiction|sea stories]] and have been blamed for several tragedies. 

*A white squall was the reported cause of the loss of the schooner ''Paul Pry'' off [[Cape Schanck]], [[Australia]], on the 3rd September, 1841.&lt;ref&gt;https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8752033&lt;/ref&gt;
*A white squall is also believed to have sunk the schooner ''Hunter Savidge'' on [[Lake Huron]] in 1899.{{Fact|date=October 2018}}
*A white squall was responsible for the sinking of the German training vessel ''[[Niobe (schooner)|Niobe]]'' on 26 July, 1932.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
*A white squall was allegedly behind the sinking of the brigantine ''[[Albatross (1920 schooner)|Albatross]]'' on May 2, 1961.{{Fact|date=October 2018}}
*The ''[[Pride of Baltimore]]'', a modern {{convert|137|ft|m|sing=on}} [[schooner]], was reportedly struck by a white squall on May 14, 1986. The 121-ton vessel sank about {{convert|240|mi|km}} north of [[Puerto Rico]], casting the surviving crew members adrift for five days. The ''Toro'', a Norwegian freighter, picked them up at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. May 19, 1986. An eyewitness account described it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A tremendous whistling sound suddenly roared through the rigging and a wall of wind hit us in the back. The ''Pride'' heeled over in a matter of seconds. The {{convert|70|kn|km/h|sing=on}} wind pushed a {{convert|20|ft|m|sing=on}} high wall of water into the starboard side. She sank in minutes."[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/waoceans.htm]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[Stan Rogers]]' 1984 song "[[White Squall (song)|White Squall]]" is about the white squalls of the Great Lakes.
*[[Ridley Scott]]'s film ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'' tells the story of the 1961 sinking of the ''[[Albatross (1920 schooner)|Albatross]]''.
