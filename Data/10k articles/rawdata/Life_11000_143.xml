      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1154">'''Ælfwald''' was a [[List of monarchs of Sussex|King of Sussex]], who reigned jointly with [[Ealdwulf of Sussex|Ealdwulf]] and [[Oslac of Sussex|Oslac]], and probably also with [[Oswald of Sussex|Oswald]] and [[Osmund of Sussex|Osmund]].

Ælfwald witnessed an undated charter of Ealdwulf, believed to be from about 765, with his name corruptly recorded as ''Ælhuuald rex''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ælfwald also witnessed a charter of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], King of Mercia, dated 772, as ''Ælbuuald dux'',&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty 36.&lt;/ref&gt; with his name placed after Oswald, Osmund, but before Oslac. 

He is not known to have issued charters of his own.

'''Alvar Larsson''' was a Swedish boy who disappeared in 1967.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://29juli1965.blogspot.com/2016/05/alvar-larsson-forsvann-1967-vad-hande.html|title=Alvar Larsson disappeared in 1967 - what happened?

He left his house on a Sunday morning to take a walk and bring in some wood, leaving no traces behind. In 1982, more than fifteen years after the disappearance, his cranium was found on a small island 6&amp;nbsp;km away. The disappearance attracted a lot of media coverage at the time and many theories as to what happened have been put forward. [[Sture Bergwall|Thomas Quick]] has confessed to the crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=7fLwzSXho2QC&amp;pg=PT124&amp;lpg=PT124|title=Thomas Quick: The Making of a Serial Killer|last=Råstam|first=Hannes|date=2013-07-04|publisher=Canongate Books|isbn=9781782110712|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has recanted all his confessions.

== Disappearance and search ==
On the morning of April 16, 1967, Alvar was woken up at half past seven by his mother. He ate a bun, drank a glass of fruit juice and dressed in his everyday clothes. Before breakfast and a visit to the church later that morning, Alvar wanted to go for a walk. His mother let him go and told him to bring in wood as he returned. No-one has reported that they've seen him since.

By the time it was too late for Alvar to eat breakfast, get dressed and leave for church, his mother phoned the nearest neighbours asking about Alvar, but no-one had seen him. Alvar's father phoned the nearest neighbour and the two men searched the farm for the boy. Later, all the neighbours were asked to join the search. A constable named Emanuelsson was asked to start a search for Alvar as he was only five kilometers away at the time. The initial search party consisted of the family, neighbours, two police officers, a privately owned [[German Shepherd]] and the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard]]. The search went on into the night without result.

In the early morning, Harald contacted the police and informed them that Alvar had not returned, and yet another search soon started. In the afternoon, fifty servicemen from the army infantry regiment [[Kronobergs regemente|I 11]] in [[Växjö]] joined. During the following week, more people arrived to aid the search, and the lake was searched by the use of boats. A police helicopter was also flown in from [[Stockholm]] at Tuesday. At most, 150 persons were in the search party at the same time.

== Theories ==

=== Runaway ===
Initially the main theory was that thirteen-year-old Alvar had [[Runaway (dependent)|run from home]]. However, it is hard to explain why Alvar would not have dressed up more with heavier shoes, eaten breakfast, brought his money and/or used his bicycle if he had planned to leave.

A boy of Alvar's age had been seen north of [[Kalmar]], in [[Påskallavik]], but he could later be identified. This was also the case for a boy who had gotten a ride by a truck driver, a boy that had been seen spending the Sunday night at the postal station in [[Rottne]], and other boys that had been spotted hitch-hiking in the area.

=== Accident ===
That Alvar would have been alive during the week-long search and later died is dismissed by most sources. If he had died in an accident, it would most likely have happened early Sunday, and the location of his death would have been the lake. It is just short of a kilometre from Sundslätt to the lake, and Alvar is speculated to have suddenly decided to row by boat. During the searches and investigations, all the boats in the lake were checked, but one is said to have been forgotten by its owner due to its bad state. That Alvar could not swim suggests he would not have entered a boat, but if he had, his lack of ability to swim could have become fatal.

It is said that the fact that Alvar's [[Träskor|clogs]] have not surfaced at the waterside, as opposed to many other clogs, suggests that he did not drown in the lake.

=== Crime ===
The first theories involving a crime were suggested on the Monday, and these ideas seemed more plausible as time passed. The police received several tips about persons who had acted suspiciously, all of which could be rejected. The theory was that Alvar would have gone to the cellar to smoke and that someone would have passed and convinced him to follow them.

== Grave-opening ==
In 1978, more than ten years after the disappearance, a grave was opened. A woman had told the police of how a relative of hers had told her of how he'd killed a boy in Småland in 1967 and how he'd hidden the body near the deserted summer house for two years. The man would then have moved the body to the bottom of a grave, prepared for a relative of his, where he'd covered it with spruce twigs. Although he had been celebrating the 50th anniversary of his wedding on the day Alvar disappeared and had been working the night before, the grave was opened. In front of a large press gathering, the coffin was lifted out and nothing was found under it.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Finding of the skull ==
In November 1982, three hunters had rowed to Harö, a small island, to train their dogs. In a bay they had found a human skull.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Realizing that the teeth had fillings and thus could not be an archeological finding, the men contacted the police. The police immediately assumed that the skull belonged to Alvar and using his dental record, this theory could be confirmed. The island was searched in detail but the only other findings were two rowing boats. The owners soon reported to the police and it could be excluded that Alvar would have used any of the boats to get to the island.

Although there was a big hole in the back of the skull, experts could not determine whether it had received a fatal blow or whether the damage had been caused by the weather in the years that had passed since the boy's death.

The skull of Alvar has been buried alongside of the boy's father and any crime involved with the disappearance has been barred under the [[statute of limitations]].

[[File:Gold Star Service Banner.svg|thumb|right|A [[Service flag]] with one gold star]]
'''American Gold Star Mothers, Inc.''' (AGSM), is a private&lt;ref name=Criteria/&gt; [[nonprofit organization]]&lt;ref name=Donate/&gt; of American mothers who lost sons or daughters in service of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. It was originally formed in 1928 for mothers of those lost in [[World War I]], and it holds a [[congressional charter]] under [[Title 36 of the United States Code|Title 36 § 211 of the United States Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2014-title36/html/USCODE-2014-title36.htm |title=Title 36 – Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]] |accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name came from the custom of families of servicemen hanging a banner called a [[service flag]] in the windows of their homes.  The service flag had a star for each family member in the Armed Forces.  Living servicemen were represented by a blue star, and those who had lost their lives in combat were represented by a gold star.  

Membership in the organization is open to any woman who is a U.S. citizen or legal resident that has lost a son or daughter in active service in the U.S. military (regardless of the place or time of the military service, regardless of whether the circumstances of death involved hostile conflict or not, and including mothers of those [[missing in action]]).

==Founding==
The Gold Star Mothers was founded by Grace Darling Seibold of [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.goldstarmoms.com/About/History.htm |website=American Gold Star Mothers official website |accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States entered World War I in 1917, George Vaughn Seibold, 23, volunteered, requesting assignment in aviation. He was sent to Canada where he learned to fly British planes since the United States had neither an air force nor planes. Deployed to England, he was assigned to the British Royal Flying Corps with [[148th Aero Squadron]]. With his squadron, he left for combat duty in France. He corresponded with his family regularly. His mother, Grace Darling Seibold, began to do community service by visiting returning servicemen in the hospitals.

The mail from George stopped. Since all aviators were under British control and authority, the United States could not help the Seibold family with any information about their son.

Grace continued to visit hospitalized veterans in the Washington area, clinging to the hope that her son might have been injured and returned to the United States without any identification. While working through her sorrow, she helped ease the pain of the many servicemen who returned so war-damaged that they were incapable of ever reaching normalcy.

But on October 11, 1918, George's wife in Chicago received a box marked "Effects of deceased Officer 1st Lt. George Vaughn Seibold". The Seibolds also received a confirmation of George's death on November 4 through a family member in Paris. George's body was never identified.

Grace, convinced that self-contained grief is self-destructive, devoted her time and efforts not only to working in the hospital but also to supporting other mothers whose sons had lost their lives in military service. She organized a group consisting solely of these mothers, with the purpose of not only comforting each other, but giving loving care to hospitalized veterans confined in government hospitals far from home. The organization was named after the Gold Star that families hung in their windows in honor of the deceased veteran. After years of planning, twenty-five mothers met in Washington, D.C., on June 4, 1928, to establish the national organization, American Gold Star Mothers, Inc.

On May 28, 1918, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] approved a suggestion made by the [[Council of National Defense]] that, instead of wearing conventional mourning for relatives who have died in the service of their country, American women should wear a black band on the left arm with a gilt star on the band for each member of the family who has given his life for the nation.

"The Service Flag displayed from homes, places of business, churches, schools, etc., to indicate the number of members of the family or organizations who are serving in the Armed Forces or who have died from such service. Service flags have a deep Blue Star for each living member in the service and a Gold Star for each member who has died." Thus, the Gold Star and the term Gold Star Mother, as applied to mothers whose sons or daughters died in World War I, were accepted; they have continued to be used in reference to all American military engagements since that time.

==History of membership criteria==
Membership in American Gold Star Mothers was originally restricted to those who lost sons or daughters in World War I, and was later expanded to include mothers of those lost in [[World War II]], then the [[Korean War]], and then other specific conflicts. Today, the membership criteria do not consider the place or time of the military service and do not consider whether the circumstances of the death involved hostile conflict or not, and also allow membership for mothers of those [[missing in action]].

For the first 77 years of its existence, AGSM restricted its membership criteria to admit only [[U.S. citizen]]s. As a way to create pressure to change the rule, an application for admission was submitted in 2005 that deliberately highlighted the applicant's lack of citizenship.&lt;ref name=ShunsFilipino/&gt; The application, from Ligaya Lagman, a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent resident of the United States]] living in [[Yonkers, New York]], who had been living in the U.S. more than 20 years and whose son, Marine Staff Sgt. Anthony Lagman, was [[killed in action]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2004 at the age of 26, was rejected in May 2005.&lt;ref name=ShunsFilipino&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8014030/ns/us_news/|title=Group shuns Filipino mother of slain soldier |website=[[NBC News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 28, 2005 |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Applebome/&gt; In the next month after that incident, which received a "firestorm"&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{cite news |first=Maki |last=Becker |title=Gold Star Mothers ease rules – Now open to noncitizens |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/gold-star-mothers-ease-rules-open-noncitizens-article-1.608837 |website=[[New York Daily News]] |date=September 9, 2005 |accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of publicity that included negative commentary by New York [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Eliot Engel]] and New York [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]],&lt;ref name=ShunsFilipino/&gt; the group agreed on June 27, 2005, to change its membership criteria,&lt;ref name=Applebome&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Applebome |title=A Special Club No Mother Needs to Join |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/nyregion/a-special-club-no-mother-needs-to-join.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 29, 2005 |accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it accepted its first two non-citizens as members a few months later in early September 2005.&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

The AGSM is a private [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization&lt;ref name=Donate&gt;{{cite web |title=Donate |url=http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Donate.htm |website=American Gold Star Mothers official website |accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that sets its own rules for who is allowed to become a member.&lt;ref name=Criteria/&gt; The current charter, held under Title 36 § 211 of the United States Code, was established on June 12, 1984.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

Today, membership in American Gold Star Mothers is open to any woman who was a U.S. citizen or legal resident of the U.S. or its [[Territories of the United States|Territories]] or [[Insular area|Insular Possessions]] at the time their child (or adopted child) was inducted into military service and whose child (or adopted child) has died or has become [[missing in action]] while in the [[United States Armed Forces]] (or died later as the result of such service). Membership is not contingent on whether the child was killed in action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Join |url=http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/HowToJoin.htm |website=American Gold Star Mothers official website |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816184210/http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/HowToJoin.htm |archive-date=2016-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the theater of operation or the time period of the service (which differs from distinctions made by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], which confers special status to service in particular periods of time and particular hostile operations).&lt;ref name=Criteria&gt;{{cite web |title=Membership Criteria |url=http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/Membership.htm |website=American Gold Star Mothers official website |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816211141/http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/Membership.htm |archive-date=2016-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-adoptive stepmothers are also eligible for membership if they assumed responsibility for the child before the age of fifteen and raised them. Husbands and children of Gold Star Mothers are eligible to join as Associate Members. Honorary membership is available to mothers who were not citizens or legal residents at the time their child was inducted. Associate Members and Honorary Members cannot vote or hold official positions (and are not required to pay dues). 

AGSM is made up of local chapters, which are organized into departments.  Five members are required to start a local chapter.  If no local chapter is available, a woman may join the organization as a member at large.

Just as when it was founded, AGSM continues to concentrate on providing emotional support to its members, doing volunteer work with veterans in general and veterans' hospitals in particular, and generally fostering a sense of patriotism and respect for members of the Armed Forces.

The uniform consists of a white skirt, white shirt, and a white blazer, with a gold star embroidered on either lapel, and gold piping on the sleeve cuffs, and collars, and white shoes, either [[Mary Janes]] or [[Court shoe|pumps]], with a white cap, similar to a women's service hat, with gold piping. This uniform is worn at all parades, meetings, and social functions connected with military functions (e.g., [[Memorial Day]] services at [[Arlington National Cemetery]])

Aside from the founder, perhaps the mother most known for being a Gold Star mother was Aletta Sullivan, the mother of the five [[Sullivan brothers]], who were killed in action when their ship, the {{USS|Juneau|CL-52}} was sunk by an enemy torpedo on November 13, 1942 during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. On September 21, 1948, the U.S. Post Office issued a [[commemorative stamp]], specially designed by artist [[Charles R. Chickering]], honoring the Gold Star Mothers. Mrs. Sullivan was given the first sheet of stamps issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Star Mothers Issue |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=September 24, 2013 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2028809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anchor Gaslamp''' was a [[Christian]] community in downtown [[San Diego]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=sdut&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080322-9999-1c22church.html |work=[[San Diego Union Tribune]] |date=March 22, 2008 |first=Sandi |last=Dolbee |title=Downtown church begins in a nightspot |accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Missional living|missional]] in intent and incarnational in practice. Since the first gathering on [[Easter]] Sunday in 2008 the group has attracted a diverse congregation. They have since moved to East Village and changed their name to New City Church &lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

== Gatherings ==
Anchor Gaslamp met on the first three Sundays of the month in the heart of downtown San Diego's [[Gaslamp Quarter]].&lt;ref name=sdr&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2008/may/21/anchor-gaslamp-church/ |work=[[San Diego Reader]] |title=Anchor Gaslamp Church |first=Matthew |last=Lickona |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gatherings were held upstairs in [[The Keating Hotel]] located on the corner of 5th &amp; F St.).&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; On the other Sundays, the Community joined together for '''Anchor in Action''' which are mission-driven events all over the city, with the sole purpose of "not just going to church, but '''being''' the church." These Sundays ranged in activities from homeless [[barbecue]]s to delivering truckloads of donated goods to orphanages and women's recovery homes in [[Baja California]].

The larger community was made up of other smaller communities that met throughout the week. All other meetings, services, or mission-events were derived out of these communities, which met in various locations throughout the city.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Starbucks Group.jpg|thumb|left|Anchor Gaslamp started as a Bible study group at various locations including a [[Starbucks]].|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 26 August 2009}}]] --&gt;

== History ==
The Church began as a church planting project of The Anchor Church, formerly [[Revival Tabernacle]], located in the [[Oak Park, San Diego|Oak Park]] area of San Diego.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt; It was initially established as a [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] group under the direction of Pastors Karlton Edison and Vince Larson in 2007. During this time the group met in the Downtown San Diego area, in locations which varied from restaurants to hotels to coffee houses until its first Sunday Gathering in a [[nightclub]] on [[Easter Sunday]], 2008.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;

Anchor Gaslamp was a [[nondenominational]] church,&lt;ref name=sdr/&gt; whose doctrinal view was in alignment with the [[Nicene Creed]]. They are now called New City Church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4453">'''Beatrice Bolam'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (''née'' '''Patterson'''; August 1919&lt;ref name="candidates"&gt;{{cite news|title=These Are the Candidates|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000640/19500209/172/0010|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette|date=9 February 1950|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 2 January 2013) was an English politician and councillor for [[Jarrow]], [[South Tyneside]]. 

==Early life==
Bolam was born and raised in [[Jarrow]], the eldest of four children of a [[boilermaker]] who worked for [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]]. She grew up during the [[Great Depression]] and her family struggled after her father lost his job in Palmer's collapse. Educated at Jarrow Grammar School, she then attended [[Skerry's College]] in Newcastle until 1937, training for a career in the civil service.&lt;ref name="sunderland1954"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs Bolam To Fight Sunderland North|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000640/19540120/004/0001|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette|date=20 January 1954|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, she married Oswald James Bolam, a bookkeeper in the shipyards, and took the name Bolam.&lt;ref&gt;''England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sunderland1954"/&gt;

==Career and politics==
Bolam became a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1939. The next year, she was made vice chairman of the Jarrow Imperial League.&lt;ref name="candidates"/&gt; She worked as a civil servant until 1942, when she returned to Jarrow Grammar School to become secretary to the headmaster. In 1945, at age 26, she became the youngest member in history of the Jarrow Town Council. In 1953, she was elected to serve as the representative for Jarrow on Durham County Council, defeating a Labour Party member to take the role.&lt;ref name="sunderland1954"/&gt;  

That same year, she founded the Jarrow branch of the Young Conservatives and assisted [[Stanley Holmes, 1st Baron Dovercourt|Stanley Holmes]] (later Baron Dovercourt) in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|general election]]. In 1947, she volunteered at the [[Jarrow by-election, 1947|Jarrow by-election]] when William Scott stood as the Conservative candidate.&lt;ref name="sunderland1954"/&gt;

In 1947, she left the grammar school to devote her life full time to politics, which was taking up more of her time. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]]s she was a housewife when she contested [[Houghton-le-Spring (UK Parliament constituency)|Houghton-le-Spring]], but was defeated both times by [[Billy Blyton, Baron Blyton|Billy Blyton]] of the Labour party.&lt;ref name="sunderland1954"/&gt;

She earned a reputation as a strong speaker, and served on many committees and speakers' panels.&lt;ref name="sunderland1954"/&gt; She held various positions within the Jarrow Conservative Association, including chair twice and treasurer.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsrt"/&gt;

==Honours==
In the [[1973 New Year Honours]], Bolam was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for political and public services in the North of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45860 |date=29 December 1972 | page=12 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also received an award for being one of the longest-serving members of the Conservative Party in the UK.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsrt"/&gt;

==Death==
Bolam died at age 93 in [[South Shields]], [[Tyne and Wear]] and was survived by her brother Alan Patterson.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Political stalwart Beatrice Bolam dies at 93|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/political-stalwart-beatrice-dies-at-93-1-5301270|publisher=The Shields Gazette|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsrt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beatrice Bolam dies at 93|url=http://www.newsrt.co.uk/news/political-stalwart-beatrice-dies-at-93-1122607.html|publisher=UK NEWS|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''catafalque''' is a raised [[bier]], box, or similar platform, often movable, that is used to support the [[casket]], [[coffin]], or body of the deceased during a [[Christian burial|Christian funeral]] or memorial service.&lt;ref name="Jobson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Jobson|title=Looking Forward Looking Back: Customs and Traditions of the Australian Army|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wZa2sr3ol8C&amp;pg=PA71|year=2009|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|isbn=978-0-9803251-6-4|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Requiem Mass]], a catafalque may be used to stand in place of the body at the [[absolution of the dead]] or used during Masses of the Dead and [[All Souls' Day]].&lt;ref name="EmpereurFernández2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Empereur|author2=Eduardo Fernández|title=La Vida Sacra: Contemporary Hispanic Sacramental Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQVvAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA294|date=12 October 2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4616-3855-1|pages=294–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papal catafalques ==
Large processions have followed the catafalques of [[List of popes|Popes]]. The households of the cardinals carried the catafalque of [[Pope Sixtus V]] in 1590. The bier, decorated with gold cloth, was followed by "confraternities, [[religious order]]s, students of seminaries and colleges, orphans and [[mendicant]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Festive Funerals in Early Modern Italy: The Art and Culture of Conspicuous Commemoration|last=Schraven|first=Minou|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9780754665243|location=|pages=203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, a million people filed past the catafalque of [[Pope John XXIII]], which had been carried in procession to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CriticalPast|title=Millions of people pass by the catafalque bearing the body of Pope John XXIII in ...HD Stock Footage|date=2014-06-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a7iFR_Gzns|accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable catafalques ==
[[File:Voltaire cercueil funérailles Panthéon.jpg|thumb|[[Voltaire]]'s catafalque]]
Other than religious leaders such as Popes, famous people have lain in state or been carried in procession to their burial place on a catafalque.

=== Voltaire ===
Thirteen years after his death, the remains of [[Voltaire]] were transferred on a catafalque to the [[Panthéon]] in Paris, a building dedicated to the great men of the French nation. It bore the inscription: "Poet, philosopher, historian, he made a great step forward in the human spirit. He prepared us to become free."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitvoltaire.com/voltaire's_later_life_funeral_procession.htm|title=Voltaire's funeral procession|website=www.visitvoltaire.com|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not in use, the catafalque is kept on display in the Exhibition Hall at the [[United States Capitol Visitor Center]]. It was used for [[Antonin Scalia]], an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]], in 2016. Commentators noted that the structure of the original pine timbers and boards has been reinforced, albeit being left 'original'.&lt;ref&gt;According to Robert Cromie in his book ''The Great Chicago Fire'', copyright 1958, Lincoln's catafalque was in Woods' Museum in [[Chicago]] and was burned in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] in 1871. However, Lincoln had funeral ceremonies during stops at several major cities as his remains were taken by train from Washington to [[Springfield, Illinois]] for burial. Cromie probably meant the catafalque used for ceremonies held at Chicago, rather than the one built for his state funeral in DC and retained at the U.S. Capitol.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It has been abolished in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==Statute==
This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/35 section 35] of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (drivers of carriages injuring persons by furious driving):

{{blockquote|"Whosoever, having the charge of any carriage or vehicle, shall by wanton or furious driving or racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, do or cause to be done any bodily harm to any person whatsoever, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years ..."}}

This section is printed as amended by section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] and of the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]].

This section was repealed for the [[Republic of Ireland]] by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0025/sec0070.html section 70(a)] of the [[Road Traffic Act 2010]]. In the Republic of Ireland, a person liable to be charged an offence under section 53 of the [[Road Traffic Act, 1961]] was not liable, by reference to the same occurrence, to be charged with an offence under this section.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Act, 1961]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0053.html section 53(5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Misdemeanour"'''

The reference to a [[misdemeanour]] must now be construed as a reference to an offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], section 12(5)(a); the [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Bodily harm"'''

See [[bodily harm]]

In England and Wales, this offence is now used to prosecute:
*drivers of horse-drawn carriages and vehicles
*motorists who cannot be prosecuted for [[dangerous driving]] because they were driving elsewhere than on a road or public place, or because they were not warned that prosecution was intended pursuant to section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]]
*cyclists who cannot be prosecuted for [[dangerous cycling]] because they were cycling elsewhere than on a road, or because they were not warned that prosecution was intended pursuant to section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-248b at page 1626&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used in 2009 to prosecute a death caused by a cyclist collision, which would have fallen outside other laws as it is the closest equivalent to [[dangerous driving]] for cyclists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyclist jailed for pavement death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8197430.stm |date=12 August 2009 |work= BBC News |accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was used again in 2017 for similar reasons&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41028321&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Mode of trial==

In England and Wales, this is an [[indictable-only offence]].

==Sentence==
In England and Wales, this offence is punishable with imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], section 35; the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], section 35; the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]], section 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempt==
The offence of [[attempt]]ing to cause bodily harm by wanton driving requires an [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] to cause bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohan [1976] QB 1, [1975] 2 WLR 859, [1975] 2 All ER 193, 60 Cr App R 272, [1975] RTR 337, [1975] Crim LR 283, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}
'''Computational linguistics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of [[natural language]] from a computational perspective, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions.

Traditionally, computational linguistics was performed by [[computer scientist]]s who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a [[natural language]]. Today, computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, which can include regular linguists, experts in the target language, and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of [[linguistics|linguists]], [[computer science|computer scientists]], experts in [[artificial intelligence]], [[mathematicians]], [[logic]]ians, [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]], [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguists]], [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]], among others.

Computational linguistics has theoretical and applied components. Theoretical computational linguistics focuses on issues in [[theoretical linguistics]] and cognitive science, and applied computational linguistics focuses on the practical outcome of modeling human language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hans |last=Uszkoreit |title=What Is Computational Linguistics? |url=http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~hansu/what_is_cl.html |publisher=Department of Computational Linguistics and Phonetics of Saarland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] defines computational linguistics as:
{{quote|...the scientific study of [[language]] from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing [[computational model]]s of various kinds of linguistic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Association for Computational Linguistics |url=http://www.aclweb.org/archive/misc/what.html |title=What is Computational Linguistics? |date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==
Computational linguistics is often grouped within the field of artificial intelligence, but actually was present before the development of artificial intelligence. Computational linguistics originated with efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly Russian scientific journals, into English.&lt;ref&gt;John Hutchins: [http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/MTS-1999.pdf Retrospect and prospect in computer-based translation.] Proceedings of MT Summit VII, 1999, pp. 30–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Since computers can make [[arithmetic]] calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was thought to be only a short matter of time before they could also begin to process language.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold B. Barach: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bostworld/2152048032/in/set-72157603898383698/ Translating Machine] 1975: And the Changes To Come.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational and quantitative methods are also used historically in attempted reconstruction of earlier forms of modern languages and subgrouping modern languages into language families. Earlier methods such as [[lexicostatistics]] and [[glottochronology]] have been proven to be premature and inaccurate. However, recent interdisciplinary studies which borrow concepts from biological studies, especially [[gene mapping]], have proved to produce more sophisticated analytical tools and more trustworthy results.&lt;ref&gt;T. Crowley., C. Bowern. An Introduction to Historical Linguistics. Auckland, N.Z.: Oxford UP, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[machine translation]] (also known as mechanical translation) failed to yield accurate translations right away, automated processing of human languages was recognized as far more complex than had originally been assumed. Computational linguistics was born as the name of the new field of study devoted to developing [[algorithm]]s and software for intelligently processing language data. The term "computational linguistics" itself was first coined by [[David G. Hays|David Hays]], founding member of both the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] and the [[International Committee on Computational Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/iccl/committee.html#deceased|title=Deceased members|website=ICCL members|accessdate=15 November 2017|ref=ICCLmembers}}&lt;/ref&gt; When artificial intelligence came into existence in the 1960s, the field of computational linguistics became that sub-division of artificial intelligence dealing with human-level comprehension and production of natural languages.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the [[grammar]] of both languages, including both [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the grammar of word forms) and [[syntax]] (the grammar of sentence structure). In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the [[semantics]] and the [[lexicon]] (or 'vocabulary'), and even something of the [[pragmatics]] of language use. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process natural languages using computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/MINDS/FINAL/NLP.web.pdf Natural Language Processing by Liz Liddy, Eduard Hovy, Jimmy Lin, John Prager, Dragomir Radev, Lucy Vanderwende, Ralph Weischedel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays research within the scope of computational linguistics is done at computational linguistics departments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de "Computational Linguistics and Phonetics"].&lt;/ref&gt; computational linguistics laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/home.html "Yatsko's Computational Linguistics Laboratory"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[computer science]] departments,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page "CLIP"].&lt;/ref&gt; and linguistics departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.georgetown.edu/programs/graduate/computational/ Computational Linguistics&amp;nbsp;– Department of Linguistics&amp;nbsp;– Georgetown College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/research/computational.html "UPenn Linguistics: Computational Linguistics"].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some research in the field of computational linguistics aims to create working speech or text processing systems while others aim to create a system allowing human-machine interaction. Programs meant for human-machine communication are called [[Embodied agent|conversational agents]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurafsky, D., &amp; Martin, J. H. (2009).

Just as computational linguistics can be performed by experts in a variety of fields and through a wide assortment of departments, so too can the research fields broach a diverse range of topics.  The following sections discuss some of the literature available across the entire field broken into four main area of discourse: developmental linguistics, structural linguistics, linguistic production, and linguistic comprehension.

===Developmental approaches===

Language is a cognitive skill which develops throughout the life of an individual. This developmental process has been examined using a number of techniques, and a computational approach is one of them.  Human [[language development]] does provide some constraints which make it harder to apply a computational method to understanding it. For instance, during [[language acquisition]], human children are largely only exposed to positive evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowerman, M. (1988). [http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:468143:4/component/escidoc:532427/bowerman_1988_The-No.pdf The "no negative evidence" problem: How do children avoid constructing an overly general grammar. Explaining language universals].&lt;/ref&gt; This means that during the linguistic development of an individual, only evidence for what is a correct form is provided, and not evidence for what is not correct.  This is insufficient information for a simple hypothesis testing procedure for information as complex as language,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Braine, M.D.S. (1971). On two types of models of the internalization of grammars. In D.I. Slobin (Ed.), The ontogenesis of grammar: A theoretical perspective. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and so provides certain boundaries for a computational approach to modeling language development and acquisition in an individual.

Attempts have been made to model the developmental process of language acquisition in children from a computational angle, leading to both [[stochastic grammar|statistical grammars]] and [[connectionism|connectionist models]].&lt;ref name="powers1989"&gt;Powers, D.M.W. &amp; Turk, C.C.R. (1989). ''Machine Learning of Natural Language''. Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|978-0-387-19557-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Work in this realm has also been proposed as a method to explain the [[evolution of language]] through history.  Using models, it has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;Elman, J. (1993). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027793900584 Learning and development in neural networks: The importance of starting small]. Cognition, 71-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was simultaneously posed as a reason for the long developmental period of human children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"/&gt; Both conclusions were drawn because of the strength of the [[artificial neural network]] which the project created.

The ability of infants to develop language has also been modeled using robots&lt;ref&gt;Salvi, G., Montesano, L., Bernardino, A., &amp; Santos-Victor, J. (2012). Language bootstrapping: learning word meanings from perception-action association. IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics. Part B, Cybernetics : a publication of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society, 42(3), 660-71. {{DOI|10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2172420}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to test linguistic theories.  Enabled to learn as children might, a model was created based on an [[affordance]] model in which mappings between actions, perceptions, and effects were created and linked to spoken words.  Crucially, these robots were able to acquire functioning word-to-meaning mappings without needing grammatical structure, vastly simplifying the learning process and shedding light on information which furthers the current understanding of linguistic development.  It is important to note that this information could only have been empirically tested using a computational approach.

As our understanding of the linguistic development of an individual within a lifetime is continually improved using neural networks and [[Robot_learning|learning robotic systems]], it is also important to keep in mind that languages themselves change and develop through time.  Computational approaches to understanding this phenomenon have unearthed very interesting information.  Using the [[Price Equation]] and [[Pólya urn]] dynamics, researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution, but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modern-day languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gong, T.|author2=Shuai, L.|author3=Tamariz, M.|author4=Jäger, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Studying Language Change Using Price Equation and Pólya-urn Dynamics|editor=E. Scalas|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|page=e33171|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0033171|pmid=22427981|pmc=3299756}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This modeling effort achieved, through computational linguistics, what would otherwise have been impossible.

It is clear that the understanding of linguistic development in humans as well as throughout evolutionary time has been fantastically improved because of advances in computational linguistics. The ability to model and modify systems at will affords science an ethical method of testing hypotheses that would otherwise be intractable.

===Structural approaches===

In order to create better computational models of language, an understanding of language’s structure is crucial. To this end, the [[English language]] has been meticulously studied using computational approaches to better understand how the language works on a structural level.  One of the most important pieces of being able to study linguistic structure is the availability of large linguistic corpora, or samples.  This grants computational linguists the raw data necessary to run their models and gain a better understanding of the underlying structures present in the vast amount of data which is contained in any single language.  One of the most cited English linguistic corpora is the Penn [[Treebank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marcus, M.|author2=Marcinkiewicz, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1993|url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J/J93/J93-2004.pdf|title=Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=313–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Derived from widely-different sources, such as IBM computer manuals and transcribed telephone conversations, this corpus contains over 4.5 million words of American English. This corpus has been primarily annotated using [[part-of-speech]] tagging and syntactic bracketing and has yielded substantial empirical observations related to language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Ann|title=Treebanks|date=2003|publisher=Spring Netherlands|pages=5–22|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical approaches to the structure of languages have also been developed.  These works allow computational linguistics to have a framework within which to work out hypotheses that will further the understanding of the language in a myriad of ways.  One of the original theoretical theses on internalization of [[grammar]] and structure of language proposed two types of models.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt;  In these models, rules or patterns learned increase in strength with the frequency of their encounter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt; The work also created a question for computational linguists to answer: how does an infant learn a specific and non-normal grammar ([[Chomsky Normal Form]]) without learning an overgeneralized version and getting stuck?&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971" /&gt; Theoretical efforts like these set the direction for research to go early in the lifetime of a field of study, and are crucial to the growth of the field.

Structural information about languages allows for the discovery and implementation of similarity recognition between pairs of text utterances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Angus, D.|author2=Smith, A.|author3=Wiles, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Conceptual recurrence plots: revealing patterns in human discourse|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|volume=18|issue=6|pages=988–97|doi=10.1109/TVCG.2011.100|pmid=22499664}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, it has recently been proven that based on the structural information present in patterns of human discourse, conceptual [[recurrence plots]] can be used to model and visualize trends in data and create reliable measures of similarity between natural textual utterances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  This technique is a strong tool for further probing the structure of human [[discourse]].  Without the computational approach to this question, the vastly complex information present in discourse data would have remained inaccessible to scientists.

Information regarding the structural data of a language is available for [[English language|English]] as well as other languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Furuhashi, S.|author2=Hayakawa, Y. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Lognormality of the Distribution of Japanese Sentence Lengths|journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan|volume=81|issue=3|page=034004|doi=10.1143/JPSJ.81.034004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using computational methods, Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of [[log-normality]] was found in relation to sentence length.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  Though the exact cause of this lognormality remains unknown, it is precisely this sort of intriguing information which computational linguistics is designed to uncover.  This information could lead to further important discoveries regarding the underlying structure of Japanese, and could have any number of effects on the understanding of Japanese as a language.  Computational linguistics allows for very exciting additions to the scientific knowledge base to happen quickly and with very little room for doubt.

Without a computational approach to the structure of linguistic data, much of the information that is available now would still be hidden under the vastness of data within any single language.  Computational linguistics allows scientists to parse huge amounts of data reliably and efficiently, creating the possibility for discoveries unlike any seen in most other approaches.

===Production approaches===
{{Original research section|date=October 2015}}

The production of language is equally as complex in the information it provides and the necessary skills which a fluent producer must have.  That is to say, comprehension is only half the problem of communication.  The other half is how a system produces language, and computational linguistics has made some very interesting discoveries in this area.
[[File:Alan Turing Aged 16.jpg|thumb|Alan Turing: computer scientist and namesake developer of the [[Turing test|Turing Test]] as a method of measuring the intelligence of a machine.]]
In a now famous paper published in 1950 [[Alan Turing]] proposed the possibility that machines might one day have the ability to "think". As a thought experiment for what might define the concept of thought in machines, he proposed an "imitation test" in which a human subject has two text-only conversations, one with a fellow human and another with a machine attempting to respond like a human. Turing proposes that if the subject cannot tell the difference between the human and the machine, it may be concluded that the machine is capable of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turing, A. M.|year=1950|jstor=10.2307/2251299|title=Computing machinery and intelligence|journal=Mind|volume=59|issue=236|pages=433–460|doi=10.1093/mind/lix.236.433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this test is known as the [[Turing test]] and it remains an influential idea in the area of artificial intelligence.

[[File:Joseph Weizenbaum.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Weizenbaum]]: former MIT professor and computer scientist who developed [[ELIZA]], a primitive computer program utilizing [[natural language processing]].]] One of the earliest and best known examples of a computer program designed to converse naturally with humans is the [[ELIZA]] program developed by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] at [[MIT]] in 1966. The program emulated a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian]] [[psychotherapist]] when responding to written statements and questions posed by a user. It appeared capable of understanding what was said to it and responding intelligently, but in truth it simply followed a pattern matching routine that relied on only understanding a few keywords in each sentence. Its responses were generated by recombining the unknown parts of the sentence around properly translated versions of the known words. For example, in the phrase "It seems that you hate me" ELIZA understands "you" and "me" which matches the general pattern "you [some words] me", allowing ELIZA to update the words "you" and "me" to "I" and "you" and replying "What makes you think I hate you?". In this example ELIZA has no understanding of the word "hate", but it is not required for a logical response in the context of this type of psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weizenbaum, J.|year=1966|title=ELIZA—a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=9|issue=1|pages=36–45|doi=10.1145/365153.365168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some projects are still trying to solve the problem which first started computational linguistics off as its own field in the first place. However, the methods have become more refined and clever, and consequently the results generated by computational linguists have become more enlightening.  In an effort to improve computer translation, several models have been compared, including [[hidden Markov models]], smoothing techniques, and the specific refinements of those to apply them to verb translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Och, F. J.|author2=Ney, H.|year=2003|title=A Systematic Comparison of Various Statistical Alignment Models|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=29|issue=1|pages=19–51|doi=10.1162/089120103321337421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model which was found to produce the most natural translations of [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] words was a refined alignment model with a first-order dependence and a fertility model[16].  They also provide efficient training algorithms for the models presented, which can give other scientists the ability to improve further on their results. This type of work is specific to computational linguistics, and has applications which could vastly improve understanding of how language is produced and comprehended by computers.

Work has also been done in making computers produce language in a more naturalistic manner.  Using linguistic input from humans, algorithms have been constructed which are able to modify a system's style of production based on a factor such as linguistic input from a human, or more abstract factors like politeness or any of the [[Big Five personality traits|five main dimensions of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mairesse, F.|year=2011|title=Controlling user perceptions of linguistic style: Trainable generation of personality traits|journal=Computational Linguistics|doi=10.1162/COLI_a_00063|volume=37|issue=3|pages=455–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work takes a computational approach via [[parameter estimation]] models to categorize the vast array of linguistic styles we see across individuals and simplify it for a computer to work in the same way, making [[human-computer interaction]] much more natural.

==== Text-based interactive approach ====

Many of the earliest and simplest models of human-computer interaction, such as ELIZA for example, involve a text-based input from the user to generate a response from the computer. By this method, words typed by a user trigger the computer to recognize specific patterns and reply accordingly, through a process known as [[keyword spotting]].

==== Speech-based interactive approach ====

Recent technologies have placed more of an emphasis on speech-based interactive systems. These systems, such as [[Siri]] of the [[iOS]] operating system, operate on a similar pattern-recognizing technique as that of text-based systems, but with the former, the user input is conducted through [[speech recognition]]. This branch of linguistics involves the processing of the user's speech as sound waves and the interpreting of the acoustics and language patterns in order for the computer to recognize the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Files|last = |first = |publisher = The Ohio State University Department of Linguistics|year = 2011|isbn = 9780814251799|location = |pages = 624–634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehension approaches===

Much of the focus of modern computational linguistics is on comprehension. With the proliferation of the internet and the abundance of easily accessible written human language, the ability to create a program capable of [[natural language understanding|understanding human language]] would have many broad and exciting possibilities, including improved search engines, automated customer service, and online education.

Early work in comprehension included applying Bayesian statistics to the task of optical character recognition, as illustrated by Bledsoe and Browing in 1959 in which a large dictionary of possible letters were generated by "learning" from example letters and then the probability that any one of those learned examples matched the new input was combined to make a final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Bledsoe, W. W.|author2=Browning, I.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1959|title=Pattern recognition and reading by machine|conference=''Papers presented at the December 1–3, 1959, eastern joint IRE-AIEE-ACM computer conference on - IRE-AIEE-ACM  ’59 (Eastern)''|pages=225–232|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1460299.1460326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts at applying Bayesian statistics to language analysis included the work of Mosteller and Wallace (1963) in which an analysis of the words used in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' was used to attempt to determine their authorship (concluding that Madison most likely authored the majority of the papers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mosteller, F.|year=1963|jstor=10.2307/2283270|title=Inference in an authorship problem|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=58|issue=302|pages=275–309|doi=10.2307/2283270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[Terry Winograd]] developed an early [[natural language processing]] engine capable of interpreting naturally written commands within a simple rule governed environment. The primary language parsing program in this project was called [[SHRDLU]], which was capable of carrying out a somewhat natural conversation with the user giving it commands, but only within the scope of the toy environment designed for the task. This environment consisted of different shaped and colored blocks, and SHRDLU was capable of interpreting commands such as "Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box." and asking questions such as "I don't understand which pyramid you mean." in response to the user's input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Winograd, T.|year=1971|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0721399|title=Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for Understanding Natural Language|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; While impressive, this kind of [[natural language processing]] has proven much more difficult outside the limited scope of the toy environment. Similarly a project developed by [[NASA]] called [[LUNAR]] was designed to provide answers to naturally written questions about the geological analysis of lunar rocks returned by the Apollo missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Woods, W.|author2=Kaplan, R.|author3=Nash-Webber, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1972|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247926251|title=The lunar sciences natural language information system|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of problems are referred to as [[question answering]].

Initial attempts at understanding spoken language were based on work done in the 1960s and 1970s in signal modeling where an unknown signal is analyzed to look for patterns and to make predictions based on its history. An initial and somewhat successful approach to applying this kind of signal modeling to language was achieved with the use of hidden Markov models as detailed by Rabiner in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rabiner, L.|year=1989|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=18626|title=A tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=77|issue=2|pages=257–286|doi=10.1109/5.18626|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.3454}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach attempts to determine probabilities for the arbitrary number of models that could be being used in generating speech as well as modeling the probabilities for various words generated from each of these possible models. Similar approaches were employed in early [[speech recognition]] attempts starting in the late 70s at IBM using word/part-of-speech pair probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bahl, L.|author2=Baker, J.|author3=Cohen, P.|author4=Jelinek, F.|year=1978|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1170402|title=Recognition of continuously read natural corpus|journal=Acoustics, Speech, and Signal|volume=3|pages=422–424|doi=10.1109/ICASSP.1978.1170402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently these kinds of statistical approaches have been applied to more difficult tasks such as topic identification using Bayesian parameter estimation to infer topic probabilities in text documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blei, D.|author2=Ng, A. |lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944937|title=Latent dirichlet allocation|journal=The Journal of Machine Learning|volume=3|pages=993–1022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Modern computational linguistics is often a combination of studies in computer science and programming, math, particularly statistics, language structures, and natural language processing. Combined, these fields most often lead to the development of systems that can recognize speech and perform some task based on that speech. Examples include speech recognition software, such as Apple's Siri feature, spellcheck tools, [[speech synthesis]] programs, which are often used to demonstrate pronunciation or help the disabled, and machine translation programs and websites, such as Google Translate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/linguistics/careers-computational-linguistics/|title=Careers in Computational Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=California State University|access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational linguistics can be especially helpful in situations involving [[social media]] and the [[Internet]]. For example, filters in chatrooms or on website searches require computational linguistics. Chat operators often use filters to identify certain words or phrases and deem them inappropriate so that users cannot submit them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another example of using filters is on websites. Schools use filters so that websites with certain keywords are blocked from children to view. There are also many programs in which parents use [[Parental controls]] to put content filters in place. Computational linguists can also develop programs that group and organize content through [[Social media mining]]. An example of this is Twitter, in which programs can group tweets by subject or keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Marujo, Lu&lt;math&gt;\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;s et al. "Automatic Keyword Extraction on Twitter." Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, n.d. Web. 19 Sept. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational linguistics is also used for document retrieval and clustering. When you do an online search, documents and websites are retrieved based on the frequency of unique labels related to what you typed into a search engine. For instance, if you search "red, large, four-wheeled vehicle," with the intention of finding pictures of a red truck, the search engine will still find the information desired by matching words such as "four-wheeled" with "car".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/#DocRetCluApp|title=Computational Linguistics|last=|first=|date=Feb 26, 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Apr 19, 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==
Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (recognition) or [[natural language generation|synthesizing language (generation)]].

[[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages. The possibility of automatic language translation, however, has yet to be realized and remains a notoriously hard branch of computational linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Oettinger, A. G. (1965). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2313322 Computational Linguistics]. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 72, No. 2, Part 2: Computers and Computing, pp. 147-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include:
* [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] of natural language, largely modeled on [[automata theory]], with the application of [[context-sensitive grammar]] and [[Linear bounded automaton|linearly bounded]] [[Turing machine]]s.
* [[Computational semantics]] comprises defining suitable logics for [[linguistic meaning]] representation, automatically constructing them and reasoning with them
* Computer-aided [[corpus linguistics]], which has been used since the 1970s as a way to make detailed advances in the field of discourse analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McEnery|first=Thomas|title=Corpus Linguistics: An Introduction|year=1996|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0748611652|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nwmgdvN_akAC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22computer+aided+corpus+linguistics%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22computer%20aided%20corpus%20linguistics%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Design of [[parser]]s or [[phrase chunking|chunkers]] for [[natural language]]s
* Design of taggers like [[Part-of-speech tagging|POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)]]
* [[Machine translation]] as one of the earliest and most difficult applications of computational linguistics draws on many subfields.
* Simulation and study of language evolution in [[historical linguistics]]/[[glottochronology]].

The subject of computational linguistics has had a recurring impact on popular culture:

'''Corporate security''' identifies and effectively mitigates or manages, at an early stage, any developments that may threaten the resilience and continued survival of a corporation. It is a corporate function that oversees and manages the close coordination of all functions within the company that are concerned with security, continuity and safety.

== Introduction ==
[[Globalisation]] has changed the structure and pace of corporate life; the saturation of traditional markets is taking companies to more risky places; the shift towards a [[knowledge economy]] is eroding the importance of ‘place’ in the business world; new business practices such as [[offshoring]] challenge companies to manage at a distance; and new forms of accountability, such as [[corporate governance]] and [[corporate social responsibility]], put added pressure on companies to match their words with deeds, wherever they are operating.

At the same time, security risks have become more complex, too. Many of the threats, such as [[terrorism]], [[organised crime]] and [[information security]], are asymmetric and networked, making them more difficult to manage. There is also greater appreciation of the interdependence between a company’s [[risk portfolio]] and the way it does business: certain types of behavior can enhance or undermine an organization’s ‘licence to operate’, and in some cases this can generate risks that would not otherwise exist. As a result, [[security]] has a higher profile in the corporate world today than it did five years ago. Companies are looking for new ways to manage these risks and the portfolio of the security department has widened to include shared responsibility for things such as reputation, corporate governance and regulation, corporate social responsibility and [[information assurance]].

There are six characteristics of alignment between security and the business:

:#The principal role of the security department is to convince colleagues across the business to deliver security through their everyday actions and decisions – not try to do security to or for the company.
:#The security department is in the business of change management rather than enforcement and works through trusted social networks of influence.
:#Security is there to help the company to take risks rather than prevent them and should therefore be at the forefront of new business development.
:#Security constantly responds to new business concerns and, as such, the portfolio of responsibilities and their relative importance will change over time. Security departments should never stand still or become fixed entities. In many companies today, its role is more concerned with overall corporate resilience than ‘traditional’ security.
:#Security is both a strategic and operational activity, and departments must distinguish between these two layers.
:#The power and legitimacy of the security department does not come from its expert knowledge, but from its business acumen, people skills, management ability and communication expertise.&lt;ref&gt;DEMOS (2006)''[http://www.demos.co.uk/files/thebusinessofresilience.pdf The Business of Resilience Corporate security for the 21st century]'', Rachel Briggs and Charlie Edwards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core Elements==
Core elements of Corporate Security are:

:*Personal security
:*[[Physical security]]
:*[[Information security]]
:*[[Corporate governance]]
:*Compliance and ethics programs
:*Crime prevention and detection
:*[[Fraud deterrence]]
:*Investigations
:*[[Risk management]]
:*[[Business continuity planning]]
:*[[Crisis management]]
:*Environment, safety and health

== Roles ==
For many years corporate security has been dominated by a ‘defensive’ approach, focused on protection and loss prevention. The head of security was seen as little more than the ‘guard at the gate’, someone whose actions invariably stopped people doing their jobs instead of enabling the business to function more effectively. Typically, heads of security came from a narrow talent pool, namely police, armed forces or intelligence.

There are many reasons companies tend to recruit security managers from these backgrounds. The police and
armed forces churn out individuals with intensive training in the practice of security and protection, and have hands-on experience that is rarely available elsewhere. There are a number of reasons greater diversity is essential within the corporate security function.

:#There is a growing recognition of the strategic importance of security and as a result security departments need to operate at a much more senior level.
:#Matrix organisations require a particular approach to management and leadership, which can be antithetical to those with police or armed services backgrounds. In today’s corporate environment, the impact of the security department is proportionate to its ability to persuade individuals and teams all over the company to collaborate and cooperate. This means that dialogue between security specialists and non-specialists is essential.
:#Traditional security skills are associated with an approach where security is perceived as a ‘dis-enabler’ of business. Those with formal security training can tend to be risk averse, while businesses need to take calculated risks to stay ahead of competitors, break into new markets and maximise profits.
:#The corporate security function needs people who are happy breaking rules, innovating and thinking outside the box.58 Studies of security-related professions such as the police, the ambulance service and local authority emergency planning departments have suggested that ‘too much’ experience in a traditional security context can inhibit people from making innovative responses to security incidents. Heads of security consistently rated qualities such as independent thinking, willingness to challenge assumptions and behaviours and innovation as being ones they value most in their team. 
:#There is a growing recognition of the value of ‘the human element’. According to experts, many security professionals are typically trained to address security incidents and emergencies in ways that fail to factor in the human dynamics of such situations, including the impact of emotions, perceptions and fear on people’s behaviour. Emotional intelligence is critical to effective alignment, but the human element of security and risk management is routinely overshadowed by the emphasis on technical security skills. 

For security to be aligned with the business, security managers must understand the business and how they contribute towards its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;DEMOS (2006)''[http://www.demos.co.uk/files/thebusinessofresilience.pdf The Business of Resilience Corporate security for the 21st century]'', Rachel Briggs and Charlie Edwards&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief Security Officer]] (CSO) is the corporation's top executive who is responsible for security. The CSO serves as the business leader responsible for the development, implementation and management of the organization’s corporate security vision, strategy and programs. They direct staff in identifying, developing, implementing and maintaining security processes across the organization to reduce risks, respond to incidents, and limit exposure to liability in all areas of financial, physical, and personal risk; establish appropriate standards and risk controls associated with intellectual property; and direct the establishment and implementation of policies and procedures related to data security.

[[File:Prague powder No 1.jpg|thumb|[[Curing salt]], also known as "Prague powder" or "pink salt", is typically a combination of [[sodium chloride]] and [[sodium nitrite]] that is dyed pink to distinguish it from [[table salt]].]]

'''Curing''' is any of various [[food preservation]] and [[seasoning|flavor]]ing processes of foods such as [[meat]], [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[vegetable]]s, by the addition of combinations of [[edible salt|salt]], [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]s,&lt;ref name="uog"&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html "Historical Origins of Food Preservation."] [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp University of Georgia, National Center for Home Food Preservation]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sugar]], with the aim of drawing moisture out of the food by the process of [[osmosis]]. Many curing processes also involve [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], spicing, or [[cooking]]. [[Drying (food)|Dehydration]] was the earliest form of food curing.&lt;ref name="uog"/&gt; Because curing increases the solute concentration in the food and hence decreases its [[water potential]], the food becomes inhospitable for the microbe growth that causes food spoilage. Curing can be traced back to antiquity, and was the primary way of preserving meat and fish until the late 19th century.

Nitrates and nitrites, in conjunction with salt, are the most common agents in curing meat, because they further inhibit the growth of ''[[Clostridium botulinum]].'' This combination of table salt with nitrates or nitrites is called [[curing salt]] and is often dyed pink to distinguish it from table salt.&lt;ref name="Bitterman"&gt;{{cite book | page = 187 | chapter = Salt Reference Guide | chapterurl = https://books.google.ca/books?id=8IAvgHk5SV4C&amp;pg=PA187  | last = Bitterman | first = M. | title = Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, with Recipes | publisher = Random House | year = 2010 | isbn = 1580082629 | accessdate = 2013-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither table salt, nor any of the nitrites or nitrates commonly used in curing (e.g. [[sodium nitrate]],&lt;ref name="Gisslen2006"&gt;{{cite book | first = W. | last = Gisslen | title = Professional Cooking, College Version | chapter = Sausages and Cured Foods  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=hxcH5o9QeywC&amp;pg=PA827 | page = 827 | year = 2006 | location = Hoboken, NJ | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn = 9780471663744 | accessdate = 2013-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sodium nitrite]],&lt;ref name="Gisslen2006"/&gt; and [[potassium nitrate]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031223155710/http://www.uwex.edu/ces/flp/meatscience/sausage.html "Meat Science"], University of Wisconsin. uwex.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;) is naturally pink.

'''Meat preservation''' in general (of meat from [[livestock]], [[game (food)|game]], and [[poultry]]) is the set of all treatment processes for preserving the properties, taste, texture, and color of raw, partially cooked, or cooked [[meats]] while keeping them edible and safe to consume. Curing has been the dominant method of meat preservation for thousands of years, although modern developments like [[refrigeration]] and synthetic [[preservative]]s are now beginning to complement and supplant it.

While meat preservation processes like curing were mainly developed in order to prevent [[disease]] and increase [[food security]], the advent of modern preservation methods mean that in most [[developed countries]] today, curing is instead mainly practised for its cultural value and desirable impact on the texture and taste of food. For [[Developing country|lesser-developed countries]], curing remains a key process in ensuring the viability of meat production, transport and access.

== Necessity of curing ==
Untreated meat decomposes rapidly if it is not preserved, at a speed that depends on several factors, including ambient [[humidity]], temperature, and the presence of [[pathogen]]s. Most meats cannot be kept at room temperature in excess of a few days without spoiling.

If kept in excess of this time, meat begins to change color and exude a foul odor, indicating the decomposition of the food. Ingestion of such spoiled meat can cause serious food poisonings, like [[botulism]].

While the short shelf life of fresh meat does not pose a significant problem when access to it is easy and supply is abundant, in times of scarcity and famine, or when the meat must be carried over long voyages, it spoils very quickly. In such circumstances the usefulness of preserving foods containing nutritional value for transport and storage is obvious.

Curing can significantly extend the life of meat before it spoils, by making it inhospitable to the growth of spoilage microbes.

== History ==
A survival technique since [[prehistory]], the preservation of meat has become, over the centuries, a topic of political, economic, and social importance worldwide.

=== Traditional methods ===

[[Vase]] v.&amp;nbsp;360-340 BC, [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]]]

Food curing dates back to ancient times, both in the form of [[smoked meat]] and [[salt-cured meat]].&lt;ref name="ANSI-3994"&gt;{{cite report|last=Ray|first=Frederick K.|title=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2055/ANSI-3994web.pdf|accessdate=15 December 2010|publisher=Oklahoma State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources describe the salting of meat in the ancient Mediterranean world. [[Diodore of Sicily]] in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' wrote that the Cosséens&lt;ref&gt;A nomadic shepherd people, considered by classical authors to be made up of warriors'' et de brigands'', was the object of a victorious campaign by [[Alexander the Great]] in the fourth century. Cf. Pierre Briant, ''État et pasteurs au Moyen-Orient ancien'', Cambridge and Paris, 1982 ([http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/befeo_0336-1519_1984_num_73_1_1647 compte rendu]).&lt;/ref&gt; in the mountains of [[Persia]] salted the flesh of carnivorous animals.&lt;ref&gt;Diodore de Sicile, ''Bibliothèque historique'', XIX, 19 cité par Koehler, 1832, p.&amp;nbsp;432, note 724 (p.&amp;nbsp;486).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] indicates that people at [[Borsippa]] were catching [[bats]] and salting them to eat.&lt;ref&gt;Strabon, ''Géographie'', XVI, 1.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks prepared ''tarichos'' ({{Lang|grc|τάριχος}}), which was meat and fish conserved by salt or other means.{{efn|1= In time the original term came to mean salted fish only, whereas salted meat was called ''kreas tarichrou'' ({{Lang|grc|κρέας ταριχηρὸν}}), according to [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]] in his ''Deipnosophistae'', IV, 14.137f ([http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/athenee/livre4.htm#137f en ligne])}} The Romans called this dish ''{{Lang|la|salsamentum}}'' – which term later included salted fat, the sauces and spices used for its preparation.&lt;ref name = Koehler&gt;{{fr icon}} M. Koehler, ''Tarichos ou recherches sur l’histoire et les antiquités des pêcheries de la Russie méridionale'', in ''Mémoires de l’Académie impériale des sciences de Saint-Pétersbourg'', 6th series, book I, Imp. of the Académie impériale des sciences, Saint Petersburg, 1832, p.&amp;nbsp;347 à 490 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=zH0-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false en ligne]).&lt;/ref&gt;
Also evidence of ancient [[sausage]] production exists. The Roman gourmet [[Marcus Gavius Apicius|Apicius]] speaks of a sausage-making technique involving ''{{Lang|grc|œnogaros}}'' (a mixture of the fermented fish sauce {{Lang|la|[[garum]]}} with oil or wine).&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} Apicii Coelii, ''{{Lang|la|De opsoniis et condimentis, sive arte coquinaria, libri decem. Cum annotationibus Martini Lister}}'', Londres, 1705, livre II, ch. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; Preserved meats were furthermore a part of religious traditions: resulting meat for offerings to the gods was salted before being given to priests, after which it could be picked up again by the offerer, or even sold in the [[butcher]]'s.&lt;ref name = Koehler/&gt;

A trade in salt meat occurred across ancient Europe. In [[Polybius]]'s time,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Joaquim Marquardt, ''La Vie privée des romains'', 2, dans ''Manuel des antiquités romaines'', 15, sous la dir. de Theodor Mommsen, Paris, 1893 [1874-1875], p.&amp;nbsp;52-56 et part. p.&amp;nbsp;54 ([https://archive.org/stream/manueldesantiqui15mommuoft#page/54/mode/1up en ligne]).&lt;/ref&gt; the Gauls exported [[salt pork]] each year to Rome in large quantities, where it was sold in different cuts: rear cuts, middle cuts, hams, and sausages. This meat, after having been salted with the greatest care, was sometime smoked. These goods had to have been considerably important, since they fed part of the Roman people and the armies. The [[Belgae]] were celebrated above all for the care which they gave to the fattening of their pigs. Their herds of sheep and pigs were so many, they could provide skins and salt meat not only for Rome, but also for most of Italy.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The Ceretani of [[Spain]] drew a large export income from their hams, which were so succulent, they were in no way inferior to those of [[Cantabria]]. These ''{{Lang|grc|tarichos}}'' of pig would become especially sought, to the point that the ancients considered this meat the most nourishing of all and the easiest to digest.&lt;ref name = Koehler/&gt;

In [[Ethiopia]], according to Pliny,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Histoire naturelle'', VI, 35.17&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Libya]] according to [[Saint Jerome]], the Acridophages (literally, the locust-eaters) salted and smoked the [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]] which arrived at their settlements in the spring in great swarms and which constituted, it was said, their sole food.

The smoking of meat was a traditional practice in North America, where [[Plains Indians]] hung their meat at the top of their tipis to increase the amount of smoke coming into contact with the food.&lt;ref name=ANSI-3994 /&gt;

===Middle Ages ===
In Europe, medieval cuisine made great use of meat and vegetables, and the guild of butchers was amongst the most powerful. During the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;En [[Normandy|Normandie]] par example : Léopold Delisle, ''Études historiques et archéologiques en province depuis 1848'' cité dans la ''Revue des deux mondes'', XI (XXI&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; année), Paris, 1851, p.&amp;nbsp;1048.&lt;/ref&gt; salt beef was consumed by all social classes. Smoked meat was called ''carbouclée'' in Romance tongues&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Baptiste-Bonaventure de Roquefort]], ''Supplément au glossaire de la langue romane'', Chasseriau et Hécart, Paris, 1820, 308 pages&lt;/ref&gt; and ''bacon'' if it was pork.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baptiste Bonaventure de Roquefort, ''Glossaire de la langue romane'', T. I, B. Warée, Paris, 1808, 772 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Ages made pâté a masterpiece: that which is, in the 21st century, merely spiced minced meat (or fish), baked in a terrine and eaten cold, was at that time composed of a dough envelope stuffed with varied meats and superbly decorated for ceremonial feasts. The first French recipe, written in verse by [[Gace de La Bigne]], mentions in the same pâté three great partridges, six fat quail, and a dozen larks. ''[[Le Ménagier de Paris]]'' mentions pâtés of fish, game, young rabbit, fresh venison, beef, pigeons, mutton, veal, and pork, and even pâtés of lark, turtledove, cow, baby bird, goose, and hen. [[Bartolomeo Sacchi]], called Platine, prefect of the [[Vatican Library]], gives the recipe for a pâté of wild beasts: the flesh, after being boiled with salt and vinegar, was larded and placed inside an envelope of spiced fat, with a ''mélange'' of pepper, cinnamon and pounded lard; one studded the fat with cloves until it was entirely covered, then placed it inside a pâte.

In the 16th century, the most fashionable pâtés were of woodcock, au bec doré, chapon, beef tongue, cow feet, sheep feet, chicken, veal, and venison.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lacroix et Ferdinand Séré, ''Le Moyen Âge et la Renaissance, histoire et description des mœurs et usages, du commerce et de l’industrie, des sciences, des arts, des littératures et des beaux-arts en Europe'', T. I, ch. ''Nourriture et cuisine'', Paris, 1848, not paginated.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same era, [[Pierre Belon]] notes that the inhabitants of [[Crete]] and [[Chios]] lightly salted then oven-dried entire hares, sheep, and roe deer cut into pieces, and that in [[Turkey]], cattle and sheep, cut and minced rouelles, salted then dried, were eaten on voyages with onions and no other preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Belon, ''Voyage au Levant, les observations de Pierre Belon du Mans, de plusieurs singularités et choses mémorables, trouvées en Grèce, Turquie, Judée, Égypte, Arabie et autres pays estranges'', 1553.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern era ===
[[File:Civil War rations.jpg|thumb|alt=Derrière une grille de métal, des barils sont couchés, empilés en trois étages et cette pyramide se termine par des tonneaux de bœuf salé.|Barrels of salt beef in a reconstruction of an American Civil War stockpile, at [[Fort Macon State Park]], [[North Carolina]]]]

During the [[Age of Discovery]], salt meat was one of the main foods for sailors on long voyages, for instance in the [[merchant marine]] or the [[navy]]. In the 18th century, salted Irish beef, transported in barrels, was considered finest.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Gilles et [[Guy Pessiot]], ''Voiles en Seine 99. L’armada du siècle'', Ptc, 1999, {{ISBN|2906258547}}, p.&amp;nbsp;110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific research on meat by chemists and pharmacists led to the creation of a new, extremely practical product: meat extract, which could appear in different forms. The need to properly feed soldiers during long campaigns outside the country, such as the Napoleonic Wars, and to nourish a constantly growing population often living in appalling conditions drove scientific research, but  a confectioner, [[Nicolas Appert]], in 1795 developed through experimentation a method which would become universal and in one language bears his name: airtight storage, called ''{{lang|fr|appertisation}}'' in French.

With the spread of ''appertisation'', the 19th-century world entered the era of the "[[food industry]]", which developed new products such as canned salt meat (for example [[corned beef]]), but also led to lowered standards of food quality and hygiene{{dubious|date=April 2017}} – such as those [[Upton Sinclair]] described in ''[[The Jungle]]''. These bad practices led to the creation of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906, followed by the national agencies for health security and the establishment of [[food traceability]] over the course of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It also led to continuing technological innovation.

In [[France]], the summer of 1857 was so hot that most butchers refused to slaughter animals and charcutiers lost considerable amounts of meat, due to inadequate conservation methods. A member of the Academy of Medicine and his son issued a 34-page summary of works printed between 1663 and 1857, which proposed some solutions: not less than 91 texts exist, of which 64 edited for only the years between 1851 and 1857.&lt;ref name="Chevallier"&gt;{{fr icon}} A. Chevallier père et fils, ''Recherches chronologiques sur les moyens appliqués à la conservation des substances alimentaires de nature animale et de nature végétale'', in ''Annales d’hygiène publique et de médecine légale'', 2nd series, T. VIII, J.-B. Baillière et fils, Paris, 1857, 480 pages, p.&amp;nbsp;291 – 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salt ===
{{Main article|Salting (food)}}
Salt ([[sodium chloride]]) is the primary ingredient used in meat curing.&lt;ref name=ANSI-3994 /&gt; Removal of water and addition of salt to meat creates a [[solvent|solute]]-rich environment where [[osmotic pressure]] draws water out of microorganisms, slowing down their growth.&lt;ref name=ANSI-3994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="mnstate-notes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curing and Brining (food preservation)|url=http://www.mnstate.edu/provost/BCBT100%20Curing%20and%20Brining.pdf|work=Science of Cooking|publisher=Minnesota State University|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doing this requires a concentration of salt of nearly 20%.&lt;ref name="mnstate-notes" /&gt; In addition, salt causes the soluble proteins to come to the surface of the meat that was used to make the sausages.  These [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]]s coagulate when the sausage is heated, helping to hold the sausage together.&lt;ref name="uga-sausage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curing &amp; Smoking|url=http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/how/cure_smoke/sausage_ingredients.html|work=National Center for Home Food Preservation|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sugar ===
The [[sugar]] added to meat for the purpose of curing it comes in many forms, including [[honey]], [[corn syrup]] solids, and [[maple syrup]].&lt;ref name="IL-state-additives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Additives Used in Meat|url=http://labs.ansci.illinois.edu/meatscience/Library/additives.htm|work=Meat Science|publisher=Illinois State University|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the exception of bacon, it does not contribute much to the flavor,&lt;ref name="uga-smoke-cure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoking and Curing|url=http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/lit_rev/cure_smoke_cure.html|work=The National Center for Home Food Preservation|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it does alleviate the harsh flavor of the salt.&lt;ref name=ANSI-3994 /&gt; Sugar also contributes to the growth of beneficial bacteria such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' by feeding them.&lt;ref name="edinformatics"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Curing?|url=http://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/science_of_cooking/curing_foods.htm|work=Science of Cooking|publisher=EDinformatics|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrates and nitrites ===
[[File:Nitrosyl-Heme.png|thumb|Nitrosyl-heme]]
Nitrates and nitrites not only help kill bacteria, but also produce a characteristic flavor and give meat a pink or red color.&lt;ref name="Edinformatics" /&gt; Nitrite ({{chem|N|O|2|-}}) is generally supplied by [[sodium nitrite]] or (indirectly) by [[potassium nitrate]]. Nitrite salts are most often used in curing. Nitrate is specifically used only in a few curing conditions and products where nitrite (which may be generated from nitrate) must be generated in the product over long periods of time.

Nitrite further breaks down in the meat into [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which then binds to the iron atom in the center of [[myoglobin|myoglobin's]] [[heme]] group, reducing oxidation and causing a reddish-brown color (nitrosomyoglobin) when raw and the characteristic cooked-ham pink color (nitrosohemochrome or nitrosyl-heme) when cooked. The addition of ascorbate to cured meat reduces formation of [[nitrosamine]]s (see below), but increases the [[nitrosyl]]ation of iron.

The use of nitrite and nitrate salts for meat in the US has been formally used since 1925.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Because of the relatively high toxicity of nitrite (the lethal dose in humans is about 22&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of body weight), the maximum allowed nitrite concentration in meat products is 200 [[parts per million|ppm]]. Plasma nitrite is reduced in persons with [[endothelial dysfunction]].&lt;ref name="pmid16413411"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kleinbongard P, Dejam A, Lauer T, Jax T, Kerber S, Gharini P, Balzer J, Zotz RB, Scharf RE, Willers R, Schechter AN, Feelisch M, Kelm M | title=Plasma nitrite concentrations reflect the degree of endothelial dysfunction in humans | journal= [[Free Radical Biology and Medicine]] | volume=40 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=295–302 | pmid=16413411 | doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.08.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of nitrites in food preservation is controversial due to the potential for the formation of [[nitrosamines]] when nitrites are present in high concentrations and the product is cooked at high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Edinformatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/science_of_cooking/curing_foods.htm|title=Curing Food|publisher=Edinformatics|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is seen for red or processed meat, but not for white meat or fish.&lt;ref name="pmid17956350"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kuhnle GG, Bingham SA | title=Dietary meat, endogenous nitrosation and colorectal cancer | journal=[[Biochemical Society Transactions]] | volume=35 | issue=Pt&amp;nbsp;5 | pages=1355–1357 | year=2007 | url = http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/035/1355/bst0351355.htm | pmid=17956350 | doi=10.1042/BST0351355| last2=Bingham }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12421881"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bingham SA, Hughes R, Cross AJ | title=Effect of white versus red meat on endogenous N-nitrosation in the human colon and further evidence of a dose response | journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] | volume=132 | issue=11&amp;nbsp;Suppl | pages=3522S–3525S | year=2002 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/11/3522S.long | id= | pmid=12421881| last2=Hughes | last3=Cross }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrates and nitrites may cause cancer and the production of carcinogenic nitrosamines can be potently inhibited by the use of the antioxidants [[Vitamin C]] and the [[alpha-tocopherol]] form of [[Vitamin E]] during curing.&lt;ref name="pmid22464105"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Parthasarathy DK1, Bryan NS | title=Sodium nitrite: the "cure" for nitric oxide insufficiency | journal=Meat Science | volume=92 | issue=3 | pages=274–279 | year=2004 |doi = 10.1016/j.meatsci.2012.03.001  | id= | pmid=22464105| last2=Bryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under simulated gastric conditions, [[S-Nitrosothiol|nitrosothiols]] rather than nitrosamines are the main [[nitroso]] species being formed.&lt;ref name="pmid17956350" /&gt; The use of either compound is therefore regulated; for example, in the United States, the concentration of nitrates and nitrites is generally limited to 200 ppm or lower.&lt;ref name="Edinformatics" /&gt; While the meat industry considers them irreplaceable because of their low cost and efficacy at maintaining color, botulism is an extremely rare disease (less than 1000 cases reported worldwide per year), and almost always associated with home preparations of food storing.&lt;ref name= “Botulism”&gt; {{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/index.html | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while the FDA has set a limit of 200 ppm of nitrates for cured meat, they are not allowed and not recognized as safe in most other foods, even foods that are not cooked at high temperatures, such as cheese.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_10.html | publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration | accessdate=30 September 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Processed meats without "added nitrites" may be misleading as they may be using naturally occurring nitrites from celery instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Choi |first1=Candice |title=Experts say hot dogs minus artificial nitrites may be no better |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/science/ct-hot-dogs-nitrites-20170630-story.html |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smoke ===
{{Main|Smoking (cooking)}}
Meat can also be preserved by "smoking". If the smoke is hot enough to slow-cook the meat, this will also keep it tender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoking Meat and Poultry|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Smoking_Meat_and_Poultry/index.asp|work=Fact Sheets|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One method of smoking calls for a [[smokehouse]] with damp wood chips or [[sawdust]].&lt;ref name=wsu-smoke&gt;{{cite web|last=Busboom|first=Jan R.|title=Curing and Smoking Poultry Meat|url=http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/eb1660/eb1660.pdf|publisher=Washington State University|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[North America]], [[hardwoods]] such as [[hickory]], [[mesquite]], and [[maple]] are commonly used for smoking, as are the wood from fruit trees such as [[apple]], [[cherry]], and [[plum]], and even [[corncob]]s.

Smoking helps seal the outer layer of the food being cured, making it more difficult for [[bacteria]] to enter. It can be done in combination with other curing methods such as salting. Common smoking styles include hot smoking, smoke roasting (pit barbecuing) and cold smoking.  Smoke roasting and hot smoking cook the meat while cold smoking does not. If the meat is cold smoked, it should be dried quickly to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. This can be achieved, as with [[jerky]], by slicing the meat thinly.

The smoking of food directly with wood smoke is known to contaminate the food with carcinogenic [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7447916 Fritz W, et.al.: Smoked food and cancer] US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect of meat preservation ==
=== On health ===
Since the 20th century, with respect to the relationship between diet and human disease (e.g. cardiovascular, etc.), scientists have conducted studies on the effects of [[lipolysis]] on vacuum-packed or frozen meat. In particular, by analyzing [[entrecôte]]s of frozen beef during 270 days at {{convert|-20|°C}}, scientists found an important [[phospholipase]] that accompanies the loss of some [[unsaturated fat]] n-3 and n-6, which are already low in the flesh of [[ruminant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} D. Bauchard, E. Thomas, V. Scislowski, A. Peyron et D. Durand, ''Effets des modes de conservation de la viande bovine sur les lipides et leur contenu en acides gras polyinsaturés''. [http://www.office-elevage.fr/vpc/11jsmtv/11JSMTV-N-POS10.pdf Document en ligne sur le wite www.office-elevage.fr].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] classified processed meat, that is, meat that has undergone salting, curing, fermenting, or smoking, as "[[carcinogenic]] to humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/news/world-health-organization-says-processed-meat-causes-cancer|title=World Health Organization Says Processed Meat Causes Cancer|author= Stacy Simon |work=Cancer.org |date= October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34615621 |title = Processed meats do cause cancer - WHO|author= James Gallagher|work= BBC |date=26 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr240_E.pdf| title=IARC Monographs evaluate consumption of red meat and processed meat |work= International Agency for Research on Cancer |date= 26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On trade ===
The improvement of methods of meat preservation, and of the means of transport of preserved products, has notably permitted the separation of areas of production and areas of consumption, which can now be distant without it posing a problem, permitting the exportation of meats.

For example, the appearance in the 1980s of preservation techniques under [[controlled atmosphere]] sparked a small revolution in the world's market for sheep meat: the lamb of [[New Zealand]], one of the world's largest exporters of lamb, could henceforth be sold as fresh meat, since it could be preserved from 12 to 16 weeks, which would be a sufficient duration for it to reach Europe by boat. Before, meat from New Zealand was frozen, thus had a much lower value on European shelves. With the arrival of the new "chilled" meats, New Zealand could compete even more strongly with local producers of fresh meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ficow.be/ficow.site/wp-content/Uploads/Mar2.pdf | title=Les marchés à l’importation | year=2004 | accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of controlled atmosphere to avoid the depreciation which affects frozen meat is equally useful in other meat markets, such as that for pork, which now also enjoys an international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Exportations françaises de viande de porc et stratégies des opérateurs nationaux | author=Yves Prégaro | publisher=Journées de la recherche porcine | volume=35  | pages=217–222 | editor=OFIVAL | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dragonseeds''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Dragon Seeds: Saishuu Shinka Keitai'''''|ドラゴンシーズ ～最終進化形態～}}, is a video game where the player must clone a dragon and train it to fight. The player gets to choose from five basic dragon types and two secret dragons. The game also allows the player to receive extra dragons through the saves files of certain games, if the memory card is placed at the second slot. The game also allows a two player mode, where each player can battle each other with their own dragons.

==Gameplay==
The whole point of the game is to raise a dragon and have it participate in battle.  After acquiring high enough stats the dragons evolve into more powerful forms. There are three elemental types in the game: Fire, aqua, and storm. Fire being basic flame control, Aqua referring to water or ice ability, and Storm refers to electrical powers. Each dragon has an element it is born with, and each species of dragon has certain limitations on how many elements it can be. The elements work in a rock, paper, scissors way of play: Fire being strong against storm, but being weak to water. Storm being strong against water, but weak to fire. Water being strong against fire, but being weak to storm.
The goal of the game is to raise a dragon to compete in the Arena with the aim of being the best dragonsage in the land. The higher the rank, the tougher the competition and the more prize money involved. The player can move around the map as needed, but the entirety of the game takes place within a single city. 
The game supports two player combat as well, with two modes, regular and quick battle. Quick battle allows for pre-registered dragons to be used as opposed to having to raise your own and is comparable to the Battle Now mode of [[Pokémon Colosseum]].
 
'''Battle'''

The battles of Dragon Seeds are fought in traditional 1 vs 1 matches, on a semi rotating screen between the player and the challenger's dragons. The battle is fought in turn-based rock, paper, scissors rotations with a timer that counts down during each player's phase of action. The player can command the dragon to either move forward, backward, use a physical or magical attack, defend, or taunt. The player must equip the dragon with a weapon and shield, called a reflector, for the dragon to be able to enter combat. In battle, there are 3 main positions in which the dragon can be in: Close, Mid, and Far range. Each dragon can be at max 2 ranges apart from their opponent. Only at close range can a dragon successfully perform a physical attack. At mid and far ranges, the dragon can perform magical attacks attuned with their element, or taunt. The player must choose correct judgment and a bit of luck to win battles successfully.

During battle, if the player anticipates defeat, they have the option to forfeit the match. Forfeiting will cause the player to lose, but will spare their dragon's life. If the dragon's HP reaches 0, it has the possibility of dying. If the player's dragon dies during a battle it will be lost permanently, however if its DNA cell it was last in is empty it might still have the DNA remnants in it and there is a chance it can be re-synthesized to the last point it was in the cell, but it loses the weapons it had.

'''Types'''

There are 6 different types of dragons: Saurian, Winged, Beetle, Crustacean, Wasp, and Natura, plus two, Spirit and Evil, which are secret and are unlocked after fulfilling special conditions. Out of these types, there are three flavors of dragon per type; called Normal, Super and Mutant, with different appearances. For example, the Saurian dragons can come in either Red or Blue coloration with slightly different spike orientation. Their evolutions are also affected by which flavor the player receives.   
*The Saurian type dragons are dinosaur like dragons which are bipedal and evolve into more fierce looking versions of themselves, gaining spikes and size. Saurian dragons are able to be in all 3 of the element types.
*The Winged Dragons are the most reminiscent of true dragons in the game. They are, as their name states, dragons with wings. They are always in the air until they die. One version of the Winged Dragon has only one eye, like a cyclops. Their evolutions are slightly bigger versions with immense wings. Some resemble birds more than reptiles. They are not limited to any elements, they can become all three.
*The Beetle dragons are shaped nothing like mythical dragons but are described as "myriopods". They have 4-6 legs they stand on and use two to wield their weapon and reflector. Their evolutions are bigger, more armored versions of themselves. They are limited to Fire and Storm elements.
*The Crustacean Dragons also do not look like reptilian dragons, but have the front part of a crab as their head/body including claws and their legs are composed of small legs in a circle that undulate in and out as it moves and/or stands. Their evolutions are taller and fiercer versions of themselves. Their elements are limited to Aqua.
*The Wasp dragon is shaped like a slightly advanced bee, with a more defined separation between the thorax and abdomen. They are continuously flying and hold their weapon and reflector in two of their six legs. Their evolutions are fiercer versions of themselves. They only come in aqua and storm elements.
*Natura dragons are a statuesque type, resembling humanoid robots with a huge oval for a torso. Some varieties have one eye. Their evolutions are bulkier versions of themselves. They only come in Storm elements, like robots.
*Spirit dragons are often humanoid, but having heads or tails of animals. They usually have two arms and always are floating in midair.
*Evil dragons are possibly the furthest depiction from a traditional dragon. They are usually living doors or gateways, such as wooden doors and coffins with arms. They float in midair and evolve into larger, more elaborate objects.

''' Synthesis and evolution'''

Dragons are made by DNA synthesis in a genetics lab. This is done by choosing a dragon type and then combining given phrases to specify the element/stats. Certain phrases give more power than others, or rather produce more specialized effects. They can also determine what flavor of dragon type the player receives. 
There are four evolutions generally, from Baby, to Adult, Senior, then Old. The dragon will cocoon itself for a small amount of time when undergoing each transformation. However, each type of dragon also has the potential to undergo a fifth evolution to become a "mutant dragon" which is uber but will die in a short while or the ultimate legendary sixth evolution to a "super dragon", which is described as a status where the dragon becomes immortal, and ceases to age. Dragons of this caliber are far from their traditional forms, mostly resembling humanoid spirits. They are encountered in the game's top tier battles.
As a bonus, the game allows for memory card synthesis of dragons. If the player has another memory card inserted into the second slot with save data from certain PlayStation games (such as ''Tekken 3'', ''Croc'', or ''Crash Bandicoot 2'') they can then enter a corresponding code in game to receive a special dragon.

== Story ==
The Story begins in an unknown world (supposedly Earth) where scientists have discovered an unknown remnant of DNA with no classification. Several years later they identify it and call it a "dragon". Soon after, an entire dragon is successfully cloned from the remnant. Dragons are mass-produced via cloning labs, and dragon sparring has become a popular sport. The player is shown a picture of Warm City, the player's new home, and has supposedly come to this city to make a name for themselves in the sport of dragon battling.

When the player starts the game, they are introduced to the battle system via a story relevant tutorial. The player receives a saurian dragon pre-equipped with a weapon and a reflector. A powerful dragonsage comes by and shows the player character his dragon and asks to spar. He doesn't take no for an answer. It is impossible to defeat this dragon and as a result the player's dragon dies. You can then go to the Cloning Lab and are able to raise as many dragons as you want. The goal of the game is to win in tournaments and get up to the highest rank to defeat the man who first defeated you. Winning in tournaments gives the player money, prestige, and access to better equipment as well. Inside this world, there is an in-game clock and calendar that changes with time passed in the various locations on the map. The day begins at 6 AM and ends at 9 PM, when the player is assumed to sleep. Shops and tourneys close at certain times of the day, so there is a limit on how much the player can accomplish in one day. Tourneys end at 3 PM, and each tourney depending on the rank challenged could take up at least 3 hours of in game time. The player can also choose to speed up time by choosing to sleep at their apartment for a number of hours or a day. There are a few major areas in the city in which the player has access to, each with a notable NPC. They include the cloning lab, an apartment for item and money storage, a weapon/shield shop, the official arena, the junk shop for discount/rare weapons, the sanctuary for capturing/releasing dragons, a training area, and an unofficial arena for battling.

{{Politics}}
'''Emergent democracy''' refers to the rise of political structures and behaviors without [[economic planning|central planning]] and by the action of many individual participants, especially when mediated by the Internet. More recently, [[Clay Shirky]] has referred to this as "[[Here Comes Everybody|the power of organizing without organizations]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Shirky
  | first = Clay

  | publisher = The Penguin Press HC
  | page= Subtitle
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 1-59420-153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined to stand in contrast to more traditional forms of democracy, such as [[representational democracy]] and [[direct democracy]]. The phrase draws upon [[emergence]] theory for the idea that the simple actions of individuals can collectively create complex and unpredictable results, as when the behavior of [[termites]] results in large, efficient nests beyond the comprehension of any individual participant.

In the paper that first drew attention to the term,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=2003-02-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joi Ito]] expresses a hope that the [[Internet]], as a large and decentralized network, will enable innovative responses by citizens to highly complex problems. From its outset, emergent democracy has been seen arising most clearly among bloggers who, as a decentralized network of writers, can provide a fuller airing and development of ideas than can the relatively limited resources of traditional media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The canonical example of emergent democracy was the December 2002 resignation of [[Trent Lott]] as [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[majority leader]] after bloggers publicized his praising of [[Strom Thurmond]]'s 1948 [[Racial segregation|segregation]]ist campaign for the [[President of the United States|presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillmor, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, pp. 61–66&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Ito had been vocal about issues with Japanese democracy, and had spoken at Davos about how broken he felt Japanese democracy was. "Afterwards, Ms. Ogata, the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me that I should stop ranting as a Japanese and think more about global democracy and global issues," he posted. "These words stuck with me and last year I tried to think about blogs and emergent democracy outside of the Japanese context." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He organized a group effort to discuss and document the emergent democracy concept, using a term initially coined by [[Ross Mayfield]]. He announced meetings on his weblog, inviting his readers to attend a [[conference call]] that was augmented by [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chat for posting realtime visual cues and backchannel conversation, and a [[wiki]] for gathering notes from the call. This "multimodal" approach was called a "happening" by Ross Mayfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation resulted in Ito's online article that generated discussions about the potential for weblogs and other [[social software]] tools to influence participation in governance. The discussion and notes were captured in a paper that was placed on a wiki for collaborative editing and enhancement. [[Jon Lebkowsky]] edited the wiki version, and published it as a chapter in the 2005 book ''Extreme Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although their life together seems great, they quickly find themselves falling into a routine, as they eat the same things every week and take the same vacation to their lake house every year. Although June is clearly restless, Oscar appears satisfied with their life together. When June recommends shaking things up by going skiing instead of taking their typical lake house vacation, Oscar is reluctant, but he agrees to go along. The trip is more difficult than June imagined, as they have difficulty renting skis and scheduling a skiing lesson. Although Oscar encourages June to take one last trip down the mountain, she elects to spend the rest of the trip at the lodge. While June sits at the bar, Oscar skis down the mountain, where he crashes into a tree and is killed.

Oscar greets June in the afterlife, a small community known as Riverside. Oscar is excited to see her and continue their life together, as he had been waiting there ever since his death. Oscar tries to explain the afterlife, as the people there are referred to as "Formers", and they are able to see people still existing in the real world, referred to as "Currents", who cannot see Formers. The only thing keeping Formers from moving away from Riverside is a fountain in the center of the community. The further away from the fountain that a Former moves, the weaker they feel, which prevents people from leaving Riverside. Oscar also reveals that their lake house is somehow present in Riverside. However, when they go there, a family of Currents is living there&amp;mdash;June having sold the lake house after Oscar's death. Oscar enlists the help of another Former, Mark ([[Noah Robbins]]), to haunt the family so that they can get the lake house back. Although Mark teaches Oscar and June how to affect the real world by channeling their anger into the tips of their fingers, only June is successful in making anything happen. Despite their efforts, the family is not sufficiently spooked, and they decide to give up on the endeavor when June tells Oscar that she wants to give up the lake house, since she felt it was a symbol of the bad routine they had fallen into before their deaths.

Once again, June begins to feel restless, while Oscar seems content with their new life. One day, Mark comes to them to tell them about a new person showing up in the neighborhood. Oscar and June try to welcome their new neighbor, Kase ([[Catherine Keener]]), but she is resistant to their friendly overtures. They continue their attempts to make friends with Kase, but she continues to shut them out, while making mysterious sounds within her house. Eventually, June decides to break into Kase's house to see what she is doing. Kase confronts her for this intrusion and invites her over. Kase shows June that she has been repeatedly trying to destroy a piece of furniture in her house, which keeps miraculously rebuilding itself. Kase invites June to help her burn the furniture, in one last attempt, but this too fails. Clearly changed by the encounter, June returns to her own house and tries to burn a chair in the yard.

Oscar and June continue their routine to the increasing annoyance of June. Eventually, they get in a fight over the correct way to load the dishwasher, and they both leave the house mad at one another. June meets up with Kase, who invites her to take a walk outside of Riverside. As they get further from the fountain, they both start to feel weak. Kase takes her to a convenience store, and inside, she places her hands on the cashier. To June's amazement, the man begins to feel tired, and Kase is suddenly rejuvenated. After June does the same thing, the two women appear to be free from the weakening affect of being away from the fountain. When they decide to return to Riverside, they are confronted by a mysterious man who invites them to come to Oceanside. Although Kase immediately wants to go, June doesn't want to abandon Oscar, and they both return to Riverside. Meanwhile, Oscar meets up with Mark, and helps him ask out a woman that he had a crush on when he was alive. Oscar helps Mark prepare for his date with Heather, but while the date goes well, Heather explains that she is waiting for her husband to join her, as she had died of lung cancer before him. When Oscar and June meet back up, they resume their fight, with June voicing her fears that their routine will never change, while Oscar explains that the likes the routine and wants it to continue. Angry with one another, their disagreement remains unresolved.

At an open house, Andre, a junior realtor shows up to view the house for his client. He meets Sarah, another junior realtor, who is trying to sell the house, which happens to be adjacent to Riverside. The two instantly hit it off, and with no one coming to see the house, they grow closer over a bottle of wine. Eventually, they kiss, but Sarah pulls out of it, as she is recently engaged. Andre, regretful, leaves the house, but Sarah watches, clearly disappointed to see him leave. Years later, their roles are reversed, as Sarah attends an open house being held by Andre. In the intervening years, they have both gotten married and have moved forward in their careers. Once again, the two bond over a bottle of wine, as they take advantage of the sparsely attended open house. Sarah admits to Andre that she does not have a client, and only came to see him. They sleep together in the house, but neither are willing to blow up their lives to continue seeing one another. After another time jump, Andre and Sarah are continuing their affair, using an unpurchased house to simulate a life together. After eating dinner, they both agree to tell their spouses about the affair so that they can be together. However, after one final time jump, Andre is now old, attending an open house being run by Sarah's real estate company. However, when Andre asks about Sarah, he is informed by the realtor that she had died of cancer some months earlier. As Andre talks to himself, realizing that he missed his chance, he is watched by an invisible June. Affected by Andre's regret, she returns to Kase's and tells her that she is ready to travel to Oceanside.

Oscar wakes up to find a letter from June, telling him that she is leaving him to explore the afterlife with Kase. Oscar meets with Mark and tells him about June. Although Oscar claims to be okay, he slowly shows signs of frustration with June's departure. Mark takes him to meet with Josiah, a young boy who might be able to tell them where June went. Josiah tells them about Oceanside, and Oscar resolves to go there to find June. Meanwhile, June and Kase arrive at Oceanside to discover a community of people partying in a mansion perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean. The apparent leaders, Marisol and Gregory, espouse the viewpoint of those living there, who attempt to forget their lives as "Currents" and enjoy the benefits of being dead. In a celebration of their status as Formers, the residents of Oceanside engage in impossible feats, like walking on the ocean floor and letting cars drive through their incorporeal forms. While partying at Oceanside, Oscar suddenly arrives and confronts June. He yells at her in a rage, furious at her abandonment of him. When he turns to leave, Oscar collapses, weak from being away from the fountain, and having refused to absorb energy from "Currents" like Kase and June had done.

[[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] '''Francis John William Harvey, [[Victoria Cross|VC]]''' (29 April 1873 – 31 May 1916) was an officer of the British [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine Light Infantry]] during the [[First World War]]. Harvey was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions at the height of the [[Battle of Jutland]]. A long serving Royal Marine officer descended of a military family, during his career Harvey became a specialist in [[naval artillery]], serving on many large warships as gunnery training officer and gun commander. Specially requested for {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}}, the flagship of the British [[battlecruiser]] fleet, Harvey fought at the battles of [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Heligoland Bight]], [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]].

At Jutland, Harvey, although mortally wounded by German shellfire, ordered the magazine of Q turret on the battlecruiser ''Lion'' to be flooded. This action prevented the tons of [[cordite]] stored there from catastrophically detonating in an explosion that would have destroyed the vessel and all aboard her. Although he succumbed to his injuries seconds later, his dying act may have saved over a thousand lives and prompted [[Winston Churchill]] to later comment: "In the long, rough, glorious history of the Royal Marines there is no name and no deed which in its character and consequences ranks above this".&lt;ref name="P108"/&gt;

==Gunnery expert==
Harvey was born in [[Sydenham|Upper Sydenham]], [[Kent]], the son of Commander John William Francis Harvey, [[Royal Navy|RN]] and Elizabeth Edwards Lavington Harvey ''née'' Penny. At age 11 in 1884, Harvey moved with his family to [[Southsea]] and he attended [[Portsmouth Grammar School]], achieving excellent academic results and showing proficiency in languages and debating.&lt;ref name="P106"&gt;Snelling, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;  Harvey was descended from a military family; his great-great-grandfather [[John Harvey (Royal Navy officer)|John Harvey]] had been killed in the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794 and his great-grandfather Admiral Sir [[Edward Harvey]], [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath|GCB]], RN and grandfather Captain John Harvey of the [[9th Regiment of Foot]] were also prominent military figures.&lt;ref name="P107"&gt;Snelling, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving school, Harvey chose a military career and was accepted by both the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] and the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]] for officer training. Choosing the latter school as a Royal Marines officer cadet, Harvey graduated in 1892 and the following year was made a full [[lieutenant]], joining {{HMS|Wildfire|shore establishment 1889|6}} for his first seagoing commission.&lt;ref name="LG4"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26428 |supp=y|page=4356|date=1 August 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; After just a year at sea, Harvey was back on shore attending gunnery courses at {{HMS|Excellent|shore establishment|6}}, qualifying in 1896 as an instructor first class in naval gunnery.&lt;ref name="P107"/&gt; Harvey was appointed to the [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Phaeton|1883|6}} when she was commissioned at Devonport on 8 June 1897 for service on the Pacific Station.&lt;ref name=NavyListJul98&gt;''Navy List, July 1898, corrected to 18 June 1898'', page 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, whilst on the ''Phaëton'', he was reprimanded by the [[Admiralty]] for an unfavourable report he released on [[San Diego]] Harbour. Returning home the same year, Harvey was given the position of Assistant Instructor for Gunnery at Plymouth Division. During this period, Harvey married Ethel Edye and had one son, John.&lt;ref name="P108"/&gt;

Between 1898 and 1904 Harvey spent much of his time attached to the [[Channel Fleet]], aboard {{HMS|Edgar|1890|6}} and {{HMS|Diadem|1896|6}}, practising and instructing in gunnery. On 28 January 1900 he was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=27164|page=1000| date=13 February 1900|}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he was posted aboard {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1891|6}}, the first of a string of big ship appointments teaching gunnery to the heavy units of the Channel Fleet. By 1909, Harvey had served on {{HMS|Duke of Edinburgh|1904|6}}, {{HMS|St George|1892|6}} and the new battlecruiser {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|6}}. In 1910 Harvey became Instructor of Gunnery at [[Chatham Dockyard]] and the following year was promoted to [[Major (UK)|major]],&lt;ref name="LG3"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28463 |supp=y|page=953|date=7 February 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; a report on the gunnery school commenting "Degree of efficiency in Gunnery Establishment at Chatham is very high both as regards general training and attention to detail. Great credit is due all concerned particularly to Major F.J.W. Harvey, the I of G".&lt;ref name="P107"/&gt;

The strength of this report subsequently gained Harvey a position as senior marine officer aboard {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}}, the 27,000&amp;nbsp;ton flagship of the British battlecruiser fleet. ''Lion'' had eight 13.5-inch guns and Harvey was stationed in an office under Q turret directing their operation and fire. Under her new commander, Rear-Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]], Harvey served as the senior marine officer on board into the [[First World War]], his first military campaign.&lt;ref name="P107"/&gt;

==First World War==
[[File:HMS Lion (1910).jpg|thumb|250px| The blazing HMS ''Lion'' at [[battle of Jutland|Jutland]]]]

Harvey did not have to wait long to see action, seeing combat for the first time at the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] just weeks into the war. On 28 August 1914, ''Lion'' and her squadron of {{HMS|Queen Mary}} and {{HMS|Princess Royal|1911|6}}, swept into the [[Heligoland Bight]] where German and British cruiser forces were already engaged in a bitter struggle.&lt;ref name="P131"&gt;Bennett, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; One German cruiser had already been sunk by the time Beatty's force arrived, but the German flagship {{SMS|Cöln|1909|6}} and cruiser {{SMS|Ariadne}} were surprised in the fog and destroyed by heavy calibre shells from Beatty's battlecruisers. German [[Konteradmiral]] [[Leberecht Maass]] and over 1,000 of his sailors were killed, Harvey's guns scoring several hits on the cruisers.&lt;ref name="P107"/&gt;

Six months later, Harvey's guns again caused severe damage to a German force at the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]]. Over the previous months, a German battlecruiser squadron under [[Franz von Hipper|Rear-Admiral Hipper]] had crossed the [[North Sea]] and bombarded British coastal towns on several occasions. On 24 January 1915 another attempt was made, but this time British signals analysts had detected the German movement and using this information the [[Admiralty]] dispatched Beatty's force to intercept and destroy them. Beatty and Hipper's squadrons collided at 09:00 and during the engagement that followed, ''Lion'' was left exposed by mis-communication between the ships, which led to {{HMS|Tiger|1913|6}} engaging the wrong ship, leaving {{SMS|Moltke}} uncovered and so able to fire more accurately.  The British flagship was hard pressed until one of ''Lion''{{'}}s shots penetrated one of {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}{{'}}s turrets.&lt;ref name="P108"&gt;Snelling, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; A huge explosion destroyed the neighbouring turret as well and killed 160 men, the German flagship only surviving due to the actions of sailor [[Wilhelm Heidkamp]], who wrenched open the water valves to the magazines despite them glowing red hot.&lt;ref name="P143"&gt;Bennett, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lion'' was badly damaged in the action by shells from the passing {{SMS|Derfflinger}} and with her engines failing, dropped back to engage the already sinking {{SMS|Blücher}}. Misread signals resulted in the rest of the British fleet returning to support ''Lion'' in this task, allowing the rest of the battered German fleet to retire as the British destroyed the hapless ''Blücher'' and 792 of her crew.&lt;ref name="P144"&gt;Bennett, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Following the battle, Harvey remained aboard ''Lion'' at [[Rosyth]] for the whole of 1915 and the first five months of 1916, continuing his gunnery training and preparations for major fleet action. His preparations came to fruition on the last day of May, when the British fleet sailed to engage the main body of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] at the [[Battle of Jutland]].

Just after Dogger Bank, Harvey had written to a fellow RMLI officer in {{HMS|Orion|1910|6}} describing his experiences:

{{cquote|As to the fighting in a turret, one doesn't suffer any discomfort and my chief feeling has been of 'curiosity' mixed with the idea that whoever else is coming to grief, oneself will be all right.  I am under no delusion though, that if a proj [projectile] does hit one's turret it will in all probability come right in and send one to glory.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beatty's battlecruisers led the British fleet in its attack, casting south into the North Sea to find the enemy during the afternoon of 31 May 1916. At 14:15, scouting cruisers spotted the German vanguard and Beatty closed to attack the enemy with his main force. Given time to prepare, Hipper was ready for Beatty with his battlecruisers in line to face Beatty's approaching ships with their full broadsides. Hipper was also encouraged by the main German battleship fleet under Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], which was steaming northwards close behind him. At 15:45 Beatty came within range of the German fleet and the vanguards engaged one another with their opening fusillades.&lt;ref name="P93"/&gt; As the two squadrons closed, the Germans found the range better and faster than the British, who were silhouetted against the sun. As a result, German shells pounded the British ships while the German ships remained untouched for the first 10&amp;nbsp;minutes of the engagement.&lt;ref name="P93"/&gt; During this stage of the battle ''Lion'' was hit by nine shells from {{SMS|Lützow}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; One shell at 16:00 struck the right upper corner of the left hand gun port at the junction of the face plate and the roof, and punched a piece of the 9-inch face plate into the turret before detonating, blowing off the armoured roof of the turret and starting a fire, which a damage control party working from outside the turret fought to put out.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMSLion besideHMSQueenMaryblowingup1916.jpg|thumb|left|200px|HMS ''Lion'' to left of exploding HMS ''Queen Mary'' at Jutland. White splashes from shells can be seen falling short of ''Lion'']]

The initial explosion killed or wounded everyone stationed in the gun house itself.&lt;ref name="P94"&gt;Snelling, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey, despite severe wounds and burns, realised that the shell hoist leading to the ship's main forward magazine was jammed open. With the hatch open, the flash fire would rapidly travel down to the main magazine resulting in an explosion that would tear the ship in two and kill everyone on board.&lt;ref&gt;Some accounts, including Perrett, suggest that both of Harvey's legs had been torn off by the shell blast, but Snelling indicates that he could still walk during these final seconds. The full extent of his injuries are unclear.  One of the officers who helped recover his body, Lieutenant-Colonel F.R. Jones, wrote to the Marines' journal ''The Globe and Laurel'' in October 1956 that Harvey was "very badly burnt…[but] ''not'' dismembered in any way."&lt;/ref&gt; Staggering across the wreckage of the turret, Harvey gave orders down the voice pipe for the magazine doors to be closed and the magazine compartments to be flooded, an action which would prevent the cordite in the magazines detonating.&lt;ref name="THP"&gt;[http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm Through the Hawse Pipe], Captain Alexander Grant, Retrieved 20 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Turning to his sergeant, the one man still standing, Harvey instructed him to proceed to the bridge and give a full report to the ship's captain [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Ernle Chatfield]] (a standard drill in damage exercises). Seconds later, Harvey collapsed and died from  his wounds.&lt;ref name="P95"&gt;Snelling, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The sergeant went immediately to the bridge and notified the captain of Harvey's actions before being taken below to have his wounds dressed.
[[File:HMSLiondamagetoQturret1916.jpg|right|thumb|Q turret with damaged armour roof plate removed after the battle]]
As soon as the turret had been hit the captain had ordered Q magazine doors closed and the magazine flooded, the order passing to the Transmitting Station below the armoured deck where Stoker 1st Class William Yeo was entrusted with passing the order on. The magazine was consequently flooded and locked up within minutes of the hit.  However the cordite charges which had fallen down from gun house after the hit were not removed to safety, and there were still ready charges in the working chamber.  A large number of crewmen still remained in the shell room, magazine handing room and working chamber.  The fire which was thought to have been put out after the hit on the turret gained strength and ignited the remaining cordite charges, setting off a large explosion at 16:28 which killed the turret crewmen, the flame of the explosion reaching as high as the top of the ship's masts.  Even with the precautions taken in hand, the magazine doors were later found to be severely buckled – only the seawater in the magazine behind it prevented the blast reaching inside.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; Other ships of the battlecruiser fleet were less lucky; at about the same time as Harvey's death, {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|6}} was torn to pieces by a series of magazine explosions that claimed 1,013 lives and just minutes after that HMS ''Queen Mary'' exploded "like a puffball" in one huge column of grey smoke, killing 1,275 sailors.&lt;ref name="P96"/&gt; Hours later during the main battlefleet engagement, Rear-Admiral [[Horace Hood]]'s flagship {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} was destroyed with 1,032 lives. All three ships were lost as the result of magazine explosions similar to the one narrowly avoided on ''Lion''.&lt;ref name="P96"&gt;Snelling, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance==
Harvey's charred corpse was taken from the wreckage of Q turret in the aftermath of battle and buried at sea with full honours alongside the other 98 fatal casualties ''Lion'' had suffered.&lt;ref name="P108"/&gt; His bravery in the face of certain death did not go unnoticed; he was mentioned by name in [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe's]] post-battle dispatch and he was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref name="LG2"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29751 |supp=y|page=9070|date=15 September 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey's widow Ethel was presented with the award at [[Buckingham Palace]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] on 15 September 1916. His medal group was later loaned to the [[Royal Marines Museum]], [[Eastney Barracks]] by his son Lieutenant-Colonel John Malcolm Harvey of the [[King's Regiment]] in 1973. Harvey's name is inscribed on the [[Chatham Naval Memorial]] to those with no known grave, administered by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].&lt;ref name="CWGC"&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/3051079 Harvey, Major Francis John William], ''Commonwealth War Graves Commission'', Retrieved 20 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11555">The '''Fudan poisoning case''' was a criminal case tried from 2013 to 2015 in which the [[suspect]] Lin Senhao was accused of intentional [[homicide]] by [[poisoning]] the victim Huang Yang. Lin Senhao's [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] was executed on December 11, 2015.

On February 18, 2014, the [[Second Intermediate People's Court of Shanghai]] sentenced the defendant, Lin Senhao, to death for intentional homicide, depriving him of political rights for life. Then the defendant decided to appeal. On January 8, 2015, [[Shanghai High People's Court]] upheld the original sentence: death penalty for intentional homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9E%97%E6%A3%AE%E6%B5%A9/10907361?fr=aladdin|title=百度百科：林森浩|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was debated in Chinese jurisprudential circle and public opinion at the time of the trial.

== Background ==

=== Relationship ===
Lin Senhao and Huang Yang were both graduate students of the medical school of [[Fudan University]]. They majored in different medical specialties. Since August 2010, Lin had been checked in to dormitory room 421. One year later, Huang Yang came to live in the dormitory and became Lin's roommate. After that, Lin was angry with Huang for a trivial matter, and gradually developed a grudge against him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.court.gov.cn/fabu-xiangqing-13042.html|title=权威发布 - 中华人民共和国最高人民法院|website=www.court.gov.cn|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2013, Lin heard that Huang Yang and other classmates wanted to make fun of other classmates on [[April Fools' Day]].

Lin wanted to pull a poisoning prank on Huang Yang and to make him sick.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farmer.com.cn/sh/fz/fzxw/201501/t20150108_1005980.htm|title=复旦投毒案终审 三大疑问跌宕起伏引关注-中国农业新闻网|last=孙建|website=www.farmer.com.cn|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivation ===
The Supreme People's Court was confirmed by review: the defendant Lin Senhao and the victim Huang Yang were graduate students of the same medical university, and lived in the same dormitory. Lin was dissatisfied with the victim Huang because of trifles, and decided to use poison to harm Huang Yang.

=== Poison ===
On November 27, 2013, in the courtroom of Shanghai no.2 Intermediate People's Court, Lin Senhao said, on March 31, 2013, he found his classmate LL&amp;uuml; Peng and tried to ask him for [[N-nitrosodimethylamine|''N''-nitrosodimethylamine]] he used in his experiment. Lin then got the key of laboratory from L&amp;uuml; Peng, then went to the laboratory and took a bottle containing 75 ml of ''N''-nitrosodimethylamine and a syringe containing about 2 ml of the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Poisoning dose ===
Prosecutors accused Lin of infusing at least 30 ml of ''N''-nitrosodimethylamine into the water dispenser, which was more than 10 times the deadly dose for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.163.com/14/0224/08/9LR9SQR400254TI5.html|title=上海一周：反思“复旦投毒案”中的舆论角色_网易财经|last=网易|website=money.163.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The case ==

=== Poisoning details ===
On the afternoon of March 31, Lin Senhao borrowed the key from another person. Lin then got into 204 imaging medical laboratory, building 11 of [[Zhongshan Hospital]] affiliated to Fudan University, took out the reagent bottle and syringes with the rest of poisonous chemicals ''N''-nitrosodimethylamine stored after the medical animal experiments in 2011, put them into a yellow medical waste bag and took it out of the room.

=== Police investigation ===
On April 11, 2013, the cultural security bureau of the municipal [[Public security bureau (China)|public security bureau]] answered the incident of Huang Yang's poisoning.  Police immediately organized a task force to conduct an investigation. Lin Senhao never told the truth previously, including when he accepted investigation by the police.

About 0:00 on April 12, 2013, after the police determined that Lin was a suspect and summoned him, Lin then confessed the fact that he put ''N''-nitrosodimethylamine in the 421 water dispenser.

On April 12, 2013, Lin was detained by the police.

On April 16, 2013, Huang Yang died at 3:23 pm after failing to revive. After authentication by forensics, the [[acute liver necrosis]] caused by ''N''-nitrosodimethylamine poisoning caused the death by [[multiple organ failure]].

=== Formally arrested ===
On April 19, 2013, Shanghai police charged the [[Procuratorate (China)|procuratorate]] with the arrest of a suspect, Lin, of the "4·1" case of Fudan University.

On April 25, the Huangpu district procuratorate gave the permission to arrest the criminal suspect Lin of the "4·1" case of Fudan University.

=== Prosecution ===
On October 30, 2013, Shanghai No.2 Intermediate People's Court received the prosecution of the suspect Lin. The prosecution accused Lin of the crime of intentional homicide using poison.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%8D%E6%97%A6%E6%8A%95%E6%AF%92%E6%A1%88/2129522?fr=aladdin#reference-[1]-10653147-wrap|title=百度百科：复旦投毒案|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judicial procedure ==

=== The first-instance court: Shanghai No.2 Intermediate People's Court ===
At 9:30am on November 27, 2013, Shanghai No.2 Intermediate People's Court held a public hearing of the  "Fudan poisoning case". In the hearing, the prosecutor alleged that Lin murdered Huang Yang by poisoning intentionally just because of trifles. The means were cruel, and the social harm was heavy. Lin's acts constituted intentional homicide, so prosecutors asked the court to punish Lin severely.

The defendant Lin Senhao argued that, the motivation of poisoning was just to make fun of Huang Yang on April fool's day. He had no intent to kill Huang Yang. Defenders had no objection of the indictment, but put forward that Lin was indirect intentional homicide, and could confess guilt, should be given a lighter punishment in accordance with the law.

At 6:15pm on November 27, 2013, the hearing ended. Shanghai No.2 Intermediate People's Court announced the judgment of this case will be pronounced on a date of choice.

On February 18, 2014, made the first-instance judgment. The defendant, Lin Senhao, was sentenced to death penalty for intentional homicide, and denied political rights for life.

=== The second-instance court: Shanghai High People's Court ===
On February 25, 2014, Lin's lawyer, Tang Zhijian, was formally appointed by Lin Senhao to appeal.

On January 8, 2015, Shanghai High People's Court announced the original judgment of Lin Senhao poisoning case was affirmed. The second-instance court did not accept the defendant's contention, and said although Lin confessed the guilt after arrest, his means of killing were cruel and the consequences were serious, so Lin couldn't get a lighter punishment. The second-instance sentenced Lin Senhao to death penalty for intentional homicide. According to Criminal Procedure Law, the death penalty sentence of Lin Senhao was submitted to The Supreme People's Court for approval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Supreme People's Court ===
On May 26, 2015, the [[Supreme People's Court]] heard Lin Senhao's defence contention. The defender claimed that the second-instance court's sentencing was too heavy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150527/43842795_0.shtml#_zbs_baidu_bk|title=最高法复核复旦投毒案被告人死刑判决|website=news.ifeng.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge of The Supreme People's Court said the case will be reviewed in accordance with the law.

On December 9, the "Fudan poisoning case" had made new progress. The result of Lin Senhao's death penalty review came out. The Supreme People's court issued the verdict approving Lin Senhao's death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20151209/46593645_0.shtml#_zbs_baidu_bk|title=“复旦投毒案”续：最高法已核准林森浩死刑|website=news.ifeng.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details and development ==

=== Supreme Court judge met Lin's father, setting a precedent ===
The chief justice met Lin's father in the courtroom, and the lawyer said: "It's the first."

The lawyer of Lin's father, Xie Tonxiang said, on July 28, 2015, by his application and communication, the chief justice agreed the defendant's father, Lin Zunyao's request to meet after asked for instruction superior and careful consideration. Lin Zunyao and the chief justice of Fudan poisoning case exchanged some parts of the case in the courtroom of The Supreme People's Court. Lin Zunyao said, this meeting lasted for hours, the judge and the clerk made a detailed record.

The lawyer, Xie Tongxiang said, there was no precedent that the chief justice meets the defendant's relatives, "This is the first time since The Supreme People's Court has repossessed the right to review the death penalty, the judges of the death penalty have met directly with the relatives in the courtroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.southcn.com/china/content/2015-08/12/content_130507351.htm|title=复旦投毒案：最高法死刑复核法官接见凶手父亲_中国新闻_南方网|last=于艳彬|website=news.southcn.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The suspect is approved for the death penalty ===
On December 10, 2015, the defendant of Fudan poisoning case, Lin Senhao's father, Lin Zunyao, said he received a notification from the court. The notification said that The Supreme People's Court has approved Lin Senhao's death penalty, and issued the verdict of Lin Senhao's death penalty.

Lin Zunyao said: "My heart breaks, I can't think now." He was told by The Supreme People's Court that he must go to see Lin Senhao before December 11.

The lawyer used of the defendant, Xie Tongxiang said that he will submit a written application to help Lin Senhao apply for a pretest, in order to make a final effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.qq.com/a/20151210/006271.htm|title=复旦投毒案嫌犯被核准死刑 律师将向最高检抗诉_新闻_腾讯网|website=news.qq.com|language=zh-CN|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinions ==
"This sentence sparked heated debate. Professional and knowledgeable elite students not abiding by the basic line of ethics makes people vigilant. A too utilitarian social environment allows us to ignore the cultivation of the most basic health personality; the indoctrination of animosity makes the restless youth narrow-minded and intolerant. From intimate roommate to poison, it's not just education that needs to rethink."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Heuweltjies''' are a class of [[soil]] surface feature that occurs widely in the [[Western Cape|south-western Cape]] of [[South Africa]]. They may be recognised as large mounds above or near the surface of the landscape. Like other similar-looking phenomena, such as [[Mima mounds]] and [[Fairy circle (Africa)|fairy circles]], from which they have been poorly distinguished, particularly in early literature, they have been the subject of a wide range of speculation and of debate that has not yet been settled conclusively.&lt;ref name="Merwe1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. R. Van der Merwe|title=Soil Groups and Sub-groups of South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6RBAAAAIAAJ|year=1941|publisher=Government Printer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stellenbosch1928"&gt;{{cite book|author=University of Stellenbosch|title=Annale - Universiteit van Stellenbosch: Reeks A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXtUAAAAMAAJ|year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heuweltjies showing invasion by vegetation IMG 0138s.JPG|thumb|Heuweltjies showing invasion by vegetation]]

==Causes==
It is quite certain that not all types of heuweltjies have the same cause and nature. For one thing, the various organisms and circumstances that have been proposed to cause them do not occur throughout their range. For another, they differ in nature; some for example have been seen as improving soil fertility, an opinion documented at least as long ago as the early 20th century,&lt;ref name="Stellenbosch1928"/&gt; whereas others seem to inhibit plant growth.

Possible theories and discussions on the topic include the following:

===Fossil termite mounds===
One theory is that heuweltjies are fossil [[termite mound]]s. Within this hypothesis, there are two conflicting opinions on the origins of heuweltjies, one maintaining that heuweltjies were built by the harvester termite ''[[Microhodotermes viator]]'', the other that heuweltjies were built by a now possibly extinct termite species.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, J. J.; Harris, C.; Hesse, H.; Swift, A. Heuweltjie age and vegetation change based on &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C analyses. South African Journal of Science;Mar/Apr2002, Vol. 98 Issue 3/4, p202. (A study estimating heuweltjie age from calcrete from near the Clanwilliam Dam in South Africa.)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[radiocarbon]] dates on heuweltjies suggest an age of about 30,000 or even 40,000 B.P.&lt;ref name="BurnhamJohnson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jennifer L. Horwath Burnham|author2=Donald Lee Johnson|title=Mima Mounds: The Case for Polygenesis and Bioturbation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xz5BMqTxYJkC&amp;pg=PA70|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=978-0-8137-2490-4|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mole-rats and/or termites===
Another theory is that heuweltjies are created by burrowing (fossorial) animals. Variants of this hypothesis are that the animals are [[mole-rat]]s in the families [[Bathyergidae]] and [[Rhizomyinae]]; termites; or a combination of mole-rats and termites. In a review paper, Walter Whitford and Fenton Kay state that while the mounds appear to have been created by termites, mammals (aardvarks) partially maintain the mounds by feeding on and living in them. They show a (log-log) correlation between the surface area of mounds including [[Mima mound]]s, badger digs, bison wallows, mole-rat, prairie-dog and banner-tail kangaroo rat mounds, with the longevity of the disturbance ('[[Wiktionary:biopedturbation|biopedturbation]]', i.e. disturbance of soil by living agents including animals, roots, etc.): a heuweltjie of 100–1000 square metres is 1000–10,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jornada-t7.nmsu.edu/bibliography/696.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215402/http://jornada-t7.nmsu.edu/bibliography/696.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-05-27 |title=Biopedturbation by mammals in deserts: a review |author1=Whitford, Walter G. |author2=Kay, Fenton R. |journal=Journal of Arid Environments |year=1999 |volume=41 |pages=203–330 |doi=10.1006/jare.1998.0482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential erosion===
Yet another theory is that heuweltjies are caused by differential [[erosion]] in places where the availability of water limits the growth of vegetation, creating [[patterns in nature|natural patterns]] such as [[tiger bush]]. In favour of this theory, Michael Cramer and his colleagues note that heuweltjies contain at least ten times more soil than any [[termite nest]]s in South Africa, and that they can occur on bedrock, which termites could not be tunnelling through to move soil upwards. Further, the heuweltjies had the same spatial distribution as bush-clumps, patches of woody vegetation forming patterns. They suggest that heuweltjies formed from bush-clumps as these protected the soil from eroding away, producing calcrete hardpans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-ab969e23-2c87-36b0-a144-1c5ed9ebd6af | title=Hard evidence that heuweltjie earth mounds are relictual features produced by differential erosion |author1=Cramer, Michael D. |author2=Innes, Sheona N. |author3=Midgley, Jeremy J. | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | year=2012 | volume=350-352 | pages=189–197 | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.06.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature Paper explanation===
In 2017 [[Corina Tarnita]] and colleagues published a paper in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] which explained these and other related self-organised vegetation patterns by means of a general theory which integrates scale-dependent feedbacks and the activities of subterranean ecosystem engineers such as termites, ants, and rodents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Corina E.|last1=Tarnita|first2=Juan A.|last2=Bonachela|first3=Efrat|last3=Sheffer|first4=Jennifer A.|last4=Guyton|title=A theoretical foundation for multi-scale regular vegetation patterns|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/59574/1/Tarnita_et_al_Nature2017_theoretical_foundation_for_multi_scale_regular_vegetation.pdf|journal=Nature|pages=398–401|volume=541|issue=7637|doi=10.1038/nature20801|first5=Tyler C.|last5=Coverdale|first6=Ryan A.|last6=Long|first7=Robert M.|last7=Pringle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Heuweltjies modify their local environment, creating a patchwork of habitats in the Nama Karoo ecosystem. Soils in heuweltjies are finer-grained, contain more water, and are more alkaline than surrounding soils, and they support differing animal and plant communities. Both [[aardvark]] and [[steenbok]] use heuweltjies as dung middens; they are often colonised by Brant's whistling rats (''[[Parotomys brantsii]]''), and sheep graze and leave dung on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1314 | title=Deserts and Xeric Shrublands: Nama Karoo | publisher=World Wildlife Fund (WWF) | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Seymour, Colleen}} Page has extensive bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Afrikaans]] word ''heuweltjie'' stems from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''heuveltje'', which translates to ''hillock'' or ''small hill''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vandale.nl/opzoeken?pattern=hillock&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Homestead strike''', also known as the '''Homestead Steel strike''', '''Pinkerton rebellion''', or '''Homestead massacre''', was an industrial [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] and [[Strike action|strike]] which began on July 1, 1892, culminating in a battle between strikers and private security agents on July 6, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=American Experience: Strike at Homestead Mill |publisher=Public Broadcasting System |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/sfeature/mh_horror.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000408223823/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/sfeature/mh_horror.html |archive-date=April 8, 2000 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was one of the most violent disputes in [[Labor history of the United States|U.S. labor history]], third behind the [[Ludlow Massacre]] and the [[Battle of Blair Mountain]]. The dispute occurred at the [[Homestead Steel Works]] in the [[Pittsburgh]] area town of [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], between the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (the AA) and the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. The final result was a major defeat for the union of strikers and a setback for their efforts to unionize steelworkers.

==Background==
[[Carnegie Steel]] made major technological innovations in  the 1880s, especially the installation of the [[Open hearth furnace|open-hearth]] system at Homestead in 1886.  It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for [[armor plate]] for the [[United States Navy]], which paid far higher prices for the premium product. In addition, the plant moved increasingly toward the continuous system of production. Carnegie installed vastly improved systems of material-handling, like overhead cranes, hoists, charging machines, and buggies. All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product.  As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with less skilled workers. In response, the more-skilled union members reacted with a strike designed to protect their historic position. The bitterness grew between workers.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (2000); Krass (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union==

The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) was an American [[trade union|labor union]] formed in 1876. It was a [[craft unionism|craft union]] representing skilled iron and steel workers.
[[File:PamphletHomesteadStrikeLyrics1892.jpg|thumb|Pro-Union pamphlet with lyrics to a song in support of workers|upright|left]]
The AA's membership was concentrated in [[ironworks]] west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. The union negotiated national uniform wage scales on an annual basis; helped regulate working hours, workload levels and work speeds; and helped improve working conditions. It also acted as a [[hiring hall]], helping employers find scarce [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddlers]] and rollers.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AA organized the independently-owned Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works in Homestead in 1881. The AA engaged in a bitter strike at the Homestead works on January 1, 1882 in an effort to prevent management from including a non-union clause in the workers' contracts, known as a "[[yellow-dog contract]]". Violence occurred on both sides, and the plant brought in numerous [[strikebreakers]]. The strike ended on March 20 in a complete victory for the union.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 174-192; Body, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AA struck the steel plant again on July 1, 1889, when negotiations for a new three-year collective bargaining agreement failed. The strikers seized the town and once again made common cause with various immigrant groups. Backed by 2,000 townspeople, the strikers drove off a trainload of strikebreakers on July 10. When the sheriff returned with 125 newly deputized agents two days later, the strikers rallied 5,000 [[townspeople]] to their cause.  Although victorious, the union agreed to significant wage cuts that left tonnage rates less than half those at the nearby [[Jones and Laughlin Steel|Jones and Laughlin]] works, where technological improvements had not been made.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, p. 52; Krause, p. 42, 174, 246–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie officials conceded that the AA essentially ran the Homestead plant after the 1889 strike.  The union contract contained 58 pages of footnotes defining work-rules at the plant and strictly limited management's ability to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

For its part, the AA saw substantial gains after the 1889 strike. Membership doubled, and the local union treasury had a balance of $146,000. The Homestead union grew belligerent, and relationships between workers and managers grew tense.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the 1892 strike==

The Homestead strike was organized and purposeful, a harbinger of the type of strike which marked the modern age of labor relations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the Homestead job action began as a lockout, not a strike. Foner, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The AA strike at the Homestead steel mill in 1892 was different from previous large-scale strikes in American history such as the [[Great railroad strike of 1877]] or the [[Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886]]. Earlier strikes had been largely leaderless and disorganized mass uprisings of workers.

==Plans of Carnegie and Frick==
[[Image:Andrew Carnegie, three-quarter length portrait, seated, facing slightly left, 1913.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Carnegie]]]]
[[Andrew Carnegie]] placed industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]] in charge of his company's operations in 1881. Frick resolved to break the union at Homestead. "The mills have never been able to turn out the product they should, owing to being held back by the Amalgamated men," he complained in a letter to Carnegie.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in George Harvey, ''Henry Clay Frick: The Man'' (New York: Beard Books, 1928; reprinted 2002), p. 177. {{ISBN|1-58798-127-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie was publicly in favor of labor unions. He condemned the use of strikebreakers and told associates that no steel mill was worth a single drop of blood.&lt;ref name="Standiford2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Standiford|first=Les|title=Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvz5BBm7CisC&amp;pg=PT161|accessdate=26 May 2013|date=10 May 2005|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-23837-5|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Carnegie agreed with Frick's desire to break the union and "reorganize the whole affair, and . . . exact good reasons for employing every man. Far too many men required by Amalgamated rules."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in James H. Bridge, ''The Inside History of the Carnegie Steel Company'' (New York: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1903; rev. ed. 1992), p. 206. {{ISBN|0-405-04112-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie ordered the Homestead plant to manufacture large amounts of inventory so the plant could weather a strike. He also drafted a notice (which Frick never released) withdrawing recognition of the union.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, a pacifist, purposefully avoided the moral dilemmas raised by the Homestead strike by beginning a European vacation before the strike began. When questioned in Scotland about Frick's actions, Carnegie washed his hands of any responsibility and declared that Frick was in charge. Brody argues that Carnegie felt Frick was doing the right thing by bringing in strikebreakers and busting the union, but Frick was doing a poor job of it. See Brody, p. 59 fn. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Portion of the typed and signed copy of the letter sent to Andrew Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead.]]

With the collective bargaining agreement due to expire on June 30, 1892, Frick and the leaders of the local AA union entered into negotiations in February. With the steel industry doing well and prices higher, the AA asked for a wage increase; the AA represented about 800 of the 3,800 workers at the plant. Frick immediately countered with a 22% wage decrease that would affect nearly half the union's membership and remove a number of positions from the bargaining unit. Carnegie encouraged Frick to use the negotiations to break the union: "...the Firm has decided that the minority must give way to the majority. These works, therefore, will be necessarily non-union after the expiration of the present agreement."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Carnegie to Frick dated April 4, 1892, quoted in Foner, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carnegie believed that the Amalgamated was a hindrance to efficiency; furthermore it was not representative of the workers.  It admitted only a small group of skilled workers. It was in its own way an elitist, discriminatory organization that was not worthy of the Republic, Carnegie felt.&lt;ref&gt;Krass p 277&lt;/ref&gt;

Frick announced on April 30, 1892 that he would bargain for 29 more days. If no contract was reached, Carnegie Steel would cease to recognize the union. Carnegie formally approved Frick's tactics on May 4.  Then  Frick offered a slightly better wage scale and advised the Superintendent to tell the workers, "We do not care whether a man belongs to a union or not, nor do we wish to interfere. He may belong to as many unions or organizations as he chooses, but we think our employees at Homestead Steel Works would fare much better working under the system in vogue at Edgar Thomson and Duquesne."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Krass p. 278; Krause, p. 284-310, contains the best discussion of the bargaining timeline and exchange of proposals.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lockout==

[[Image:Henry Clay Frick.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Henry Clay Frick]]]]
Frick locked workers out of the plate mill and one of the [[open hearth furnace]]s on the evening of June 28.  When no collective bargaining agreement was reached on June 29, Frick locked the union out of the rest of the plant. A high fence topped with barbed wire, begun in January, was completed and the plant sealed to the workers. Sniper towers with searchlights were constructed near each mill building, and high-pressure water cannons (some capable of spraying boiling-hot liquid) were placed at each entrance. Various aspects of the plant were protected, reinforced, or shielded.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, footnote p. 207; Foner, p. 208; Krause, p. 302, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a mass meeting on June 30, local AA leaders reviewed the final negotiating sessions and announced that the company had broken the contract by locking out workers a day before the contract expired. The [[Knights of Labor]], which had organized the mechanics and transportation workers at Homestead, agreed to walk out alongside the skilled workers of the AA.  Workers at Carnegie plants in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Duquesne, Pennsylvania|Duquesne]], Union Mills and [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]] struck in sympathy the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, footnote, p. 207, and p. 208, 210–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration of the Strike Committee, dated July 20, 1892 reads in part,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The employees in the mill of Messrs. Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Co., at Homestead, Pa., have built there a town with its homes, its schools and its churches; have for many years been faithful co-workers with the company in the business of the mill; have invested thousands of dollars of their savings in said mill in the expectation of spending their lives in Homestead and of working in the mill during the period of their efficiency. . . . "Therefore, the committee desires to express to the public as its firm belief that both the public and the employees aforesaid have equitable rights and interests in the said mill which cannot be modified or diverted without due process of law; that the employees have the right to continuous employment in the said mill during efficiency and good behavior without regard to religious, political or economic opinions or associations; that it is against public policy and subversive of the fundamental principles of American liberty that a whole community of workers should be denied employment or suffer any other social detriment on account of membership in a church, a political party or a trade union; that it is our duty as American citizens to resist by every legal and ordinary means the unconstitutional, anarchic and revolutionary policy of the Carnegie Company, which seems to evince a contempt [for] public and private interests and a disdain [for] the public conscience. . . .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battleofhomestead.org/archives/2005_Jan.pdf|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807020537/http://battleofhomestead.org/archives/2005_Jan.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2016|title=Bronze marker of the 1892 Edwin Rowe depiction|website=battleofhomestead.org|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The strikers were determined to keep the plant closed. They secured a steam-powered river launch and several rowboats to patrol the [[Monongahela River]], which ran alongside the plant. Men also divided themselves into units along military lines. Picket lines were thrown up around the plant and the town, and 24-hour shifts established. Ferries and trains were watched. Strangers were challenged to give explanations for their presence in town; if one was not forthcoming, they were escorted outside the city limits. Telegraph communications with AA locals in other cities were established to keep tabs on the company's attempts to hire replacement workers. Reporters were issued special badges which gave them safe passage through the town, but the badges were withdrawn if it was felt misleading or false information made it into the news. Tavern owners were even asked to prevent excessive drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 208-09; Krause, p. 311; Brody, p. 59;&lt;/ref&gt;

Frick was also busy. The company placed ads for replacement workers in newspapers as far away as [[Boston]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and even Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

But unprotected strikebreakers would be driven off. On July 4, Frick formally requested that Sheriff William H. McCleary intervene to allow supervisors access to the plant. Carnegie corporation attorney [[Philander Knox]] gave the go-ahead to the sheriff on July 5, and McCleary dispatched 11 deputies to the town to post handbills ordering the strikers to stop interfering with the plant's operation. The strikers tore down the handbills and told the deputies that they would not turn over the plant to nonunion workers. Then they herded the deputies onto a boat and sent them downriver to Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 26. claims these were plant guards specially deputized, but Krause is more authoritative in this regard.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frick had ordered the construction of a solid board fence topped with barbed wire around mill property. The workers dubbed the newly fortified mill "Fort Frick."

==Battle on July 6==
[[File:Odonnell-hugh-c1892.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Hugh O'Donnell (labor leader)|Hughey O'Donnell]], Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers.]]

Frick's intent was to open the works with nonunion men on July 6. Knox devised a plan to get the Pinkertons onto the mill property. With the mill ringed by striking workers, the agents would access the plant grounds from the river. Three hundred Pinkerton agents assembled on the Davis Island Dam on the Ohio River about five miles below Pittsburgh at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the night of July 5, 1892. They were given [[Winchester rifle]]s, placed on two specially-equipped [[barge]]s and towed upriver.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 209; Krause, p. 15, 271. The barges, bought specifically for the Homestead lockout, contained sleeping quarters and kitchens and were intended to house the agents for the duration of the strike.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strikers were prepared for them; the AA had learned of the Pinkertons as soon as they had left Boston for the embarkation point. The small flotilla of union boats went downriver to meet the barges. Strikers on the steam launch fired a few random shots at the barges, then withdrew—blowing the launch whistle to alert the plant.  The strikers blew the plant whistle at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., drawing thousands of men, women and children to the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 209; Krause, p. 16. Krause indicates that at least a thousand people turned out.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pinkertons attempt to land===
The Pinkertons attempted to land under cover of darkness about 4 a.m. A large crowd of families had kept pace with the boats as they were towed by a tug into the town. A few shots were fired at the tug and barges, but no one was injured. The crowd tore down the barbed-wire fence and strikers and their families surged onto the Homestead plant grounds. Some in the crowd threw stones at the barges, but strike leaders shouted for restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 16-18. Brody cites Andrew Carnegie, who claimed that Frick had not extended the barbed-wire fence to the riverbank, thus allowing the strikers access to the plant grounds. Brody, p. 59. But Foner says that the strikers tore down the fence near the water's edge. Foner, p. 209. Supporting Foner, see Krause, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pinkerton agents attempted to disembark, and shots were fired. Conflicting testimony exists as to which side fired the first shot. John T. McCurry, a boatman on the steamboat ''Little Bill'' (which had been hired by the Pinkerton Detective Agency to ferry its agents to the steel mill) and one of the men wounded by the strikers, said: "The armed Pinkerton men commenced to climb up the banks.  Then the workmen opened fire on the detectives. The men shot first, and not until three of the Pinkerton men had fallen did they respond to the fire.  I am willing to take an oath that the workmen fired first, and that the Pinkerton men did not shoot until some of their number had been wounded."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/07/07/104139918.pdf "What a Boatman Saw." ''New York Times.'' July 7, 1892.]&lt;/ref&gt; But according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the Pinkertons shot first.&lt;ref name="MobLaw"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/07/07/104139908.pdf "Mob Law at Homestead."] ''New York Times.'' July 7, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported that the Pinkertons opened fire and wounded William Foy, a worker.&lt;ref name="MobLaw" /&gt; Regardless of which side opened fire first, the first two individuals wounded were Frederick Heinde, captain of the Pinkertons,&lt;ref&gt;Heinde, sometimes spelled Hynd, makes the claim he was the first one wounded on the Pinkerton side. See: [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/07/07/104139919.pdf "The Wounded at Pittsburg." ''New York Times.'' July 7, 1892].&lt;/ref&gt; and Foy. The Pinkerton agents aboard the barges then fired into the crowd, killing two and wounding 11. The crowd responded in kind, killing two and wounding 12. The firefight continued for about 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Krause is the most accurate source on the number of dead, including the names of the killed and wounded. Krause, p. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Battle at the Landing Homestead Strike of 1892.jpg|thumb|The battle at the landing between the Pinkertons and strikers.|left]]
The strikers then huddled behind the pig and scrap iron in the mill yard, while the Pinkertons cut holes in the side of the barges so they could fire on any who approached.  The Pinkerton tug departed with the wounded agents, leaving the barges stranded. The strikers soon set to work building a rampart of steel beams further up the riverbank from which they could fire down on the barges. Hundreds of women continued to crowd on the riverbank between the strikers and the agents, calling on the strikers to 'kill the Pinkertons'.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strikers continued to sporadically fire on the barges. Union members took potshots at the ships from their rowboats and the steam-powered launch. The [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of Homestead, John McLuckie, issued a proclamation at 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. asking for townspeople to help defend the peace; more than 5,000 people congregated on the hills overlooking the steelworks. A 20-pounder brass cannon was set up on the shore opposite the steel mill, and an attempt was made to sink the barges. Six miles away in Pittsburgh, thousands of steelworkers gathered in the streets, listening to accounts of the attacks at Homestead; hundreds, many of them armed, began to move toward the town to assist the strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 21-22; Brody, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Homestead strike Carnegie shield.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a striker hiding behind a large shield and watching the Pinkerton men.]]
The Pinkertons attempted to disembark again at 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.  A striker high up the riverbank fired a shot. The Pinkertons returned fire, and four more strikers were killed (one by shrapnel sent flying when cannon fire hit one of the barges). Many of the Pinkerton agents refused to participate in the firefight any longer; the agents crowded onto the barge farthest from the shore. More experienced agents were barely able to stop the new recruits from abandoning the ships and swimming away. Intermittent gunfire from both sides continued throughout the morning. When the tug attempted to retrieve the barges at 10:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., gunfire drove it off.  More than 300 riflemen positioned themselves on the high ground and kept a steady stream of fire on the barges. Just before noon, a sniper shot and killed another Pinkerton agent.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 22-25, 30; Brody, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few more hours, the strikers attempted to burn the barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. [[Dynamite]] was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 24; Foner, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calls for state intervention===
The AA worked behind the scenes to avoid further bloodshed and defuse the tense situation. At 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., outgoing AA international president William Weihe rushed to the sheriff's office and asked McCleary to convey a request to Frick to meet. McCleary did so, but Frick refused. He knew that the more chaotic the situation became, the more likely it was that Governor [[Robert E. Pattison]] would call out the state militia.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 25-26. Frick had sought several times to have the Pinkerton agents deputized. He guessed correctly that the strikers would attack the Pinkertons, and attacking duly deputized county law enforcement officers would provide grounds for claiming insurrection. McCleary, sympathizing with the workers, refused Frick's demands. See Krause, p. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheriff McCleary resisted attempts to call for state intervention until 10 a.m. on July 7. In a [[telegram]] to Gov. Pattison, he described how his deputies and the Carnegie men had been driven off, and noted that the workers and their supporters actively resisting the landing numbered nearly 5,000. Pattison responded by requiring McCleary to exhaust every effort to restore the peace. McCleary asked again for help at noon, and Pattison responded by asking how many deputies the sheriff had. A third telegram, sent at 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., again elicited a response from the governor exhorting McCleary to raise his own troops.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pinkerton surrender===
[[Image:Homestead riot harpers 3c26046v.jpg|thumb|right|Pinkerton men leave the barges after their surrender during the Homestead strike|upright]]
At 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., events at the mill quickly began to wind down. More than 5,000 men—most of them armed mill hands from the nearby South Side, Braddock and Duquesne works—arrived at the Homestead plant. Weihe wanted to prevent further trouble at Homestead, so he pleaded with Frick to confer with representatives of the Amalgamated to return to Homestead and stop the armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1819234 Bemis, Edward W. "The Homestead Strike." ''Journal of Political Economy.'' June 1894.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2012}} Weihe urged the strikers to let the Pinkertons surrender, but he was shouted down. Weihe tried to speak again, but this time his pleas were drowned out as the strikers bombarded the barges with fireworks left over from the recent Independence Day celebration. [[Hugh O'Donnell (labor leader)|Hugh O'Donnell]], a heater in the plant and head of the union's strike committee, then spoke to the crowd.  He demanded that each Pinkerton be charged with murder, forced to turn over his arms and then be removed from the town. The crowd shouted their approval.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pinkertons, too, wished to surrender. At 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., they raised a white flag and two agents asked to speak with the strikers. O'Donnell guaranteed them safe passage out of town. Upon arrival, their arms were stripped from them. With heads uncovered, to distinguish them from the mill hands, they passed along between two rows of guards armed with Winchesters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/historyofus/web09/features/source/docs/C10.pdf "The Incident of the 6th of July." ''The Illustrated American.'' July 16, 1892, p. 4] Accessed 2012-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Pinkertons crossed the grounds of the mill, the crowd formed a gauntlet through which the agents passed. Men and women threw sand and stones at the Pinkerton agents, spat on them and beat them. Several Pinkertons were clubbed into unconsciousness. Members of the crowd ransacked the barges, then burned them to the waterline.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 154; Krause, p. 34-36. Krause documents two more incidents which occurred during the surrender. A striker seized a Pinkerton agent's rifle and attempted to break it in two. He succeeded in shooting himself in the stomach, and died. Later, as the agents passed through the gauntlet, a woman poked out an agent's eye with her umbrella.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Homestead Strike - Barges on fire.jpg|thumb|Burning of barges|left]]
As the Pinkertons were marched through town to the Opera House (which served as a temporary jail), the townspeople continued to assault the agents. Two agents were beaten as horrified town officials looked on. The press expressed shock at the treatment of the Pinkerton agents, and the torrent of abuse helped turn media sympathies away from the strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 36-38. Krause points out that much of the press' lurid reporting played heavily on misogynistic ideals of women as respectable and docile. The press also often described the women of the town as 'Hungarians,' playing on nativist hatreds.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike committee met with the town council to discuss the handover of the agents to McCleary. But the real talks were taking place between McCleary and Weihe in McCleary's office. At 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., the two sides agreed to a transfer process. A special train arrived at 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 7. McCleary, the international AA's lawyer and several town officials accompanied the Pinkerton agents to Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

But when the Pinkerton agents arrived at their final destination in Pittsburgh, state officials declared that they would not be charged with murder (per the agreement with the strikers) but rather simply released. The announcement was made with the full concurrence of the AA attorney. A special train whisked the Pinkerton agents out of the city at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 7.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival of the state militia==
[[File:Pennsylvania National Guard Passing the Railroad Station to Disperse Groups of Strikers Homestead strike 1892.jpg|thumb|State militia passing the railroad station to disperse groups of strikers.]]
On July 7, the strike committee sent a telegram to Gov. Pattison to attempt to persuade him that law and order had been restored in the town. Pattison replied that he had heard differently. Union officials traveled to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and met with Pattison on July 9. Their discussions revolved not around law and order, but the safety of the Carnegie plant.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 332-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pattison, however, remained unconvinced by the strikers' arguments.  Although Pattison had ordered the Pennsylvania militia to muster on July 6, he had not formally charged it with doing anything. Pattison's refusal to act rested largely on his concern that the union controlled the entire city of Homestead and commanded the allegiance of its citizens. Pattison refused to order the town taken by force, for fear a massacre would occur. But once emotions had died down, Pattison felt the need to act. He had been elected with the backing of a Carnegie-supported political machine, and he could no longer refuse to protect Carnegie interests.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 32, 333–34; Foner, p. 212;&lt;/ref&gt;

The steelworkers resolved to meet the militia with open arms, hoping to establish good relations with the troops.  But the militia managed to keep its arrival in the town a secret almost to the last moment. At 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 12, the Pennsylvania state militia arrived at the small Munhall train station near the Homestead mill (rather than the downtown train station as expected). Their commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[George R. Snowden]], made it clear to local officials that he sided with the owners.  When Hugh O'Donnell, the head of the union's strike committee attempted to welcome Snowden and pledge the cooperation of the strikers, Snowden told him that the strikers had not been law abiding, and that "I want you to distinctly understand that I am the master of this situation."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kahan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ctaTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=snowden+homestead+master+situation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KD6q5fbdXH&amp;sig=NWQwuS3859CcUMfjL5FmmzxFi6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VtQsU-nvLaWG0AGQ84CQAQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=snowden%20homestead%20master%20situation&amp;f=false The Homestead Strike: Labor, Violence, and American Industry], 2014, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; More than 4,000 soldiers surrounded the plant. Within 20 minutes they had displaced the picketers; by 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., company officials were back in their offices.  Another 2,000 troops camped on the high ground overlooking the city.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 337-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company quickly brought in strikebreakers and restarted production under the protection of the militia. Despite the presence of AFL pickets in front of several recruitment offices across the nation, Frick easily found employees to work the mill. The company quickly built bunk houses, dining halls and kitchens on the mill grounds to accommodate the strikebreakers. New employees, many of them black, arrived on July 13, and the mill furnaces relit on July 15. When a few workers attempted to storm into the plant to stop the relighting of the furnaces, militiamen fought them off and wounded six with bayonets.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 211, 212; Krause, p. 337-39&lt;/ref&gt; But all was not well inside the plant. A race war between nonunion black and white workers in the Homestead plant broke out on July 22, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

Desperate to find a way to continue the strike, the AA appealed to [[Whitelaw Reid]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], on July 16. The AA offered to make no demands or set any preconditions; the union merely asked that Carnegie Steel reopen the negotiations. Reid wrote to Frick, warning him that the strike was hurting the Republican ticket and pleading with him to reopen talks. Frick refused.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, p. 55-56; Krause, 343-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempted assassination and collapse of the strike==
[[File:Berkman with Frick (1892).jpg|thumb|Berkman's attempt to assassinate Frick, as illustrated by W. P. Snyder for ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in 1892|alt=Two men are sitting at a desk while a third man enters the office carrying a gun]]
Frick, too, needed a way out of the strike. The company could not operate for long with strikebreakers living on the mill grounds, and permanent replacements had to be found.

On July 18, the town was placed under [[martial law]], further disheartening many of the strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 213-14; Krause, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

National attention became riveted on Homestead when, on July 23, [[Alexander Berkman]], a New York [[anarchism|anarchist]] with no connection to steel or to organized labor, plotted with his lover [[Emma Goldman]] to assassinate Frick. He came in from New York, gained entrance to Frick's office, then shot and stabbed the executive. Frick survived and continued his role; Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 89; Krause, p. 354-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkman assassination attempt undermined public support for the union and prompted the final collapse of the strike. Hugh O'Donnell was removed as chair of the strike committee when he proposed to return to work at the lower wage scale if the unionists could get their jobs back. On August 12, the company announced that 1,700 men were working at the mill and production had resumed at full capacity. The national [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] refused to intervene, the East European workers ignored the union and it had no strategy left. The union voted to go back to work on Carnegie's terms; the strike had failed and the union had collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 355-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal battles===

The company had waged a second front in state court, and was winning. On July 18, 16 of the strike leaders were charged with conspiracy, riot and murder. Each man was jailed for one night and forced to post a $10,000 bond.

The union retaliated by charging company executives with murder as well. The company men, too, had to post a $10,000 bond, but they were not forced to spend any time in jail.  One judge issued treason charges against the Advisory Committee on August 30 for making itself the law. Most of the men could not raise the bail bond, and went to jail or into hiding. A compromise was reached whereby both sides dropped their charges.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 348-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The strike's conclusion==
[[File:An object lesson - J.S. Pughe. LCCN2010651438.jpg|thumb|[[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] illustration in which [[Charles M. Schwab|Schwab]] asks Carnegie whether it might be wiser to use the wealth from industry to benefit the worker rather than donate it to institutions for the privileged few.]]
Support for the strikers evaporated. The AFL refused to call for a boycott of Carnegie products in September 1892. Wholesale crossing of the picket line occurred, first among Eastern European immigrants and then among all workers. The strike had collapsed so much that the state militia pulled out on October 13, ending the 95-day occupation. The AA was nearly bankrupted by the job action. Weekly union relief for a member averaged $6.25 but totaled a staggering $10,000 per week when including 1,600 strikers.  With only 192 out of more than 3,800 strikers in attendance, the Homestead chapter of the AA voted, 101 to 91, to return to work on November 20, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 356-57; Foner, p. 215-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, only four workers were ever tried on the actual charges filed on July 18. Three AA members were found innocent of all charges. Hugh Dempsey, the leader of the local Knights of Labor District Assembly, was found guilty of conspiring to poison&lt;ref&gt;The official charge was conspiracy to poison. "In mid-January 1893, Hugh Dempsey, a leading K. of L. official in the Pittsburgh area, and three others were found guilty of having conspired to poison, during September and October, a number of non-union men..." Aaron and Miller, p. 170. See also: Montgomery, p. 39; "The Homestead Poisoners; Trial of Hugh Dempsey for Conspiracy Continued." ''New York Times.'' January 14, 1893; "Hugh Dempsey to be Pardoned." ''New York Times.'' January 30, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; nonunion workers at the plant—despite the state's star witness recanting his testimony on the stand. Dempsey served a seven-year prison term.  In February 1893, Knox and the union agreed to drop the charges filed against one another, and no further prosecutions emerged from the events at Homestead.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The striking AA affiliate in Beaver Falls gave in the same day as the Homestead lodge. The AA affiliate at Union Mills held out until August 14, 1893. But by then the union had only 53 members. The union had been broken; the company had been operating the plant at full capacity for almost a year, since September 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The Homestead strike broke the AA as a force in the American labor movement. Many employers refused to sign contracts with their AA unions while the strike lasted. A deepening in 1889 of the [[Long Depression]] led most steel companies to seek wage decreases similar to those imposed at Homestead.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

An organizing drive at the Homestead plant in 1896 was crushed by Frick. In May 1899, 300 Homestead workers actually formed an AA lodge, but Frick ordered the Homestead works shut down and the unionization effort collapsed.

De-unionization efforts throughout the Midwest began against the AA in 1897 when Jones and Laughlin Steel refused to sign a contract. By 1900, not a single steel plant in Pennsylvania remained unionized. The AA presence in Ohio and Illinois continued for a few more years, but the union continued to collapse. Many lodges disbanded, their members disillusioned. Others were easily broken in short battles. Carnegie Steel's [[Mingo Junction, Ohio]], plant was the last major unionized steel mill in the country. But it, too, successfully withdrew recognition without a fight in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, p. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

AA membership sagged to 10,000 in 1894 from its high of over 24,000 in 1891. A year later, it was down to 8,000. A 1901 strike against Carnegie's successor company, [[U.S. Steel]] collapsed. By 1909, membership in the AA had sunk to 6,300. A nationwide [[steel strike of 1919]] also was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The AA maintained a rump membership in the steel industry until its takeover by the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]] in 1936. The two organizations officially disbanded and formed the [[United Steelworkers]] May 22, 1942.

In 1999 the [[Bost Building]] in downtown Homestead, AA headquarters throughout the strike, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]]. It is used as a museum devoted not only to the strike, but also the steel industry in the Pittsburgh area. A railroad bridge over the Monongahela River near the site of the battle is named [[Pinkerton's Landing Bridge]] in honor of the dead. Two sites were each designated with a [[List of Pennsylvania state historical markers|Pennsylvania state historical marker]]: the site where Pinkerton attempted to land, and the two adjoining cemeteries of St. Mary's and Homestead where are buried the remains of six of the seven Carnegie Steel Company workers that were killed.&lt;ref name="PAHMDB" /&gt; The Pinkerton landing site was also named a [[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation]] Historic Landmark.&lt;ref name="PHLF" /&gt;

==Modern site==
The pumphouse where the gunfight occurred remains as a museum and meeting hall. There are several historical markers as well as a metal commemorative sign with the US Steel logo that reads "In Honor Of The Workers."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17181">'''Ho{{okina}}oponopono''' (IPA [ho.ʔo.po.no.po.no]) is a [[Hawaii]]an practice of [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]] and [[forgiveness]]. The Hawaiian word translates into English simply as ''correction'', with the synonyms ''manage'' or ''supervise'', and the antonym ''careless''.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=google+translate&amp;oq=google+translate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l4.4119j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.co.uk/#auto/en/Ho%CA%BBoponopono Translation for Hoʻoponopono given as 'Edit' or 'Correction'] ''translate.google.co.uk'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0824807030 Mary Kawena Pukui, Samuel H. Elbert - 1986: Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English, English-Hawaiian] ''books.google.com'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar forgiveness practices are performed on islands throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]] and [[New Zealand]]. Traditional ''Ho{{okina}}oponopono'' is practiced by [[Native Hawaiians|Indigenous Hawaiian]] healers, often within the extended family by a family member. There is also a [[New Age]] practice that goes by the same name.

==Polynesian antecedents==
[[File:Oceania (World-Factbook).jpg|thumb|Map of Oceania]]
In many [[Polynesian culture]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} it is believed that a person's errors (called ''hara'' or ''hala'') caused [[illness]]. Some believe error angers the gods, others that it attracts malevolent gods, and still others believe the guilt caused by error made one sick. "In most cases, however, specific 'untie-error' rites could be performed to atone for such errors and thereby diminish one's accumulation of them."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the islands of [[Vanuatu]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], people believe that illness usually is caused by sexual misconduct or anger. "If you are angry for two or three days, sickness will come," said one local man.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy that counters this sickness is confession. The patient, or a family member, may confess. If no one confesses an error, the patient may die. The Vanuatu people believe that secrecy is what gives power to the illness. When the error is confessed, it no longer has power over the person.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other islanders, including Hawaiians, people of [[Tikopia]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], and on [[Rarotonga]] in the [[Cook Islands]], believe that the sins of the father will fall upon the children. If a child is sick, the parents are suspected of quarreling or misconduct. In addition to sickness, social disorder could cause sterility of land or other disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Harmony could be restored only by confession and apology.

In [[Pukapuka]], it was customary to hold sort of a confessional over patients to determine an appropriate course of action in order to heal them.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar traditions are found in [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tahiti]],&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; and among the [[Māori people|Maori]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buck, pp. 405–06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handy, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Hala lei.JPG|thumb|right|A lei made from the fruit of the hala or pandanus tree. A hala lei was given at the completion of ho{{okina}}oponopono in the tradition of kahuna Makaweliweli of Moloka{{okina}}i]]
[[File:Kokee.jpg|thumb|right|Overlooking Kalalau Valley from Koke'e State Park, where Nana Veary held retreats to teach ho{{okina}}oponopono]]

"Ho{{okina}}oponopono" is defined in the ''Hawaiian Dictionary'' as:

(a) "To put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up make orderly or neat, administer, superintend, supervise, manage, edit, work carefully or neatly; to make ready, as canoemen preparing to catch a wave."

(b) "Mental cleansing: family conferences in which relationships were set right (''ho{{okina}}oponopono'') through prayer, discussion, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and [[forgiveness]]." &lt;ref name="HDict"&gt;Pukui, Elbert, pp. 340–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally, ''ho{{okina}}o'' is a particle used to make an actualizing verb from the following noun, as would "to" before a noun in English. Here, it creates a verb from the noun ''[[pono]]'', which is defined as: "...goodness, uprightness, morality, moral qualities, correct or proper procedure, excellence, well-being, prosperity, welfare, benefit, true condition or nature, duty; moral, fitting, proper, righteous, right, upright, just, virtuous, fair, beneficial, successful, in perfect order, accurate, correct, eased, relieved; should, ought, must, necessary."&lt;ref name="HDict" /&gt;

''Ponopono'' is defined as "to put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up, make orderly or neat."

==Traditional practice==
Hawaiian scholar Nana Veary in her book, ''Change We Must: My Spiritual Journey''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3VsHAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=9781877982071&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN_PGD3c3WAhVR2WMKHQ4BAtoQ6AEIKDAA Nana Veary: Change We Must: My Spiritual Journey]  ''books.google.com'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that ho'oponopono was a practice in [[Ancient Hawaii]]&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee, pp. 61–62, 67&lt;/ref&gt; and this is supported by oral histories from contemporary Hawaiian elders.&lt;ref&gt;Chai, pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt; Pukui first recorded her experiences and observations from her childhood (born 1895) in her 1958 book.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Handy, pp. 184–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word ''ho{{okina}}oponopono'' was not used, early Hawaiian historians documented a belief that illness was caused by breaking [[kapu]], or spiritual laws, and that the illness could not be cured until the sufferer atoned for this transgression, often with the assistance of a praying priest (''[[kahuna]] pule'') or healing priest (''kahuna lapa{{okina}}au''). Forgiveness was sought from the gods&lt;ref&gt;Kamakau, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malo, p. 75 (English)&lt;/ref&gt; or from the person with whom there was a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Titcomb&lt;/ref&gt;

Pukui described it as a practice of extended family members meeting to "make right" broken family relations. Some families met daily or weekly, to prevent problems from erupting.&lt;ref&gt;Chai, pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; Others met when a person became ill, believing that illness was caused by the stress of anger, guilt, recriminations and lack of forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Kupuna Nana Veary wrote that when any of the children in her family fell ill, her grandmother would ask the parents, "What have you done?" They believed that healing could come only with complete forgiveness of the whole family.&lt;ref&gt;Veary, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==
Ho{{okina}}oponopono corrects, restores and maintains good relationships among family members and with their gods or God by getting to the causes and sources of trouble. Usually the most senior member of the family conducts it. He or she gathers the family together. If the family is unable to work through a problem, they turn to a respected outsider.

The process begins with prayer. A statement of the problem is made, and the transgression discussed. Family members are expected to work problems through and cooperate, not "hold fast to the fault". One or more periods of silence may be taken for reflection on the entanglement of emotions and injuries. Everyone's feelings are acknowledged. Then confession, repentance and forgiveness take place. Everyone releases (''kala'') each other, letting go. They cut off the past (''{{okina}}oki''), and together they close the event with a ceremonial feast, called ''pani'', which often included eating ''limu kala'' or [[kala seaweed]], symbolic of the release.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee pp. 60–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In a form used by the family of ''kahuna'' Makaweliweli of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i, the completion of ho{{okina}}oponopono is represented by giving the person forgiven a [[lei (Hawaii)|lei]] made from the fruit of the [[Hala (tree)|hala tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern uses==
"Aunty" Malia Craver, who worked with the Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani Children's Centers (QLCC) for more than 30 years, taught courses in traditional ho{{okina}}oponopono.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keepers of culture named  |work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/01/13/news/story09.html |date=January 13, 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2000, she spoke about it to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2000/08/09/news/story9.html "Aunty" Malia Craver to address United Nations] 8 September 2000, ''archives.starbulletin.com'', accessed  19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional applications===
In the late 20th century, courts in Hawai{{okina}}i began to order juvenile and adult offenders to work with an elder who would conduct ho{{okina}}oponopono for their families, as a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]]. The ho{{okina}}oponopono is conducted in the traditional way, without court interference, with a practitioner picked by the family from a list of court-approved providers.&lt;ref&gt;Steuterman, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Some native practitioners provide ho{{okina}}oponopono to clients who otherwise might seek family counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Shook&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from karma===
[[File:Lapakahi3.jpg|thumb|right|The site of the partially restored remains of the village of Koai{{Okina}}e in the ''Lapakahi State Historical Park'' of the island of ''Hawaii'', North Kohala district. Beginning in the early 20th century, this village has been a center for lapa{{okina}}au]]
In 1976 [[Morrnah Simeona]], regarded as a healing priest or ''[[kahuna]] lapa{{okina}}au'', adapted the traditional ho{{okina}}oponopono of family mutual forgiveness to the social realities of the modern day. For this she extended it both to a general problem solving process outside the family and to a psycho-spiritual self-help rather than group process.

Simeona's version is influenced by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and [[Edgar Cayce]]. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative [[karma]], saying that "you have to experience by yourself what you have done to others." But that you are the creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;Pali Jae Lee, Koko Willis, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past [[reincarnation]]s, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'."&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, pp. 45–61&lt;/ref&gt; She did not use [[mantra]]s or conditioning exercises.

Her teachings include: there is a Divine Creator who takes care of altruistic pleas of Men; "when the phrase 'And it is done' is used after a prayer, it means Man's work ends and God's begins."&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; "Self-Identity" signifies, e.g. during the ho{{okina}}oponopono, that the three selves or aspects of consciousness are balanced and connected with the Divine Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Different from egoistic prayers, "altruistic prayers like ho{{okina}}oponopono, where you also pray for the release of other entities and objects, reach the Divine plane or Cosmos because of their high vibrations. From that plane the Divine energy or "mana" would come,"&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; which would transform the painful part of the memory of the wrong actions in all participants to "Pure Light", on whatever plane they are existing; "all are set free".&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Through this transmutation in the mind the problems will lose their energy for physical effects, and healing or balancing is begun. In this sense, Simeona's mana is not the same as the traditional Polynesian understanding of [[mana]].

Pacifica Seminars, founded by [[Morrnah Simeona]], started the first Ho'oponopono seminars in [[Germany]]. Seminars are still held on a regular basis in Germany, Poland, France, and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, Morrnah, ''Selbst-Identität durch Ho{{okina}}oponopono'', ''Self-identity through Ho´oponopono'' p. 128, Pacifica Seminars (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Simeona, Morrnah |url=http://www.hooponopono.eu/artykul_anny_kligert.htm |title=''Parę słów o moim spotkaniu z Ho´oponopono'' lit.

===State of Zero===
After Simeona's death in 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored a book with Joe Vitale called ''Zero Limits''&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Simeona's Ho{{okina}}oponopono teachings. Len makes no claim to be a ''kahuna''. In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Ho{{okina}}oponopono is getting to "the state of Zero, where we would have zero limits. No memories. No identity."&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the [[mantra]], "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.  Thank you."&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility,&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If one would take complete responsibility for one's life, then everything one sees, hears, tastes, touches, or in any way experiences would be one's responsibility because it is in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The problem would not be with our external reality, it would be with ourselves. Total Responsibility, according to Hew Len, advocates that everything exists as a projection from inside the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humanist Counseling in the Dutch Armed Forces''' is a task in the [[Armed forces of the Netherlands]]. [[Humanism|Humanist]] counsellors, sometimes called humanist chaplain, contribute to the (mental) well-being of military personnel, those related to them, and veterans. They do this through visible presence at the workplace, personal contact and guidance. They hold conversations, give advice and offer support. Issues concerning meaning and ethics are central to their work.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanistischverbond.nl/humanistische-geestelijke-begeleiding-defensie&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task description==

The work of humanist counsellors in the armed forces consists of:
*Presence at the workplaces, training locations and during deployments
*Individual guidance to (former) military personnel and those related to them
*Informal training for groups
*Education/training in e.g. ethics
*Philosophical/spiritual meetings
*Contribution to military ceremonies
*Identification of, and advice and counselling on issues that concern the well-being of people (humanization)
*Participation in Social Medical Teams (SMT’s), together with other aid and care workers.

Humanist counsellors are appointed as civil servants, though for carrying out their work they are viewed equivalent to the military ranks (captain, major or lieutenant colonel). They are employed in the military, not by the military, and work outside the military hierarchy. Professionally they are not accountable to the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]] or the military authority, but to the agency that sends them, the Dutch Humanist Society (Humanistisch Verbond). This service exists primarily for the people, not for the military apparatus. Humanist counsellors thus like to call themselves (positively) critically involved. 
	
Humanist counsellors give support, but also maintain a critical distance. It means being part of the (military) unit, befriending them and gaining access to their world, while at the same time being able to pose the critical question, keeping sufficient distance to be able to see things from a different perspective, to remain the involved outsider.

Wherever the soldiers are stationed, humanist counsellors are active, working for the benefit of the mental well-being of personnel in the armed forces. Humanist counsellors are thus, also stationed outside the Netherlands, for example at [[Curaçao]], and join missions abroad as well as longer naval operations. 
 
A humanist counsellor works together with the unit they're stationed with. A counsellor goes along once in a while on patrol, helps out in the kitchen sometimes, sits with the guards at another time, or visits someone at the military field hospital. They are a member of the unit, while holding an independent position as well. They also join the deployments abroad, so they live and work in the same circumstances as the soldiers.

The humanist counseling department in the armed forces was introduced on 1 September 1964, in order to serve secular and non-religious soldiers. The department started with five counsellors. Over the years however, it has developed into one of the major counseling departments of the armed forces, with a current total of thirty eight humanist counsellors. The counsellors adopt the humanist philosophy in their work, not imposing one’s ideas onto others. In this form of counselling, the person asking for help and his own views and ways of thinking are central. But the counsellors do try to contribute to the humanization of the armed forces, by creating a more dignified, humane atmosphere.

Humanism is a life stance in which the human being is central. Humanists want to determine their life-choices themselves, assuming self-responsibility, and living autonomously, but in connection with others and the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanistischverbond.nl/humanisme&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Ann Coate''' (born 8 February 1953)&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;''Who's Who in Australia'', ConnectWeb (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; is an Australian [[judge|jurist]]. Coate is a Judge of the [[Family Court of Australia]] and one of the six [[Commissioner|Royal Commissioners]] appointed by the [[Australian government]] [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Justice Jennifer Coate |url=http://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/justice-jennifer-coate/ |work=Our work: The Commissioners |publisher=[[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] |year=2013 |accessdate=12 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Coate studied law at [[Monash University]]. She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1979, and a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1984. Coate worked part-time as a teacher while she studied law.

==Career==
Upon graduating, Coate worked as a [[solicitor]] and then a [[barrister]]. She also served as an [[academic]], and contributed to a range of [[social policy]] groups and committees.

In 1992, Coate was appointed a [[magistrate]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By September 1996, she was Deputy Chief Magistrate of Victoria. In June 2000, she was made a judge of the [[County Court of Victoria]], and was made the first female President of the [[Children's Court of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; One of the most significant reforms she oversaw as President of the Children's Court was the establishment of a Children's [[Koori Court]], a specialist court designed to accommodate juvenile Indigenous offenders. In 2001, Coate was made part-time Commissioner of the [[Victorian Law Reform Commission]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vicbar.com.au/webdata/VicBarNewsFiles/Farewell%20to%20First%20President%20of%20the%20Children's%20Court.pdf |format=PDF |title=Farewell to First President of the Children's Court |publisher=Bar Association of Victoria |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913164451/http://www.vicbar.com.au/webdata/VicBarNewsFiles/Farewell%20to%20First%20President%20of%20the%20Children%27s%20Court.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coate left the Children's Court in April 2006.

On 29 November 2007, she formally took up responsibilities as [[Coroner]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], marking the first time a woman had taken on the role; and served in that role until her appointment to the Family Court.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/thoughtful-judge-to-be-state-coroner/2007/11/27/1196036892780.html |title='Thoughtful' judge to be state coroner |work=[[The Age]] |date=27 November 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vIAiHUtY?url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/thoughtful-judge-to-be-state-coroner/2007/11/27/1196036892780.html |archive-date=27 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/monashmemo/stories/20071212/new-coroner.html |title=New Victorian coroner a Monash graduate |work=Monash Memo |date=12 December 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vIAjDOo1?url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/monashmemo/stories/20071212/new-coroner.html |archive-date=27 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2006, she served as the first female President of the [[Children's Court of Victoria]].

Additionally, Coate has been involved in a wide range of charitable and community organizations. She has served as Chair of the Health Services for Abused Victorian Children Advisory Group and Chair of the Anglicare Steering Committee for Group Conferencing Restorative Justice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

On 11 January 2013, Judge Coate was named as one of the six Royal Commissioners appointed to investigate child sexual abuse by the Australian government Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.

==Personal==
Coate is reportedly highly respected in legal circles as an extremely bright, thoughtful lawyer, who occasionally acts unconventionally to demonstrate a point. In 1993, when Coate had only recently been appointed a magistrate, a controversy broke out in a Victorian court, when a female solicitor was criticized by a judge for coming to court in polka-dot stockings and a suit with a skirt that finished above the knee. The incident attracted widespread media attention and sparked extensive debate. In a silent protest against her colleague's comments, Coate spent the remainder of the week dressed in outlandishly coloured and patterned stockings, ensuring that she was seen widely and publicly in Melbourne's legal precinct.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Jonathan David Larson''' (February 4, 1960 – January 25, 1996) was an American [[composer]] and [[playwright]] noted for exploring the social issues of [[multiculturalism]], [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], and [[homophobia]] in his work. Typical examples of his use of these themes are found in his works ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and ''[[Tick, Tick... Boom!|tick, tick... BOOM!]]'' He received three posthumous [[Tony Awards]] and a posthumous [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for the [[rock musical]] ''Rent''.

==Early years==
Larson was born to Jewish parents, Allan and Nanette Larson, in [[White Plains, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jonathan Larson Biography | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Jonathan-Larson.html | work=filmreference | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was exposed to the performing arts, especially music and theatre, from an early age, as he played the trumpet, tuba, sang in his school's choir, and took formal piano lessons. His early musical influences were his favorite rock musicians such as [[Elton John]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Doors]], [[The Who]], and [[Billy Joel]], as well as the classic composers of musical theatre, especially [[Stephen Sondheim]]. Larson was also involved in acting in high school, performing in lead roles in various productions at [[White Plains High School]].&lt;ref name="melg"/&gt;

Larson attended [[Adelphi University]] in [[Garden City, New York]] with a four-year scholarship as an acting major, in addition to performing in numerous plays and musical theatre. During his college years, he began music composition, composing music first for small student productions, called cabarets, and later the score to a musical entitled ''Libro de Buen Amor'', written by the department head, [[Jacques Burdick]]. Burdick functioned as Larson's mentor during his college education. After graduating with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, Larson participated in a summer stock theatre program at The Barn Theatre in  [[Augusta, Michigan]] as a piano player, which resulted in his earning an [[Equity Card]] for membership in the [[Actors' Equity Association]].

Larson moved to a [[loft]] with no heat on the fifth floor of a building at the corner of [[Greenwich Street]] and [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] where he lived with various roommates, among them Greg Beals, a journalist for [[Newsweek]] magazine and the brother of actress [[Jennifer Beals]], and James Clunie, now a creative director at advertising agency [[BBDO]]. For 9 and a half years Larson worked as a waiter at the [[Moondance Diner]] during weekends, and worked on composing and writing musicals during the weekdays. At the diner Larson later met [[Jesse L. Martin]], who was his waiting trainee and later would perform the role of Tom Collins in the original cast of Larson's ''Rent''. Larson and his roommates lived in harsh conditions with little money or property.

==Career==
Before composing and writing the musical ''Rent,'' his most popular work, Jonathan Larson wrote a variety of early theatrical pieces, with varying degrees of success and production.

Among his early creative works is ''Sacrimmoralinority,'' his first musical which was co-written with David Glenn Armstrong, and originally staged at his alma mater [[Adelphi University]] in the winter of 1981. Following Jonathan and David's graduation in 1982, and retitled ''Saved! - An Immoral Musical on the Moral Majority,'' the [[Brechtian]]-themed musical cabaret played a four-week showcase run at Rusty's Storefront Blitz, a small theatre on 42nd Street in Manhattan, and won both authors a writing award from ASCAP.

Between 1983 and 1990, Larson wrote ''Superbia,'' originally intended as a futuristic rock retelling of [[George Orwell]]'s book ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', though the Orwell estate denied him permission to adapt the novel itself. ''Superbia'' won the Richard Rodgers Production Award and the Richard Rodgers Development Grant.&lt;ref name="melg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7D71F39F935A15752C0A960958260|title=Jonathan Larson, 35, Composer of Rock Opera and Musicals|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1996-01-26|author=[[Mel Gussow]]|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite performances at Playwrights Horizons and a rock concert version produced by Larson's close friend and producer Victoria Leacock at the [[Village Gate]] in September 1989, ''Superbia'' was not fully produced, leading to disappointment for Larson.

His next work, completed in 1991, was an autobiographical "rock monologue" entitled ''30/90'', which was later renamed ''Boho Days'' and finally titled ''[[tick, tick... BOOM!]]''. This piece, written for only Larson with a piano and rock band, was intended to be a response to his feelings of rejection caused by the disappointment of ''Superbia.'' The show was performed off-Broadway at the Village Gate in [[Greenwich Village]], as well as at the [[Second Stage Theater]], then on the [[Upper West Side]]. Both of these productions were produced by Victoria Leacock. The producer [[Jeffrey Seller]] saw a reading of ''Boho Days'' and expressed interest in producing Larson's musicals. After Larson's death, the work was reworked into a stage musical by playwright [[David Auburn]] and arranger and musical director [[Stephen Oremus]]. The stage version premiered off-Broadway in 2001, and has since also been produced on the [[West End theatre|West End]].

In 1992, Larson collaborated with fellow composer/lyricists [[Rusty Magee]], Bob Golden, Paul Scott Goodman and Jeremy Roberts on ''Sacred Cows,'' which was devised and pitched to television networks as a weekly anthology with each episode taking a different Biblical or mythological story and giving it a '90s celebrity twist. The project was shelved due to scheduling conflicts among the five composers but resurfaced over 20 years later in a six-page Playbill.com article. The demo for ''Sacred Cows'' was released on iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/175531-How-the-Feverish-Imaginations-of-Jonathan-Larson-Rusty-Magee-and-Friends-Birthed-the-Musical-Sacred-Cows/pg1 |title=How the Feverish Imaginations of Jonathan Larson, Rusty Magee and Friends Birthed the Musical "Sacred Cows" |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in college, Larson came into contact with his strongest musical theatre influence, [[Stephen Sondheim]], to whom he occasionally submitted his work for review. One ''tick, tick... BOOM!'' song called "Sunday" is a homage to Sondheim, who supported Larson, staying close to the melody and lyrics of Sondheim's own song of the same title but turning it from a manifesto about art into a waiter's lament. Sondheim would often write letters of recommendation for Larson to various producers. Larson later won the Stephen Sondheim Award.

In addition to his three larger theatrical pieces written before ''Rent'', Larson also wrote music for ''J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation'';&lt;ref name="lc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DD1731F934A35754C0A963958260|title=Last Chance|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1995-07-07|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous individual numbers; music for ''[[Sesame Street]]''; music for the children's book cassettes of ''An American Tail'' and ''The Land Before Time''; music for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine publisher [[Jann Wenner]]; a musical called ''Mowgli''; and four songs for the children's video ''Away We Go!'', which he also conceived with collaborator and composer Bob Golden and directed. He also performed in [[John MacLachlan Gray|John Gray]]'s musical ''[[Billy Bishop Goes to War]]'', which starred his close friend actor [[Roger Bart]] (''[[Desperate Housewives]]''). For his early works, Larson won a grant and award from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] and the [[Gilman &amp; Gonzalez-Falla Theatre Foundation|Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla Theatre Foundation's Commendation Award]].&lt;ref name="ldr"/&gt;

===''Rent''===
Playwright [[Billy Aronson]] came up with the idea to write a musical update of ''[[La Bohème]]'' in 1988. He wanted to create "a musical inspired by [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''La Bohème'', in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York".&lt;ref name="thath"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1D91639F934A25750C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title=Theater; The Seven-Year Odyssey that Led to 'Rent'|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1996-03-17|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]] |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Aronson called Ira Weitzman with his idea, asking for ideas for collaborators, and Weitzman put Larson together with Aronson to collaborate on the new project. Larson came up with the title and suggested moving the setting from the [[Upper West Side]] to [[downtown Manhattan|downtown]], where Larson and his roommates lived in a rundown apartment.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/larson_j.html|title=Jonathan Larson|accessdate=2008-07-17|publisher=PBS|work=Broadway: The American Musical}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he and his roommates kept an illegal wood-burning stove because of lack of heat in their building, and he also dated a dancer for four years who sometimes left him for other men and eventually left him for a woman. These experiences would influence the autobiographical aspects of ''Rent''. Larson wanted to write about his own experience, and in 1991, he asked Billy if he could use the original concept they collaborated on and make ''Rent'' his own.&lt;ref name="thath" /&gt; They made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds. Eventually they decided on setting the musical not in [[SoHo]], where Larson lived, but rather in [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]] in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].

''Rent'' started as a staged reading in 1993 at the [[New York Theatre Workshop]], followed by a studio production that played a three-week run a year later. However, the version that is now known worldwide, the result of a three-year-long collaborative and editing process between Larson and the producers and director, was not publicly performed before Larson's death. The show premiered Off Broadway on schedule. Larson's parents (who were flying in for the show anyway) gave their blessing to open the show. Due to Larson's death the day before the first preview performance, the cast agreed that they would premiere the show by simply singing it through, all the while sitting at three prop tables lined up on stage. But by the time the show got to its high energy "[[La Vie Boheme]]", the cast could no longer contain themselves and did the rest of the show as it was meant to be, minus costumes, to the crowd and the Larson family's approval. Once the show was over, there was a long applause followed by silence which was eventually broken when an audience member shouted out "Thank you, Jonathan Larson."

''Rent'' played through its planned engagement to sold-out crowds and was continually extended. The decision was finally made to move the show to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and it opened at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="rup"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/16678895.html?dids=16678895:16678895&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+30%2C+1996&amp;author=LAURIE+WINER&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=THEATER+REVIEW%3B+'Rent'+Goes+Up--to+Broadway%3B+Pulitzer+Prize-Winning+Musical+Celebrates+Life%2C+Even+Under+Specter+of+Death&amp;pqatl=google|title='Rent' Goes Up -- to Broadway|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1996-04-30|author=Laurie Winer|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the New York Theatre Workshop, ''Rent'' was and is produced by Jeffrey Seller, who was introduced to Larson's work when attending an off-Broadway performance of ''Boho Days'', and two of his producer friends who also wished to support the work, Kevin McCollum and Allan S. Gordon.

For his work on ''Rent'', Larson was posthumously awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]],&lt;ref name="ldr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/16669667.html?dids=16669667:16669667&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+14%2C+1996&amp;author=Patrick+Pacheco&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=THEATER%3B+Life%2C+Death+and+'Rent'%3B+Jonathan+Larson's+Pulitzer+winner+celebrates+the+artists+and+HIV-positive+addicts+he+knew%2C+a+'Hair'+cut+for+the+'90s.+The+show+couldn't+have+gone+to+Broadway+without+him.+And+then+it+did.&amp;pqatl=google|title=Theater; Life, Death and 'Rent'|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1996-04-14|author=Patrick Pacheco|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tony Award]]s for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]], and [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]; the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical]], the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music]], and the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]];&lt;ref name="hearts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/06/03/1996-06-03_tony_hearts_are__rent__in_tw.html|title=Tony Hearts are 'Rent' in Two: Sister Recalls Late Composer Jonathan Larson's Dreams as She Accepts Award|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1996-06-03|author=Phil Roura, Patricia O'Haire and Michael Riedel|work=New York Daily News}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Musical; the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Best Musical in the Off-Broadway category; and three [[Obie Award]]s for Outstanding Book, Outstanding Lyrics and Outstanding Music.

==Death==
Larson died unexpectedly the morning of ''Rent''{{'}}s first preview performance Off Broadway. He suffered an [[aortic dissection]], believed to have been caused by undiagnosed [[Marfan syndrome]], in the early morning on January 25, 1996.&lt;ref name="eve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marfan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndrome survival: New drugs offer promise for often-fatal Marfan tissue disorder |author=Kirk, Fiona J. |url=http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/07/26/072611-arts-health-marfan-syndrome-1-3/  |newspaper=[[The Daily (News Corporation)|The Daily]] |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York State medical investigators concluded that if the aortic dissection had been properly diagnosed and treated, Larson would have lived.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/state-faults-hosps-rent-tragedy-article-1.743185|title=State Faults Hosps for 'Rent' Tragedy|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1996-12-13|author=Joe Nicholson and Anne Kornblut|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had been suffering severe [[angina pectoris|chest pains]], dizziness, and shortness of breath for several days prior to his death, but doctors at Cabrini Medical Center and [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital]] could not find signs of an aortic aneurysm even after doing a chest X-ray and [[electrocardiogram]] so they misdiagnosed it either as [[influenza|flu]] or [[Distress (medicine)|stress]].&lt;ref name="eve"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0DC143EF930A25751C1A960958260|title=On the Eve of a New Life, an Untimely Death|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=1996-12-13|author=Lawrence Van Gelder|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Rent'' played on Broadway at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] from its debut in April 1996 until it closed on September 7, 2008.&lt;ref name="rente"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/116252.html|title=Rent Extension: Hit Show Will Close Sept. 7|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=2008-03-26|author=Kenneth Jones|work=Playbill|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531134731/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/116252.html|archivedate=2008-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 11th longest running show in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/long-runs-on-broadway-109864 |title= Long Runs on Broadway |first=Robert |last=Viagas |date=November 10, 2015 |work=Playbill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, it has toured throughout the United States, Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, Australia, China, Singapore, Philippines, Mexico, Germany, Poland and throughout Europe as well as in other locations.  A [[Rent (film)|film version]] was released in 2005.

After his death, Larson's family and friends started the [[Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation]] to provide monetary grants to artists, especially musical theatre composers and writers, to support their creative work.  The Jonathan Larson Grants are now administered by the [[American Theatre Wing]], thanks to an endowment funded by the Foundation and the Larson Family.&lt;ref name="grants"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/arts/music/17arts-FOOTNOTES_BRF.html|title=Footnotes|date=2008-09-16|author=Julie Bloom|work=New York Times | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan's work was given to the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. in December 2003. The Jonathan Larson Collection is a new addition to its major holdings in the area of musical theater. The collection documents Larson's surprisingly prolific output, including numerous musicals, revues, cabarets, pop songs, dance and video projects – both produced and unproduced.

Less than three years after ''Rent'' closed on Broadway it was revived [[Off-Broadway]] at Stage 1 of [[New World Stages]] just outside the [[Theater District]]. The show was directed by Michael Greif who directed the original productions. The show went into previews on July 14, 2011 and opened August 11, 2011.

The list contains only confirmed deaths of [[Euromaidan]] participants, Ukrainian policemen and other killed by Euromaidan participants.

The first deaths occurred on [[Ukrainian unification day|Unity Day]], 22 January 2014, during [[2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots|riots]] on [[Hrushevskoho Street]] in [[Kiev]], where 3 Euromaidan activists were shot dead. On the same day, a dead body of another Euromaidan activist was found on the outskirts of the city; he was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] a day before with [[Ihor Lutsenko (politician)|Ihor Lutsenko]], who was released. These were the first victims to die in demonstrations in Ukraine since gaining national independence in 1991. The deaths caused [[Euromaidan#Protests across Ukraine|widespread protests across the country]]. On 23 January 2014, then Prime Minister [[Mykola Azarov]] in an interview with [[BBC]] said that police had not been issued firearms, and said no police officers were located on the rooftops around the protest area. He stated that the shooting of protesters was a provocation by extremist forces aimed at escalating violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukrainian/politics/2014/01/140122_azarov_interview_ko.shtml|script-title=uk:Микола Азаров: демонстрантів могли застрелити провокатори|newspaper=BBC Ukrainian|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=23 January 2014|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Party of Regions]] MP [[Arsen Klinchayev]] stated during a memorial service in [[Luhansk]] for those killed on 22 January by police, "These people were against the government. Nobody has the right to use physical force against police officers. And then they have their sticks, then stones, then something else. The police have the right to defend their lives. So I think it's right that these four people were killed. Moreover, I believe that you need to be stricter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25239158.html|script-title=uk:Луганський регіонал назвав правильною загибель людей у Києві|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=3 January 2014|accessdate=23 January 2014|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5 more deaths in connection with Euromaidan occurred between 25 January and 13 February.

'''Maria of Aragon''' (29 June 1482 &amp;ndash; 7 March 1517) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[infanta]], and [[queen consort]] of Portugal as the second spouse of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]].

==Life==
She was born at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] on 29 June 1482 as the third surviving daughter of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] (the [[Catholic monarchs]]). She was the fourth of their five surviving children, and had a stillborn twin sister named Anna.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=78}}

===Queen===
As an infanta of Spain, her hand in marriage was very important in European politics; before her marriage to Manuel I of Portugal, her parents entertained the idea of marrying her to King [[James IV of Scotland]].{{sfn|Bergenroth|1862|p=167-180}} This was at a time when her younger sister Catherine's marriage to [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], was being planned. Ferdinand and Isabella thought if Maria was Queen of Scotland, the two sisters could keep the peace between their husbands. These plans, however, came to nothing. Her eldest sister [[Isabella, Princess of Asturias (1470–1498)|Isabella, Princess of Asturias]], was the first wife of Manuel I, but her death in 1498 created a necessity for Manuel to remarry; Maria became the next bride of the Portuguese king, reaffirming dynastic links with Spanish royal houses.

Manuel and Maria were married in [[Alcácer do Sal Municipality|Alcácer do Sal]] on 30 October 1500,{{sfn|Howe|2008|p=53}} and was granted Viseu and Torres Vedras as her dower. She had 10 children, eight of whom reached adulthood, including King [[John III of Portugal]], [[Isabella of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Holy Roman Empress Isabella]], and [[Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy|Beatrice, Duchess of Savoy]].

Queen Maria became known as a fervent Catholic. She supported king Manuel's religious-imperial project, including the plan to conquer the Mamluk's realm, destroy [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] and reconquer Christian holy places such as Jerusalem. She co-founded the Jeronimos Monastery in Lisbon.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=79}}

Maria died in [[Lisbon]] on 7 March 1517, and was buried at the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] of [[Belém]]. She died as a result of her last pregnancy.

==Legacy==
In 1580, the dynastic links from the marriage led to a [[ Portuguese succession crisis of 1580 | succession crisis]] in [[Portugal]] that made [[Philip II of Spain]] king of Portugal as Philip I of Portugal.

'''''Martialis heureka''''' is a [[species]] of [[ant]] discovered in 2000 from the [[Amazon rainforest]] near [[Manaus, Brazil]]. It was described as a new species and placed as the [[Monotypic taxon|sole member]] of a new [[subfamily]], '''Martialinae'''.&lt;ref name="AntCat"&gt;{{AntCat|430174|''Martialis''|2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generic name means "from [[Mars]]" and was given due to its unusual [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and the [[Specific name (zoology)|species epithet]] ''[[Eureka (word)|heureka]]'' indicates the surprising discovery. It belongs to the oldest known distinct lineage to have diverged from the ancestors of all other ants.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt;

==Etymology==
The aberrant features of this ant led Stefan P. Cover and [[Edward O. Wilson]] to comment that it was an ant that had to be from Mars. The genus name, then, refers to the planet Mars, alluding to the strange characteristics that seem to come from nowhere; the species epithet is from [[Ancient Greek]] [[Eureka (word)|ηὕρηκα]] "I found it", echoing [[Archimedes]]' famous exclamation, meant to epitomize the troubles involved in the rediscovery of the species after the first specimen discovered in a soil sample was lost.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt;

==Discovery==
Two specimens were first discovered by Manfred Verhaagh of the [[Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde]] in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, in 2000, but they were damaged, and a new specimen was collected in 2003 by Christian Rabeling, a graduate student of the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Rabeling|first2=Jeremy M.|last2=Brown|first3=Manfred|last3=Verhaagh|title=Newly discovered sister lineage sheds light on early ant evolution|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.|year=2008|volume=105|pages=14913–14917|doi=10.1073/pnas.0806187105|pmid=18794530|issue=39|pmc=2567467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Martialis heureka CASENT0106181 0.jpg|thumb|left|Head of a worker]]
Like all members of the family Formicidae, these ants have distinctive elbowed antennae, prominent metapleural glands, and  distinctive [[Petiole (insect anatomy)|petioles]]. The ants, though, lack compound eyes, are pale in colour, and lead a subterranean life, preying on small litter organisms. The workers have unusual, elongated [[mandible]]s, distinctly [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] in their features.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt;

Based on the morphology, the authors suggested the ants lead an underground life, possibly foraging on the surface during the night. The first two specimens were found in soil core samples,while another was found in leaf litter. They probably make use of pre-existing underground cavities,as their legs do not show adaptations for digging.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt;

'''''Miracles from Heaven: A Little Girl, Her Journey to Heaven, and Her Amazing Story of Healing''''' is a memoir written by an American author Christy Beam, released on April 14, 2015. The author wrote the book about her daughter Annabel Beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Miracles From Heaven': Near-Fatal Fall Cures Sick Little Girl's Symptoms|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/04/14/miracles-heaven-near-fatal-fall-cures-sick-little-girls-symptoms|accessdate=July 20, 2015|work=foxnews.com|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The book is about the author's 10-year-old daughter Annabel Beam, who was diagnosed with a rare terminal stomach disorder. While on a visit home from the hospital she fell while climbing a tree with her older sister, a branch gave way sending Annabel 30 feet down headfirst into the hollow trunk of a cottonwood tree. She was inside the trunk of the tree for several hours where she visits with Jesus who tells her she will be fine. She is finally rescued and taken to a hospital. She woke up at the hospital without any broken bones or internal injuries. After this incident, she no longer felt pain due to her stomach disorder and her doctor confirmed that her rare disease was somehow miraculously cured.

'''''My Beautiful Broken Brain''''' is a 2014 documentary film about the life of 34-year-old Lotje Sodderland after she suffered a [[Stroke#Hemorrhagic stroke|hemorrhagic stroke]] as a result of a congenital vascular malformation in November 2011, initially experiencing [[aphasia]], the complete loss of her ability to read, write, or speak coherently.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2016-03-12/sxsw-film-review-my-beautiful-broken-brain/ |title=SXSW Film Review: My Beautiful Broken Brain |last=Cape |first=Jessi |date=12 March 2016 |website=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Lynch]] became an executive producer of the film.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

== Content ==

The film starts with a recap of the intracerebral hemorrhage (stroke) and subsequent emergency brain surgery on her parietal and temporal lobes, and follows the life of its protagonist, London resident Lotje Sodderland, in the year that followed, documenting the progress of her recovery and the major setbacks she experienced.&lt;ref name="guardian_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newyork"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliver|first1=Simone S.|title=At SXSW, a Woman Who Had a Stroke Turns Director|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/movies/my-beautiful-broken-brain.html?_r=0|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lotje covers some of the daily challenges that she experienced after sustaining injury to her brain through the stroke, not just with dysphasia and apraxia while communicating through expressive verbal language, reading and writing, but also the memory deficits, confusion, cognitive processing and sensory perception changes, over-sensitivity to noise and the sensations of overwhelm, fatigue, frustration, and at times discouragement about future considering the changes in her life. The valuable support provided by her family and friends during this journey of recovery was featured prominently in this documentary. Through extensive in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation that included occupational therapy, speech therapy, visits with both a psychologist and psychiatrist, she makes a profound recovery, despite the post-seizure regression she experienced following the experimental Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aphasia.org/stories/my-beautiful-broken-brain/ |title=My beautiful broken brain |date=22 March 2016 |website=Aphasia.org |publisher=National Aphasia Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718100922/https://www.aphasia.org/stories/my-beautiful-broken-brain/ |archive-date=18 July 2017 |dead-url=no |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lotje began recording video-selfies just a few days after the stroke, while still in the hospital. Large parts of the film consist of material filmed by herself on her iPhone. This together with various sequences showing the world from her [[Point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] at that time, including for example visual misperceptions (hallucinations), produce a rather personal storytelling style.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wills|first1=Kate|title=My Beautiful Broken Brain: The amazing collaboration of David Lynch and a woman who 'video-selfied' her stroke|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/my-beautiful-broken-brain-the-amazing-collaboration-of-david-lynch-and-a-woman-who-video-selfied-her-a6937571.html|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vans|first1=Katy|title=My Beautiful Broken Brain review - moving study of life after stroke|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/blog/2015/jun/10/my-beautiful-broken-brain-review-documentary-moving-study-of-life-after-stroke|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=4 August 2016|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyork" /&gt;

== Production ==

The film was initiated by its protagonist itself. According to herself, making a film about her struggles was the first linear thought she had after the stroke.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/22/it-felt-as-if-i-had-become-fear-itself-life-after-a-stroke-at-34 |title=I felt as if I had become fear itself |last=Sodderland |first=Lotje |date=22 November 2014 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She started taking video-selfies of herself while still in hospital, and two weeks later contacted documentary filmmaker Sophie Robinson to enlist her help.

Funding for editing and post-production was collected via [[Kickstarter]] between November 28 and December 20, 2013. The initial goal of £30,000 was exceeded by £7340.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mybbb/my-beautiful-broken-brain/description|title=My Beautiful Broken Brain|accessdate=3 August 2016|work=[[Kickstarter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
''My Beautiful Broken Brain'' had its world premiere at the 2014 [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]], where it won the DOC U award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.idfa.nl/en/info/winners |title=Award winners |website=Idfa.nl |publisher=[[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Netflix]] started streaming the film as a Netflix Original worldwide on March 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-david-lynch-my-beautiful-broken-brain-documentary-1201698339/ |title=Netflix Picks Up ‘My Beautiful Broken Brain’ Documentary from David Lynch |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=5 February 2016 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''My Pokémon Ranch'''''|みんなのポケモン牧場|Minna no Pokemon Bokujō|Everyone's Pokémon Ranch}} is a [[Pokémon]] [[video game]] developed for the [[Wii]] by [[Ambrella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonintendo.com/?p=27103 |title=Blog Archive » Ambrella behind Pokemon Farm |publisher=GoNintendo |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''My Pokémon Ranch'' was released via the [[WiiWare]] download service on March 25, 2008 in Japan, in the Americas on June 9, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wii-kly Update: One WiiWare game and two Virtual Console games added to Wii Shop Channel|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/index.php/press-releases/read/wii-kly-update-one-wiiware-game-and-two-virtual-console-games-added-to-wii-shop-channel-10/061572|agency=Games Press|work=MCV|date=2008-06-09|accessdate=2011-10-09|quote=Nintendo adds new and classic games to the Wii Shop Channel at 9 a.m. Pacific time every Monday. […] This week's new games are: […] My Pokémon Ranch (Nintendo, 1 player, Rated E for Everyone-Comic Mischief, 1,000 Wii Points)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe on July 4, 2008.

This game only works with [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] versions; the Japanese version was updated to receive Pokémon from ''[[Pokémon Platinum]]''.

==Overview==
[[File:My Pokémon Ranch Screenshot.JPG|''My Pokémon Ranch'' Screenshot|thumb|left]]''My Pokémon Ranch'' is similar in concept to [[Pokémon Box]], and allows players to transfer up to 1,500 of their [[Pokémon]] (if they have the Platinum update; without it the limit is 1,000) from up to eight separate [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] Nintendo DS game cards, to a ranch run by Hayley, a friend of Bebe who runs the PC box system in these versions. Here, they can view their Pokémon rendered in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], while using their [[Mii]]s to interact with them.

Players do not need to own ''Pokémon Diamond'', ''Pearl'' or ''Platinum'' to play ''My Pokémon Ranch''. Players with or without the [[Nintendo DS]] game will be given six starter Pokémon and a new Pokémon at the start of each day. Additionally, each day Hayley will give the player requests for certain Pokémon not in the player's [[Pokédex]] to be added to the ranch, along with instructions on where to find them in ''Diamond'', ''Pearl'' and ''Platinum''. It has also been confirmed that players can obtain a special [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]] and [[Phione]]. Hayley can also trade certain Pokémon she already has in her possession. Eventually, adding more Pokémon to the ranch unlocks new features to the game and expands the ranch.&lt;ref name=gamesradar&gt;{{cite web|author=Words: Carolyn Gudmundson, GamesRadar US |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/wii/pokemon-farm-wiiware/preview/everyones-pokemon-ranch-hands-on/a-20080404115637366031/g-2007101111043437098 |title=Everyone's Pokemon Ranch - hands-on |publisher=Gamesradar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the actions in the [[Mii Channel]]'s plaza, the Pokémon on the ranch can perform different idle actions, such as talking, playing, and sleeping at other players' ranches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = My Pokemon Ranch :: WiiWare Game Review | work = | publisher = Kidzworld | url = http://www.kidzworld.com/article/14867-my-pokemon-ranch-wiiware-game-review | accessdate = 2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are also able to take snapshots of their Pokémon and send them to friends registered on their Wii, as well as downloading the photos in .JPG file to an SD card, and transfer them onto your computer or camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/142/14209901.html |title=IGN: Pokemon Farm |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]] shows the ability to monitor the time and the number of Pokémon in the ranch. Apart from storing collected Pokémon on the ranch, players are otherwise unable to further train or level up their Pokémon on the ranch.&lt;ref name=gamesradar/&gt;

==Updates==

On June 18, 2008 an update was made available for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonintendo.com/?p=46661 |title=&gt;&gt; Blog Archive &gt;&gt; My Pokemon Ranch - update available |publisher=GoNintendo |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another update was made available on November 5, 2008 in Japan to ensure compatibility with ''Pokémon Platinum'' and to improve and add some features, such as adding 500 more Pokémon, making a total amount of [[Pokémon]] go up to 1500.

===The Pokémon===

Most notably, as ''[[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl#Pokémon Platinum|Pokémon Platinum]]'' essentially introduces 7 new Pokémon in the manner of new forms of previous Pokémon and these can all be placed in Pokémon Ranch and have their forms remain while in the Ranch. However, this will have some effect on ''Pokémon Platinum''.

===Shaymin===

[[Shaymin]]'s alternate form is activated in a different manner than [[Giratina]]'s. If the player has the Gracidea in his or her game, the Ranch will recognize it and will unlock the Gracidea as a new toy in the Ranch. Shaymin will normally be Land Forme, however if the player gets the Gracidea and Shaymin touches it, it will transform into its Sky Forme for the duration of the player's Ranch visit. However, if the player removes Shaymin from the Ranch while it is in its Sky Forme, it will revert to Land Forme.

===Rotom===

In ''Pokémon Platinum'', [[Rotom]] was given five different forms. Each form represents Rotom possessing a different appliance. They will keep their form upon being transferred to Pokémon Ranch.

===The Ranch===

Various changes have occurred for the Ranch too, most notably, a 26th level of the ranch has been added, allowing you to deposit a total of 1500 Pokémon onto the Ranch. This does not give the player any extra rewards though.

===Animations &amp; Toys===

Also in the Ranch there are twelve more animations that the Pokémon will partake in should the screen be left idle. These include water races, wrestling tournaments between the fighting Pokémon, fights between Pokémon rivals (such as [[Zangoose]] vs. [[Seviper]], [[Dialga]] vs. [[Palkia]], [[Darkrai]] vs. [[Cresselia]], and so forth), and a Rotom animation utilizing all its formes.

Eleven new toys have also been added, including the aforementioned Gracidea Flower.

===Menu Options===

With this update it is possible to change the background music from the default.

It is now possible to store up to 30 in the game. It is now also possible to copy and delete photos over to or from the [[Secure Digital|SD card]] in bulk.

===Club Look-see===

There have also been some changes in regard to Club Look-see. Previously, you could only visit the NPC member's ranches whenever they visited yours and made an offer for you to go. With the ''Pokémon Platinum'' update however, the player now has the option of revisiting ranches that were previously visited. This adds more playability as you can check to see their unique Mii's and specific Ranches at any time.

The number of Club Look-see members has also been increased from 37 to 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/ranch/platinum.shtml |title=My Pokémon Ranch - Platinum Upgrades |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Overall, the game has received negative reviews, with an aggregate rating of 46 percent at [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/943658.asp |title=My Pokémon Ranch reviews at Game Rankings |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] was disappointed in the game and gave it a 4/10, believing the graphics to be ugly, citing "absolutely hideous" Pokémon models, and likening the gameplay to a [[screensaver]], claiming it to be a largely "sit-n-stare experience." However, they had some praise for the Nintendo DS connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Craig Harris |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/881/881343p1.html |title=IGN: My Pokémon Ranch Review |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; WiiWare World, who are currently known as Nintendo Life, also gave it a 4/10, calling it "half-assed" and "obtuse" and particularly noting the flawed nature of the Pokémon storage system. While they believed that it was "chock full" of missed potential, the game was still ideal for younger Pokémon fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wiiware.nintendolife.com/reviews/2008/06/my_pokemon_ranch |title=Review: My Pokémon Ranch (WiiWare) |publisher= Nintendo Life|date= 2008-06-10|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[Official Nintendo Magazine]] gave the game a below-average score of 48%, finding it hard to justify the 1000 Wii Points price, and believing the game only appeals to ''Pokémon'' completists. Not all reviews were negative, however; [[Nintendo Power]] gave it a "Recommended" when they reviewed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=4996 |title=Nintendo: Wii Reviews: My Pokémon Ranch |publisher=Officialnintendomagazine.co.uk |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palingenesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|l|ɪ|n|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ə|s|ɪ|s}}; also '''palingenesia''') is a concept of [[reincarnation|rebirth or re-creation]], used in various contexts in [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[politics]], and [[biology]]. Its meaning stems from Greek ''palin'', meaning ''again'', and ''genesis'', meaning ''birth''.

In biology, it is another word for [[recapitulation theory|recapitulation]]—the largely discredited hypothesis which talks of the phase in the development of an organism in which its form and structure pass through the changes undergone in the evolution of the species. In political theory, it is a central component of [[Roger Griffin]]'s analysis of Fascism as a fundamentally modernist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;R. Griffin, Modernism and Fascism (Basingstoke, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In theology, the word may refer to [[reincarnation]] or to Christian spiritual rebirth symbolized by baptism.

==Philosophy and theology==
The word ''palingenesis'' or rather ''palingenesia'' ({{lang-grc|παλιγγενεσία}}) may be traced back to the [[Stoicism|Stoic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/stoicorumveterum02arniuoft#page/190/mode/2up 2.627]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The concept is attributed to [[Chrysippus]] by [[Lactantius]] — see Harry Austryn Wolfson (1961), "Immortality and Resurrection in the Philosophy of the Church Fathers", in: Everett Ferguson (ed.), ''Doctrines of Human Nature, Sin, and Salvation in the Early Church'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1993, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', Cambridge University Press, 1978, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Albert Harrill, [https://www.academia.edu/1865923/Stoic_Physics_the_Universal_Conflagration_and_the_Eschatological_Destruction_of_the_Ignorant_and_Unstable_in_2_Peter "Stoic Physics, the Universal Conflagration, and the Eschatological Destruction of the “Ignorant and Unstable” in 2 Peter"], in: Tuomas Rasimus, Troels Engberg-Pedersen, Ismo Dunderberg (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lR2kxd17v44C&amp;dq= ''Stoicism in Early Christianity''], Baker Academic, 2010, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; who used the term for the continual re-[[creation myth|creation]] of the [[universe]]. Similarly [[Philo]] spoke of [[Noah]] and his sons as leaders of a renovation or rebirth of the earth, [[Plutarch]] of the [[transmigration of souls]], and [[Cicero]] of his own return from exile.

In the [[Gospel of Matthew]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|19:28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesus]] is quoted in Greek (although his historical utterance would most likely have been in [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]]) using the word "παλιγγενεσία" (''palingenesia'') to describe the [[Last Judgment]] foreshadowing the event of the regeneration of a new world. Palingenesia is thus as much the result of, or reason for, the Last Judgement as it is directly the Judgement itself.

In philosophy it denotes in its broadest sense the theory (e.g. of the [[Pythagoreans]]) that the human soul does not die with the body but is born again in new [[incarnation]]s. It is thus the equivalent of [[metempsychosis]]. The term has a narrower and more specific use in the system of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], who applied it to his doctrine that the will does not die but manifests itself afresh in new individuals. He thus repudiates the primitive metempsychosis doctrine which maintains the [[reincarnation]] of the particular soul.

[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], in ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1628), writes, "The Pythagoreans defend metempsychosis and palingenesia, that souls go from one body to another."

The 17th century English physician-philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (1643) declared a belief in palingenesis, stating,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A plant or vegetable consumed to ashes, to a contemplative and school Philosopher seems utterly destroyed, and the form to have taken his leave for ever: But to a sensible Artist the forms are not perished, but withdrawn into their incombustible part, where they lie secure from the action of that devouring element. This is made good by experience, which can from the ashes of a plant revive the plant, and from its cinders recall it into its stalk and leaves again.'&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne, ''The Major Works'', ed. C. A. Patrides, Penguin, 1977, R.M.1:48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Palingenesis is the subject of the Argentine author [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s last ever short story, ''The Rose of Paracelsus'' (1983)

==Politics and history==
In [[Antiquities of the Jews]] (11.3.9) [[Josephus]] used the term ''palingenesis'' for the national restoration of the [[Jew]]s in their homeland after the [[Babylonian exile]]. The term is commonly used in [[Modern Greek]] to refer to the rebirth of the Greek nation after the [[Greek Revolution]]. British political theorist [[Roger Griffin]] has coined the term ''[[palingenetic ultranationalism]]'' as a core tenet of [[fascism]], stressing the notion of fascism as an ideology of rebirth of a [[sovereign state|state]] or [[empire]] in the image of that which came before it – its ancestral political underpinnings. Examples of this are [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascism .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Under [[Benito Mussolini]], Italy purported to establish an empire as the second incarnation of the [[Roman Empire]], while [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime was seen{{By whom|date=December 2015}} as being the third palingenetic incarnation of the German "Reich" - beginning first with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ("First Reich"), followed by Bismarck's [[German Empire]] ("Second Reich") and then Nazi Germany ("Third Reich").

Moreover, Griffin's work on palingenesis in fascism analysed the pre-war [[Fin de siècle|Fin De Siecle]] Western society. In doing so he built on Frank Kermode's work ''The Sense of an Ending'' which sought to understand the belief in the death of society at the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kermode, ''The Sense of an Ending: Studies in Theory and Fiction'' (Oxford, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this death and rebirth Fascism sought to target what it perceived as degenerative elements of society, notably decadence, materialism, rationalism and enlightenment ideology. Out of this death society would regenerate by returning to a more spiritual and emotional state, with the role of the individual core. This built on the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Gustave Le Bon]] and [[Henri Bergson]]'s work on the relationship between the mass and the individual with the individual's actions necessary to achieving a state of regeneration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] expressed his [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat|post-coup]] [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|project in government]] as a national rebirth inspired in [[Diego Portales]], a figure of the early republic:&lt;ref&gt;[http://beersandpolitics.com/discursos/augusto-pinochet/a-un-mes-de-la-constitucion-de-la-junta-de-gobierno/1000 Pinochet's discourse of 11 October 1973].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|...[democracy] will be born again purified from the vices and bad habits that ended up destroying our institutions... ...we are inspired in the [[Diego Portales|Portalian spirit]] which has fused together the nation...|author=Augusto Pinochet, 11 October 1973.}}

==Science==
In modern biology (e.g. [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] and [[Fritz Müller]]), ''palingenesis'' has been used for the exact reproduction of ancestral features by inheritance, as opposed to [[kenogenesis]], in which the inherited characteristics are modified by environment.

It was also applied to the quite different process supposed by [[Karl Beurlen]] to be the mechanism for his [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levit, Georgy S |author2=Olsson, Lennart |date=2007 |title=Evolution on Rails Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis |editor=Wisseman, Volker |work=Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 11/2006 |pages=115–119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJso832AGXEC&amp;pg=PA118 |publisher=Universitätsverlag Göttingen |isbn=978-3-938616-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic ship title||Patria|disaster}}
[[File:Sinking of the Patria (1940).jpg|thumb|299px|SS ''Patria'' sinking in Haifa port]]
The '''''Patria'' disaster''' was the sinking on 25 November 1940 by the Jewish paramilitary organization [[Haganah]] of a French-built [[ocean liner]], the 11,885-ton {{SS|Patria|1913|6}}, in the [[port of Haifa]], killing 267 people and injuring 172.&lt;ref name="jewishsf"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/16938/deaths-of-260-in-1940-ship-explosion-commemorated/ |title=Deaths of 260 in 1940 ship explosion commemorated |date=14 December 2001 |work=JWeekly.com |publisher=San Francisco Jewish Community Publications Inc |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the sinking, ''Patria'' was carrying about 1,800 Jewish refugees from [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied Europe]] whom the British authorities were deporting from [[Mandatory Palestine]] to [[Mauritius]] because they lacked entry permits. [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations opposed the deportation, and the underground paramilitary Haganah group planted a bomb intended to disable the ship to prevent it from leaving Haifa.

The Haganah claims to have miscalculated the effects of the explosion. The bomb blew the steel frame off one full side of the ship and the ship sank in less than 16 minutes, trapping hundreds in the hold. The British allowed the survivors to remain in Palestine on humanitarian grounds. Who was responsible and the true reason why ''Patria'' sank remained controversial mysteries until 1957, when [[Munya Mardor]], the person who planted the bomb, published a book about his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mardor |first=Munya Meir |year=1970 |origyear=1957 |title=Shelihut Alumah: Pirke Mivtsaim Meyuhadim Be-Maarkhot Ha-Haganah |location=Tel Aviv |publisher=Tseva haganah le-Yisrael, Hotsaat Maarakhot: Misrad ha-bitahon |language=hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the government of [[Nazi Germany]] decided in 1941 to [[Final Solution|exterminate all Jews in Europe]], its policy allowed the reduction of Jewish numbers in Europe by emigration.&lt;ref name=Friendlander&gt;{{cite book | author = Saul Friedländer | title = The Years of Extermination—Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939–1945 | page = 286 | publisher = Harper-Collins | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish organizations, both mainstream and dissident, ran operations that tried to bring Jews from Europe to Palestine in violation of the [[White Paper of 1939|immigration rules]] applied by the British government.

This required cooperation with the Nazi authorities, who saw the opportunity to make trouble for Britain as well as to get rid of Jews. The ''Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung'' ([[Central Office for Jewish Emigration]] or ZjA) worked under the supervision of [[Adolf Eichmann]], organizing Jewish emigration from the Nazi-controlled parts of Europe. In September 1940 the ZjA chartered three ships, {{SS|Pacific|1880|6}}, {{SS|Milos|1878|6}} and {{SS|Atlantic|1885|6}}, to take Jewish refugees from the Romanian port of [[Tulcea]] to Palestine. Their passengers consisted of about 3,600 refugees from the Jewish communities of [[Vienna]], [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] and [[Prague]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

''Pacific'' reached Palestinian waters on 1 November, followed by ''Milos'' a few days later. The [[Royal Navy]] intercepted the ships and escorted them to the port of Haifa. Warned in advance of the ships' arrival, the British [[Colonial Office]] was determined to refuse entry to the immigrants. With the security situation in the region improving following British successes in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], the Colonial Office decided it was less risky to provoke Jewish anger than to risk an [[Arab]] revolt, and that an example would be made to dissuade other potential immigrants from making the attempt.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir [[Harold MacMichael]], issued a deportation order on 20 November, ordering that the refugees be taken to the British Indian Ocean territory of Mauritius and the [[Caribbean]] territory of [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |authorlink=Yehuda Bauer |year=1981 |title=American Jewry and the Holocaust |location= |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |isbn=0-8143-1672-7 |pages=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refugees were transferred to another ship, SS ''Patria'', for the voyage to [[Mauritius]]. ''Patria'' was an 11,885-ton [[ocean liner]] dating from 1913 that the French company [[Messageries Maritimes]] ran between [[Marseille]] and the [[Levant]]. She had reached the [[Port of Haifa]] shortly before [[Italian invasion of France|Italy declared war on France and Britain]], and then remained in port for safety. After the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|French surrender to Nazi Germany]] the British authorities in Haifa first detained ''Patria'' and then seized her for use as a [[troop ship]]. As a civilian liner she was permitted to carry 805 people including her crew,&lt;ref name=Pitot83/&gt; but after being requisitioned she was authorised to carry 1,800 troops (excluding the crew).&lt;ref name=Pitot83&gt;{{cite book |last=Pitot |first=Geneviève |year=2000 |title=The Mauritian Shekel: The Story of Jewish Detainees in Mauritius, 1940–1945 |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=0-7425-0855-2 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; She still only had enough lifeboats for the original 805 passengers and crew, so these were supplemented with [[Lifeboat (shipboard)#Liferaft versus lifeboat|liferafts]].&lt;ref name=Pitot83/&gt;

The refugees from ''Pacific'' and ''Milos'' were soon transferred to ''Patria''. ''Atlantic'' arrived on 24 November and the transfer of eight hundred of its 1,645 passengers began.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Disaster==
[[File:Patria disaster graves.jpg|thumb|Graves of some of the victims of the sinking]]
Meanwhile, Zionist organizations were considering how to thwart the deportation plan. A [[general strike]] had little effect. The [[Irgun]] tried unsuccessfully to place a bomb on ''Patria'' to disable her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=J. Bowyer |authorlink=J. Bowyer Bell |year=1996 |title=Terror Out of Zion: The Fight for Israeli Independence |location=Piscataway, NJ |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |isbn=1-56000-870-9 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haganah also sought to disable ''Patria'', with the intention of forcing her to stay in port for repairs and thus gaining time to press the British to rescind the deportation order. The Haganah officer in charge of the operation was [[Yitzhak Sadeh]], authorised by [[Moshe Sharett]], who led the Political Department of the [[Jewish Agency]] in the temporary absence of [[David Ben-Gurion]], who had left for the United States on 22 September and did not return until 13 February 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friling |first=Tuvia |year=2005 |title=Arrows in the Dark: David Ben-Gurion, the Yishuv leadership, and Rescue Attempts During the Holocaust |location=Madison, WI |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |isbn=978-0-299-17550-4 |pages=40, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November Haganah agents smuggled a {{convert|2|kg|adj=on}} bomb aboard the ship, timed to explode at 9 p.m. that day. It failed, so a second, more powerful bomb was smuggled aboard on 24 November and hidden next to the ship's inner hull. At 9 a.m. on 25 November, it exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penkower |first=Monty Noam |year=2002 |title=Decision on Palestine Deferred: America, Britain and Wartime Diplomacy |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-7146-5268-7 |pages=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haganah had miscalculated the effect of the charge and it blew a large hole measuring {{convert|3|x|2|m|ft}} in the ship's side, sinking her in only 16 minutes.&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stein |first=Leslie |year=2003 |title=The Hope Fulfilled: The Rise of Modern Israel |location=Westport, CN |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=0-275-97141-4 |pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the bomb exploded, ''Patria'' was carrying 1,770 refugees transferred from ''Pacific'' and ''Milos'' and had taken on board 134 passengers from ''Atlantic''. Most were rescued by British and Arab boats that rushed to the scene.&lt;ref name="Chazan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chazan |first=Meir |year=2003 |title=The Patria Affair: Moderates vs. Activists in Mapai in the 1940s |journal=Journal of Israeli History |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=61–95 |publisher= |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1080/13531040312331287644}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 267 people were declared missing – over 200 Jewish refugees&lt;ref name="jewishsf"/&gt; plus 50 crew and British soldiers – and another 172 were injured. Many of the dead were trapped in ''Patria''{{'}}s hold and were unable to escape as she rolled on her side and sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ofer |first=Dalia |year=1990 |title=Escaping the Holocaust: Illegal Immigration to the Land of Israel, 1939–1944 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-506340-6 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 209 bodies were eventually recovered and buried in Haifa.&lt;ref name=Perl&gt;{{cite book |last=Perl |first=William R. |authorlink=William R.

==Aftermath==
The surviving refugees from ''Patria'', together with the remaining 1,560 passengers of ''Atlantic'', were taken to the [[Atlit detainee camp]].  Later, after an international campaign, the survivors of ''Patria'' were given permits to stay in Palestine. However, the other ''Atlantic'' passengers were deported to Mauritius on 9 December. After the war they were given the choice of where to go; 81% chose Palestine and arrived there in August 1945.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In December 1945 ''Ha-Po'el ha-Tza'ir'' ("Young Worker") a [[Mapai]] party newspaper, commented ''"On one bitter and impetuous day, a malicious hand sank the ship"''. The comment was written by the deputy editor, Israel Cohen, who did not know that all of the people responsible were Mapai leaders.&lt;ref name="Chazan"/&gt; Angered by the newspaper's comments, some Haganah leaders sent Ben-Gurion's son Amos to the newspaper office where he slapped the editor, Isaac Lofven, across the face.&lt;ref name="Chazan"/&gt;

[[File:Patria ruins.jpg|thumb|A nameplate preserved from ''Patria'']]
A bitter debate over the correctness of the operation raged in secret within the Zionist leadership. The decision had been made by an activist faction, without consulting more moderate members according to normal procedure, and this caused serious internal divisions that persisted for many years. An effort was made to enshrine the incident as an icon of Zionist determination, but this largely failed.&lt;ref name="Chazan"/&gt; As early as 15 December 1945 Isaac Lofven warned a Mapai meeting against trying to ''"sanctify"'' the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | place = [[Israel|IL]] | url = http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-33313-00.html?tag=22-42-26 |script-title=he:היד הזדונית |trans-title=Malicious Hand | newspaper=[[News1]] |language=Hebrew |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leaders of the [[Yishuv]] (the Jewish community in Palestine) argued that the loss of life had not been in vain, as ''Patria''{{'}}s survivors had been allowed to stay in the country. Others declared that the Haganah had had no right to risk the lives of the immigrants, as they had not decided of their own free will to become participants in the underground Jewish conflict with the British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ofer |first=Dalia |editor-last=Lentin |editor-first=Ronit |editor-link=Ronit Lentin |year=2004 |chapter=A Dual Perspective: Yaakov Shabtai and the Historian's Account of the Deportation to Mauritius |title=Re-presenting the Shoah for the Twenty-first Century |location=New York |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |isbn=1-57181-802-2 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haganah's role was not publicly revealed and a story was put out that the deportees, out of despair, had sunk the ship themselves (the version recounted, for example, by [[Arthur Koestler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koestler |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |year=1983 |origyear=1949 |title=Promise and Fulfilment – Palestine 1917–1949 |location=London |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |isbn=0333351525 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For years Britain believed the Irgun was probably responsible.

The Haganah's role was finally publicly disclosed in 1957 when Munya Mardor, the operative who had planted the bomb, wrote an account of his activities in the Jewish underground.  He recounted, ''"There was never any intent to cause the ship to sink.  The British would have used this against the Jewish population and show it as an act of sabotage against the war effort"''.&lt;ref name = "feld"&gt;{{cite news | last= Feld | first= Eva | place = IL |date=August 2001 | title = The Story of the S/S Patria |url= http://www.jewishmag.co.il/46mag/patria/patria.htm | newspaper = Jewish Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nasr |first= Kameel B | year= 1997 | title = Arab and Israeli Terrorism |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Co]] | isbn = 0-7864-0280-6 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that it was in the highest interest of the Haganah to fight the sanctions of the British [[White Paper of 1939]], and the primary objective was to avoid casualties.&lt;ref name = "feld" /&gt; The British estimated 267 people were killed,&lt;ref name=Perl/&gt; but neither the Jewish Agency nor the Haganah could establish how many people escaped the sinking and how many had died.&lt;ref name="feld" /&gt;

Munya Mardor continued to work at the port in order to remove suspicion from himself.&lt;ref name = "feld" /&gt; The Haganah also put up an investigative body to find out why such a relatively small amount of explosives could create such a large hole in the ship. The Haganah investigators concluded that the boat's superstructure was in poor condition, and therefore unable to withstand the pressure of the explosion.&lt;ref name = "feld" /&gt;

Rudolf Hirsch, a Jewish-German writer who had emigrated to Palestine in 1939, was a close associate of [[Arnold Zweig]] there, and later remigrated with Zweig to [[East Germany]], published a novel about the incident, ''Patria Israel'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirsch |first=Rudolf |year=1983 |title=Patria Israel |location=Rudolstadt | publisher =Greifenverlag |isbn=3-7352-0071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he also explicitly refers to Mardor's account.

'''Pietro Aretino''' (19 or 20 April 1492 – 21 October 1556) was an Italian author, playwright, poet, satirist and blackmailer, who wielded influence on contemporary art and politics and developed modern [[erotic literature|literary pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Notably in ''The School of Whoredom'', ''The Ragionamenti: The lives of nuns, the lives of married women, the lives of courtesans'' and his bawdy ''Dialoghi''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=pornography(?) not supported by text or any references|date=November 2018}}

==Life==
His father was Luca Del Tura, a shoemaker from Arezzo, who abandoned his family to join the militia. The father later returned to Arezzo, finally dying in poverty at the age of 85, unforgiven by his son, who never acknowledged the paternal name, taking 'Aretino' (that is 'of or pertaining to Arezzo') as a surname.

His mother was Margherita, known as Tita, Bonci.  Either before or after the abandonment (we do not know which), she entered into a lasting relationship with a local noble, Luigi Bacci, who supported Tita, Pietro and his two sisters and brought up Pietro as part of his own family.&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

Aretino spent a formative decade in Perugia, before being sent, highly recommended, to Rome. There [[Agostino Chigi]], the rich banker and patron of [[Raphael]], took him under his wing.

When [[Hanno (elephant)|Hanno the elephant]], pet of [[Pope Leo X]], died in 1516, Aretino penned a satirical pamphlet entitled "The Last Will and Testament of the Elephant Hanno". The fictitious will cleverly mocked the leading political and religious figures of Rome at the time, including [[Pope Leo X]] himself. The pamphlet was such a success that it started Aretino's career and established him as a famous satirist, ultimately known as "the Scourge of Princes".

Aretino prospered, living from hand to mouth as a hanger-on in the literate circle of his patron, sharpening his satirical talents on the gossip of politics and the [[Roman Curia|Papal Curia]], and turning the coarse Roman [[pasquinade]] into a rapier weapon of satire, until his sixteen ribald ''Sonetti Lussuriosi'' (Lust Sonnets) written to accompany [[Giulio Romano]]'s exquisitely beautiful but utterly pornographic series of drawings engraved by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] under the title ''[[I Modi]]'' finally caused such outrage that he had to temporarily flee Rome.

After Leo's death in 1521, his patron was [[Cardinal Giulio de' Medici]], whose competitors for the papal throne felt the sting of Aretino's scurrilous lash. The installation of the Dutch pope [[Adrian VI]] ("la tedesca tigna" in Pietro's words) instead encouraged Aretino to seek new patrons away from Rome, mainly with [[Federico II Gonzaga]] in [[Mantua]], and with the [[condottieri|condottiero]] [[Giovanni dalle Bande Nere|Giovanni de' Medici]] ("Giovanni delle Bande Nere"). The election of his old Medici patron as [[Pope Clement VII]] sent him briefly back to Rome, but death threats and an attempted assassination from one of the victims of his pen, Bishop Giovanni Giberti, in July 1525, set him wandering through northern Italy in the service of various noblemen, distinguished by his wit, audacity and brilliant and facile talents, until he settled permanently in 1527, in [[Venice]], ''the'' anti-Papal city of Italy, "seat of all vices" Aretino noted with gusto.

[[Image:PietroAretinoTitian.JPG|thumb|left|[[Portrait of Pietro Aretino]], by [[Titian]], 1545 ([[Palazzo Pitti]])]]

He was a lover of men, having declared himself "a sodomite" since birth. In a letter to Giovanni de' Medici written in 1524 Aretino enclosed a satirical poem saying that due to a sudden aberration he had "fallen in love with a female cook and temporarily switched from boys to girls..." (''My Dear Boy''). In his comedy ''Il marescalco'', the lead man is overjoyed to discover that the woman he has been forced to marry is really a page boy in disguise. While at court in Mantua he developed a crush on a young man called Bianchino, and annoyed Duke Federico with a request to plead with the boy on the writer's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Hale, ''Titian: His Life'', HarperPress, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Safe in Venice, Aretino became a blackmailer, extorting money from men who had sought his guidance in vice. He "kept all that was famous in Italy in a kind of state of siege", in [[Jakob Burckhardt]]'s estimation. [[Francis I of France]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] pensioned him at the same time, each hoping for some damage to the reputation of the other. "The rest of his relations with the great is mere beggary and vulgar extortion," according to Burckhardt. Addison states that "he laid half Europe under contribution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/spectator/text/march1711/no23.html Spectator 203], March 27, 1711.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"His literary talent, his clear and sparkling style, his varied observation of men and things, would have made him a considerable writer under any circumstances, destitute as he was of the power of conceiving a genuine work of art, such as a true dramatic comedy; and to the coarsest as well as the most refined malice he added a grotesque wit so brilliant that in some cases it does not fall short of that of Rabelais."''
::—Jacob Burckhardt, ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'', 1855.

Apart from both sacred and profane texts—a satire of high-flown [[Renaissance]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] [[dialogue]]s is set in a [[brothel]] — and comedies such as ''La cortigiana'' and ''La talenta'', Aretino is remembered above all for his letters, full of literary flattery that could turn to [[blackmail]]. They circulated widely in manuscript and he collected them and published them at intervals winning as many enemies as it did fame, and earned him the dangerous nickname [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]] gave him: ''flagello dei principi'' ("scourge of princes"). The first English translations of some of Aretino's racier material have been coming onto the market recently.

''La cortigiana'' is a brilliant parody of [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier|Il Cortegiano]]'', and features the adventures of a Sienese gentleman, Messer Maco, who travels to Rome to become a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. He would also like to win himself a mistress, but when he falls in love with a girl he sees in a window, he realizes that only as a courtier would he be able to win her. In mockery of Castiglione's advice on how to become the perfect courtier, a charlatan proceeds to teach Messer Maco how to behave as a courtier: he must learn how to deceive and flatter, and sit hours in front of the mirror.

Aretino was a close friend of [[Titian]], who painted his [[portrait]] (''illustrations'') at least three times. The early portrait is a psychological study of alarming modernity. Clement VII made Aretino a [[Knights Hospitaller|Knight of Rhodes]], and [[Julius III]] named him a Knight of St. Peter, but the chain he wears for his 1545 portrait may have merely been jewelry. In his strictly-for-publication letters to patrons Aretino would often add a verbal portrait to Titian's painted one.

Aretino is frequently mentioned in English works of the Elizabethan and later periods and differently appreciated, in comments ranging from 'It was one of the wittiest knaves that ever God made' of [[Thomas Nashe|Nashe]] (''The Unfortunate Traveller'') to 'that notorious ribald of Arezzo' of Milton (''Areopagitico'') &lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th edition, ed. Margaret Drabble (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 39 &lt;/ref&gt;

He is said to have died of suffocation from "[[Death from laughter|laughing too much]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waterfield|first=Gordon, ed. |title=First Footsteps in East Africa|location=New York|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1966|page=59 footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English traveller [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Reresby]] visited "the obscene profane poet" Aretino's grave in [[San Luca, Venice]] in the mid-1650s. He relates that the following epitaph had been removed by the [[Inquisition|inquisitors]]: "''Qui jace Aretin, poeta Tusco, qui dice mal d'ogni uno fuora di Dio; scusandosi dicendo, Io no'l cognosco."'' This he translates as "Here Aretin, the Tuscan poet, lies, who all the world abused but God, and why? he said he knew him not."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ivatt, M. A., ed: ''The Memoir and Travels of Sir John Reresby, Bart.'' (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1904), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the epitaph, in [[hendecasyllable]]s a maiore, was a sarcastic one, attributed to Catholic Bishop [[Paolo Giovio]], composed when Aretino was still alive&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WX8bTsz0NcC&amp;dq=%22Di%20tutti%20disse%20mal%20fuorch%C3%A9%20di%20Cristo%22&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Di%20tutti%20disse%20mal%20fuorch%C3%A9%20di%20Cristo%22&amp;f=false Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi], ''Scritti'', Le Monnier, 1848, p. 188)&lt;/ref&gt;:
:''Qui giace l'Aretin, poeta tosco:''
:''Di tutti disse mal fuorché di Cristo,''
:''Scusandosi col dir: non lo conosco''.

==Legacy==
In 2007, the composer [[Michael Nyman]] set some of Aretino's ''Sonetti lussuriosi'' to music under the title ''[[8 Lust Songs: I Sonetti Lussuriosi|8 Lust Songs]]''. Once again, Aretino's texts proved controversial:  at a 2008 performance at [[Cadogan Hall]], London, the printed programs were withdrawn following allegations of obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_news.php?id=993 |title=Classical Music News: The Classical Source News: Michael Nyman Festival Controversy: Classical Music News |publisher=Classicalsource.com |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4829">A '''reproductive system disease''' is any [[disease]] of the [[reproductive system]].

==Types==

===Infections===
'''Reproductive tract infection''' ('''RTI''') are [[infections]] that affect the [[reproductive tract]], which is part of the [[Reproductive System]]. For females, reproductive tract infections can affect the upper reproductive tract ([[fallopian tubes]], [[ovary]] and [[uterus]]) and the lower reproductive tract (vagina, cervix and [[vulva]]); for males these infections affect the [[penis]], [[testicles]], [[urethra]] or the [[vas deferens]]. The three types of reproductive tract infections are [[endogenous infections]], [[iatrogenic infections]] and the more commonly known [[sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/RTIFacsheetsRev.pdf Reproductive Tract Infections: An Introductory Overview], from [[Population Council]]. Retrieved January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Each has its own specific causes and [[symptoms]], caused by a bacterium, virus, fungus or other organism. Some infections are easily treatable and can be cured, some are more difficult, and some are non curable such as [[AIDS]] and [[herpes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engenderhealth.org/wh/inf/drti.html HIV, AIDS, and Sexually Transmitted Infections], at [[EngenderHealth]]. Retrieved January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congenital abnormalities===
Examples of [[congenital abnormalities]] of the reproductive system include:
*[[Kallmann syndrome]] - Genetic disorder causing decreased functioning of the sex hormone-producing glands caused by a deficiency  or both testes from the scrotum.
*[[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] - A genetic disorder causing people who are genetically male (i.e. XY chromosome pair) to develop sexually as a female due to an inability to utilize androgen.
*[[Intersexuality]] - A person who has genitalia and/or other sexual traits which are not clearly male or female.

===Examples of cancers===
Examples of [[cancer]]s of the reproductive system include:
*[[Prostate cancer]] - Cancer of the prostate gland
*[[Breast cancer]] - Cancer of the mammary gland.
*[[Ovarian cancer]] - Cancer of the ovary.
*[[Penile cancer]] - Cancer of the penis.
*[[Uterine sarcoma|Uterine cancer]] - Cancer of the uterus.
*[[Testicular cancer]] - Cancer of the testicle/(plural:testes).
*[[Cervical cancer]] - Cancer of the [[cervix]].
*[[Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy]]

===Examples of functional problems===
Examples of [[functional problem]]s of the reproductive system include:
*[[Impotence]] - The inability of a male to produce or maintain an erection.
*[[Hypogonadism]] - A lack of function of the gonads, in regards to either hormones or gamete production.
*[[Ectopic pregnancy]] - When a fertilized ovum is implanted in any tissue other than the uterine wall.
*[[Hypoactive sexual desire disorder]] - A low level of sexual desire and interest.
*[[Female sexual arousal disorder]] - A condition of decreased, insufficient, or absent lubrication in females during sexual activity
*[[Premature ejaculation]] -   A lack of voluntary control over ejaculation.
*[[Dysmenorrhea]] - Is a medical condition of pain during menstruation that interferes with daily activities&lt;ref&gt;[http://apparentlifestyle.com/blog/2012/03/06/reproductive-system-a-summary-of-its-main-diseases-symptoms-and-their-causes/  Reproductive System Diseases : Types, Signs and Symptoms and Causes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endocrine===
It is also known that [[Endocrine disruptor|disruption of the endocrine system]] by certain chemicals adversely affects the development of the reproductive system and can cause vaginal [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="NIEHS"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/docs/endocrine.pdf |title= Endocrine Disruptors |accessdate= 2007-11-29 |year= 2006 |format= PDF |publisher= National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041532/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/docs/endocrine.pdf |archivedate= 2008-02-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other reproductive diseases have also been link to exposure to synthetic and environmental chemicals. Common chemicals with known links to reproductive disorders include: [[lead]], [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]], [[styrene]], [[toluene]], BPA (Bisphenol A) and [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectingourhealth.org/newscience/infertility/2003-04peerreviewinfertility.htm  Infertility and Related Reproductive Disorders.] 2003.

'''Sander Thoenes''' (November 7, 1968 – September 21, 1999) was a Dutch journalist who was killed, near [[Dili]] in [[East Timor]], by soldiers of Indonesian army. He was shot when their paths crossed on a road as the Indonesians withdrew from the territory.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

==Early life==
Thoenes was born in [[Enschede]], the Netherlands, the youngest of three brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorialforsander.org/hislife/index.html|title=Sander Memorial site|author=Boris Kester|date=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Gymnasium St. Jacobus college in Enschede (1981-1987) and studied English literature and modern Russian history at [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], Massachusetts, USA (1987-1992). During his time at Hampshire college Thoenes learned to speak and write Russian fluently.

==Career==
After studying for his journalism career at the Centre for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco he moved to [[Moscow]] in August, 1992. Here Thoenes worked for the English language paper [[Moscow Times]]. He went on to write for the Dutch weekly [[Vrij Nederland]] and served as [[correspondent]] for [[U.S. News and World Report]] where he reported from [[Chechnya]] in 1995.

In 1996 he relocated to [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] and covered [[Central Asia]], including [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] for the [[Financial Times]]. In September, 1997 he moved to [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], still working as a correspondent for the Financial Times. There he reported the [[Asian Financial Crisis]] and the fall of [[President Suharto]].

==Death==
On September 21, 1999, Thoenes was killed by soldiers from a company of the Indonesian Army's [[Battalion 745]] as the unit withdrew from the territory, carrying out a deliberate, government-directed, scorched-earth policy as it went. These murders were just one in a string of similar incidents that marked the passage of the unit westward along the coast-road toward the Indonesian border. Thoenes was riding [[pillion]] on a local motorcycle taxi in the neighborhood of [[Becora]], just east of [[Dili]], when he encountered the column of motor-cyclists and heavy lorries as it approached Dili from the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;{{cite news |first=Cameron W. |last=Barr |title=Battalion 745: A brutal exit |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2000/0313/p1s2.html |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2000-03-13 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian-led [[United Nations|UN]] peace-keepers discovered Thoenes’ body with gunshot-wounds in the back-yard of a house on a side-road. It was concluded Thoenes had been moved off the road to delay his being found and that he had also been shot at close range, with deliberation.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Journalist killed in East Timor|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454185.stm |date=1999-09-22 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florindo Araujo, Thoenes' motorcycle taxi driver, told reporters that he was stopped by at least six men wearing gray Indonesian police uniforms at a roadblock while en route to Becora. Araujo and Thoenes sought to flee. Araujo managed to reach cover in the bush nearby and hide. He witnessed the execution of the injured Thoenes at the road-side. Two Indonesian army officers, Lt. Camilo dos Santos and Maj. Jacob Djoko Sarosa, were later blamed for his murder by a UN special investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lt Camilo dos Santos - Master of Terror|url=http://www.villagechief.com/mot/Camilo%20dos%20Santos.htm|publisher=villagechief.com|date=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoenes' death marked the first time a foreign reporter was killed in East Timor since 1975.&lt;ref name="Barr2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Monitor contributor killed in East Timor |url=http://www.angelfire.com/rock/hotburrito/thoenes/barr230999.html |date=1999-09-23 |first=Cameron W. |last=Barr |publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921165629/http://www.angelfire.com/rock/hotburrito/thoenes/barr230999.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he received a posthumous [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] award from the [[Washington D.C.]]-based [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] (NPC).

The incident was the subject of a documentary, broadcast in October 2013, by fellow Dutch journalist [[Step Vaessen]]. On 21 September 1999, Stephanie was reporting from central Dili, together with her husband Andries, for [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]]. She still works in the region, now as the [[Djakarta]] correspondent for international broadcaster [[Al Jazeera English]]. The film was part of the ''Al Jazeera Correspondent'' series and featured an interview by the veteran South-East Asia journalist [[Jon Swain]], who narrowly avoided the same fate later that day, nearby on the same road. Vaessen interviewed General [[Wiranto]], the overall Indonesian military commander at the time and former Presidential candidate, and [[BJ Habibie]] the President of Indonesia in 1999. The General suggested that the military had to obey government policy, whilst the President suggested he had no personal responsibility for the military's actions. The international community tends to indict only those who are already disowned.

==Legacy==
The ''Financial Times'' set up the Sander Thoenes Prize in his honour. The award offers recent journalism graduates, each year, a three-month internship at the ''Financial Times'' headquarters in London and a scholarship to cover living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sander Thoenes Award|url=http://www.ft.com/indepth/sanderthoenes|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club]] (JFCC) announced a scholarship fund in his honor on September 7, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFCC launches new website|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/09/09/jfcc-launches-new-website.html|date=2006-09-09|work=The Jakarta Post|publisher=PT Bina Media Tenggara|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809203113/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/09/09/jfcc-launches-new-website.html|archivedate=2009-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual JFCC scholarship is awarded to support the training of East Timorese journalists.

[[Hampshire College]], Thoenes' alma mater in Amherst MA. has the [http://www.hampshire.edu/cs/22715.htm SANDER THOENES DIVISION II AND DIVISION III RESEARCH AWARD.]  Awards are made from an endowment established by his friends from Hampshire and around the world. The award is given to Division III students working in journalism; documentary photography, film or video; international relations; globalization; peace-building; civil society and human rights.

[[File:Stoneyisland Man Scheme.svg|thumb|Scheme of preserved bones.&lt;br&gt;Red marked lightly fragmented bones, blue marked heavily fragmented bones]]
'''Stoneyisland Man''' is the name given to a [[bog body]] discovered in the Stoneyisland Bog, Gortanumera, [[County Galway]], Ireland 13 May 1929.

==Discovery==
[[Peat|Turf]]-cutters James Dolphin, Thomas Rodgers and John Spain uncovered a human skeleton while working on Dolphin's bank, located towards the centre of Stoneyisland Bog. It was first thought to be the remains of a Mr. Ward of Ballyshrule who had been missing for some time, but it was later revealed to be over five thousand years old.

"It was found lying on its back within a few inches of the [[marl]], at the base of the bog, beneath  {{convert|10|ft|cm}} of uncut turf. The skeleton was intact with the arms outstretched at right angles to the body. No implements were found with the skeleton, but Mr. Dolphin said at the time that they had previously found tree stumps and ashes at higher depths in the bog. He also claimed to have found a [[dugout canoe]] at a depth of {{convert|5|ft|cm}}, while cutting turf in another part of the bog on a previous occasion. Mr. T. Shea, who was in charge of a section of the [[Ordnance Survey]], operating in the district at the time, examined the remains. He excavated the skeleton and had it examined by Professor Shea of the Anatomical Museum, University College, Galway."&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Shea | title = Report on the Human Skeleton found in Stoney Island bog, Portumna | editor = Galway Archaeological and Historical Society | journal = Journal | volume = 15 | year = 1931 | pages = 73–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions of Professor Shea==
Professor Shea's conclusions were that "the body &lt;sup&gt;[sic]&lt;/sup&gt; had not sunk slowly down from an originally higher level in the bog, but was lying in the position and at the level where it originally lay." He believed that the outstretched arms indicated that the person had drowned, sank to the bottom of what was then a lake, and the bog grew over it.

His further conclusions were that the body was of a man, aged about forty, five foot two in height. "The lower jaw and teeth, and a large number of the limbs bones were peculiar to prehistoric skeletons in Western Europe. The period of the skeleton was further determined by the degree of flattening of some of the arm and leg bones which are characteristic of skeletons of [[Neolithic]] man."&lt;ref name="Shea"/&gt;

Pollen and peat analysis dated the remains to sometime after 4500 BCE. Several [[radiocarbon dating]]s dated the remains between 3320–3220 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =van der Sanden | first =Wijnand  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Through Nature to Eternity - The Bog Bodies of Northwest Europe | publisher =Batavian Lion International | year =1996 | location =Amsterdam | pages =189 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =90-6707-418-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terror management theory''' ('''TMT''') is an [[evolutionary psychology]] theory originally proposed by [[Jeff Greenberg]], [[Sheldon Solomon]], and [[Tom Pyszczynski]]&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; and codified in their book ''The Worm at the Core: On the Role of Death in Life'' (2015). It proposes that a basic psychological conflict results from having a [[self-preservation]] instinct whilst realizing that death is inevitable and to some extent unpredictable. This conflict produces terror, and the terror is then managed by embracing cultural values, or symbolic systems that act to provide life with enduring meaning and value.&lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;Greenberg, J., Pyszczynski, T. &amp; Solomon, S.

Examples of cultural values that impact an individual's terror of death are those that purport to offer literal immortality (e.g. belief in afterlife, religion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jonas | first1 = E. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Terror management and religion: evidence that intrinsic religiousness mitigates worldview defense following mortality salience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 553–567 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.3.553 | pmid=16938037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, TMT also argues that other cultural values&amp;nbsp;– including those that are seemingly unrelated to death&amp;nbsp;– offer symbolic immortality.  For example, values of national identity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; posterity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = X. | last2 = Liu | first2 = J. | last3 = Chen | first3 = C. | last4 = Yu | first4 = Z. | year = 2008 | title = Do children transcend death?

L. 2000"/&gt; have  been linked to death concerns.  In many cases these values are thought to offer symbolic immortality either a) by providing the sense that one is part of something greater that will ultimately outlive the individual (e.g. country, lineage, species), or b) by making one's symbolic identity superior to biological nature (i.e. you are a personality, which makes you more than a glob of cells).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Because cultural values determine that which is meaningful, they are also the foundation for [[self-esteem]]. TMT describes self-esteem as being the personal, subjective measure of how well an individual is living up to their cultural values.&lt;ref name=GPS91/&gt;

TMT is derived from [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ernest Becker]]'s 1973&amp;nbsp;[[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning work of nonfiction ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', in which Becker argues most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death. The terror of absolute annihilation creates such a profound&amp;nbsp;– albeit subconscious&amp;nbsp;– anxiety in people that they spend their lives attempting to make sense of it. On large scales, societies build symbols: laws, [[religion and happiness|religious meaning systems]], cultures, and belief systems to explain the significance of life, define what makes certain characteristics, skills, and talents extraordinary, reward others whom they find exemplify certain attributes, and punish or kill others who do not adhere to their cultural [[worldview]]. On an individual level, self-esteem provides a buffer against death-related anxiety.

}}

[[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologist]] Ernest Becker asserted in his 1973&amp;nbsp;book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'' that humans, as intelligent animals, are able to grasp the inevitability of death. They therefore spend their lives building and believing in cultural elements that illustrate how to make themselves stand out as individuals and give their lives significance and meaning. Death creates an anxiety in humans; it strikes at unexpected and random moments, and its nature is essentially unknowable, causing people to spend most of their time and energy to explain, forestall, and avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, pp. ix–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker expounded upon the previous writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Norman&amp;nbsp;O.&amp;nbsp;Brown]], and [[Otto Rank]]. According to clinical psychiatrist [[Morton Levitt]], Becker replaces the Freudian preoccupation with [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the fear of death as the primary motivation in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Morton (July 1974). "Reviewed work(s): The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 414, USA-USSR: Agenda for Communication, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

People desire to think of themselves as beings of value and worth with a feeling of permanence, a concept in [[psychology]] known as [[self-esteem]]. This feeling counters the [[cognitive dissonance]] created by an individual's realization that they may be no more important than any other living thing. Becker refers to high self-esteem as heroism: {{blockquote|the problem of heroics is the central one of human life, that it goes deeper into human nature than anything else because it is based on organismic [[narcissism]] and on the child's need for self-esteem as ''the'' condition for his life. Society itself is a codified hero system, which means that society everywhere is a living myth of the significance of human life, a defiant creation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rationale behind decisions regarding one's own health can be explored through a terror management model. A 2008 research article in [[Psychological Review]] proposes a three-part model for understanding how awareness of death can ironically subvert health-promoting behaviors by redirecting one's focus towards behaviors that build self-esteem instead: "''Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities.''"&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Arndt | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = The Implications of death for health: A terror management health model for behavioral health promotion | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 1032–1053 | doi=10.1037/a0013326| pmid = 18954213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary backdrop===
Terror management theorists consider TMT to be compatible with the [[theory of evolution]]:&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Valid fears of dangerous things have an adaptive function that helped facilitate the survival of our ancestors' genes. However, generalized existential anxiety resulting from the clash between a desire for life and awareness of the inevitability of death is neither adaptive nor selected for. TMT views existential anxiety as an unfortunate byproduct of these two highly adaptive human proclivities rather than as an adaptation that the evolutionary process selected for its advantages. Just as human [[bipedalism]] confers advantages as well as disadvantages, death anxiety is an inevitable part of our intelligence and awareness of dangers.

Anxiety in response to the inevitability of death threatened to undermine adaptive functioning and therefore needed amelioration. TMT posits that humankind used the same intellectual capacities that gave rise to this problem to fashion cultural beliefs and values that provided protection against this potential anxiety. TMT considers these cultural beliefs (even unpleasant and frightening ones, such as ritual human sacrifice) when they manage potential [[death anxiety (psychology)|death anxiety]] in a way that promotes beliefs and behaviors which facilitated the functioning and survival of the collective.

Hunter-gatherers used their emerging cognitive abilities to facilitate solving practical problems, such as basic needs for nutrition, mating, and tool-making. As these abilities evolved, an explicit awareness of death also emerged. But once this awareness materialized, the potential for terror that it created put pressure on emerging conceptions of reality. Any conceptual formation that was to be widely accepted by the group needed to provide a means of managing this terror.

Originally, the emergence of morality evolved to facilitate co-existence within groups. Together with language, morality served pragmatic functions that extended survival. The struggle to deny the finality of death co-opted and changed the function of these cultural inventions. For example, [[Neanderthal]]s might have begun burying their dead as a means of avoiding unpleasant odors, disease-infested parasites, or dangerous scavengers. But during the Upper Paleolithic era, these pragmatic burial practices appear to have become imbued with layers of ritual performance and supernatural beliefs, suggested by the elaborate decoration of bodies with thousands of beads or other markers. Food and other necessities were also included within the burial chamber, indicating the potential for a belief system that included life after death. In many human cultures today, [[funeral]]s are viewed primarily as cultural events, viewed through the lens of morality and language, with little thought given to the utilitarian origins of burying the dead.

Evolutionary history also indicates that "the costs of ignoring threats have outweighed the costs of ignoring opportunities for self-development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook Of Experimental Existential Psychology|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_KMRe9wK2MC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=2013-08-18|chapter=Paradise Lost and Reclaimed|last1=Koole|first1=Sander L.|last2=van den Berg|first2=Agnes E.|editor1-last=Greenberg|editor1-first=Jeff|editor2-last=Koole|editor2-first=Sander L.|editor3-last=Pyszczynski|editor3-first=Tom|year=2004|publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59385-040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the concept that abstract needs for individual and group self-esteem may continue to be selected for by evolution, even when they sometimes confer risks to physical health and well-being.

==Self-esteem==
[[Self-esteem]] lies at the heart of TMT and is a fundamental aspect of its core paradigms. TMT fundamentally seeks to elucidate the causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem. Theoretically, it draws heavily from [[Ernest Becker]]'s conceptions of culture and self-esteem (Becker, 1971;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1971). The birth and death of meaning (2nd ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker, 1973&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1973). ''The Denial of Death'' (1st ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). TMT not only attempts to explain the concept of self-esteem, it also tries to explain ''why'' we need self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self-esteem"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., Solomon, S., Arndt, J. &amp; Schimel, J.
 | year = 2004
 | title = Why do people need self-esteem? A theoretical and empirical review

 | pmid = 15122930
 | volume=130
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that self-esteem is used as a coping mechanism for anxiety. It helps people control their sense of terror and nullify the realization that humans are just animals trying to manage the world around them. According to TMT, self-esteem is a sense of personal value that is created by beliefs in the validity of one's cultural worldview, and the belief that one is living up to the cultural standards created by that worldview.&lt;ref name = "self-esteem"/&gt;

Critically, Hewstone ''et al.'' (2002) have questioned the causal direction between self-esteem and death-anxiety, evaluating whether one's self-esteem comes from their desire to reduce their death anxiety, or if death anxiety arises from a lack of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Hew&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hewstone | first1 = M. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = M. | last3 = Willis | first3 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Intergroup bias | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 575–604 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109 | pmid = 11752497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an individual's suppression of death anxiety may arise from their overall need to increase their self-esteem in a positive manner.&lt;ref name="Hew"/&gt;

Research has demonstrated that self-esteem can play an important role in physical health. In some cases, people may be so concerned with their physical appearance and boosting their self-esteem that they ignore problems or concerns with their own physical health.&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Cox | first2 = C. R. | last3 = Goldenberg | first3 = J. L. | last4 = Vess | first4 = M. | last5 = Routledge | first5 = C. | last6 = Cooper | first6 = D.

(2009) conducted three studies to examine how peer perceptions and social acceptance of smokers contributes to their quitting, as well as if, and why these people continue smoking for outside reasons, even when faced with thoughts of death and anti-smoking prompts.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; Tanning and exercising were also looked at in the researchers' studies. The studies found that people are influenced by the situations around them.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;  Specifically, Arndt ''et al.'' (2009) found in terms of their self-esteem and health, that participants who saw someone exercising were more likely to increase their intentions to exercise.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; In addition, the researchers found in study two that how participants reacted to an anti-smoking commercial was affected by their motivation for smoking and the situation which they were in. For instance, people who smoked for extrinsic reasons and were previously prompted with death reminders were more likely to be compelled by the anti-smoking message.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;

===Self-esteem as anxiety buffer===
An individual's level of self-consciousness can affect their views on life and death. To a point, increasing self-consciousness is adaptive in that it helps prevent awareness of danger. However, research has demonstrated that there may be [[diminishing returns]] from this phenomenon. Individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness sometimes have increased death cognition, and a more negative outlook on life, than those with reduced self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taubman-Ben-Ari | first1 = O. | last2 = Noy | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Self-consciousness and death cognitions from a terror management perspective | url = | journal = Death Studies | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 871–892 | doi = 10.1080/07481187.2010.496685 | pmid = 24482853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, self-esteem can work in the opposite manner. Research has confirmed that individuals with higher self-esteem, particularly in regard to their behavior, have a more positive attitude towards their life. Specifically, death cognition in the form of anti-smoking warnings weren't effective for smokers and in fact, increased their already positive attitudes towards the behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = J. | last2 = Winzeler | first2 = S. | last3 = Topolinski | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = When the death makes you smoke: A terror management perspective on the effectiveness of cigarette on-pack warnings | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 226–228 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons behind individuals' optimistic attitudes towards smoking after mortality was made salient, indicate that people use positivity as a buffer against anxiety. Continuing to hold certain beliefs even after they are shown to be flawed creates [[cognitive dissonance]] regarding current information and past behavior, and the way to alleviate this is to simply reject new information. Therefore, anxiety buffers such as self-esteem allow individuals to cope with their fears more easily. Death cognition may in fact cause [[negative reinforcement]] that leads people to further engage in dangerous behaviors (smoking in this instance) because accepting the new information would lead to a loss of self-esteem, increasing vulnerability and awareness of mortality.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

==Mortality salience==
The [[mortality salience]] hypothesis&amp;nbsp;(MS) states that if indeed one's cultural worldview, or one's self-esteem, serves a death-denying function, then threatening these constructs should produce defenses aimed at restoring psychological equanimity (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;returning the individual to a state of feeling invulnerable). In the MS&amp;nbsp;paradigm, these "threats" are simply experiential reminders of one's own death. This can, and has, taken many different forms in a variety of study paradigms (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;asking participants to write about their own death;&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; conducting the experiment near funeral homes or cemeteries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Wicklund | first2 = R.

Like the other TMT hypotheses, the literature supporting the MS hypothesis is vast and diverse. For a meta analysis of MS&amp;nbsp;research, see Burke ''et al.'' (2010).&lt;ref name = Burke&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burke | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Martens | first2 = A. | last3 = Faucher | first3 = E. H. | year = 2010 | title = Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research | url = | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 155–195 | doi=10.1177/1088868309352321 | pmid=20097885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimentally, the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis has been tested in close to 200&amp;nbsp;empirical articles.&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt; After participants in an experiment are asked to write about their own death (vs.&amp;nbsp;a neutral, non-death control topic, such as dental pain), and then following a brief delay (distal, worldview/self-esteem defenses work the best after a delay; see Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name="Green 1994"/&gt; for a discussion), the participants' defenses are measured. In one early TMT study assessing the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis, Greenberg ''et al.'' (1990)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = J. | last2 = Pyszczynski | first2 = T. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Rosenblatt | first4 = A. | last5 = Veeder | first5 = M. | last6 = Kirkland | first6 = S. | last7 = Lyon | first7 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Evidence for terror management&amp;nbsp;II: The effects of mortality salience on reactions to those who threaten or bolster the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 308–318 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.2.308| citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.2378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had Christian participants evaluate other Christian and Jewish students that were similar demographically, but differed in their religious affiliation. After being reminded of their death (experimental MS&amp;nbsp;induction), Christian participants evaluated fellow Christians more positively, and Jewish participants more negatively, relative to the control condition.&lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Simon | first2 = L. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Pyszczynski | first4 = T. | last5 = Solomon | first5 = S. | last6 = McGregor | first6 = H. | year = 1997 | title = Terror management theory and self-esteem: Evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortality salience effects | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24| pmid = 9008372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, bolstering self-esteem in these scenarios leads to less worldview defense and derogation of dissimilar others.&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt;

Mortality salience has an influence on individuals and their decisions regarding their health. Cox ''et al.'' (2009) discuss mortality salience in terms of suntanning. Specifically, the researchers found that participants who were prompted with the idea that pale was more socially attractive along with mortality reminders, tended to lean towards decisions that resulted in more protective measures from the sun.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = D. P. | last3 = Vess | first3 = M. | last4 = Arndt | first4 = J. | last5 = Goldenberg | first5 = J. L. | last6 = Routledge | first6 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Bronze is beautiful but pale can be pretty: The effects of appearance standards and mortality salience on sun-tanning outcomes | url = | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 746–752 | doi = 10.1037/a0016388 | pmid = 19916643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were placed in two different conditions; one group of participants were given an article relating to the fear of death, while the control group received an article unrelated to death dealing with the fear of public speaking.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Additionally, they gave one group an article pertaining to the message that "bronze is beautiful," one relating to the idea that "pale is pretty," and one neutral article that did not speak of tan or pale skin tones.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Finally, after introducing a delay activity, the researchers gave the participants a five-item questionnaire asking them about their future sun-tanning behaviors. The study illustrated that when tan skin was associated with attractiveness, mortality salience positively affected people's intentions to suntan; however, when pale skin was associated with attractiveness people's intentions to tan decreased.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;

===Mortality and self-esteem on health risks===
Studies have shown that mortality and self-esteem are important factors of the terror management theory. Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) study this relationship within four studies that all examine how people react when they are given information on risks, specifically, in terms of the mortality related to the risks of driving.&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jessop | first1 = D. C. | last2 = Albery | first2 = I. P. | last3 = Rutter | first3 = J. | last4 = Garrod | first4 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Understanding the impact of mortality-related health-risk information: A terror management theory perspective | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 7| pages = 951–964 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208316790 | pmid = 18453389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the researchers were exploring how participants acted in terms of self-esteem, and its impact on how mortality-related health-risk information would be received.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Overall, Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) found that even when mortality is prominent, people who engage in certain behaviors to improve their self-esteem have a greater chance of continuing with these activities.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Mortality and self-esteem are both factors that influence people's behaviors and decision-making regarding their health. Furthermore, individuals who are involved in behaviors and possess motivation to enhance their self-worth are less likely to be affected by the importance placed on health risks, in terms of mortality.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Self-esteem is important when mortality is made salient. It can allow people a coping mechanism, one that can cushion individuals' fears; and thus, impacting one's attitudes towards a given behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Individuals who have higher levels of self-esteem regarding their behavior(s) are less likely to have their attitudes, and thus their behaviors changed regardless of mortality salient or death messages.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; People will use their self-esteem to hide behind their fears of dying. In terms of smoking behaviors, people with higher smoking-based self-esteem are less susceptible to anti-smoking messages that relate to death; therefore, mortality salience and death warnings afford them with an even more positive outlook on their behavior, or in this instance their smoking.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

In the Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) experiment the researchers manipulated mortality salience. In the experiment, Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) examined smokers' attitudes towards the behavior of smoking. Actual warning labels were utilized to create mortality salience in this specific experiment. The researchers first gave participants a questionnaire to measure their smoking-based self-esteem.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Following the questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to two different conditions; the first were given anti-smoking warning labels about death and the second, control group were exposed to anti-smoking warning labels not dealing with death.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Before the participants' attitudes towards smoking were taken the researchers introduced an unrelated question to provide a delay. Further research has demonstrated that delays allow mortality salience to emerge because thoughts of death become non-conscious.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Finally, participants were asked questions regarding their intended future smoking behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; However, one weakness in their conduction was that the final questionnaire addressed opinions and behavioral questions, as opposed to the participants level of persuasion regarding the different anti-smoking warning labels.

===Social impacts===
Many people are more motivated by social pressures, rather than health risks. Specifically for younger people, mortality salience is stronger in eliciting changes of one's behavior when it brings awareness to the immediate loss of social status or position, rather than a loss, such as death that one can not imagine and feels far off.&lt;ref name=social&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = I. M. | last2 = Kamins | first2 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An application of terror management theory in the design of social and health-related anti-smoking appeals | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Behaviour | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 172–190 | doi = 10.1002/cb.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many different factors to take into consideration, such as how strongly an individual feels toward a decision, his or her level of self-esteem, and the situation around the individual. Particularly with people's smoking behaviors, self-esteem and mortality salience have different effects on individuals' decisions.  In terms of the longevity of their smoking decisions, it has been seen that individuals' smoking habits are affected, in the short-term sense, when they are exposed to mortality salience that interrelates with their own self-esteem.  Moreover, people who viewed social exclusion prompts were more likely to quit smoking in the long run than those who were simply shown health-effects of smoking.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; More specifically, it was demonstrated that when individuals had high levels of self-esteem they were more likely to quit smoking following the social pressure messages, rather than the health risk messages.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;  In this specific instance, terror management, and specifically mortality salience is showing how people are more motivated by the social pressures and consequences in their environment, rather than consequences relating to their health. This is mostly seen in young adult smokers with higher smoking-based self-esteems who are not thinking of their future health and the less-immediate effects of smoking on their health.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;

==Death thought accessibility==
Another paradigm that TMT&amp;nbsp;researchers use to get at unconscious concerns about death is what is known as the death thought accessibility&amp;nbsp;(DTA) hypothesis. Essentially, the DTA&amp;nbsp;hypothesis states that if individuals are motivated to avoid cognitions about death, and they avoid these cognitions by espousing a worldview or by buffering their self-esteem, then when threatened, an individual should possess more death-related cognitions (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;thoughts about death, and death-related stimuli) than they would when not threatened.&lt;ref name = "Hayes" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = J. | last2 = Schimel | first2 = J. | last3 = Ardnt | first3 = J. | last4 = Faucher | first4 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A Theoretical and Empirical Review of the Death Thought Accessibility Concept in Terror Management Research | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 136 | issue = 5| pages = 699–739 | doi=10.1037/a0020524 | pmid=20804234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DTA hypothesis has its origins in work by Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name = "Green 1994"/&gt; as an extension of their earlier terror management hypotheses (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the anxiety buffer hypothesis and the mortality salience hypothesis). The researchers reasoned that if, as indicated by [[Daniel Wegner|Wegner's]] research on [[thought suppression]] (1994; 1997), thoughts that are purposely suppressed from conscious awareness are often brought back with ease, then following a delay death-thought cognitions should be more available to consciousness than (a)&amp;nbsp;those who keep the death-thoughts in their consciousness the whole time, and (b)&amp;nbsp;those who suppress the death-thoughts but are not provided a delay. That is precisely what they found. However, other psychologists have failed to replicate these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trafimow|first=David|author2=Jamie S. Hughes |title=Testing the Death Thought Suppression and Rebound Hypothesis|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=September 2012|volume=3|issue=5|pages=622–629|doi=10.1177/1948550611432938|url=http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/5/622.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these initial studies (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;Greenberg ''et al.'' (2004); Arndt ''et al.'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Solomon | first4 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Subliminal exposure to death-related stimuli increases defense of the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 379–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00429.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in numerous subsequent DTA studies, the main measure of DTA is a word fragment task, whereby participants can complete word fragments in distinctly death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;coff_&amp;nbsp;_ as coffin, not coffee) or in non death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;sk_&amp;nbsp;_l as skill, not skull).&lt;ref name="TMHM"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = D. P. | last2 = Goldenberg | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Arndt | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Empowering the self: Using the terror management health model to promote breast self-examination | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 315–325 | doi = 10.1080/15298868.2010.52749 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If death-thoughts are indeed more available to consciousness, then it stands to reason that the word fragments should be completed in a way that is semantically related to death.

===Importance of the DTA hypothesis===

The introduction of this hypothesis has refined TMT, and led to new avenues of research that formerly could not be assessed due to the lack of an empirically validated way of measuring death-related cognitions. Also, the differentiation between proximal (conscious, near, and threat-focused) and distal (unconscious, distant, symbolic) defenses that have been derived from DTA studies have been extremely important in understanding how people deal with their terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | year = 1999 | title = A dual-process model of defense against conscious and unconscious death-related thoughts: An extension of terror management theory | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 835–845 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note how the DTA paradigm subtly alters, and expands, TMT as a motivational theory. Instead of solely manipulating mortality and witnessing its effects (e.g., [[nationalism]], increased prejudice, [[Safe sex|risky sexual behavior]], etc.), the DTA paradigm allows a measure of the death-related cognitions that result from various affronts to the self. Examples include threats to self-esteem and to one's worldview; the DTA paradigm can therefore assess the role of death-thoughts in self-esteem and worldview defenses. Furthermore, the DTA hypothesis lends support to TMT in that it corroborates its central hypothesis that death is uniquely problematic for human beings, and that it is fundamentally different in its effects than meaning threats, (i.e., Heine ''et al.'', 2006&lt;ref name = "Heine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Proulx | first2 = T. | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K. D. | year = 2006 | title = The meaning maintenance model: On the coherence of human motivations | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 88–110 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1002_1| pmid = 16768649 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.434.4237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and that is death itself, and not uncertainty and lack of control associated with death; Fritsche ''et al.'' (2008) explore this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritsche | first1 = I. | last2 = Jonas | first2 = E. | last3 = Fankhänel | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = The role of control motivation in mortality salience effects on ingroup support and defense | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 524–541 | doi=10.1037/a0012666 | pmid=18729692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the DTA hypothesis had been rapidly gaining ground in TMT investigations, and as of 2009, has been employed in over 60 published papers, with a total of more than 90 empirical studies.&lt;ref name = "Hayes"/&gt;

===Death anxiety on health promotion===

How people respond to their fears and anxiety of death is investigated in TMT. Moreover, Taubman-Ben-Ari and Noy (2010) examine the idea that a person's level of self-awareness and self-consciousness should be considered in relation to their responses to their anxiety and death cognitions.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt; The more an individual is presented with their death or death cognitions in general, the more fear and anxiety one may have; therefore, to combat said anxiety one may implement anxiety buffers.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt;

Due to a change in people's lifestyles, in the direction of more unhealthy behaviors, the leading causes of death now, being [[cancer]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], most definitely are related to individuals' unhealthy behaviors (though the statement is over-generalising and certainly cannot be applied to every case)&lt;ref name="death anxiety"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bozo | first1 = Ö. | last2 = Tunca | first2 = A. | last3 = Şİmşek | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The effect of death anxiety and age on health- promoting behaviors: A terror-management theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied | volume = 143 | issue = 4| pages = 377–389 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.143.4.377-389 | pmid = 19606644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Age and death anxiety both are factors that should be considered in the terror management theory, in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Age undoubtedly plays some kind of role in people's health-promoting behaviors; however, an actual age related effect on death anxiety and health-promoting behaviors has yet to be seen. Although, research has demonstrated that for young adults only, when they were prompted with death related scenarios, they yielded more health-promoting behaviors, compared to those participants in their sixties. In addition, death anxiety has been found to have an effect for young adults, on their behaviors of health promotion.&lt;ref name="death anxiety"/&gt;

==Terror management health model==
The terror management health model (TMHM) explores the role that death plays on one's health and behavior. Goldenberg and Arndt (2008) state that the TMHM proposes the idea that death, despite its threatening nature, is in fact instrumental and purposeful in the conditioning of one's behavior towards the direction of a longer life.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt;

According to Goldenberg and Arndt (2008), certain health behaviors such as [[Breast self-examination|breast self-exam]]s (BSEs) can consciously activate and facilitate people to think of death, especially their own death.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; While death can be instrumental for individuals, in some cases, when breast self-exams activate people's death thoughts an obstacle can present itself, in terms of health promotion, because of the experience of fear and threat.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; Abel and Kruger (2009) have suggested that the stress caused by increased awareness of mortality when celebrating one's birthday might explain the [[birthday effect]], where mortality rates seem to spike around these days.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, death and thoughts of death can serve as a way of empowering the self, not as threats. Researchers, Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) explored TMHM in terms of empowerment, specifically using BSEs under two conditions; when death thoughts were prompted, and when thoughts of death were non-conscious.&lt;ref name="TMHM"/&gt; According to TMHM, people's health decisions, when death thoughts are not conscious, should be based on their motivations to act appropriately, in terms of the self and identity.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt; Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) found that when mortality and death thoughts were primed, women reported more empowerment feelings than those who were not prompted before performing a BSE.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt;

Additionally, TMHM suggests that mortality awareness and self-esteem are important factors in individuals' decision making and behaviors relating to their health. TMHM explores how people will engage in behaviors, whether positive or negative, even with the heightened awareness of mortality, in the attempt to conform to society's expectations and improve their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; The TMHM is useful in understanding what motivates individuals regarding their health decisions and behaviors.

In terms of smoking behaviors and attitudes, the impact of warnings with death messages depends on:
# The individuals' level of smoking-based self-esteem
# The warnings' actual degree of death information&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

== Emotion ==
People with low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, have more negative emotions when reminded of death. This is believed to be because these individuals lack the very defenses that TMT argues protect people from mortality concerns (e.g., solid worldviews). In contrast, positive mood states are not impacted by death thoughts for people of low or high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Routledge|first=C. |author2=Ostafin, B. |author3=Juhl, J. |author4=Sedikides, C. |author5=Cathey, C.  |author6=Liao, J.|title=The effects of self-esteem and mortality salience on well-being, growth motivation, and maladaptive behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|pages=897–916|doi=10.1037/a0021431 |volume=99 |issue=6 |pmid=21114350|citeseerx=10.1.1.465.8476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
It has been suggested that culture provides  meaning, organization, and a coherent world view that diminishes the psychological terror caused by the knowledge of eventual death. The terror management theory can help to explain why a leader's popularity can grow substantially during times of crisis. When a follower's mortality is made prominent they will tend to show a strong preference for iconic leaders. An example of this occurred when [[George&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Bush]]'s [[United States presidential approval rating|approval rating]] jumped almost 50&amp;nbsp;percent following the [[September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks]] in the United States. As Forsyth (2009) posits, this tragedy made U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens aware of their mortality, and Bush provided an antidote to these existential concerns by promising to bring justice to the terrorist group responsible for the attacks.

Researchers Cohen ''et al.'' (2004), in their particular study on TMT, tested the preferences for different types of leaders, while reminding people of their mortality. Three different candidates were presented to participants. The three leaders were of three different types: task-oriented (emphasized setting goals, strategic planning, and structure), relationship-oriented (emphasized [[compassion]], trust, and confidence in others), and [[charisma]]tic. The participants were then placed in one of two conditions: mortality salient or control group. In the former condition the participants were asked to describe the emotions surrounding their own death, as well as the physical act of the death itself, whereas the [[control group]] were asked similar questions about an upcoming exam. The results of the study were that the charismatic leader was favored more, and the relationship-oriented leader was favored less, in the mortality-salient condition. Further research has shown that mortality salient individuals also prefer leaders who are members of the same group, as well as men rather than women (Hoyt ''et al.'' 2010). This has links to [[social role theory]].

==TMT and religion==
TMT posits that religion was created as a means for humans to cope with their own mortality. Supporting this, arguments in favor of life after death, and simply being religious, reduce the effects of mortality salience on worldview defense. Thoughts of death have also been found to increase religious beliefs. At an implicit, subconscious level, this is the case even for people who claim to be nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heflick |first=Nathan |author2=Goldenberg, J. |title=No atheists in foxholes: Arguments for (but not against) afterlives buffer mortality salience effects for atheists |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |year=2012| doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02058.x |pmid=21995319 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=385–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jong |first=Jonathan |author2=Halberstadt, Jamin |author3=Bluemke, Matthias |title=Foxhole atheism, revisited: The effects of mortality salience on explicit and implicit religious belief |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.005 |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=2012 |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=983–989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}

Bloom and Nancy Dess]&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar commented that the field of psychology would be advanced by a study of paralyzed states caused by anxiety that would only be alleviated with the reworking of a person's mental state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarreteNormativeBiasEP.pdf Normative Bias and Adaptive Challenges]&lt;/ref&gt; These authors instead explain human behavior is selected to urge people to avoid situations likely to lead to death. This suggests that mortality salience effects reflect adaptive responses to solve specific life-threats rather than an unconscious attempt to avoid this realization.

===Prevalence of death in TMT===
Since findings on mortality salience and worldview defense were first published, other researchers have claimed that the effects may have been obtained due to reasons other than death itself, such as anxiety, fear, or other aversive stimuli such as pain. Other studies have found effects similar to those that MS results in – for example, thinking about difficult personal choices to be made, being made to respond to open-ended questions regarding uncertainty, thinking about being robbed, thinking about being socially isolated, and being told that one's life lacks meaning.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Maxfield | first4 = M. | year = 2006 | title = On the unique psychological import of the human awareness of mortality: Theme and variations | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 328–356 | doi=10.1080/10478400701369542}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these cases exist, thoughts of death have since been compared to various aversive experimental controls, such as (but not limited to) thinking about: failure, writing a critical exam, public speaking with a considerable audience, being excluded, paralysis, dental pain, intense physical pain, etc.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

With regards to the studies that found similar effects, TMT theorists have argued that in the previously mentioned studies where death was not the subject thought about, the subjects would quite easily be related to death in an individual's mind due to "linguistic or experiential connection with mortality" (p.&amp;nbsp;332)&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, being robbed invokes thoughts of violence and being unsafe in one's own home – many people have died trying to protect their property and family. A second possible explanation for these results involves the death-thought accessibility hypothesis: these threats somehow sabotage crucial anxiety-buffering aspects of an individual's worldview or self-esteem, which increases their DTA. For example, one study found increased DTA in response to thoughts of antagonistic relations with attachment figures.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Meaning maintenance model===
The meaning maintenance model (MMM) was initially introduced as a comprehensive motivational theory that claimed to subsume TMT, with alternative explanations for TMT findings. Essentially, it posits that people automatically give meaning to things, and when those meanings are somehow disrupted, it causes anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; In response, people concentrate on "meaning maintenance to reestablish their sense of symbolic unity" and that such "meaning maintenance often involves the compensatory reaffirmation of alternative meaning structures".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; These meanings, among other things, should "provide a basis for prediction and control of our...environments, help [one] to cope with tragedy and trauma...and the symbolic cheating of death via adherence to the enduring values that these cultures provide".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt;

TMT theorists argue that MMM cannot describe why different sets of meaning are preferred for a symbol by different people, and that while they may exist, "different [(i.e., more concrete)] types of meaning have different psychological functions".&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, MMM&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that all types of meaning are basically equal, and yet one could not compare the likelihood of defensive responses resulting from exposure to a deck of cards containing black hearts with something like the September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue, essentially, that unless something is an important element of a person's anxiety-buffering worldview or self-esteem, it will not require broad meaning maintenance.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

In sum, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists believe that MMM cannot accurately claim to be an alternative to TMT because it does not seem to be able to explain the current breadth of TMT evidence.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; As an example, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists assert that mortality salience would not be a threat to meaning, since our eventual demise is a necessary condition of life. Therefore, it should not cause an individual to engage in general meaning maintenance. MMM also makes no attempt to explain why threatening meaning increases DTA.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Offensive defensiveness===
Some theorists have argued that it is not the idea of death and nonexistence that is unsettling to people, but the fact that uncertainty is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = I. | last2 = Zanna | first2 = M. P. | last3 = Holmes | first3 = J. G. | last4 = Spencer | first4 = S. J. | year = 2001 | title = Compensatory conviction in the face of personal uncertainty: Going to extremes and being oneself | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 3| pages = 472–488 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.3.472}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, these researchers posited that people defend themselves by altering their fear responses from uncertainty to an enthusiasm approach.&lt;ref name ="uniqueness of death"/&gt;  Other researchers argue for distinguishing fear of death from fear of dying and, therein, posit that ultimately the fear of death has more to do with some other fear (e.g., fear of pain) or reflects fear of the unknown.&lt;ref name="FOTU"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Fear of the unknown: One fear to rule them all?|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=June 2016|volume=41|pages=5–21|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.03.011|pmid=27067453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMT theorists agree that uncertainty can be disconcerting in some cases and it may even result in defense responses, but note that they believe the inescapability of death and the possibility of its finality regarding one's existence is most unsettling. They ask, "'Would death be any less frightening if you knew for certain that it would come next Tuesday at 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., and that your hopes for an afterlife were illusory?'....Would you rather be certain that death is the end, or live with the uncertainty that it might not be?" They also note that people actually seek out some types of uncertainty, and that being uncertain is not always very unpleasant.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; In contrast, there is substantial evidence that, all things being equal, uncertainty and the unknown represent fundamental fears and are only experienced as pleasant when there is sufficient contextual certainty.&lt;ref name = "FOTU" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Into the unknown: A review and synthesis of contemporary models involving uncertainty|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=April 2016|volume=39|pages=30–43|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.02.007|pmid=26945765}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a surprise involves uncertainty, but is only perceived as pleasant if there is sufficient certainty that the surprise will be pleasant.  Consider a box received on a birthday from a trusted family member as compared to the box received at the end of the film "[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]" (which contains a severed head).

Though TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists acknowledge that many responses to mortality salience involve greater approaches (zealousness) towards important worldviews, they also note examples of mortality salience which resulted in the opposite, which offensive defensiveness cannot account for: when negative features of a group to which participants belong were made salient, people actively distanced themselves from that group under&amp;nbsp;mortality salience.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Evolutionary psychology, coalitional psychology, and TMT===
Several critiques have been proposed against TMT from [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] – for reasons including that fear is an adaptive response in individuals' that has come about as a result of natural selection; without these adaptations human beings would have never been able to avoid maladaptive situations.&lt;ref name = "Landau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Solomon | first2 = S. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Greenberg | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On the compatibility of terror management theory and perspectives on human evolution | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 476–519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is unlikely that people would have psychological ways of slowing-down anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; In response, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that this critique is mixing up fear related to immediate danger with anxiety related to thoughts of threats that will or may occur eventually.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; TMT is talking about the protection that self-esteem and cultural worldviews offer against the threat of unavoidable death in the ''future''. While anxiety may be adaptive in avoiding entering a dangerous place (e.g. because a predator may be waiting), this doesn't mean that anxiety must be adaptive in all cases.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; For a more comprehensive review of TMT and evolutionary psychology, see Landau ''et al.'', 2007.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Similar evolutionary critiques have been raised by researchers exploring uncertainty and unknowns (see for reviews,&lt;ref name = "FOTU"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review" /&gt;).

Coalitional psychology&amp;nbsp;(CP) is presented as another alternative to TMT, which proposes that there is an evolutionary tendency to seek safety in groups (coalitions) as a reaction to adaptive threats.&lt;ref name= "Nav"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navarrete | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = D.M.T. | year = 2005 | title = Normative bias and adaptive challenges: A relational approach to coalitional psychology and a critique of terror management theory | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 297–325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People already a part of coalitional groups seek to protect their membership by exhibiting their value to the group.&lt;ref name = "Nav"/&gt; TMT theorists answer by arguing that CP 1) cannot account for the fact that virtually all cultures have a supernatural dimension; 2) it does not explain why cultural worldview defense is symbolic, involving allegiance to both specific and general systems of abstract meaning unrelated to specific threats, rather than focused on the specific adaptive threats it supposedly evolved to deal with; 3) it dismisses TMT's dual process account of the underlying processes that generate MS effects without providing an alternative of any kind or attempting to account for the data relevant to this aspect of the TMT analysis and 4) the experiments testing hypotheses derived from CP do not provide compelling or unique support for CP, 5) it cannot account for a host of empirical findings supporting hypotheses derived from TMT that could never be deduced from CP.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.ku.edu/~mjlandau/docs/Landau_tmt%20and%20evol%20psych_EP%202007.pdf On the Compatibility of Terror Management Theory and Perspectives on Human Evolution&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Storyteller'''" is the first segment of the twenty-seventh episode (the third episode of the second season (1986–87) of the [[television series]] ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|Two women.  A man.  A chase down library steps.  And so, our story begins.  Like life, all stories have a beginning, a middle and end.  But the distances between beginning and end, between story and life, can sometimes be deceptive.  Especially when viewed through the shifting prisms of the Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
Retired teacher Dorothy Livingston is visiting her niece when she bumps into a man she has never been able to forget. Seeing him leave by taxi, Dorothy and her niece decide to follow him and Dorothy tells her niece how she met that man in 1933.

During that time, Dorothy was assigned to a small school in West Virginia and replaced a teacher who informed her that Mica Frost, one of her students, should be allowed access to the library at all times. She meets Mica and discovers that he is a boy who enjoys scribbling in his notebook. She believes Mica's behavior to be unusual and asks him to schedule a parent-teacher conference. Mica declines and informs her that his parents are dead and he lives with his grandfather, who will neither meet her or be met under any circumstance.

The next morning at school, Mica accidentally falls from a tree, hits his head, and breaks his arm. He is taken to the town doctor to spend the night but he fights back because no one will be home to keep his great-great-great-grandfather alive.

Feeling responsible for Mica’s grandfather, Dorothy goes to their house and reads the old man a story she makes up on the fly. The next day, Mica rushes home to find that his great-great-great-grandfather is still alive and well. He is also surprised to find out that Dorothy was there to read to the old man. She tells Mica that she’s still not convinced that she saved his life but she said she read the story just in case it worked.

In the present, Mica gets out of the taxi and enters an apartment building followed closely by Dorothy and her niece. Entering an apartment, Dorothy’s voice can be heard reading to her own mother who asks excitedly, “What happens next? Did you find the man? Was he really 200 years old?” Dorothy smiles and answers her: “Tomorrow, mother,” and leaves with the old woman waiting for tomorrow’s story.

'''Wouter Johannes van Troostwijk''' (28 May 1782, [[Amsterdam]] - 20 September 1810, Amsterdam) was a Dutch painter and etcher. Most of his works are landscapes (featuring cattle) or cityscapes.

==Biography==
He was born into a wealthy family. His father, {{ill|Adriaan (Paets)|de|Adriaan Paets van Troostwijk}}, was a cloth merchant by trade, but was better known as a chemist and physicist. Many scientists were guests at their home, which inspired his interest in nature. He began sketching and his talent was soon evident, so he was given drawing lessons by [[Anthonie Andriessen]] and painting lessons by Anthonie's brother, [[Jurriaan Andriessen (painter)|Juriaan]].&lt;ref name="H"&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN_1780tot1830/lemmata/data/Van%20Troostwijk Biography and appreciation] from the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland'' @ Huygens/Resources.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, he enrolled at the "{{ill|Amsterdam Municipal Academy of Drawing|nl|Stadstekenacademie (Amsterdam)}}". Two years later he joined the [[Felix Meritis]] society, where he won two medals for his work.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; His style was inspired by [[Paulus Potter]] and [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].

He never became a full-time artist, but still he is thought to have influenced late 19th century Dutch painters. After 1805, he served as [[concierge]] at the Amsterdam City Hall, where he lived and had his studio. He devoted himself to painting before and after his working hours and used his days off to paint "en [[plein aire]]" (as it would later be called). He also took up etching; when he burned his foot and had to spend his time sitting at home.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

Ultimately, his passion for painting outdoors proved fatal. He worked too long on a cold Autumn night, came down with a high fever, and succumbed a few days later.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; Only eight of his paintings are on public display, but there are numerous drawings, sketches and studies.

A gift from [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] to King [[Charles X of France]], she was one of three giraffes Muhammad Ali sent to European rulers in 1827. These were the first giraffes to be seen in Europe for over three centuries, since the [[Medici giraffe]] was sent to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in [[Florence]] in 1486.  She didn't receive the name "Zarafa" until 1985.&lt;ref name="McCouat"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCouat|first1=Philip|title=The art of giraffe diplomacy|url=http://www.artinsociety.com/the-art-of-giraffe-diplomacy.html|website=Journal of ART in SOCIETY|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The giraffe known today as Zarafa was a present to [[Charles X of France]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Viceroy]] of [[Egypt]], [[Mehmet Ali Pasha]].  In 1824, the army of the [[Sultan of Turkey]] was engaged in fighting in the [[Greek War of Independence]], and Sultan [[Mahmud II]] called upon the Pasha to send troops in support.  The Greeks were supported by France.  [[Bernardino Drovetti]], the French [[consul-general]] in Egypt, persuaded the Pasha that an extraordinary present would encourage the [[King of France]] to stop supporting the Greeks.

As a young animal, she was captured&lt;!-- in 1824 {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}--&gt; by Arab hunters near [[Sennar]] in [[Sudan]] and taken to [[Khartoum]] on the back of a [[camel]].  From there she was transported by boat down the [[Nile]] to [[Alexandria]].  She was accompanied by three cows that provided her with 25&amp;nbsp;litres of [[milk]] each day.

From Alexandria, she embarked on a ship to [[Marseilles]], with an Arab groom, Hassan, and Drovetti's Sudanese servant, Atir.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allin|first1=Michael|title=Book Excerpt: 'Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5299974|website=NPR.org|accessdate=19 April 2017|language=en|date=March 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of her height, a hole was cut through the deck above the cargo hold through which she could poke her neck.  After a voyage of 32 days, she arrived in Marseilles on 31 October 1826.  Fearing the dangers of transporting her by boat to Paris around the [[Iberian peninsula]] and up the [[Atlantic]] coast of France to the [[Seine]], it was decided that she should walk the 900&amp;nbsp;km to Paris.

[[File:Giraffe Crossing (1827) by Jacques Raymond Brascassat.jpg|thumb|270px|left|''The Passage of the giraffe near {{nowrap|[[Arnay-le-Duc]]}}'' (1827) by [[Jacques Raymond Brascassat]], showing Zarafa with entourage en route to Paris]]
She over-wintered in [[Marseilles]], where she was joined by the [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] for the walk.  He ordered a two-part yellow coat to keep her warm, and shoes for her feet.  She set out on 20 May 1827,&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; already 15&amp;nbsp;cm taller than when she arrived in Marseilles.  She was accompanied by her cows and Saint-Hilaire, then aged 55, who walked with her.  The trip to Paris took 41 days.  She was a spectacle in each town she passed through, [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Avignon]], [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]], [[Montelimar]] and [[Vienne]].  She arrived in [[Lyon]] on 6 June, where she was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of 30,000.

[[File:Assiette girafe.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative [[faience]] plate]]
She was presented to the King at the [[Château de Saint-Cloud|chateau of Saint-Cloud]] in Paris on 9 July 1827, and took up residence in the [[Jardin des Plantes]].  Now standing nearly 4&amp;nbsp;m high, Zarafa's arrival in Paris caused a sensation.  Over 100,000 people came to see her, approximately an eighth of the population of Paris at the time.  [[Honoré de Balzac]] wrote a story about her; [[Gustave Flaubert]] (then a young child) travelled from [[Rouen]] to see her.   ''La mode à la girafe'' swept the nation; hair was arranged in towering styles, spotted fabrics were all the rage. The ''Journal des Dames'' reported that the color known as "belly of giraffe" became extremely popular.&lt;ref name="Werlin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Werlin|first1=Katy|title=The Fashion Historian: La Mode à la Girafe|url=http://www.thefashionhistorian.com/2014/12/la-mode-la-girafe.html|website=The Fashion Historian|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Porcelain and other ceramics were painted with giraffe images.  She was painted by [[Nicolas Huet the Younger|Nicolas Huet]],&lt;ref name="Werlin" /&gt; [[Jacques Raymond Brascassat]] and many others.

Zarafa remained in Paris for a further 18 years until her death, attended to the end by Atir.  Her corpse was [[taxidermy|stuffed]] and displayed in the foyer of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris for many years, before being moved to the [[Muséum d'Histoire naturelle de La Rochelle|Museum of Natural History of La Rochelle]], where it remains.

[[File:La Rochelle - Zarafa.jpg|thumb|left|The stuffed giraffe known as Zarafa, in the Museum of Natural History of La Rochelle, France]]
According to Saint-Hilaire, she was called ''le bel animal du roi'' ("The Beautiful Animal of the King") during her trip from Marseille to Paris&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=p3QCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;output=html  « Quelques considérations sur la Girafe »], in Audouin, Brongniard et Dumas (dir.), « Annales des sciences naturelles », tome 11, Paris, Crochard, 1827, p.213&lt;/ref&gt; and she was dubbed ''la Belle Africaine'' ("the Beautiful African") by contemporary press. ''[[La Gazette (France)|La Gazette]]'' referred to her as "her [[Highness]]" (pun intended).{{efn|"Her Highness was to be presented to his Majesty! how little the king must have looked by a lady 14 feet high! What the ceremonial was I cannot say, but I really believe her Highness was guilty of ''[[lèse-majesté]]'' — the treason of looking down upon a king, the monarch of the great nation; but her Highness is unbendable by nature, and she has a quality very rare and estimable in the female sex, as all married men will allow; she is mute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walton|first1=Geri|title=Belle Africaine: The First Giraffe In France - Geri Walton|url=https://www.geriwalton.com/the-first-giraffe-in-france/|accessdate=8 August 2017|date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2017}} }}

The name "Zarafa" was given to her by American author Michael Allin in his 1998 book ''Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story, from Deep in Africa to the Heart of Paris.'' Zarafa, meaning "charming" or "lovely one" in Arabic, is a phonetic variant of the Arabic word for giraffe: ''zerafa''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Allin, ''Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story, from Deep in Africa to the Heart of Paris'', Walker and Company, 1998, 215 p.

In addition, the eponymous 2012 French animation film, ''[[Zarafa (film)|Zarafa]]'' uses the name; and even the museum in La Rochelle, where her mounted remains still greet visitors, now refers to her by the name Zarafa.&lt;ref&gt;See the museum's website, http://www.museum-larochelle.fr/visites/parcours.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other giraffe gifts by Muhammad Ali==
[[File:The nubian giraffe.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''The Nubian Giraffe'', by [[Jacques-Laurent Agasse]] (c.1827); this one of the three giraffes sent to Europe by [[Mehmet Ali Pasha]] was received by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in London.  The man in the top hat is [[Edward Cross (zoo proprietor)|Edward Cross]], [[Exeter Exchange]] [[menagerie]] proprietor, with the Egyptian attendants and (background) the Egyptian cows that supplied the young giraffe with milk]]
Muhammad Ali Pasha also sent two other giraffes as gifts in 1827, one to [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] in [[London]] and the other to [[Francis I of Austria]] in [[Vienna]].  Like the giraffe sent to France, both inspired giraffe crazes in their respective cities.  The Austrian giraffe joined the Emperor's menagerie at [[Schönbrunn Palace]] but survived for less than one year.  Nevertheless, it lived on in the form of ''Giraffeln'' pastries, served until the beginning of the [[First World War]], and ''Giraffentorten'' (giraffe cakes) which still can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lebleu|first1=Olivier|title=Long-necked diplomacy: the tale of the third giraffe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/animal-magic/2016/jan/11/long-necked-diplomacy-third-giraffe-austria|website=The Guardian|accessdate=17 April 2017|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giraffe Cake|url=http://www.winterthur-tourismus.ch/en/giraffentorte|website=winterthur-tourismus.ch|accessdate=17 April 2017|language=de}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English giraffe (or "cameleopard", echoing the terminology used by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]) joined the embryonic [[London Zoo]] in [[Regent's Park]].  It was painted as ''The Nubian Giraffe'' in 1827 by [[Jacques-Laurent Agasse]], in an image that includes [[Edward Cross (zoo proprietor)|Edward Cross]] and, in the background, the giraffe's milk cows from Egypt.  The English giraffe survived for less than two years, and was [[taxidermy|stuffed]] by [[John Gould]].

{{About|the quality management program|the American hardcore punk band|0DFx}}
{{Manufacturing}}
'''Zero Defects''' (or '''ZD''') was a management-led program to eliminate defects in industrial production that enjoyed brief popularity in American industry from 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Guide to Zero Defects: Quality and Reliability Assurance Handbook | year = 1965 | publisher = [[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense]] (Manpower Installations and Logistics) | location = Washington, D.C. | id = 4155.12-H | oclc = 7188673 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA950061 | accessdate = May 29, 2014 | page = 3 | quote = Early in 1964 the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and Logistics) invited the attention of the Military Departments and the [[Defense Logistics Agency|Defense Supply Agency]] to the potential of Zero Defects.  This gave the program substantial impetus.  Since that time Zero Defects has been adopted by numerous industrial and Department of Defense activities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the early 1970s.  Quality expert [[Philip B. Crosby|Philip Crosby]] later incorporated it into his "Absolutes of Quality Management" and it enjoyed a renaissance in the American automobile industry—as a performance goal more than as a program—in the 1990s.  Although applicable to any type of enterprise, it has been primarily adopted within [[supply chain]]s wherever large volumes of components are being purchased (common items such as nuts and bolts are good examples).

==Definition==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] Zero Defects is a management tool aimed at the reduction of defects through prevention.  It is directed at motivating people to prevent mistakes by developing a constant, conscious desire to do their job right the first time."&lt;ref name="Halpin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Halpin | first = James F. | title = Zero Defects: A New Dimension in Quality Assurance | year = 1966 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | oclc = 567983091}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}} — ''Zero Defects: A New Dimension in Quality Assurance''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zero Defects seeks to directly reverse the attitude that the number of mistakes a worker makes doesn't matter since inspectors will catch them before they reach the customer.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  This stands in contrast to activities that affect the worker directly, such as receiving a paycheck in the correct amount.  Zero Defects involves [[Social conditioning|reconditioning]] the worker "to take a personal interest in everything he does[,] by convincing him that his job is just as important as the task of the doctor or the dentist."&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

==History==
The development of Zero Defects is credited to [[Philip B. Crosby]], a quality control department manager on the [[MGM-31 Pershing|Pershing missile]] program at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin Company]],&lt;ref name="HarwoodOrigin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harwood | first = William B. | title = Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements | year = 1993 | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780671749989 | oclc = 28710737 | page = 350 | chapter = 27: "Zero Defects" Was Invented Here | quote = Zero Defects was the brainchild of a gifted and articulate young engineer named Philip Crosby, who conceived it while working as quality control manager on Pershing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though at least one contemporary reference credits a small, unnamed group of Martin employees.&lt;ref name="HalpinOrigin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Halpin | first = James F. | title = Zero Defects: A New Dimension in Quality Assurance | year = 1966 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | oclc = 567983091 | page = 11 | quote = "Whenever the subject of Zero Defects comes up, it invariably prompts the question:  "Exactly how did it all start?"  The fact that it did start in the defense industry on an Army-Martin missile system is testimony to the dedication of a relatively small group of people."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Defects is not the first application of motivational techniques to production:  During World War II, the [[United States Department of War|War Department's]] [[Army-Navy "E" Award|"E for Excellence"]] program sought to boost production and minimize waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pettebone | first = E. R. | editor1-last = Riordan | editor1-first = John J. | title = Zero Defects: the Quest for Quality | year = 1968 | publisher = [[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense]] | location = Washington, D.C. | id = Technical Report TR9 | oclc = 3396301 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0683446 | accessdate = May 29, 2014 | page = 46 | quote = While Zero Defects programs might appear on the surface to be a re-hash of worker motivation programs that appeared during World War II, there is a more clearly defined methodology and technique emerging in today's programs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = More Bang Per Buck: 'Zero Defects' Plans Cut Contractor Costs | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | location = New York City | publication-date = April 6, 1965 | page = 1 | issn = 0099-9660 | quote = "It reminds me of the E (for excellence) program during World War II."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Revivalist zeal in the drive for perfect parts | newspaper = [[Bloomberg Businessweek|Business Week]] | location = New York City | publication-date = May 8, 1965 | pages = 159 | issn = 0007-7135 | oclc = 1537921 | quote = So the company turned to a propaganda approach, a peacetime equivalent of patriotic campaigns waged in defense plants during World War II.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cold War]] resulted in increased spending on the development of defense technology in the 1950s and 1960s.  Because of the safety-critical nature of such technology, particularly weapons systems, the government and defense firms came to employ hundreds of thousands of people in inspection and monitoring of highly-complex products assembled from hundreds of thousands of individual parts.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|10}}  This activity routinely uncovered defects in design, manufacture, and assembly and resulted in an expensive, drawn out cycle of inspection, rework, reinspection, and retest.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|12}}  Additionally, reports of spectacular missile failures appearing in the press{{refn|group=note|For example: {{cite news | date = January 1, 1957 | title = AIR FORCE ROCKET SAID TO FAIL TEST; 1,500-Mile Missile Reported to Have Fallen and Burned at Florida Launching | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C1FF63B5C14738DDDAE0A94D9405B8789F1D3 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]}}, {{cite news | date = July 14, 1958 | title = ATLAS SWITCH FAILED; Cutoff of Missile Launching Caused by Defective Part | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A1EFD355A137B93C6A8178CD85F4C8585F9 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]}}, {{cite news | date = July 20, 1958 | title = A 3-ENGINE ATLAS FALLS IN FLAMES; Most Powerful U.

In 1961, the Martin Company's Orlando Florida facility embarked on an effort to increase quality awareness and specifically launched a program to drive down the number of defects in the Pershing missile to one half of the [[Acceptable quality limit|acceptable quality level]] in half a year's time.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|12}}  Subsequently, the Army asked that the missile be delivered a month earlier than the contract date in 1962.  Martin marshaled all of its resources to meet this challenge and delivered the system with no discrepancies in hardware and documentation and were able to demonstrate operation within a day of the start of setup.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|14¡V15}}  After reviewing how Martin was able to overachieve, its management came to the conclusion that while it had not insisted on perfection in the past, it had in this instance, and that was all that was needed to attain outstanding product quality.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

Management commissioned a team to examine the phenomenon and come up with an action plan, which became the organizing, motivating, and initiating elements of Zero Defects.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|15}}  The Department of Defense also took notice and in 1964, began to actively encourage its vendors to adopt Zero Defects programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Zero Defects Campaign Gets DOD Impetus | newspaper = [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] | location = New York City | publication-date = November 30, 1964 | pages = 63–65 | issn = 0005-2175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = More ZD reports | newspaper = Quality Assurance | location = [[Wheaton, Illinois]] | publisher = Hitchcock Pub. Co. |date=August 1965  | oclc = 2449963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest in the program from outside firms, including [[Litton Industries]], [[Thiokol]], [[Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems|Westinghouse]], and [[Bendix Corporation]],&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|16}} was keen and many made visits to Martin to learn about it.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|16}}  Their feedback was incorporated and rounded out the program.  In particular, [[General Electric]] suggested that error cause removal be included in the program.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

Martin claimed a 54% defect reduction in defects in hardware under government audit during the first two years of the program.  General Electric reported a $2 million reduction in rework and scrap costs, [[RCA]] reported 75% of its departments in one division were achieving Zero Defects, and [[Sperry Corporation]] reported a 54% defect reduction over a single year.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

During its heyday, it was adopted by [[General Electric]], [[ITT Corporation]], [[Montgomery Ward]], [[Rolls-Royce Limited]], and the [[United States Army]] among other organizations.&lt;ref name="HarwoodAdopters"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harwood | first = William B. | title = Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements | year = 1993 | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780671749989 | oclc = 28710737 | page = 350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Zero Defects began in the aerospace and defense industry, thirty years later it was regenerated in the automotive world. During the 1990s, large companies in the [[automotive industry]] tried to cut costs by reducing their quality inspection processes and demanding that their suppliers dramatically improve the quality of their supplies.  This eventually resulted in demands for the "Zero Defects" standard. It is implemented all over the world.

==Later developments==
In 1979, Crosby penned ''Quality Is Free: The Art of Making Quality Certain'' which preserved the idea of Zero Defects in a [[Quality Management Maturity Grid]], in a 14-step quality improvement program, and in the concept of the "Absolutes of Quality Management".&lt;ref name="QualityIsFree"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = Quality Is Free: The Art of Making Quality Certain | year = 1979 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780070145122 | oclc = 3843884 | pages = 127–139 | chapter = 8: Quality Improvement Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The quality improvement program incorporated ideas developed or popularized by others (for example, [[Quality costs|cost of quality]] (step 4), employee education (step 8), and [[Quality circle|quality councils]] (step 13)) with the core motivation techniques of booklets, films, posters, speeches, and the "ZD Day" centerpiece.&lt;ref name="QualityWithoutTears"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = Quality Without Tears: The Art of Hassle-free Management | year = 1984 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780070145306 | oclc = 10277859 | pages = 97–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolutes of Quality Management===
According to Crosby, there are four Absolutes:&lt;ref name="QualityWithoutTears5886"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = Quality Without Tears: The Art of Hassle-free Management | year = 1984 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780070145306 | oclc = 10277859 | pages = 58–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1. "The definition of quality is conformance to requirements"====
Newcomers to manufacturing bring their own vague impressions of what quality involves.  But in order to tackle quality-related problems, there must be widespread agreement on the specifics of what quality means for a particular product.  Customer needs and expectations must be reduced to measurable quantities like length, or smoothness, or roundness and a standard must be specified for each.  These become the requirements for a product and the organization must inspect, or measure what comes out of the production process against those standards to determine whether the product conforms to those requirements or not.&lt;ref name="QualityIsFree"/&gt;{{rp|17}}  An important implication of this is that if management does not specify these requirements workers invent their own which may not align with what management would have intended had they provided explicit requirements to begin with.&lt;ref name="AbsolutesOfLeadership"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = The Absolutes of Leadership | year = 1996 | publisher = Pfeiffer &amp; Co. | location = [[San Diego]] | isbn = 9780893842765 | oclc = 34077426}}&lt;/REF&gt;{{rp|78}}

====2. "The system of quality is prevention"====
Companies typically focus on [[Inspection in manufacturing|inspection]] to ensure that defective product doesn't reach the customer.  But this is both costly and still lets nonconformances through.&lt;ref name="QualityWithoutTears67"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = Quality Without Tears: The Art of Hassle-free Management | year = 1984 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780070145306 | oclc = 10277859 | page = 67 | quote = Appraisal is an expensive and unreliable way of getting quality. Checking and sorting and evaluating only sift what is done.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prevention, in the form of "pledging ourselves to make a constant conscious effort to do our jobs right the first time", is the only way to guarantee zero defects.  Beyond that, examining the production process for steps where defects can occur and [[Poka-yoke|mistake proofing]] them contributes to defect-free production.&lt;ref name="QualityWithoutTears68"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = Quality Without Tears: The Art of Hassle-free Management | year = 1984 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780070145306 | oclc = 10277859 | page = 68 | quote = The concept of prevention is based on understanding the process that needs the preventive action...The secret of prevention is to look at the process and identify opportunities for error.  These can be controlled.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AbsolutesOfLeadershipP79"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = The Absolutes of Leadership | year = 1996 | publisher = Pfeiffer &amp; Co. | location = [[San Diego]] | isbn = 9780893842765 | oclc = 34077426 | page = 79 | quote = Prevention is the orientation for causing quality.  This is opposed to the "detection" way of thinking that was used for years.  Inspectors, testers, and auditors scanned the output of an operation in order to sort good from bad.  It is better to create an environment in which there is no "bad," to learn how to do things right the first time.  That takes prevention.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====3. "The performance standard is Zero Defects"====
Workers, at least during the [[post–World War II economic expansion]], had a lackadaisical attitude on the whole toward work.  Crosby saw [[Statistical process control|statistical quality control]] and the MIL-Q-9858 standard as contributing to this through [[Acceptable quality limit|acceptable quality level]]s—a concept that allows a certain number of acceptable defects and reinforces the attitude that mistakes are inevitable.&lt;ref name="AbsolutesOfLeadership"/&gt;{{rp|80}}&lt;REF name="QualityIsStillFree"/&gt;{{rp|79-80}}  Another contributor is the self-imposed pressure to produce something to sell, even if that thing is defective.&lt;REF name="QualityWithoutTears"/&gt;{{rp|72-73}}  Workers must "make the attitude of Zero Defects [their] personal standard."&lt;REF name="QualityIsStillFree"/&gt;{{rp|172}}

====4. "The measurement of quality is the price of nonconformance"====
To convince executives to take action to resolve issues of poor quality, costs associated with poor quality must be measured in monetary terms.&lt;ref name="AbsolutesOfLeadershipP78"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = The Absolutes of Leadership | year = 1996 | publisher = Pfeiffer &amp; Co. | location = [[San Diego]] | isbn = 9780893842765 | oclc = 34077426 | page = 78 | quote = Until quality is fitted into the cash flow and displayed as an equal with the other financial considerations, it will always be an add-on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QualityIsFree"/&gt;{{rp|121}}  Crosby uses the term "the price of nonconformance" in preference to "[[Quality costs|the cost of quality]]" to overcome the misimpression that higher quality requires higher costs.&lt;REF name="QualityIsStillFree"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = Quality Is Still Free: Making Quality Certain in Uncertain Times | year = 1996 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780070145320 | oclc = 32820340 | page = 191}}&lt;/REF&gt;  The point of writing ''Quality Is Free'' was to demonstrate that quality improvement efforts pay for themselves.&lt;ref name="QualityIsFree8586"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Crosby | title = Quality Is Free: The Art of Making Quality Certain | year = 1979 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9780070145122 | oclc = 3843884 | pages = 85–86| quote = "Quality is free. It's not a gift, but it is free.  ... Every penny you don't spend on doing things wrong, over, or instead becomes half a penny right on the bottom line."}}&lt;/REF&gt;  Crosby divides [[Quality costs|quality-related costs]] into the price of conformance and the price of nonconformance. The price of conformance includes quality-related planning, inspection, and auditing; the price of nonconformance includes scrap, rework, claims against warranty, unplanned service&lt;ref name="QualityIsFree"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

==Criticisms==
The main criticism is the amount of effort required to verify every person's performance in an organization.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|121}}  Confidence in the program, and therefore compliance to it, fades without this verification.&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt;{{rp|118}}&lt;REF name="Larson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Larson | first1 = Alan | year = 2003 | title = Demystifying Six Sigma | location = [[New York City| New York]] | publisher = American Management Association | page = 161 | isbn = 9780814471845 | oclc = 50808933 | quote = A year passed, and sure enough, he showed up with a huge yellow pin emblazoned with "ZD, 2 years."  He had now gone two consecutive years without making a mistake.  When you don't do anything, it is easy to not make mistakes or produce faulty product.}}&lt;/REF&gt;

Point 10 of [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|Deming's 14 points]] ("''Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for ''zero defects'' and new levels of productivity.''") is clearly aimed at ZD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.deming.org/theman/theories/fourteenpoints | title = The Fourteen Points For The Transformation Of Management | last1 = Deming | first1 = W. Edwards | authorlink1 = W. Edwards Deming | website = www.deming.org | publisher = The W. Edwards Deming Institute | location = [[Palos Verdes Estates, California]] | accessdate = November 24, 2013 | quote = Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Salsburg | first = David | author-link = David Salsburg | year = 2001 | title = The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century | publisher = [[W.

In the 1970s, the fad was called "zero defect."  They would have no defects in their product—a condition that Deming knew was completely impossible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph M. Juran]] was also critical of ZD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Juran | editor-first = Joseph M. | editor-link = Joseph M. Juran | year = 1995 | title = A History of Managing for Quality: The Evolution, Trends, and Future Directions of Managing for Quality | publisher = The [[American Society for Quality|American Society for Quality Control]] | publication-place = [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] | pages = 584–585 | isbn = 9780873893411 | oclc = 32394752 | quote = Some consultants proposed a sweeping solution by exhorting the workforce to make no mistakes—"Do it right the first time."  This simplistic approach was persuasive to those managers, who, at the time, believed that the primary cause of their company's quality problems was the carelessness and indifference of the workforce.  The facts were that the bulk of the quality problems had their origin in the managerial and technical processes.  In due course this approach was abandoned, but not before a lot of divisiveness had been generated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that Zero Defects is a motivational program aimed at encouraging employees to do better.&lt;ref name="Juran"&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Juran | first1 = Joseph M. | author-link1 = Joseph M.
