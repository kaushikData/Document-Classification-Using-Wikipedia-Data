{{For|the bed type|Four poster bed}}

A '''4-poster''' or four poster automotive test system is specifically designed for the testing of [[vehicles]] (cars, trucks). These test systems consist of 4 [[hydraulic actuator]]s on top of which the wheels of the vehicle are placed. Movements of the [[actuator]]s simulate the road surface and forces exerted by the road on the wheels. The movements of the system are tightly controlled by a [[digital test controller]]. During the research phase of a vehicle a 4-poster system is used to test newly designed [[suspension system]]s and their durability. In production 4-poster systems are usually used to test every vehicle at the end of the production line on squeak and rattle, which is a check to make sure the vehicle doesn't have any loose parts. Different kinds of testing are possible: sine test (sweep in frequency); simple wave form on each actuator; open loop test (driven by an external tension signal); a particular testing method called ICS control, which allows to reproduce on a car an actual service environment, starting from those data coming from the outdoor acquisition sessions.

'''''A Hacker Manifesto''''' is a critical manifesto written by [[McKenzie Wark]], which criticizes the [[commodification]] of information in the age of digital culture and globalization. It was published in the United States in 2004.

== Structure, style and influence ==
A Hacker Manifesto is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter including a series of short numbered paragraphs (a total of 389) that mimics the epigrammic style of [[Guy Debord]]’s [[The Society of the Spectacle]]. The opening sentence in the book, “A double spooking the world, the double of abstraction” &lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; is a clear homage to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]’ [[The Communist Manifesto]] which opens with the line “A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of Communism”.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, Engels, Friedrich. ''The communist manifesto''. 1848. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Wark builds on Marx and Engels’ ideas, alongside Deleuze and Guattari, by adding two new classes of workers into the mix - the “hacker class” and the “vectoralist class”.

As its title reads, the book really is a manifesto. It's a public declaration of principles for a radically new vision and a call to arms based on that vision. The written style is not 'difficult' in comparison to other post-structuralist philosophical texts; however in Wark's own words, it's "abstract". There are a few spelling/grammar mistakes and the language can be tricky to sink in at times, but its short, bullet style paragraphs depict a lot in the least possible space. Influenced by Marx, the book is awash with Communist Manifesto-like lingo, and Wark proceeds to link Marx's ideas to concepts in the current digital information age we live in, such as "intellectual property".

== Main ideas ==

=== Abstraction/hacker ===
For Wark, hacking begins with what he defines as an "abstraction", the construction of different and unrelated matters into previously unrealized relations. Hackers produce new conceptions, perceptions and sensations hacked out of raw data. Everything and anything is a code for the hacker to hack, be it "programming, language, poetic language, math, or music, curves or colourings" &lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and once hacked, they create the possibility for new things to enter the world. What they create is not necessarily "great", or "even good", but new, in the areas of culture, art, science, and philosophy or "in any production of knowledge where data can be extracted from it."

Wark argues that (new) information comes from the hack. It doesn't matter if you are a computer programmer, a philosopher, a teacher, a musician, a physicist, if you essentially produce new information - it's a hack [http://intertheory.org/wark-ruiz.htm]. In this sense, hackers are creators and they bring new ideas into the world. The aim of the book is to highlight the origins, purpose and efforts by this emerging hacker class, who produce new; concepts, perceptions, and sensations out of the stuff of raw data.

=== Commodification of information ===
The commodification of information is about how information that was free is appropriated by the vectoral class. McKenzie claims that free information is not a product, but a condition of the affective allocation of resources. There are many public and gift economies based around free information that keep the question of property open.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McKenzie Wark when information becomes a commodity it means we will only be able to see the information produced by the vectoral class. This is because they are the ones whose profits depend on the scarcity of information. So when information becomes intellectual property we are bound to repeat the same commodity form, because this is what the market decrees.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the previously mentioned hacker class that produces new information, free from the restrictions of a property form. This however is then used by the vectoral class, who own and control the means of production of information on an industrial scale. The hacker and the vectoral class aren’t always at odds with each other. They can compromise on the free flow of information and the extraction of wealth from this information to fund its development. Think of the open source movement, Reddit and Wikipedia. McKenzie Wark believes that the hacker class should ally themselves with the other producing classes so that they together don’t have to answer to the vectoral class anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vectoralist Class ===
The hacker's main opposition to creating a world where information is free, and free of scarcity, is what Wark denotes as the "vectoralist" class. Named for their control over vectors (i.e. various pathways and networks over which information flows), the vectoralist class are the modern day dotcom corporate giants, the transnational turbo-capitalist regime, who own the means of production and thus monopolize abstractions. They maintain control by waging "an intensive struggle to dispossess hackers of their intellectual property", enforced by a series of patent and copyright laws that are used to separate the hacker class from the fruits of their labor.

== Reception ==
"Ours is once again an age of manifestos. Wark's book challenges the new regime of property relations with all the epigrammatic vitality, conceptual innovation, and revolutionary enthusiasm of the great manifestos." —Michael Hardt, co-author of ''Empire''

"A Hacker Manifesto will yield some provocative ideas and real challenges to a world in which everything is commodified." —Eric J. Iannelli, The Times Literary Supplement

"Wark- responds to the problems created by the current proliferation of digital culture. He pumps air back into Marxian categories and spices them up with Debord and Gautarri. As Millions of young people illegally download electronic information off the Internet, Wark sees possibilities for revolutionary politics grounded on the chaotic circulation of information freed from the regime of property." -William W. Sokoloff, ''Political Theory'', Vol. 34, No. 1 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20452438]

"Writers, artists, biotechnologists, and software programmers belong to the 'hacker class' and share a class interest in openness and freedom, while the 'vectoralist' and 'ruling classes' are driven to contain, control, dominate, and own. Wark crafts a new analysis of the tension between the underdeveloped and 'overdeveloped' worlds, their relationships to surplus and scarcity, and the drive toward human actualization." —Michael Jensen, The Chronicle of Higher Education [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674015432&amp;content=reviews]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85961">An '''arbuscular mycorrhiza''' (plural ''mycorrhizae'' or ''mycorrhizas'', a.k.a. ''endomycorrhiza'') is a type of [[mycorrhiza]] in which the [[fungus]] (''AM fungi'', or AMF) penetrates the [[Cortex (botany)|cortical]] cells of the roots of a [[vascular plant]]. 
(Not to be confused with [[ectomycorrhiza]] or [[ericoid mycorrhiza]].)
 
Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s by fungi of the phylum [[Glomeromycota]]. AM fungi help plants to capture [[nutrient]]s such as [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]] and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants.&lt;ref name=brundrett2002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brundrett, M.C.|year= 2002|title= Coevolution of roots and mycorrhizas of land plants|journal= New Phytologist|volume= 154|pages= 275–304|doi= 10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00397.x|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that it is quicker to list the plants that do not form endomycorrhizae than those that do.&lt;ref name="Barbour1980"&gt;{{cite book | last=Barbour | first=M.G. | last2=Burk | first2=J.H. | last3=Pitts | first3=W.D. | title=Terrestrial plant ecology |page=118 | publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company | series=Frontiers in Physics | year=1980 | isbn=978-0-8053-0540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[symbiosis]] is a highly evolved mutualistic relationship found between fungi and plants, the most prevalent plant symbiosis known,&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simon, L. |author2=Bousquet, J. |author3=Levesque, C. |author4=Lalonde, M. |year=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=363 |pages=67–69 |doi=10.1038/363067a0 |issue=6424 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AMF is found in 80% of [[vascular plant]] families in existence today.&lt;ref name=schuessler&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schüßler, A. | year=2001 | title=A new fungal phylum, the ''Glomeromycota'': phylogeny and evolution | journal=Mycol.

The tremendous advances in research on mycorrhizal [[physiology]] and [[ecology]] over the past 40 years{{when|date=October 2015}} have led to a greater understanding of the multiple roles of AMF in the ecosystem. This knowledge is applicable to human endeavors of [[ecosystem management]], [[ecosystem restoration]], and [[agriculture]].

==Evolution of mycorrhizal symbiosis==

===Paleobiology===
Both [[paleobiological]] and molecular evidence indicate that AM is an ancient symbiosis that originated at least 460 million years ago. AM symbiosis is ubiquitous among land plants, which suggests that mycorrhizas were present in the early ancestors of extant land plants. This positive association with plants may have facilitated the development of land plants.&lt;ref name="simon"/&gt;

The [[Rhynie chert]] of the lower [[Devonian]] has yielded fossils of the earliest land plants in which AM fungi have been observed.&lt;ref name=remy&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Remy, W. |author2=Taylor, T. |author3=Hass, H. |author4=Kerp, H. |year=1994 |title=Four hundred-million-year-old vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume= 91 |pages=11841–11843 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.25.11841 |pmid=11607500|issue=25|pmc=45331 |bibcode=1994PNAS...9111841R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossilized plants containing mycorrhizal fungi were preserved in silica.

The [[Early Devonian]] saw the development of terrestrial flora. Plants of the Rhynie chert from the Lower Devonian (400 m.yrs ago) were found to contain structures resembling vesicles and spores of present ''Glomus'' species. Colonized fossil roots have been observed in ''[[Aglaophyton major]]'' and ''[[Rhynia]]'', which are ancient plants possessing characteristics of vascular plants and [[bryophyte]]s with primitive [[protostele|protostelic]] [[rhizome]]s.&lt;ref name=remy /&gt;

Intraradical [[mycelium]] was observed in root intracellular spaces, and arbuscules were observed in the layer thin wall cells similar to palisade [[parenchyma]]. The fossil arbuscules appear very similar to those of existing AMF.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt; The cells containing arbuscules have thickened walls, which are also observed in extant colonized cells.

Mycorrhizas from the [[Miocene]] exhibit a vesicular morphology closely resembling that of present [[Glomerales]]. This conserved morphology may reflect the ready availability of nutrients provided by the plant hosts in both modern and Miocene mutualisms.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kar, R.K., Mandaokar, B.D., Kar, R.|year= 2005|title= Mycorrhizal fossil fungi from the Miocene sediments of Mirozam, Northeast India|journal= Current Science|volume= 89|pages=257–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be argued that the efficacy of signaling processes is likely to have evolved since the Miocene, and this can not be detected in the fossil record. A finetuning of the signaling processes would improve coordination and nutrient exchange between [[symbiont]]s while increasing the fitness of both the fungi and the plant symbionts.

The nature of the relationship between plants and the ancestors of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is contentious. Two hypotheses are:
* Mycorrhizal symbiosis evolved from a [[parasite|parasitic]] interaction that developed into a mutually beneficial relationship.
* Mycorrhizal fungi developed from [[saprobe|saprobic]] fungi that became endosymbiotic.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt;
Both saprotrophs and biotrophs were found in the Rhynie Chert, but there is little evidence to support either hypothesis.

There is some fossil evidence that suggests that the parasitic fungi did not kill the host cells immediately upon invasion, although a response to the invasion was observed in the host cells. This response may have evolved into the chemical signaling processes required for symbiosis.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt;

In both cases, the symbiotic plant-fungi interaction is thought to have evolved from a relationship in which the fungi was taking nutrients from the plant into a symbiotic relationship where the plant and fungi exchange nutrients.

=== Molecular evidence ===

Increased interest in mycorrhizal symbiosis and the development of sophisticated molecular techniques has led to the rapid development of genetic evidence.  Wang ''et al.'' (2010) investigated plant genes involved in communication with order [[Glomales]] fungal partners (DMI1, DMI3, IPD3).&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wang, B. |author2=Yeun, L.H. |author3=Xue, Y. |author4=Liu, Y. |author5=Ane, J.M. |author6=Qiu, Y.L. |year=2010 |title=Presence of three mycorrhizal genes in the common ancestor of land plants suggests a key role of mycorrhizas in the colonization of land by plants|journal=[[New Phytologist]]|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03137.x| volume= 186 |pages=514–525 |pmid=20059702|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These three genes could be sequenced from all major clades of modern land plants, including [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, the most basal group, and phylogeny of the three genes proved to agree with then current land plant phylogenies. This implies that mycorrhizal genes must have been present in the common ancestor of land plants, and that they must have been vertically inherited since plants colonized land.&lt;ref name="wang" /&gt;

=== AM fungi and cyanobacteria symbiosis?===

It was revealed that AM fungi have the bacterial type core enzyme (ribonuclease III) of sRNA processing mechanism possibly related with symbiosis, by the result of horizontal gene transfer from cyanobacterial ancestor.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/gbe/evy002|pmid=29329439|pmc=5786227|title=Conserved Proteins of the RNA Interference System in the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare Provide New Insight into the Evolutionary History of Glomeromycota|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|volume=10|issue=1|pages=328–343|year=2018|last1=Lee|first1=Soon-Jae|last2=Kong|first2=Mengxuan|last3=Harrison|first3=Paul|last4=Hijri|first4=Mohamed}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding of genetic fossil inside AM fungi raises the hypothesis of the intimate relationship between AM fungi and cyanobacterial ancestors. At the same time, Geosiphon-Nostoc symbiosis was reported previously.&lt;ref&gt;Alexopolous C, Mims C, Blackwell M. 2004. Introductory mycology, 4th ed . Hoboken (NJ): John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Circadian clock evolution in AM fungi? ===

Surprisingly, despite their long time evolution as underground partner of the plant root of which environment is far from light or temperature fluctuation, AMF still have conserved circadian clock with its activation of fungal circadian oscillator (''frq'') by the blue light, similar to the case of the model circadian fungus ''Neurospora crassa''.&lt;ref name="Lee, SJ. 2018"&gt;Lee, SJ., Kong, M., Morse, D. et al. Expression of putative circadian clock components in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare. Mycorrhiza (2018) https://doi.org/10.1007/s00572-018-0843-y&lt;/ref&gt; The proved conservation of circadian clock and output genes in ''R. irregulare'' opens the door to the study of circadian clocks in the fungal partner of AM symbiosis. The characterized AMF ''frq'' gene by same research &lt;ref name="Lee, SJ. 2018"/&gt; is the first ''frq'' gene identified outgroup of Dikarya, which suggest the ''frq'' gene evolution in fungal kingdom is much older than previously investigated.

== Physiology ==

=== Presymbiosis ===
The development of AM fungi prior to root colonization, known as presymbiosis, consists of three stages: spore germination, hyphal growth, host recognition and [[appressorium]] formation.
;Spore germination
Spores of the AM fungi are thick-walled multi-nucleate resting structures.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt; The germination of the spore does not depend on the plant, as spores have been germinated under experimental conditions in the absence of plants both ''[[in vitro]]'' and in soil. However, the rate of germination can be increased by host root [[exudate]]s.&lt;ref name=douds/&gt; AM fungal spores germinate given suitable conditions of the soil matrix, temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, pH, and phosphorus concentration.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite book | author= Wright S.F.| title=  Management of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi | year=2005 | editors= "Roots and Soil Management: Interactions between roots and the soil." R.W. Zobel &amp; S.F. Wright | location=USA | publisher= American Society of Agronomy | pages= 183–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Hyphal growth
The growth of AM [[hypha]]e through the soil is controlled by host root exudates known as [[strigolactone]]s, and the soil phosphorus concentration.&lt;ref name=akiyama05/&gt;
Low-phosphorus concentrations in the soil increase hyphal growth and branching as well as induce plant exudation of compounds that control hyphal branching intensity.&lt;ref name=douds&gt;Douds, D.D. and Nagahashi, G. 2000.

The branching of AM fungal hyphae grown in phosphorus media of 1 mM is significantly reduced, but the length of the germ tube and total hyphal growth were not affected. A concentration of 10 mM phosphorus inhibited both hyphal growth and branching. This phosphorus concentration occurs in natural soil conditions and could thus contribute to reduced mycorrhizal colonization.&lt;ref name=nagashi/&gt;
&lt;!--comment: this data cannot be correct!--&gt;
;Host recognition
Root exudates from AMF host plants grown in a liquid medium with and without phosphorus have been shown to affect hyphal growth. Spores of [[Gigasporaceae|Gigaspora margarita]] were grown in host plant exudates. Hyphae of fungi grown in the exudates from roots starved of phosphorus grew more and produced tertiary branches compared to those grown in exudates from plants given adequate phosphorus. When the growth-promoting root exudates were added in low concentration, the AM fungi produced scattered long branches. As the concentration of exudates was increased, the fungi produced more tightly clustered branches. At the highest-concentration arbuscules, the AMF structures of phosphorus exchange were formed.&lt;ref name=nagashi/&gt;

This chemotaxic fungal response to the host plants exudates is thought to increase the efficacy of host root colonization in low-phosphorus soils.&lt;ref name=douds/&gt; It is an adaptation for fungi to efficiently explore the soil in search of a suitable plant host.&lt;ref name=nagashi/&gt;

Further evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal  fungi exhibit host-specific [[chemotaxis]], that enable hyphal growth toward the roots of a potential host plant: Spores of [[Glomus (fungus)|Glomus mosseae]] were separated from the roots of a host plant, nonhost plants, and dead host plant by a membrane permeable only to hyphae. In the treatment with the host plant, the fungi crossed the membrane and always emerged within 800&amp;nbsp;µm of the root, but not in the treatments with nonhost plants and dead plants.&lt;ref name=sbrana&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sbrana, C. |author2=Giovannetti, M.|year= 2005|title= Chemotropism in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae|journal= Mycorrhiza|pmid=16133246|volume= 15|issue=7|pages= 539–545|doi= 10.1007/s00572-005-0362-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecular techniques have been used to understand the signaling pathways between arbuscular mycorrhizae and plant roots. In 2003 it was shown how the AM undergoes physiological changes in the presence of exudates from potential host plant roots, to colonize it. Host plant root exudates trigger and turn on AM fungal genes required for the respiration of spore carbon compounds. In experiments, transcription rate of 10 genes increased half-hour after exposure and at an even greater rate after 1 hour. after 4 hours exposure AM respond with morphological growth. Genes isolated from that time are involved in mitochondrial activity and enzyme production. The fungal respiration rate, measured by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption rate, increased by 30% 3 hours after exposure to root exudates, indicating that host plant root exudates stimulate AMF spore mitochondrial activity. It may be part of a fungal regulatory mechanism that conserves spore energy for efficient growth and the hyphal branching upon receiving signals from a potential host plant.&lt;ref name=tamasloukht&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Tamasloukht, M., Sejalon-Delmas, N., Kluever, A., Jauneau, A., Roux., C., Becard, G., Franken, P.|year= 2003|title= Root Factors Induce Mitochondrial-Related Gene Expression and Fungal Respiration during the Developmental Switch from Asymbiosis to Presymbiosis in the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Gigaspora rosea|journal= Plant Physiology|volume= 131| pages=1468–1478|doi= 10.1104/pp.012898|pmid= 12644696|issue=3|pmc=166906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Appressorium
When arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae encounter the root of a host plant, an appressorium or 'infection structure' forms on the root epidermis. From this structure hyphae can penetrate into the host's [[parenchyma]] cortex.&lt;ref name=gp&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gianinazzi-Pearson, V.|year= 1996|title= Plant Cell Responses to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi: Getting to the Roots of the Symbiosis|journal= The Plant Cell|volume= 8|pages= 1871–1883| pmid=12239368|issue=10 |pmc=161321|doi=10.1105/tpc.8.10.1871|jstor=3870236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AM need no chemical signals from the plant to form the appressoria. AM fungi could form appressoria on the cell walls of “ghost” cells in which the [[protoplast]] had been removed to eliminate signaling between the fungi and the plant host. However, the hyphae did not further penetrate the cells and grow in toward the root cortex, which indicates that signaling between symbionts is required for further growth once appressoria are formed.&lt;ref name=douds/&gt;

===Symbiosis===
Once inside the parenchyma, the fungus forms highly branched structures for nutrient exchange with the plant called "arbuscules".&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; These are the distinguishing structures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus. Arbuscules are the sites of exchange for phosphorus, carbon, water, and other nutrients.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;  There are two forms: [[Paris type|''Paris'' type]] is characterized by the growth of [[hyphae]] from one cell to the next; and [[Arum type|''Arum'' type]] is characterized by the growth of hyphae in the space between plant cells.&lt;ref name="armstrong" &gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3761710 | title = The Interface between the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Glomus intraradices and Root Cells of Panax quinquefolius: A Paris-Type Mycorrhizal Association | year = 2002 |author1=Lara Armstrong |author2=R.

The host plant exerts a control over the intercellular hyphal proliferation and arbuscule formation. There is a decondensation of the plant's [[chromatin]], which indicates increased transcription of the plant's [[DNA]] in arbuscule-containing cells.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; Major modifications are required in the plant host cell to accommodate the arbuscules. The [[vacuole]]s shrink and other cellular [[organelle]]s proliferate. The plant cell [[cytoskeleton]] is reorganized around the arbuscules.

There are two other types of hyphae that originate from the colonized host plant root. Once colonization has occurred, short-lived runner hyphae grow from the plant root into the soil. These are the hyphae that take up phosphorus and micronutrients, which are conferred to the plant. AM fungal hyphae have a high surface-to-volume ratio, making their absorptive ability greater than that of plant roots.&lt;ref name=tuomi&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tuomi, J. |author2=Kytoviita, M. |author3=Hardling, R.|year= 2001|title = Cost efficiency of nutrient acquisition of mycorrhizal symbiosis for the host plant|journal= Oikos | volume = 92| pages = 62–70|doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMF hyphae are also finer than roots and can enter into pores of the soil that are inaccessible to roots.&lt;ref name=bolan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bolan, N.S.|year= 1991|title= A critical review of the role of mycorrhizal fungi in the uptake of phosphorus by plants|journal= Plant and Soil|volume= 134|pages= 189–207|doi= 10.1007/BF00012037|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third type of AMF hyphae grows from the roots and colonizes other host plant roots. The three types of hyphae are morphologically distinct.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;

===Nutrient uptake and exchange===
AM fungi are [[obligate symbiont]]s. They have limited [[saprobic]] ability and depend on the plant for their carbon nutrition.&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley, J.L., Smith , S.E., 1983. Mycorrhizal Symbiosis. Academic Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt; AM fungi take up the products of the plant host's photosynthesis as [[hexose]]s.

Carbon transfer from plant to fungi may occur through the arbuscules or intraradical hyphae.&lt;ref name=pfeffer&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pfeffer, P. |author2=Douds D. |author3=Becard, G. |author4=Shachar-Hill, Y.|year= 1999|title= Carbon Uptake and the Metabolism and Transport of Lipids in an Arbuscular Mycorrhiza|journal= Plant Physiology|volume= 120|pages= 587–598|doi= 10.1104/pp.120.2.587|pmid= 10364411|issue=2|pmc=59298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary synthesis from the hexoses by AM occurs in the intraradical [[mycelium]]. Inside the mycelium, hexose is converted to [[trehalose]] and [[glycogen]]. Trehalose and glycogen are carbon storage forms that can be rapidly synthesized and degraded and may buffer the intracellular sugar concentrations.&lt;ref name=pfeffer /&gt; The intraradical hexose enters the oxidative [[pentose phosphate pathway]], which produces [[pentose]] for nucleic acids.

[[Lipid]] biosynthesis also occurs in the intraradical mycelium. Lipids are then stored or exported to extraradical hyphae where they may be stored or metabolized. The breakdown of lipids into hexoses, known as [[gluconeogenesis]], occurs in the extraradical mycelium.&lt;ref name=pfeffer /&gt; Approximately 25% of the carbon translocated from the plant to the fungi is stored in the extraradical hyphae.&lt;ref name=hamel /&gt; Up to 20% of the host plant's carbon may be transferred to the AM fungi.&lt;ref name=pfeffer /&gt; This represents the host plant's considerable carbon investment in [[mycorrhizal network]] and contribution to the below-ground organic carbon pool.

Increasing the plant's carbon supply to the AM fungi increases uptake and transfer of phosphorus from fungi to plant &lt;ref&gt;H. Bücking and Y.Shachar-Hill (2005). ''Phosphate uptake, transport and transfer by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices is stimulated by increased carbohydrate availability'' New Phytologist 165:899–912&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, phosphorus uptake and transfer is lowered when the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthate]] supplied to the fungi is decreased. Species of AMF differ in their abilities to supply the plant with phosphorus.&lt;ref name=smith2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, S. |author2=Smith, A. |author3=Jakobsen, I.|year= 2003|title= Mycorrhizal Fungi Can Dominate Phosphate Supply to Plants Irrespective of Growth Responses|journal= Plant Physiology |volume =133|pages= 16–20|doi= 10.1104/pp.103.024380|pmid= 12970469|issue=1|pmc=1540331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, arbuscular mycorrhizae are poor symbionts, providing little phosphorus while taking relatively high amounts of carbon.&lt;ref name=smith2003 /&gt;

The main benefit of mycorrhizas to plants has been attributed to increased uptake of nutrients, especially phosphorus. This may be due to increased surface area in contact with soil, increased movement of nutrients into mycorrhizae, a modified root environment, and increased storage.&lt;ref name=bolan /&gt; Mycorrhizas can be much more efficient than plant roots at taking up phosphorus. Phosphorus travels to the root or via diffusion and hyphae reduce the distance required for diffusion, thus increasing uptake. The rate of phosphorus flowing into mycorrhizae can be up to six times that of the root hairs.&lt;ref name=bolan /&gt; In some cases, the role of phosphorus uptake can be completely taken over by the mycorrhizal network, and all of the plant's phosphorus may be of hyphal origin.&lt;ref name=smith2003 /&gt; Less is known about the role of [[nitrogen nutrition in the arbuscular mycorrhizal system]] and its impact on the symbiosis and community. While significant advances have been made in elucidating the mechanisms of this complex interaction, much investigation remains to be done.

Mycorrhizal activity increases the phosphorus concentration available in the [[rhizosphere]]. Mycorrhizae lower the root zone [[pH]] by selective uptake of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ([[ammonium]]-ions) and by releasing  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Decreased soil pH increases the solubility of phosphorus precipitates. The hyphal NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake also increases the [[nitrogen]] flow to the plant as the soil's inner surfaces absorb ammonium and distribute it by diffusion.&lt;ref name=hamel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamel, C.|title= Impact of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi on N and P cycling in the root zone|journal= Canadian Journal of Soil Science|volume= 84|pages = 383–395|doi=10.4141/S04-004|year=2004|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

=== Biogeography ===
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are most frequent in plants growing on mineral soils, and are of extreme importance for plants growing in nutrient-deficient substrates such as in [[volcanic soil]] and [[sand dune ecology|sand dune environments]]. The populations of AM fungi is greatest in plant communities with high diversity such as [[tropical rainforest]]s and temperate grasslands where they have many potential host plants and can take advantage of their ability to colonize a broad host range.&lt;ref name=smithread02&gt;Smith, S.E., Read D.J. Mycorrhizal Symbiosis. 2002. Academic Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lower incidence of mycorrhizal colonization in very arid or nutrient-rich soils. Mycorrhizas have been observed in [[aquatic habitat]]s; however, waterlogged soils have been shown to decrease colonization in some species.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt;
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are found in 80% of plant species &lt;ref name="Smith, Read 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith, Read|first=Sally, DJ|title=Mycorrhizal symbiosis|year=2008|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been surveyed on all continents except Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Opik 2010 233–241"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Opik|first=M|author2=Vanatoa A|author3=Vanatoa E|author4=Moora M|author5=Davidson J|author6=Kalwij JM|author7=Reier U|author8=Zobel M|title=The online database MaarjAM reveals global and ecosystemic distribution patterns in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota)|journal=New Phytologist|year=2010|volume=188|issue=1|pages=233–241|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03334.x|pmid=20561207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kivlin_SBB /&gt; The biogeography of [[glomeromycota]] is influenced by dispersal limitation,&lt;ref name="Lekberg 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lekberg|first=Y|author2=Koide RT |author3=Rohr JR |author4=Aldirch-Wolfe L |author5=Morton JB |title=Role of niche restrictions and dispersal in the composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities|journal=Journal of Ecology|year=2007|volume=95|pages=95–100|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01193.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; environmental factors such as climate,&lt;ref name="Opik 2010 233–241"/&gt; soil series and soil pH,&lt;ref name=Kivlin_SBB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kivlin| first=Stephanie| author2=Christine V.

=== Response to plant communities ===
The specificity, host range, and degree of colonization of mycorrhizal fungi are difficult to analyze in the field due to the complexity of interactions between the fungi within a root and within the system. There is no clear evidence to suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi exhibit specificity for colonization of potential AM host plant species as do fungal [[pathogen]]s for their host plants.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; This may be due to the opposite selective pressure involved.

In pathogenic relations, the host plant benefits from mutations that prevent colonization, whereas, in a mutualistic symbiotic relationship, the plant benefits from mutation that allow for colonization by AMF.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; However, plant species differ in the extent and dependence on colonization by certain AM fungi, and some plants may be facultative [[mycotroph]]s, while others may be obligate mycotrophs.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; Recently, mycorrhizal status has been linked to plant distributions,&lt;ref name="Hempel 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hempel|first=Stefan|author2=Gotzenberger L|author3=Kuhn I|author4=Michalski SG|author5=Rillig M|author6=Zobel M|author7=Moora M|title=Mycorrhizas in the Central European flora – relationships with plant life history traits and ecology|journal=Ecology|year=2013|doi=10.1890/12-1700.1|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1389–1399}}&lt;/ref&gt; with obligate mycorrhizal plants occupying warmer, drier habitats while facultative mycorrhizal plants occupy larger ranges of habitats.

The ability of the same AM fungi to colonize many species of plants has ecological implications. Plants of different species can be linked underground to a common mycelial network.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; One plant may provide the photosynthate carbon for the establishment of the mycelial network that another plant of a different species can utilize for mineral uptake. This implies that arbuscular mycorrhizae are able to balance below-ground intra–and interspecific plant interactions.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt;

Since Glomeromycota fungi live inside plant roots, they can be influenced substantially by their plant host and in return affect plant communities as well. Plants can allocate up to 30% of their photosynthate carbon to AM fungi &lt;ref name="Drigo 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drigo|first=B|last2=Pijl |first2=AS |last3=Duyts |first3=H |last4=Kielak |first4=AM |last5=Gamper |first5=HA |last6=Houtekamer |first6=MJ |last7=Boschker |first7=HTS |last8=Bodelier |first8=PLE |last9=Whiteley |first9=AS |last10=Veen |first10=JAV |last11=Kowalchuk |first11=GA|title=Shifting carbon flow from roots into associated microbial communities in response to elevated atmospheric CO2|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2010|volume=107|issue=24|pages=10938–10942|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10710938D |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912421107 |pmid=20534474 |pmc=2890735}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in return AM fungi can acquire up to 80% of plant phosphorus and nitrogen.&lt;ref name="Smith, Read 2008"/&gt; The diversity of AM fungal communities has been positively linked to plant diversity,&lt;ref name="van der Heijden 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Heijden|first=MG|author2=Boller AT|author3=Wiemken A|author4=Sanders IR|title=Different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species are potential determinants of plant community structure|journal=Ecology|year=1998|volume=79|issue=6|pages=2082–2091|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2082:damfsa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant productivity&lt;ref name="van der Heijden 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Heijden|first=MGA|author2=Bardgett RD|author3=Van Straalen NM|title=The unseen majority: soil microbes as drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Ecology Letters|year=2008|volume=11|pages=296–310|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01139.x|pmid=18047587|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and herbivory.&lt;ref name="Vannette 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vannette|first=RL|author2=Rasmann S|title=Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi mediate below-ground plant–herbivore interactions: a phylogenetic study|journal=Functional Ecology|year=2012|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1033–1042|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02046.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can be influenced by small scale interactions with the local plant community.

The mycorrhizal status of invasive plant species often varies between regions.

=== Interactions between AM fungi and other plant symbionts ===
All symbionts within a plant host interact, often in unpredictable ways. A 2010 meta-analysis indicated that plants colonized by both AM fungi and vertically transmitted endophytes often are larger than plants independently colonized by these symbionts.&lt;ref name="Larimer 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=AL|author2=Bever JD|author3=Clay K|title=The interactive effects of plant microbial symbionts: a review and meta-analysis| journal=Symbiosis|year=2010| volume=51|issue=2|pages=139–148|doi=10.1007/s13199-010-0083-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this relationship is context-dependent as AM fungi can interact synergistically with fungal endophytes inhabiting the leaves of their host plant,&lt;ref name="Novas 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novas|first=MV|author2=Iannone LJ|author3=Godeas AM|author4=Cabral D|title=Positive association between mycorrhiza and foliar endophytes in a Poa bonariensis|journal=Mycological Progress| year=2009| volume=8| pages=75–81|doi=10.1007/s11557-008-0579-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larimer 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=AL|author2=Bever JD|author3=Clay K|title=Consequences of simultaneous interactions of fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with a shared host grass|journal=Oikos|year=2012|volume=121|issue=12|pages=2090–2096|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20153.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or antagonistically.&lt;ref name="Omacini 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Omacini|first=M|author2=Eggers T|author3=Bonkowski M|author4=Gange AC|author5=Jones TH|title=Leaf endophytes affect mycorrhizal status and growth of co-infected and neighboring plants|journal=Functional Ecology|year=2006|volume=20|issue=2|pages=226–232|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2006.01099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mack 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mack|first=KML|author2=Rudgers JA|title=Balancing multiple mutualists: asymmetric interactions among plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and fungal endophytes|journal=Oikos| year=2008|volume=117|issue=2| pages=310–320| doi=10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15973.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.722.4169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=QH| author2=Parsons AJ| author3=Xue H|author4=Fraser K|author5=Ryan GD|author6=Newman JA|author7=Rasmussen S|title=Competition between foliar Neotyphodium lolii endophytes and mycorrhizal Glomus spp. fungi in Lolium perenne depends on resource supply and host carbohydrate content|journal=Functional Ecology| year=2011| volume=25|issue=4| pages=910–920| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01853.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ranges of interactions can occur between AM fungi and [[ectomycorrhizal fungus|ectomycorrhizal fungi]] and [[dark septate endophytes]].&lt;ref name="Reininger 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reininger|first=V|author2=Sieber TN|title=Mycorrhiza reduces adverse effects of dark septate endophytes (DSE) on growth of conifers|journal=PLOS One|year=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=1–10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042865|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...742865R|pmid=22900058|pmc=3416760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response to environmental gradients ===
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many [[environmental gradient]]s. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa.&lt;ref name="Klironomos 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klironomos|first=JN|author2=Hart MM|author3=Gurney JE|author4=Moutoglis P|title=Interspecific differences in the tolerance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to freezing and drying|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|year=2001|volume=79|issue=10|pages=1161–1166|doi=10.1139/cjb-79-10-1161}}&lt;/ref&gt; AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations,&lt;ref name="Auge 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auge|first=RM|title=Water relations, drought and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis| journal=Mycorrhiza| year=2001|volume=11|pages=3–42|doi=10.1007/s005720100097}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=NC|author2=Rowland DL |author3=Corkidi L |author4=Egerton-Warburton LM |author5=Allen EB |title=Nitrogen enrichment alters mycorrhizal allocation at five mesic to semiarid grasslands|journal=Ecology|year=2003|volume=84|issue=7|pages=1895–1908|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1895:neamaa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=NC|author2=Wilson GWT|author3=Bowker MA|author4=Wilson JA|author5=Miller RM|title=Resource limitation is a driver of local adaptation in mycorrhizal symbioses|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2010|volume=107|issue=5|pages=2093–2098|bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.2093J |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0906710107|pmid=20133855|pmc=2836645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
AM composition often becomes less diverse on mountain tops than at lower elevations, which is driven by the composition of plant species.&lt;ref name="Gai 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gai|first=JP|author2=Tian H|author3=Yang FY|author4=Christie P|author5=Li XL|author6=Klironomos JN|title=Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity along a Tibetan elevation gradient|journal=Pedobiologia|year=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=145–151|doi=10.1016/j.pedobi.2011.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AM fungi have been shown to improve plant tolerance to abiotic environmental factors such as [[salinity]]. They alleviate salt stress and benefit plant growth and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porcel | first1 = R | last2 = Aroca | first2 = R | last3 = Ruiz-Lozano | first3 = JM | year = 2012 | title = stress alleviation using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

===Rhizosphere ecology===
The [[rhizosphere]] is the soil zone in the immediate vicinity of a root system.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis affects the community and diversity of other organisms in the soil. This can be directly seen by the release of exudates, or indirectly by a change in the plant species and plant exudates type and amount.&lt;ref name=marschner&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marschner, P. |author2=Timonen, S.|year= 2004|title= Interactions between plant species and mycorrhizal colonization on the bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere|journal= Applied Soil Ecology|volume= 28|pages= 23–36|doi= 10.1016/j.apsoil.2004.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycorrhizae diversity has been shown to increase plant species diversity as the potential number of associations increases. Dominant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can prevent the invasion of non-mycorrhizal plants on land where they have established symbiosis and promote their mycorrhizal host.&lt;ref name=eriksson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eriksson, A.|year= 2001|title= Arbuscular mycorrhizae in relation to management history, soil nutrients and plant diversity|journal= Plant Ecology|volume= 155|pages=129–137|doi= 10.1023/A:1013204803560|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the '''myc factor''', which activates the [[Nod factor|nodulation factor]]'s inducible gene MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the [[Diazotroph|nitrogen fixing]], [[Rhizobia|rhizobial bacteria]] (Kosuta ''et al.'' 2003). When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie ''et al.'' 2003). Molecules similar to Nod factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, lateral root formation and enhance mycorrhization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=2010049751 | title=Lipochitooligosaccharides Stimulating Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the [[Root nodule|nodulations]] and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.&lt;ref name=hamel /&gt;

The extent of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and species affects the bacterial population in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref name="Schrey-et-al-2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schrey | first1=Silvia D. | display-authors=etal | year=2012 | title=Production of fungal and bacterial growth modulating secondary metabolites is widespread among mycorrhiza-associated streptomycetes | journal=BMC Microbiology | volume=12 | issue=1| pages=164 | doi=10.1186/1471-2180-12-164| pmid=22852578 | pmc=3487804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial species differ in their abilities to compete for carbon compound root exudates. A change in the amount or composition of root exudates and fungal exudates due to the existing AM mycorrhizal colonization determines the diversity and abundance of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref name=marschner /&gt;

The influence of AM fungi on plant root and shoot growth may also have indirect effect on the rhizosphere bacteria. AMF contributes a substantial amount of carbon to the rhizosphere through the growth and degeneration of the hyphal network. There is also evidence to suggest that AM fungi may play an important role on mediating the plant species' specific effect on the bacterial composition of the rhizosphere.&lt;ref name=marschner /&gt;

=== Glomeromycota and global climate change ===
Global climate change is affecting AM fungal communities and interactions between AM fungi and their plant hosts. While it is generally accepted that interactions between organisms will affect their response to global climate change, we still lack the ability to predict the outcome of these interactions in future climates.&lt;ref name="Van der Putten 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van der Putten|first=WH|title=Climate change, Aboveground-belowground interactions and species' range shifts|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|year=2012|volume=43|pages=365–383|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110411-160423|hdl=20.500.11755/0f7d61b9-e435-4da3-b3d6-3ca115bdbdb5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent meta-analyses, AM fungi were found to increase plant biomass under drought conditions and decrease plant biomass under simulated nitrogen deposition studies.&lt;ref name=Worchel_MicroEcol&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worchel|first=Elise|first2=Hannah E. |last2=Giauque |first3=Stephanie N. |last3=Kivlin|title=Fungal symbionts alter plant drought response|journal=Microbial Ecology|year=2013|volume= 65|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s00248-012-0151-6 |pmid=23250115|pages=671–678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kivlin 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kivlin|first=SN|author2=Emery SM|author3=Rudgers JA|title=Fungal symbionts alter plant response to global change|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2013|doi=10.3732/ajb.1200558|pmid=23757444|volume=100|issue=7|pages=1445–1457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi themselves have been shown to increase their biomass in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 &lt;ref name="Treseder 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treseder|first=KK|title=A meta-analysis of mycorrhizal responses to nitrogen, phosphorus, and atmospheric CO2 in field studies|journal=New Phytologist|year=2004|volume=164|issue=2|pages=347–355|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01159.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants lacking arbuscular mycorrhizae===
Members of the mustard family ([[Brassicaceae]]), such as cabbage, cauliflower, canola, and [[crambe]], do not establish arbuscular mycorrihizal fungi on their roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glomalin | title = Hiding Place for a Third of the World's Stored Soil Carbon | url = | journal = Agricultural Research Journal | volume = | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular genetic analyses of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi==
In the past ten years there have been spectacular advances in molecular genetic technologies and tools. These advances allow microbial and mycorrhizal ecologists to ask new and exciting questions about the ecological and evolutionary roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi as individuals, in communities and ecosystems. Genetic analyses of AM fungi have been used to explore the genetic structure of single spores using multilocus genotyping,&lt;ref name=Stukenbrock&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stukenbrock|first=Eva|author2=Rosendahl, Soren|title=Clonal diversity and population genetic structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( Glomus spp.) studied by multilocus genotyping of single spores|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2005|volume=14|issue=3|pages=743–752|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2005.02453.x|pmid=15723666}}&lt;/ref&gt; AM fungal diversity and adaptation across multiple grassland communities,&lt;ref name=Baoming&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baoming|first=Ji|title=Patterns of diversity and adaptation in Glomeromycota from three prairie grasslands|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2013|volume=22|issue=9|pages=2573–2587|doi=10.1111/mec.12268|display-authors=etal|pmid=23458035}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the way up to a global investigation of AM fungal diversity, which greatly increased the described molecular diversity within the phylum Glomeromycota.&lt;ref name="Opik 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Opik|first=Maarja|title=Global sampling of plant roots expands the described molecular diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2013|volume=23|issue=5|pages=411–430|doi=10.1007/s00572-013-0482-2|pmid=23422950|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the recent advances in molecular genetics clearly permit the analysis of microbial communities at much finer and functional scales and potentially with more confidence than previous methods. The classical AM fungal identification method of spore extraction from soil and further spore morphological analysis&lt;ref name="johnson 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Nancy|last2=Zak|first2=D.R. |last3=Tilman |first3=D. |last4=Pfleger |first4=F.L|title=Dynamics of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae during old field succession|journal=Oecologia|year=1991|volume=86|issue=3|pages=349–358|doi=10.1007/bf00317600|pmid=28312920|bibcode=1991Oecol..86..349J}}&lt;/ref&gt; is fraught with complicating issues due to the various strategies and forms of AM fungi, e.g., lack of sporulation in certain species, seasonality, high unculturability, possible misidentification (human error), and new evidence of multi-nucleate spores&lt;ref name="marleau 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marleau|first=Julie|author2=Dalpé, Y.|authorlink2=Yolande Dalpé|author3=St-Arnaud, M.|author4=Hijri, M.|title=Spore development and nuclear inheritance in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=51|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-51|pmid=21349193|pmc=3060866}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high genetic variation within clonal AM species.&lt;ref name=ehinger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehinger|first=Martine O.|author2=Daniel Croll|author3=Alexander M.

Additionally, by following the traditional extraction, culture and microscopic identification methods, there is no way to determine active/functioning AM fungal populations, which are likely the most important when attempting to relate plant-AM symbiotic interactions and mechanisms to ecological or ecosystem function. This is especially true in the case of root colonization analyses, which can determine percentage of roots colonized by AM fungi. The major problem with this analysis is in field soils, which contain multiple species of AM fungi in association with a target plant at the same time (see Ecology of AM). The identification of the associated fungal symbionts is impossible without the use of molecular methods. Though genetic analysis of AM fungal communities has advanced a great deal in the past decade, the methodology is not yet completely refined. Below is an overview of the methods used in molecular genetic analyses of AM fungi, along with applications to research, future directions and some of their problems.

===Overview of methods===

====DNA/RNA====
Genetic analyses of AM fungi from soil and root samples range in their applicability to answer ecological or phylogenetic questions. DNA analyses utilize various nuclear markers to describe AM fungi and represent different regions of the nuclear [[Ribosomal RNA|ribosomal]] operon ([[18S ribosomal RNA|18S rRNA]]) found in all eukaryotic organisms. The DNA analysis of AM fungi using these markers began in the early 1990s&lt;ref name="simon 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=L|author2=Lalonde, M.|author3=Bruns, T.D|title=Specific amplification of 18S fungal ribosomal genes from vesicular-arbuscular endomycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots|journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol.|year=1992|volume=58|pages=291–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are continuing to be developed today. The small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, the internal transcribed spacer ([[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]]) gene, and the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene are currently the most common DNA markers used. The SSU region has been used most frequently in ecological studies,&lt;ref name="helgason 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helgason|first=Thorunn|author2=Fitter, A.H.|author3=Young, J.P.W|title=Molecular diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonising Hyacinthoides non-scripta (bluebell) in a seminatural woodland|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=1999|volume=8|issue=4|pages=659–666|doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1999.00604.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ITS and LSU regions have been predominantly used in taxonomic constructions of the phylum Glomeromycota.&lt;ref name="redecker 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redecker|first=Dirk|author2=Arthur Schüßler|author3=Herbert Stockinger|author4=Sidney L. Stürmer|author5=Joseph B. Morton|author6=Christopher Walker|title=An evidence-based consensus for the classification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota)|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2013|volume=23|issue=7|pages=515–531|doi=10.1007/s00572-013-0486-y|pmid=23558516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General procedure====
The first step of all molecular genetic analyses is the preparation and/or preservation of a sample. In the case of AM fungi, samples typically come in the form of soil or roots that will contain AM spores, hyphae and/or various AM colonization structures. Sample preservation will vary depending on the desired analysis (DNA or RNA). For analysis of DNA, samples should either be processed immediately or kept frozen prior to nucleic acid extraction. For analysis of RNA, samples should be [[Cryopreservation|cryogenically frozen]] (−196&amp;nbsp;°C) almost immediately upon collection, or stored in an RNA stabilization and preservation reagent (e.g. RNAlater). The next step is to extract the desired nucleic acids from the sample, which can be performed manually using various published extraction methods or by using one of the many commercially available DNA/RNA extraction kits. Due to the labile nature of RNA, synthesis of complementary DNA ([[Complementary DNA|cDNA]]) using extracted RNA as a template is performed for further analysis. For most molecular genetic sequencing methods of AM fungi a PCR step is required to increase the total amount of target DNA/RNA/cDNA. There are many PCR conditions proposed for analysis of AM fungi and some of the most accessible are briefly summarized below.

One difficulty with the genetic analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has been the selection of ideal, comprehensive, and repeatable primers or primer sets.&lt;ref name=Kohout&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohout|first=Petr|title=Comparison of commonly used primer sets for evaluating arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities: Is there a universal solution?|journal=Soil Biology &amp; Biogeochemistry|date=January 2014|volume=68|pages=482–493|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071713003027|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.08.027|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are four common AM fungal specific markers/primers used in genetic sequencing to describe AM fungal communities in a sample, ideally to species level identification. These sequence markers are designed for the nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 18S region and are either used individually or in some combination.&lt;ref name=stockinger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stockinger|first=Herbert|first2=Manuela |last2=Kruger |first3=Arthur |last3=Schüßler|title=DNA barcoding of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|journal=New Phytologist|year=2010|volume=187|issue=2|pages=461–474|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03262.x|pmid=20456046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partial small subunit (SSU), the partial large subunit (LSU), and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2) are the regions used for genetic sequencing of AMF. Additionally, there are 'primer sets' that incorporate a combination of these different regions into one target primer for AMF, these include the "Krüger&lt;ref name="Kruger 2009" /&gt; " and the "Redecker&lt;ref name=Redecker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redecker|first=Dirk|title=Specific PCR primers to identify arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within colonized roots|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2000|volume=10|issue=2|pages=73–80|doi=10.1007/s005720000061}}&lt;/ref&gt;" primers. The "Krüger" primer utilizes the partial SSU, the ITS, and the partial LSU regions, while the "Redecker" primer utilizes the partial SSU and the ITS.

Currently, there is no consensus as to which primers or primer sets, being used with varying degrees of success, repeatability and species-level resolution, are best for molecular genetic analysis of AMF. Additionally, the current advances and coming changes in genetic sequencing technology, e.g. [[Sanger sequencing|Sanger]], to 454 [[pyrosequencing]], to [[Illumina dye sequencing|Illumina]] HiSeq/MiSeq, can force researchers to only use certain primers. The large size of the "Krüger" (~1500bp) and "Redecker" (~900bp) primer sets prohibit use with newer sequencing technology (e.g. Illumina MiSeq) as opposed to 454 pyrosequencing that is capable of these long read lengths. Though Roche Diagnostics has announced the discontinuation of the 454 platform for 2016,&lt;ref name=pyro&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Years After Acquisition, Roche Quietly Shutters 454|date=16 October 2013|website=Bio-IT World|url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/BioIT_Article.aspx?id=131053|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is still commonly used in genetic analyses. Perhaps new 'all-inclusive' AM specific primers should be created to support the new technologies for as descriptive a molecular analysis from the "Kruger" primer set using 454 pyrosqeuncing, as shown below. The reverse may also be true, where molecular technologies should be developed with both long read lengths (which would allow for large primer sets) as well as [[deep sequencing|sequencing depth]].

Kohout et al.&lt;ref name=Kohout /&gt; present a study using all of the aforementioned primers/primer sets on identical plant samples using 454 sequencing analysis. Results of their experiment are summarized below.

**"Kruger" primers yielded relatively higher diversity parameters than other comparable primers (LSU, ITS2)
**"Kruger" primers showed significantly higher Shannon diversity measures than did SSU primer
**"Redecker" primers yielded the most different, but maybe most descriptive community composition of all primers tested. This may be explained by the ability of the "Redecker" primers to find less abundant AMF lineages such as the Claroideoglomeraceae or the Paraglomeraceae
**LSU primers had a strong bias towards Glomeraceae, excluding other families
**SSU primers had a bias towards Glomeraceae and underestimated the presence of different families within the Glomeromycota, including the Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae and Paraglomeraceae

MOTU = Molecular operational taxonomic unit, synonymous with OTU or phylotype.

====qPCR and qRT-PCR====
[[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|Real-time PCR]] or quantitative PCR (qPCR), is becoming a well-established method to quickly amplify and simultaneously quantify targeted AM fungal DNA from biological samples (plant roots or soils). Fairly recent developments in qPCR markers allow researchers to explore the relative abundance of AM fungal species within roots in greenhouse experiments as well as in the field to identify local AM fungal communities.

qPCR markers for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi will consist of AM specific primers and fluorescently labeled hydrolysis probes. These AM specific primers (discussed above) can be chosen by the researcher and this decision is typically guided by the question at hand, resources available, and willingness to troubleshoot in the lab.

====Microarray====
[[DNA microarray]] analysis is currently being used in AM fungal research to simultaneously measure the expression of many genes from target species or experimental samples. The most common tool or method is to use functional gene array (FGA) technology, a specialized microarray that contains probes for genes that are functionally important in microbial processes such as carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus cycling. FGAs have the ability to simultaneously examine many functional genes.&lt;ref name="he 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhili|author2=Joy D. VAN NOSTRAND|author3=Ye DENG|author4=Jizhong ZHOU|title=Development and applications of functional gene microarrays in the analysis of the functional diversity, composition, and structure of microbial communities|journal=Front. Environ. Sci. Eng. China|year=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1007/s11783-011-0301-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is typically used for general analysis of functional microbial genes, but when complemented with genetic sequencing, inferences can be made about the connection between fungal community composition and microbial functionality.

====[[Phospholipid-derived fatty acids|PLFA]]/NLFA====
Specific organismal chemical signatures can be used to detect biomass of more cryptic organisms, such as AM fungi or soil bacteria. Lipids, more specifically phospholipids and neutral lipids, contain fatty acids connected to a glycerol backbone. The fatty acid composition of organisms varies, and the proportions of specific fatty acids can be organism specific. For example, in AM fungi the proportion of the fatty acids, 16:1ω5 and 18:1ω7, in the phospholipid portion account for approximately 58% of total fatty acid composition.&lt;ref name="olsson 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsson|first=Pal Axel|title=Signature fatty acids provide tools for determination of the distribution and interactions of mycorrhizal fungi in soil|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|year=1999|volume=29|issue=4|pages=303–310|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.1999.tb00621.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatty acid, 16:1ω5 is the most commonly used acid to characterize AM fungi in soils and can be used as a strong indicator of mycelial biomass in soil sample.&lt;ref name="olsson 1999" /&gt;

Neutral lipid fatty acid analysis of AM fungi is typically looked upon as a method to indicate energy storage, but most importantly, the ratio of NLFA (16:1ω5) to PLFA (16:1ω5) can potentially be used to indicate nutritional status of AM fungi in soils. Energy is mainly stored in AM fungi as neutral lipids in storage structures like spores and vesicles. Because of this NLFA correlates quite well with the number of spores in a given volume of soil.&lt;ref name="olsson 1999" /&gt; The ratio of NLFA concentration to PLFA concentration (active mycelia) can then give the proportion of carbon allocated to storage structures (spores, measured as NLFA).

Problems with lipid fatty acid analyses include the incomplete specificity of fatty acids to AM fungi, the species- or genera-specific variation in fatty acid composition can complicate analysis in systems with multiple AM fungal species (e.g. field soil), the high background levels of certain fatty acid concentration in soils, and that phospholipids are correlated to an organism's membrane area, and the surface to volume ratio can vary widely between organisms such as bacteria and fungi.&lt;ref name=schnurer&gt;{{cite journal|last=J.|first=Schnürer|author2=Clarholm, M.|author3=Rosswall, T|title=Microbial biomass and activity in an agricultural soil with different organic matter contents|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|year=1985|volume=17|issue=5|pages=611–618|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(85)90036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More work must be done to identify the efficacy of this method in field soils with many genera and species of AM fungi to discern the methods ability to discriminate between many varying fatty acid compositions.

===Future research directions with AM fungi===
An exciting prospect for future analysis of AM fungi is the use of stable isotope probes. Stable isotope probing ([[Stable isotope|SIP]]) is a technique that can be used to determine the active metabolic function of individual taxa within a complex system of microbes. This level of specificity, linking microbial function and phylogenetics, has not been achieved previously in microbial ecology. This method can also be used independently of classical culture methods in microbial ecology, allowing for ''in situ'' analysis of functional microbes.

====Stable Isotope Probing (SIP)====
SIP, more explicitly DNA/RNA-based SIP, uses stable-isotope enriched substrates, such as &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, and then analyzes the 'labeled' markers using species specific DNA or RNA markers.&lt;ref name="dumont 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dumont|first=Marc G.|author2=Murrell, Colin J.|title=Stable isotope probing – linking microbial identity to function|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|year=2005|volume=3|issue=6|pages=499–504|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1162|pmid=15886694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of labeled DNA is performed by separating unlabeled and labeled DNA on a cesium chloride gradient formed in an ultra centrifuge.&lt;ref name="schwartz 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Egbert|title=Characterization of growing microorganisms in soil by stable isotope probing with H218O|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2007|volume=73|issue=8|pages=2541–2546|doi=10.1128/AEM.02021-06|pmid=17322324|pmc=1855593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all microbial organisms are capable of importing water into their cells, the use of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O stable isotope probing is a very exciting new method that can shed light on questions microbial ecologists and biologists have struggled with answering for years, in particular, what are the '''active''' microbial organisms in my system? The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, or heavy water method will target all organisms that are actively growing, and induce little influence on growth itself. This would be especially true with most greenhouse experiments with arbuscular mycorrhizas because plants must be watered anyway, and water does not directly select for organisms with specific metabolic pathways,&lt;ref name="schwartz 2007" /&gt; as would happen when using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N.

Little has been done with this method in arbuscular mycorrhizal experiments, but if proven to work in a controlled experiment, and with further refinement of DNA/RNA fungal community analyses techniques, this may be a viable option to very specifically determine the actively growing portion of AM fungal species across growing seasons, with different plant hosts or treatments, and in the face of climate change.

====sRNA and sRNA processing mechanism to understand AM symbiosis====
sRNAs have been reported to take crucial role in the crosstalk between host and symbiont.&lt;ref&gt;Formey D, et al.   2016. Regulation of small RNAs and corresponding targets in Nod factor-induced Phaseolus vulgaris root hair cells. Int J Mol Sci . 176:887.&lt;/ref&gt; sRNAs processing mechanism is thus, important for understanding AM symbiosis. It seems that AM fungi have their unique features to have bacterial type core enzyme as well as the large number of Argonaute proteins in their sRNA processing system (or RNAi system).&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; sRNA and sRNA processing mechanism research is also exciting topic to understand AM fungi symbiosis.

==Phytoremediation==
{{Main|Phytoremediation}}
Disturbance of native plant communities in [[desertification]]-threatened areas is often followed by degradation of physical and biological soil properties, soil structure, nutrient availability, and organic matter. When restoring disturbed land, it is essential to replace not only the above ground vegetation but also biological and physical soil properties.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeffries, P. |author2=Gianinazzi, S. |author3=Perotto, S. |author4=Turnau, K. |author5=Barea, J. |year= 2003|title= The Contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sustainable maintenance of plant health and soil fertility|journal= Biology and Fertility of Soils|volume= 37|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new approach to restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003 /&gt; The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation in the presence of AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003 /&gt;

==Agriculture==
Many modern agronomic practices are disruptive to mycorrhizal symbiosis. There is great potential for low-input agriculture to manage the system in a way that promotes mycorrhizal symbiosis.

Conventional agriculture practices, such as [[tillage]], heavy fertilizers and [[fungicide]]s, poor crop rotations, and selection for plants that survive these conditions, hinder the ability of plants to form symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Most agricultural crops can perform better and are more productive when well-colonized by AM fungi. AM symbiosis increases the phosphorus and micronutrient uptake and growth of their plant host (George ''et al.'' 1992).

Management of AM fungi is especially important for organic and low-input agriculture systems where soil phosphorus is, in general, low, although all [[agroecosystem]]s can benefit by promoting arbuscular mycorrhizae establishment.

Some crops that are poor at seeking out nutrients in the soil are very dependent on AM fungi for phosphorus uptake. For example, [[flax]], which has poor chemotaxic ability, is highly dependent on AM-mediated phosphorus uptake at low and intermediate soil phosphorus concentrations (Thingstrup ''et al.'' 1998).

Proper management of AMF in the agroecosystems can improve the quality of the soil and the productivity of the land. Agricultural practices such as reduced tillage, low phosphorus fertilizer usage, and perennialized cropping systems promote functional mycorrhizal symbiosis.

===Tillage===
[[Tillage]] reduces the inoculation potential of the soil and the efficacy of mycorrhizaes by disrupting the extraradical hyphal network (Miller ''et al.'' 1995, McGonigle &amp; Miller 1999, Mozafar ''et al.'' 2000).

By breaking apart the soil macro structure, the hyphal network is rendered non-infective (Miller ''et al.'' 1995, McGonigle &amp; Miller 1999). The disruption of the hyphal network decreases the absorptive abilities of the mycorrhizae because the surface area spanned by the hyphae is greatly reduced. This, in turn, lowers the phosphorus input to the plants that are connected to the hyphal network (Figure 3, McGonigle &amp; Miller 1999).

In reduced-tillage system, heavy phosphorus fertilizer input may not be required as compared to heavy-tillage systems. This is due to the increase in mycorrhizal network, which allows mycorrhizae to provide the plant with sufficient phosphorus (Miller ''et al.'' 1995).

===Phosphorus fertilizer===
The benefits of AMF are greatest in systems where inputs are low. Heavy usage of phosphorus fertilizer can inhibit mycorrhizal colonization and growth.

As the soil's phosphorus levels available to the plants increases, the amount of phosphorus also increases in the plant's tissues, and carbon drain on the plant by the AM fungi symbiosis become non-beneficial to the plant (Grant 2005).

A decrease in mycorrhizal colonization due to high soil-phosphorus levels can lead to plant deficiencies in other micronutrients that have mycorrhizal-mediated uptake such as copper (Timmer &amp; Leyden 1980).

===Perennialized cropping systems===
Cover crops are grown in the fall, winter, and spring, covering the soil during periods when it would commonly be left without a cover of growing plants.

Mycorrhizal cover crops can be used to improve the mycorrhizal inoculum potential and hyphal network (Kabir and Koide 2000, Boswell ''et al.''1998, Sorensen et al. 2005).

Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell ''et al.'' 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.

===Soil quality===
Restoration of native AM fungi increases the success of ecological restoration project and the rapidity of soil recovery.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003 /&gt; AM fungi enhance  soil aggregate stability is due to the production of extraradical hyphae and a soil protein known as [[glomalin]].

Glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP) have been identified using a [[monoclonal]] [[antibody]] (Mab32B11) raised against crushed AMF spores. It is defined by its extraction conditions and reaction with the antibody Mab32B11.

There is other circumstantial evidence to show that glomalin is of AM fungal origin. When AM fungi are eliminated from soil through incubation of soil without host plants, the concentration of GRSP declines. A similar decline in GRSP has also been observed in incubated soils from forested, afforested, and agricultural land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rillig, M. |author2=Ramsey, P. |author3=Morris, S. |author4=Paul, E.|year= 2003|title= Glomalin, an arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungal soil protein, responds to land-use change|journal= Plant and Soil |volume=253|pages= 293–299|doi= 10.1023/A:1024807820579|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grasslands treated with fungicide.&lt;ref name=rillig2004 /&gt;

Glomalin is hypothesized to improve soil aggregate water stability and decrease [[soil erosion]]. A strong correlation has been found between GRSP and soil aggregate water stability in a wide variety of soils where organic material is the main binding agent, although the mechanism is not known.&lt;ref name=rillig2004 /&gt; The protein glomalin has not yet been isolated and described, and the link between glomalin, GRSP, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is not yet clear.&lt;ref name=rillig2004&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rillig, M.|year= 2004|title= Arbuscular mycorrhizae, glomalin and soil aggregation|journal= Canadian Journal of Soil Science|volume= 84|pages= 355–363|doi=10.4141/S04-003|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asimov's Guide to the Bible''''' is a work by [[Isaac Asimov]] that was first published in two volumes in 1968 and 1969, covering the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] (including [[Deuterocanonical books|the Catholic Old Testament, or deuterocanonical, books]] (See [[Catholic Bible]]) and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Old Testament books, or ''[[Deuterocanonical books#Eastern Orthodoxy|anagignoskomena]]'', along with the [[2 Esdras|Fourth Book of Ezra]]), respectively.  He combined them into a single 1296-page volume in 1981. They included maps by the artist [[Rafael Palacios (artist)|Rafael Palacios]].

Including numerous black-and-white maps, the guide goes through the books of the [[Bible]] in the order of the [[King James Version]] to the extent possible, explaining the historical and geographical setting of each one, and the political and historical influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the main characters. His appendix "Guides to the Old and New Testament" include biblical verse, footnotes, references and subject indices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">'''Astronomy Visualization Metadata (AVM)''' is a standard for tagging digital astronomical images stored in formats such as [[JPEG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]].&lt;ref name="avm"&gt;[http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_metadata.php  Astronomy Visualization Metadata Standard]&lt;/ref&gt; The AVM standard extends the concept of [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) headers to include useful astronomical information about the subject of the image as well as the telescope used to take the image. This ensures that relevant information is transferred with the image when it is shared with others. AVM could be considered analogous to the [[FITS]] headers associated with raw astronomical data files. 

The standard was proposed by the Virtual Astronomy Multimedia Project, part of the [[IAU]] Commission 55 and the [[International Virtual Observatory Alliance]]. It reached version 1.1 on May 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;[http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_1.1_final_draft.pdf  AVM 1.1 Final Candidate]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is currently used to tag images from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], [[Herschel Space Observatory]], [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], [http://www.spacetelescope.org ESA/Hubble] and the [[European Southern Observatory]].&lt;ref name="usage"&gt;[http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12018/ ESO Images in a Universal Context - Astronomical metadata to provide better access to space images]&lt;/ref&gt; Software packages such as PinpointWCS,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~akapadia/pinpointwcs/   PinpointWCS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811054855/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~akapadia/pinpointwcs/ |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FITS Liberator]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/  FITS Liberator]&lt;/ref&gt; and Microsoft [[WorldWide Telescope]] have implemented the standard.

The metadata include information about the creator of the image, the content (including description and subject category), the method of observation (including facility, instrument and spectral information), the World Coordinate System (WCS) position in the sky, and the publisher of the image.

AVM was conceived by Robert Hurt, [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]], and Adrienne Gauthier.

==Metadata Categories==
The Astronomy Visualization Metadata standard defines a taxonomy for astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="taxonomy"&gt;[http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_1.1_final_draft.pdf  AVM 1.1 Final Candidate Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt; The main categories are:

# Planet
# Interplanetary Body
# Star
# Nebula
# Galaxy
# Cosmology
# Sky Phenomenon
# Technology
# People

'''Bloviation''' is a style of empty, pompous political speech popularized by United States President [[Warren G. Harding]], who, himself a master of the technique, described it as "the art of speaking for as long as the occasion warrants, and saying nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The American Past: A Survey of American History |first=Joseph R. | last=Conlin |authorlink = Joseph R.

In terms of its etymology, according to one source, the word is a "compound of blow, in its sense of 'to boast' (also in another typical Americanism, ''blowhard''), with a mock-[[Latin]] ending to give it the self-important stature implicit in its meaning."&lt;ref name="quinion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-blo1.htm|title= Bloviate|authorlink=Michael Quinion|first=Michael |last=Quinion|year=1999|publisher=[[World Wide Words]]|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Septic tank EN.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of a cesspit which is constructed like an underground holding tank]]
A '''cesspit''' (or '''cesspool''' or '''soak pit''' in some contexts), is a term with various meanings: it is used to describe either an underground holding tank (sealed at the bottom) or a soak pit (not sealed at the bottom).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised 2rEdition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=Lüthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbrügg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used for the temporary collection and storage of [[Human feces|feces]], excreta or fecal sludge as part of an on-site [[sanitation]] system and has some similarities with [[septic tank]]s or with soak pits. Traditionally, it was a deep cylindrical chamber dug into the earth, having approximate dimensions of 1 metre diameter and 2–3 metres depth. Their appearance was similar to that of a hand-dug water well.

The pit can be lined with bricks or concrete, covered with a slab and needing to be emptied frequently when it is used like an underground holding tank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other cases (if soil and [[groundwater]] conditions allow), it is not constructed watertight, to allow liquid to leach out (similar to a [[pit latrine]] or to a soak pit).

== Uses ==
[[File:Cess Pool in Slovakia.jpg|thumb|An empty, old cesspool in Slovakia]]
=== Holding tank ===
In the UK a cesspit is a sealed tank for the reception and temporary storage of [[sewage]]; in North America this is simply referred to as a "[[holding tank]]". Because it is sealed, the tank must be emptied frequently &amp;mdash; in many cases as often as weekly. Because of the need for frequent emptying, the cost of maintenance of a cesspit can be very high.

=== Infiltration systems ===
A cesspool was at one time{{when|date=April 2016}} built like a [[dry well]] lined with loose-fitting brick or stone, used for the disposal of sewage via infiltration into the soil. Liquids leaked out through the soil as conditions allowed, while solids decayed and collected as  composted matter in the base of the cesspool. As the solids accumulated, eventually the particulate solids blocked the escape of liquids, causing the cesspool to drain more slowly or to overflow.

A [[biofilm]] forms in the loose soil surrounding a cesspool or [[pit latrine]] which provides some degree of attenuation of the pollutants present, but a very deep cesspool can allow raw sewage to directly enter [[groundwater]] with minimal biological cleansing, leading to [[groundwater pollution]] and undrinkable water supplies.  It is for this reason that deep water wells on the property must be drilled far from the cesspool.

Most residential waste cesspools in use in the US today are rudimentary septic systems, consisting of a concrete-capped pit lined with [[concrete masonry unit]]s (cinder blocks) laid on their sides with perforated [[drain field]] piping ([[weeping tile]]) extending outward below the level of the intake connection. The concrete cover will often have a cleanout pipe extending above ground. Some are constructed with concrete walls on one or more sides.

The waste cesspool is vulnerable to overloading or flooding by heavy rains or snow melt because it is not enclosed and sealed like conventional septic tank systems. It is also vulnerable to the entry of tree roots which can eventually cause the system to fail.

== Regulations ==
Modern environmental regulations either discourage or ban the use of cesspools, and instead connections to municipal [[Sanitary sewer|sewage systems]] or [[septic tank]]s are encouraged or required.

In many countries, planning and development regulations for the protection of the watershed prevent home-owners who live close to rivers and environmentally sensitive areas from installing a [[septic system]], requiring a holding tank instead.

=== United States ===
In some localities in the U.S., existing rural residential waste cesspools are "[[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]]" or allowed to continue operations until they no longer function. Once defunct, they must be disconnected and replaced by modern septic systems. In areas that have a higher than usual [[water table]] or fail a [[percolation test]], an above-ground drain field waste disposal system may be installed instead.

In the case of sale or transfer of residential property that uses an existing waste cesspool system, local laws may differ. Some counties or jurisdictions do not permit the sale of residential property that utilizes a waste cesspool. Other counties or villages may recognize the "grandfather clause" and allow the property sale or transfer.

=== Europe ===
In France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, cesspits are forbidden.

== History ==
{{seealso|History of water supply and sanitation}}
===United States===
The typical American urbanite in the 1870s relied on the rural solution of individual well and outhouse (privy) or cesspools. Baltimore in the 1880s smelled "like a billion [[polecat]]s," according to [[H. L. Mencken]], and a [[Chicago]]an said in his city "the stink is enough to knock you down." Improvement was slow, and large cities of the East and South depended to the end of the century mainly on drainage through open gutters. Pollution of water supplies by [[sewage]] as well as dumping of [[industrial waste]] accounted in large measures for the public health records and staggering mortality rates of the period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Cesspits were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, at a time when urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of waste volume began overloading urban street gutters, where [[chamber pot]]s were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before construction reforms were introduced in the early 19th century, liquid waste would seep away through the ground, leaving solid waste behind in the cesspit. While this made removal of solid waste easier, the seeping liquid waste often contaminated well water sources, creating public health problems. Municipal reforms required that cesspits be built of solid walls of stone and concrete. This kept liquid waste in the cesspit, forcing cesspits to be cleaned more frequently, on average two or three times per year. Liquid cesspit waste would be removed with pumps by cesspit cleaners, and then solid waste, valuable as fertilizer and for manufacturing [[ammonia]], was removed.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9" /&gt; 
 
In 1846, French public hygienist [[Alphone Guérard]] estimated that 100 cesspits were cleaned in Paris every night, by 200-250 total cesspit cleaners in the city, and out of a total of 30,000 cesspits. The replacement of Paris' cesspit system was challenged for decades by officials not on public hygiene grounds, but on economic ones, based on the desire to conserve human waste as fertilizer rather than disposing of it in a modern sewer system. Paris' sewer system began modernizing in the 1880s, with the conversion of storm sewers for public sewage. Some cesspits were still in use in Paris into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=209, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==

=== Accidents ===
In Suffolk County, on Long Island, [[New York (state)|New York]], most households still use cesspools for waste drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shovel Ready|date=2011-01-24|url=http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Straggler/098.html|author=[[John Derbyshire]]|journal=[[National Review]]|volume=63|issue=1|page=55|issn=0028-0038|department=The Straggler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cesspool collapses have occurred in this area, for example on December 8, 2009. Two workers in a decommissioned cesspit were trapped, subsequently leading to a two-hour rescue mission. Since 1998, six cases of cesspools collapsing and sucking in human residents that were standing over them have been reported, injuring a total of seven people, killing one in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,192807,00.html|title=Man, Son, Neighbor Sucked Into N.Y.

These structures weakened over their lifespan leading to increased risk of collapse. Newer cesspools are [[Precast concrete|cast concrete]] which dramatically decrease any risk of collapse. All new construction in areas without waste sewer systems use these new precast cesspools. In addition, cast concrete cesspools are used commonly in commercial construction for storm water collection.

The '''Clarkesdale Bird Sanctuary''' is a [[nature reserve]] focused on protecting and restoring habitat for woodland birds.  It lies in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in south-eastern [[Australia]], near the small town of [[Linton, Victoria|Linton]], 30&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the city of [[Ballarat]].

==History==
The origins of the reserve lie in the 1960s with the efforts of Gordon Clarke, a [[Sheep husbandry|sheep farmer]] in the Linton district who was a keen [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]] and conservationist.  He began removing areas of [[gorse]], an [[invasive species|invasive weed]] in the area, to replant one of his paddocks with a wide range of Australian native (though not necessarily locally indigenous) plants in order to attract and protect birds by providing them with food and shelter.  This initial {{convert|31|ha|adj=on}} block of land, named the "Bird Paddock’’, had been purchased in 1957 and had never been heavily grazed; it was donated by Clarke to [[Bird Observation &amp; Conservation Australia]] (BOCA), then known as the Bird Observers Club, in 1975 when formal reservation of the land took place.&lt;ref name=CBShistory&gt;CBS history.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 a second block of {{convert|13|ha}} of land, named "Grantiella’’ after the generic name of the [[painted honeyeater]], was also donated to the club.  During the 1980s Clarke purchased several additional small blocks of adjacent land which he donated to the Trust for Nature to supplement the existing reserve.  Clarke died in 1996 at the age of 89, having established and endowed the Gordon Clarke Trust Fund to secure the future of the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=CBShistory/&gt;

==Description==
With adjacent [[crown land]] dedicated as a flora and fauna reserve, the sanctuary comprises {{convert|535|ha}}, of which the private land titles are covered by [[conservation easement|conservation covenants]].  Much of the land used to be farmland, including a commercial orchard and a [[Pinus radiata|pine]] plantation as well as pasture for sheep. but is now subject to a program of environmental rehabilitation involving the restoration of indigenous [[woodland]] vegetation. There are some small artificial [[wetland]]s on the reserve, which is managed by a BOCA-appointed Committee of Management and a resident [[park ranger|ranger]].  Much maintenance and planting work is carried out by a volunteer group, the Friends of Clarkesdale.&lt;ref&gt;CBS overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===
The remnant native forest in the area is classified as [[heath]]y dry forest and has been subject to selective logging and other forms of disturbance for many years.  The dominant trees include [[Eucalyptus obliqua|messmate]], [[Eucalyptus rubida|candlebark]], [[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha|red stringybark]], [[Eucalyptus radiata|narrow-leaved peppermint]], [[Eucalyptus dives|broad-leaved peppermint]], [[Eucalyptus aromaphloia|scent–bark]] and [[Eucalyptus ovata|swamp gum]] forming an open overstorey about 20&amp;nbsp;m in height.  The [[understory|understorey]] is a low and sparse [[shrub]] layer containing [[Acacia myrtifolia|myrtle wattle]], [[Acacia mearnsii|black wattle]], [[Pultenaea gunnii|golden bush-pea]], [[Cassinia arcuata|drooping cassinia]], [[Leptospermum myrsinoides|heath tea-tree]], [[Epacris impressa|common heath]], [[Xanthorrhoea minor|small grass-tree]], [[Pteridium esculentum|austral bracken]] and [[Poa sieberiana|grey tussock-grass]].&lt;ref name=afo&gt;Loyn et al. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and achievements==
The original aim of Gordon Clarke was to provide a habitat for birds that was richer in food resources than native forest, and towards that end most of his early plantings were of [[nectar]]-producing shrubs and trees, especially from [[Western Australia]].  He refused to plant the local stringybarks and scent-barks as they did not fit within that vision.  This has resulted in areas of Clarke’s plantings benefiting some species of honeyeaters, such as [[New Holland honeyeater]]s and [[red wattlebird]]s, to the point where they are much more common there than in native forest.  On the other hand, birds such as [[Australasian treecreeper|treecreepers]] have benefited far less and are more common in adjacent native forest.&lt;ref name=afo/&gt;

The current vision for the sanctuary however, as stated in the 1999 management plan, is ‘to optimise, manage and create habitat at Linton as a Sanctuary to increase the diversity and populations of native birds in perpetuity’.&lt;ref name=afo/&gt;  The main aim of the management program is to help reverse the decline of the woodland bird community, which is listed as a [[threatened]] [[community (ecology)|community]] under Victoria’s [[Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988]].  Clarkesdale was a finalist in Category 6 (Protecting Bush, Land and Waterways) of the 2003 [[Banksia Environmental Foundation|Banksia Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;CBS achievements.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryo-Electron Microscopy''' ('''Cryo-EM''') is an [[electron microscopy]] (EM) technique applied on samples cooled to [[cryogenic]] temperatures and embedded in an environment of vitreous water. An aqueous sample solution is applied to a grid-mesh and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. While development of the technique began in the 1970s, recent advances in detector technology and software algorithms have allowed for the determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng Y, Grigorieff N, Penczek PA, Walz T | title = A primer to single-particle cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 3 | pages = 438–449 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25910204 | pmc = 4409659 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has attracted wide attention to the approach as an alternative to [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[NMR spectroscopy]] for macromolecular structure determination without the need for crystallization.

In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to [[Jacques Dubochet]], [[Joachim Frank]], and [[Richard Henderson (biologist)|Richard Henderson]] "for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History of Cryogenic Electron Microscopy ==
In the 1960s, scientist were faced with the issue of structure determination methods using electron microscopy damaging the specimen due to high energy electron beams, so cryogenic electron microscopy was considered to overcome this issue as it was expected that low temperatures would reduce beam damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubochet J, Knapek E | title = Ups and downs in early electron cryo-microscopy | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = e2005550 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29672565 | pmc = 5929567 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | url = https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | doi-broken-date = 2018-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Erwin Knapek and Jacques Dubochet published commenting on beam damage at cryogenic temperatures sharing observations that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thin crystals mounted on carbon film were found to be from 30 to 300 times more beam-resistant at 4 K than at room temperature... Most of our results can be explained by assuming that cryoprotection in the region of 4 K is strongly dependent on the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knapek E, Dubochet J | title = Beam damage to organic material is considerably reduced in cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 141 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–61 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 7441748 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(80)90382-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, these results were not reproducible and amendments were published in the Nature international journal of science just 2 years later informing that the beam resistance was less significant than initially anticipated. The protection gained at 4 K was closer to “tenfold for standard samples of L-valine,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/299386c0.pdf|title=Cryo-transmission microscopy Fading hopes|last=Newmark|first=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=30 September 1982|website=Nature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; than what was previously stated.

In 2017, three scientists, Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a technique that would image biomolecules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cressey D, Callaway E | title = Cryo-electron microscopy wins chemistry Nobel | journal = Nature | volume = 550 | issue = 7675 | pages = 167 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29022937 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2017.22738 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/cryo-electron-microscopy-wins-chemistry-nobel-1.22738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Chemists realized that electron diffraction can be used to readily determine the structures of small molecules that form needle-like crystals, structures that would otherwise need to be determined from X-ray crystallography, by growing larger crystals of the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gruene T, Wennmacher JT, Zaubitzer C, Holstein JJ, Heidler J, Fecteau-Lefebvre A, De Carlo S, Müller E, Goldie KN, Regeni I, Li T, Santiso-Quinones G, Steinfeld G, Handschin S, van Genderen E, van Bokhoven JA, Clever GH, Pantelic R | title = Rapid structure determination of microcrystalline molecular compounds using electron diffraction | journal = Angewandte Chemie | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30325568 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201811318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Picswiss AI-04-02.jpg|thumb|300px|Dispersed settlement or ''Streusiedlung'' in [[Brülisau]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Switzerland]]]]
A '''dispersed settlement''', also known as a '''scattered settlement''', is one of the main types of [[Human settlement|settlement]] patterns used by [[Landscape history|landscape historians]] to classify [[rural]] settlements found in [[England]] and other parts of the world.  Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Muir, ''The NEW Reading the Landscape'', University of Exeter Press&lt;/ref&gt; A dispersed settlement contrasts with a [[nucleated village]].

The French term ''[[bocage]]'' is sometimes used to describe the type of landscape found where dispersed settlements are common.

In addition to Western Europe, dispersed patterns of settlement are found in parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], as among the Gainj, Ankave, and Baining tribes. It is also frequently met with in normadic pastoral societies.

==England==
In England, dispersed settlements are often found in the areas of ancient enclosure outside the central region—for example, [[Essex]], [[Kent]] and the [[West Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts &amp; Rathmell, ''An Atlas of Rural Settlement in England'', English Heritage&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a dispersed settlement given by [[William George Hoskins|W G Hoskins]] is [[Middle Barton]] in [[Steeple Barton]], [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of the English Landscape''. However, he uses the term "fragmented village".&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some parts of England, the pattern of dispersed settlement has remained unchanged for many hundreds of years. Many of the locations found in [[Domesday]] may be dispersed farmsteads.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tvg.bham.ac.uk/laxton/TTSN2002.pdf Keith Challis, Settlement Morphology and Medieval Planning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006080936/http://www.tvg.bham.ac.uk/laxton/TTSN2002.pdf |date=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes possible to identify documentary references to farmsteads in the 18th or 19th centuries with these Domesday entries.&lt;ref&gt;[[William George Hoskins|W G Hoskins]], ''Fieldwork in Local History''&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas of Kent and Essex close to London, development of residential housing during the 20th century has often disguised the dispersed nature of the original settlement.

The farmsteads which make up the dispersed settlement are often surrounded by small irregularly shaped fields.  Traditionally, trees are encouraged to grow at the edges of these fields and in thin strips alongside roads. However, during the 20th century, much of this woodland disappeared, either as a result of disease or modern farming practice. [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]'s description of the view from [[Langdon Hills]], "dark lanes intersected with numberless hedges and woods,"&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Young, ''A Six Weeks' Tour through the Southern Counties of England and Wales''&lt;/ref&gt; is a typical description of the landscape in an area of dispersed settlements.

==Italy==
Anthony Galt has written an extensive study of the dispersed settlement pattern around [[Locorotondo]] in the [[Province of Bari]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Galt, ''Far from the Church Bells'' (CUP, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Curtis, https://www.academia.edu/1933250/Is_there_an_agro-town_model_for_Southern_Italy_Exploring_the_diverse_roots_and_development_of_the_agro-town_structure_through_a_comparative_case_study_in_Apulia&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the settlement pattern developed because of movement from the town to the countryside in the 19th century. [[Emphyteutic lease]]s were used by landowners seeking to increase their income from land that was only marginally attractive for agriculture by encouraging the creation of [[vineyard]]s.

==German-speaking Europe==
{{see|Talschaft}}
Known as ''Streusiedlungen'' (singular ''Streusiedlung''), dispersed settlements are a characteristic of various parts of [[German-speaking Europe]], including in areas of [[Westphalia]], historically the [[Ruhr]] urban area (the dispersed settlements lending themselves to the development of [[urban sprawl]] after industrialisation), the Austro-Bavarian parts of the [[valleys of the Alps|Alps]] ([[Upper Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[South Tyrol]]) as well as [[Alamanni|Alamannic]] parts of the Alps ([[Bernese Oberland]], [[Central Switzerland]], [[Grisons]]).

'''Dominance in ethology''' is an "individual's preferential access to resources over another."&lt;ref&gt;Bland J. (2002) About Gender: Dominance and Male Behaviour http://www.gender.org.uk/about/10ethol/a4_mldom.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Dominance in the context of [[biology]] and [[anthropology]] is the state of having high [[social status]] relative to one or more other individuals, who react [[submission|submissively]] to dominant individuals.  This enables the dominant individual to obtain access to resources such as food or potential mates at the expense of the submissive individual, without active aggression.  The absence or reduction of aggression means unnecessary energy expenditure and the risk of injury are reduced for both.  The opposite of dominance is [[Deference|submissiveness]].

Dominance may be a purely dyadic relationship, i.e. individual A is dominant over individual B, but this has no implications for whether either of these is dominant over a third individual C.  Alternatively, dominance may be hierarchical, with a [[transitive relation]]ship, so that if A dominates B and B dominates C, A always dominates C.  This is called a linear [[dominance hierarchy]].  Some animal societies have [[despotism|despots]], i.e. a single dominant individual with little or no hierarchical structure amongst the rest of the group. Horses use coalitions so that affiliated pairs in a herd have an accumulative dominance to displace a third horse that normally out-ranks both of them on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Blackshaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23945615/Ethology-Book| title=Notes on Some Topics in Applied Animal Behaviour by Judith Blackshaw.|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and maintenance==
Dominance may initially be established by fighting, or simply by threatening displays or interchanges.  Once established, however, dominance is usually maintained by agonistic (competitive) behaviours with aggression considerably reduced or sometimes absent.  In the maintenance of dominance relationships, the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal is critical.  If a dominant animal perceives its status is being threatened, it will likely threaten the sub-dominant individual.  The sub-dominant must then either escalate the intensity of the interaction to challenge the dominant, or defer.  In this way, it is often the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal that maintains the dominance relationship, rather than the dominant.

==Functions==

The ultimate function of a dominance hierarchy is to increase the [[Fitness (biology)|individual]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals involved in its formation.  Fighting to acquire resources such as food and mates is expensive in terms of time, energy and the risk of injury.  By developing a dominance hierarchy, animals determine which individuals will get priority of access to resources, particularly when they are limited; there is a reduction in aggression once a pecking order has been developed.  Therefore, the proximate functions of a pecking order are to reduce the costs of time, energy and risk of injury incurred during resource acquisition and defense.

A dominant animal is one whose [[animal sexual behavior|sexual]], feeding, aggressive and other behavior patterns subsequently occur with relatively little influence of the other group members. Subordinate animals are opposite; their behavior can be relatively easily influenced or inhibited by other group members.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, J., Johnson, M., &amp; Koch, P. (1998). The nature and measurement of interpersonal dominance. (Volume 65 ed., Vol. Issue 4, pp. 308-335). Communication monograph. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rcmm20.&lt;/ref&gt; For many animal societies, an individual's position in the dominance hierarchy corresponds with their opportunities to reproduce,&lt;ref&gt;Researchers from University of Washington publish findings in ethology. (2009, August 11). Science Letter, 1136. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA205165916&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&lt;/ref&gt; however, in other animal societies, the dominance hierarchy may be unrelated to (potential) opportunities to reproduce, e.g. [[naked mole-rat]], [[bees]] and many farm, laboratory, zoo and companion animals. Studies have shown there is a strong association between high testosterone levels and dominance behaviors that help enhance mating success in men.&lt;ref&gt;Slatcher, R., Mehta, P., &amp; Joseph, R. (2011). Testosterone and Self-Reported Dominance Interact to Influence Human Mating Behavior. ''Social Psychological and Personality Science'' 531-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

In hierarchical societies, dominant individuals may exert control over others.  For example, in a herd of feral goats it is a large male that is dominant and maintains discipline and coherence of the flock. He leads the group but shares leadership on a foraging expedition with an old she-goat who will normally outlast a succession of
dominant males.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie, (1980)"&gt;MacKenzie, D. 1980. Goat Husbandry. 4th Edition. Revised and edited by Jean Laing. Faber and Faber, London and Boston. p.66-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, earlier work showed that leadership orders in goats was not related to age or dominance.&lt;ref name="Stewart and Scott, (1947)"&gt;Stewart, J.C. and Scott, J.P. (1947). Lack of correlation between leadership and dominance relationships in a herd of goats. Journal Comparative Physiological Psychology, 40:255-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definite study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"&gt;Squires, V.R. and Daws, G.T. (1975). Leadership and dominance relationships in Merino and Border Leicester sheep. Applied Animal Ethology, 1:263-274&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, dominant individuals will preferentially select higher perches to put themselves in the best position to detect and avoid predators, as well as to display their dominance to con-specifics.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Portugal, S. J. |author2=Sivess, L. | author3=Martin, G. R. |author4= Butler, P. J.|author5= White, C. R.| year=2017| title=Perch height predicts dominance rank in birds| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=456–462 | doi=10.1111/ibi.12447 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested, however, that more commonly, decision-taking about the actions of the group is dissociated from social dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, T.E. (1974).  The concept of social dominance.  ''Behavioral Biology, 11'', 131-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The first published systematic study of dominance in animals was by [[Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe]] who described in his Ph.D. dissertation of 1921, the social behaviour and priority of access to food by [[Chicken|hens]].
&lt;ref name="Schjelderup-Ebbe, (1922)"&gt;Schjelderup-Ebbe, T. 1922. Beitrage zurSozialpsycholgie des Haushuhns. Zeitschrift Psychologie 88: 225-252. Reprinted in Benchmark Papers in Animal Behaviour/3. Ed. M.W.Schein. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the [[colloquial]] term "[[pecking order]]"&lt;ref&gt;Porter G. Perrin (1955) 'Pecking Order' 1927-54 American Speech, 30(4):265-268&lt;/ref&gt; describing the hierarchical system of social organization in chickens, although it is sometimes loosely applied to other animals.

Dominance can be measured by the number of times that individuals defer to one another in social interactions, by the length of time that resources are preferentially accessed, by the number/intensity of threats given or other agonistic (competitive) behaviours.  The measurement of dominance is only applicable within the group it is measured since it is a function of the individual members of the group.

==Context dependency==
[[File:Vache herens.jpg|thumb|right|Eringer cattle competing for dominance.]]

Dominance and its organisation can be highly variable depending on the context or individuals involved.

In [[European badgers]], dominance relationships may vary with time as individuals age, gain or lose social status, or change their reproductive condition.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, S.E., Macdonald, D.W. and Dugdale, H.L. (2009). Context-dependent linear dominance hierarchies in social groups of European badgers, ''Meles meles''. Animal Behaviour, 77: 161-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominance may also vary across space in [[territory (animal)|territorial]] animals as territory owners are often dominant over all others in their own territory but submissive elsewhere, or dependent on the resource. Even with these factors held constant, perfect dominance hierarchies are rarely found in groups of any great size,&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the wild. Dominance hierarchies may be more frequently found in captivity, since hierarchies tend to be induced by focused resources such as limited supplies of food supplied in a fixed place.

Dominance hierarchies in small herds of domestic horses are generally linear hierarchies whereas in large herds the relationships are triangular.&lt;ref name="Houpt et al., (1978)"&gt;Houpt, K.A., Law, K. and Martinisi, V. (1978). Dominance hierarchies in domestic horses. Applied Animal Ethology, 4:273–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. [[Domestic pig]]lets are highly [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle.  The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the [[anterior]] teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this [[Domestic pig#Teat order|teat order]] remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"&gt;Clutton-Brock, J., (1987). A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance–subordination relationships can vary markedly between breeds of the same species. Studies on [[Merino]]s and [[Border Leicester sheep|Border Leicesters]] revealed an almost linear hierarchy in the Merinos but a less rigid structure in the Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation was created.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1342">'''ECSE''' is an abbreviation for ''[[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer science|Computer Sciences]] and [[Systems theory|Systems Engineering]].'' It is a designation used at some [[University|universities]] for the major or department that blends these three fields together.

One reason behind linking the areas of study is to provide students with a broad overview of each of [[software]], [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Systems theory]]. However there are also reasons for not blending departments: Students who major in theoretical computer science, studying such topics as algorithm analysis and software engineering, may not have any use for extensive electrical engineering or systems theory classes.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 

Not every university uses the ECSE designation. Several universities, for example, have separate EE/ECE and CS departments/majors. Other schools use the similar [[Electrical and Computer Engineering|ECE]] (Electrical and Computer Engineering) designation. Additionally, some schools which offer an ECSE degree also offer degrees in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science separately.

[[File:Akademia FSB.jpg|right|200px|FSB Emblem]]
The '''FSB Academy''' (Академия федеральной службы безопасности Российской Федерации, formerly known as The Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the [[KGB]]), is an education and research institution federally chartered to prepare Russian Intelligence personnel for the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] in particular and for the [[Russian Intelligence Community]] in general.

The academy was formed by [[President of Russia|presidential]] decree in August 24, 1992 on the foundation of the Higher School of the [[KGB]], and is located in Michurinsky Prospekt, [[Moscow]], Russia. It consists of the [[Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science]] (Институт криптографии, связи и информатики, ИКСИ) and the [[Institute for Operational Training]] (Институт подготовки оперативного состава, ИПОС&lt;ref&gt;Which its training site is located in Balashikha, in [[Moscow Oblast]], and called Balashikha-1.&lt;/ref&gt;) in various facilities. &lt;ref&gt;[http://newsru.com/russia/21jun2008/fsb.html Бортников напутствовал медалистов Академии ФСБ: вы "будете верны традициям, заложенным нашими ветеранами"], ''Bortnikov, to the medalists of FSB Academy: Shall all of you "will be true to the traditions laid down by our veterans"'', NEWSru.com&lt;/ref&gt;

General-Colonel Victor Ostroukhov has been Head of the Academy since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academy.fsb.ru/i_rukovodstvo.html The Head of FSB Academy - Viktor Ostroukhov], FSB Academy official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Presidium of the [[Cheka|VChK]] (The first security service of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]]) decided in January 25, 1921 to establish a special institute for operational training. The first course began April 26, 1921, and the first Head of the course was M. Romanovsky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 the course was renamed the Higher Courses of the [[State Political Directorate]] (GPU).

In May 1930 [[Moscow]] created higher schools for basic and advanced training of secret agents; in June 4, 1930 the school was known as the Central School of OGPU. July 14, 1934, after the formation of the [[NKVD|People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs]], the former OGPU Central School was renamed the Central School of General Directorate for State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD.

On March 21, 1939 the Central School of GUGB NKVD was reorganized as the Graduate School of the NKVD. By the early 1940s, every third head of the Soviet security organs was a graduate of the course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Patriotic War]], the school trained more than seven thousand security officers who organized the fight against the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Six graduates of the Higher School became [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]]: Dmitry N. Medvedev, V.A. Molodtsov (posthumously), A. M. Rabtsevich, V.A. Lyagin (posthumously), P.A Zhidkov and E.I. Mirkovsky.

On August 30, 1945 the Graduate School of the NKVD was awarded the Red Banner and the Diploma by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. By resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on July 15, 1952, the Graduate School of the MGB (Ministry for State Security) was established as a special institution of higher education with a three-year apprenticeship program for students of law schools.

By Resolution of the Council of Ministers on August 2, 1962 the [[KGB]] Higher School was named after Dzerzhinsky. During the 1960s to 1980s, graduates took part in countering foreign intelligence services and conducting operational and combat activities.

In 1995 the Higher School of the KGB was renamed the FSB Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nomad.su/?a=10-200301250019 Татьянин день, бывший когда-то праздником Московского государственного университета, сегодня с удовольствием отмечают все российские студенты.

The '''''First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC''''' (commonly shortened to '''''First Draft''''') is an [[unfinished creative work|incomplete]] 101-page document written by [[John von Neumann]] and distributed on June 30, 1945 by [[Herman Goldstine]], security officer on the classified [[ENIAC]] project.  It contains the first published description of the logical design of a computer using the stored-program concept, which has controversially come to be known as the [[von Neumann architecture]].

==History==
[[File:Firstdraftofrepo00vonn 0003.jpg|thumb|Title page the ''First Draft'', copy belonging to [[Samuel N. Alexander]], who developed the [[SEAC (computer)| SEAC computer]] based on the report.]]
Von Neumann wrote the report by hand while commuting by train to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] and mailed the handwritten notes back to [[Philadelphia]].  Goldstine had the report typed and duplicated.  While the date on the typed report is June 30, 24 copies of the ''First Draft'' were distributed to persons closely connected with the [[EDVAC]] project five days earlier on June 25.  Interest in the report caused it to be sent all over the world; [[Maurice Vincent Wilkes|Maurice Wilkes]] of [[Cambridge University]] cited his excitement over the report's content as the impetus for his decision to travel to the [[United States]] for the [[Moore School Lectures]] in Summer 1946.

==Synopsis==
Von Neumann describes a detailed design of a "very high speed automatic digital computing system." He divides it into six major subdivisions: a central arithmetic part, CA, a central control part, CC, memory, M, input, I, output, O, and (slow) external memory, R, such as [[punched card]]s, [[paper tape|Teletype tape]], or [[wire recording|magnetic wire]] or [[Magnetic tape|steel tape]].

The CA will perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root. Other mathematical operations, such as logarithms and trigonometric functions are to be done with [[Lookup table|table look up]] and [[interpolation]], possibly [[biquadratic]]. He notes that multiplication and division could be done with logarithm tables, but to keep the tables small enough, interpolation would be needed and this in turn requires multiplication, though perhaps with less precision. 

Numbers are to be represented in [[Binary number|binary notation]]. He estimates 27 binary digits (he did not use the term "[[bit]]," which was coined by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1948) would be sufficient (yielding 8 decimal place accuracy) but rounds up to 30 bit numbers with a sign bit and a bit to distinguish numbers from orders, resulting in 32-bit word he calls a ''minor cycle.'' [[Two’s complement]] arithmetic is to be used, simplifying subtraction. For multiplication and division, he proposes placing the binary point after sign bit, which means all numbers are treated as being between -1 and 1 and therefore computation problems must be scaled accordingly.

===Circuit design===
[[Vacuum tube]]s are to be used rather than [[relay]]s due to tubes’ ability operate in one microsecond vs 10 milliseconds for relays.

Von Neumann suggests (Sec. 5.6) keeping the computer as simple as possible, avoiding any attempt at improving performance by overlapping operations. Arithmetic operations are to be performed one binary digit at a time. He estimates addition of two binary digits as taking one microsecond and that therefore a 30-bit multiplication should take about 30&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; microseconds or about one millisecond, much faster than any computing device available at the time. 

Von Neumann's design is built up using what he call "E elements," which are based on the biological [[neuron]] as model,&lt;ref&gt;Von Neumann credits this model to [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]], [http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/mcp.pdf ''A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity,''] Bull. Math. Biophysics, Vol. 5 (1943), pp. 115–133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Neumann had worked closely with McCulloch and Pitts. See [http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-man-who-tried-to-redeem-the-world-with-logic The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World with Logic], Amanda Gefter, Nautilus, Issue 21, February 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but are digital devices which he says can be constructed using one or two vacuum tubes. In modern terms his simplest E element is a two input ‘"and" gate with one input inverted (the inhibit input). E elements with more inputs have an associated threshold and produce an output when the number of positive input signals meets or exceed the threshold, so long as the (only) inhibit line is not pulsed. He states that E elements with more inputs can be constructed from the simplest version, but suggests they be built directly as vacuum tube circuits as fewer tubes will be needed.

More complex function blocks are to be built from these E elements. He shows how to use these E elements to build circuits for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root, as well as two state memory blocks and control circuits. He does not use [[Boolean logic]] terminology. 

Circuits are to be synchronous with a master system clock derived from a [[vacuum tube oscillator]], possibly [[crystal oscillator|crystal controlled]]. His logic diagrams include an arrowhead symbol to denote a unit time delay, as time delays must be accounted for in a synchronous design. He points out that in one microsecond an electric pulse moves 300 meters so that until much higher clock speeds, e.g. 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cycles per second (100 MHz), wire length would not be an issue.

The need for error detection and correction is mentioned but not elaborated.

===Memory design===
A key design concept enunciated, and later named the [[Von Neumann architecture]], is a uniform memory containing both numbers (data) and orders (instructions).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The device requires a considerable memory. While it appeared that various parts of this memory have to perform functions which differ somewhat in their nature and considerably in their purpose, it is nevertheless tempting to treat the entire memory as one organ, and to have its parts even as interchangeable as possible for the various functions enumerated above." (Sec. 2.5)

"The orders which are received by CC come from M, i.e. from the same place where the numerical material is stored." (Sec. 14.0)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Neumann estimates the amount of memory required based on several classes of mathematical problems, including [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s, [[Sorting algorithm|sorting]] and [[Monte Carlo method|probability experiments]]. Of these, partial differential equations in two dimensions plus time will require the most memory, with three dimensions plus time being beyond what can be done using technology that was then available. He concludes that memory will be the largest subdivision of the system and he proposes 8,192 minor cycles (words) of 32-bits as a design goal, with 2,048 minor cycles still being useful. He estimates a few hundred minor cycles will suffice for storing the program.

He proposes two kinds of fast memory, [[Delay line memory|delay line]] and [[Iconoscope]] tube. Each minor cycle is to be addressed as a unit (word addressing, Sec. 12.8).
Instructions are to be executed sequentially, with a special instruction to switch to a different point in memory (i.e. a jump instruction). 

Binary digits in a delay line memory pass through the line and are fed back to the beginning. Accessing data in a delay line imposes a time penalty while waiting for the desired data to come around again. After analyzing these timing issues, he proposes organizing the delay line memory into 256 delay line "organs" (DLAs) each storing 1024 bits, or 32 minor cycles, called a ''major cycle.'' A memory access first selects the DLA (8 bits) and then the minor cycle within the DLA (5 bits), for a total of 13 address bits. 

For the Iconoscope memory, he recognizes that each scan point on the tube face is a capacitor and that a capacitor can store one bit. Very high precision scanning will be needed and the memory will only last a short time, perhaps as little as a second, and therefore will need to be periodically recopied ([[Memory refresh|refreshed]]).

===Orders (instructions)===
In Sec 14.1 von Neumann proposes the format for orders, which he calls a code. Order types include the basic arithmetic operations, moving minor cycles between CA and M (word load and store in modern terms), an order (''s'') that selects one of two numbers based on the sign of the previous operation, input and output and transferring CC to a memory location elsewhere (a jump). He determines the number of bits needed for the different order types, suggests ''immediate orders'' where the following word is the operand and discusses the desirability of leaving spare bits in the order format to allow for more addressable memory in the future, as well as other unspecified purposes. The possibility of storing more than one order in a minor cycle is discussed, with little enthusiasm for that approach. A table of orders is provided, but no discussion of input and output instructions was included in the First Draft.

==Controversy==
The treatment of the preliminary report as a publication (in the legal sense) was the source of bitter acrimony between factions of the [[EDVAC]] design team for two reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Moye | first = William T. | title = ENIAC: The Army-Sponsored Revolution | publisher = [[United States Army Research Laboratory]] | date = January 1996 | url = http://ftp.arl.army.mil/mike/comphist/96summary/index.html | accessdate = 2012-11-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130305070628/http://ftp.arl.army.mil/mike/comphist/96summary/index.html | archivedate = 2013-03-05 | df =  }} &lt;/ref&gt;  First, publication amounted to a public disclosure that prevented the EDVAC from being patented; second, some on the EDVAC design team contended that the stored-program concept had evolved out of meetings at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] predating von Neumann's activity as a consultant there, and that much of the work represented in the ''First Draft'' was no more than a translation of the discussed concepts into the language of formal [[logic]] in which von Neumann was fluent. Hence, failure of von Neumann and Goldstine to list others as authors on the ''First Draft'' led credit to be attributed to von Neumann alone.  (See [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]] and [[Stigler's law]].)

{{Frankfurt School}}
The '''Frankfurt School''' ({{lang-de|Frankfurter Schule}}) is a school of [[social theory]] and philosophy associated in part with the [[Institute for Social Research]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. Founded during the [[interwar period]], the School consisted of [[Western Marxist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ "Critical Theory" on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; dissidents uncomfortable with existing [[capitalist]], [[fascist]] or [[communist]] systems. Many of these theorists believed that traditional theory could not adequately explain the turbulent and unexpected development of capitalist societies in the 20th century. Critical of both capitalism and [[Marxism–Leninism|Soviet socialism]], their writings pointed to the possibility of an alternative path to [[social development]].&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980). ''Introduction to critical theory: Horkheimer to Habermas''. University of California Press, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists were sometimes only loosely affiliated, and some authors point out that the "Frankfurt Circle" was neither a philosophical school nor a political group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following Marx, they were concerned with the conditions that allow for [[social change]] and the establishment of rational institutions.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980, p. 15"&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Their emphasis on the [[Critical theory#In social theory|"critical" component of theory]] was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], [[materialism]] and [[determinism]] by returning to Kant's [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in [[German idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[Dialectic#Modern philosophy|dialectic]] and [[Contradiction#Dialectical materialism|contradiction]] as inherent properties of human reality.

Since the 1960s, Frankfurt School's critical theory has increasingly been guided by [[Jürgen Habermas|Jürgen Habermas's]] work on [[Communicative rationality|communicative reason]], linguistic [[intersubjectivity]] and what Habermas calls "the philosophical discourse of [[Modernity#In sociological thought|modernity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theorists such as [[Raymond Geuss]] and [[Nikolas Kompridis]] have voiced opposition to Habermas, holding that he has undermined the aspirations for social change that originally gave purpose to critical theory's various projects—for example the problem of what [[reason]] should mean, the analysis and enlargement of "conditions of possibility" for social [[emancipation]] and the critique of modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006). ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Institute for Social Research===
{{Main|Institute for Social Research}}
{{Marxism|Variants}}
The term "Frankfurt School" arose informally to describe the thinkers affiliated or merely associated with the Frankfurt [[Institute for Social Research]]; it is not the title of any specific position or institution ''per se'', and few of these theorists used the term themselves. The Institute for Social Research (''Institut für Sozialforschung'') was founded in 1923 by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist legal and political professor at the [[University of Vienna]],&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;Corradetti, Claudio (2011). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/ "The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory"], Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Originally published: 21 October 2011).
&lt;/ref&gt; as an adjunct of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]; it was the first Marxist-oriented research center affiliated with a major German university.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; However, the school can trace its earliest roots back to [[Felix Weil]], who used money from his father's grain business to finance the ''Institut''.

Weil (1898–1975), a young Marxist, had written his [[Thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] (published by [[Karl Korsch]]) on the practical problems of implementing socialism. With the hope of bringing different trends of Marxism together, Weil organized a week-long symposium (the ''Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche'') in 1922 in [[Ilmenau]], [[Thuringia]], a meeting attended by [[György Lukács|Georg Lukács]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Karl August Wittfogel]], [[Friedrich Pollock]] and others. The event was so successful that Weil set about erecting a building and funding salaries for a permanent institute. Weil negotiated with the Ministry of Education that the Director of the Institute would be a full professor from the state system, so that the ''Institut'' would have the status of a University institution.&lt;ref name="Marxist Internet Archive"&gt;"The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory", [http://www.marxists.org/subject/frankfurt-school/index.htm Marxist Internet Archive] (Retrieved 12 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Lukács and Karl Korsch both attended the ''Arbeitswoche'', which had included a study of Korsch's ''Marxism and Philosophy,'' but both were too committed to political activity and party membership to join the ''Institut'', though Korsch participated in publishing ventures for a number of years. Lukács 1923 work ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' was probably a major inspiration for the work of the Frankfurt School; his later repudiation of the work, required by the Soviet Union, demonstrated the value of independence from the [[Communist Party]] for genuine theoretical work.&lt;ref name="Marxist Internet Archive"/&gt;

The philosophical tradition now referred to as the "Frankfurt School" is perhaps particularly associated with [[Max Horkheimer]] (philosopher, sociologist and social psychologist), who took over as the institute's director in 1930 and recruited many of the school's most talented theorists, including [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (philosopher, sociologist, musicologist), [[Erich Fromm]] (psychoanalyst), and [[Herbert Marcuse]] (philosopher).&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

===German prewar context===
The political turmoil of [[Weimar Republic|Germany's troubled interwar years]] greatly affected the School's development. Its thinkers were particularly influenced by the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|failure of the communist revolution in Western Europe]] (precisely where Marx had predicted that a communist revolution would take place) and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in such an economically and technologically advanced nation as Germany.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} This led many of them to take up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify contemporary social conditions that Marx himself had never seen. Another key influence also came from the publication in the 1930s of Marx's ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'', which showed the continuity with [[Hegelianism]] that underlay Marx's thought.

As the growing influence of National Socialism became ever more threatening, its founders decided to prepare to move the Institute out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by Helmut Dubiel in ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933, the Institute left Germany for [[Geneva]], before moving to [[New York City]] in 1935, where it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]]. Its journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' was accordingly renamed ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science''. It was at this moment that much of its important work began to emerge, having gained a favorable reception within American and English [[academia]]. Horkheimer, Adorno and Pollock eventually resettled in [[West Germany]] in the early 1950s, although Marcuse, Lowenthal, Kirchheimer and others chose to remain in the United States. It was only in 1953 that the Institute was formally re-established in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorists===
{{See also|List of critical theorists}}
Which "theorists" to include in what is now called the "Frankfurt School" may vary among different scholars. Indeed, the title of "school" can often be misleading, as the Institute's members did not always form a series of tightly woven, complementary projects. Some scholars have therefore limited their view of the Frankfurt School to Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Lowenthal and Pollock.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980, p. 15"/&gt; However, most pre-war theorists can be considered as having shared a very similar paradigm. Most of the members of the Institute for Social Research were of [[Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Finlayson, James Gordon (2005), ''Habermas: A Very Short Introduction'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was initially part of the School's inner circle, [[Jürgen Habermas]] is generally considered as the first to have diverged from Horkheimer's research program, thus giving rise to a new generation of [[critical theory|critical theorists]].

Early members of the Frankfurt School were:

*[[Max Horkheimer]]
*[[Theodor W. Adorno]]
*[[Herbert Marcuse]]
*[[Friedrich Pollock]]
*[[Erich Fromm]]
*[[Otto Kirchheimer]]
*[[Leo Löwenthal]]
*[[Franz Leopold Neumann]]
*[[Henryk Grossman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Rick ''Henryk Grossman and the Recovery of Marxism'' Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

People who were associated with the Institute or its theorists include:

*[[Siegfried Kracauer]]
*[[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]]
*[[Walter Benjamin]]

Later theorists with roots in Frankfurt School critical theory include:

*[[Jürgen Habermas]]
*[[Claus Offe]]
*[[Axel Honneth]]
*[[Oskar Negt]]
*[[Alfred Schmidt (philosopher)|Alfred Schmidt]]
*[[Albrecht Wellmer]]

==Theoretical work==
===Critical theory and the critique of ideology===
The Frankfurt School's work cannot be addressed without understanding the objectives of critical theory. Initially outlined by [[Max Horkheimer]] in his ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937), critical theory may be defined as a self-conscious [[social]] critique that is aimed at change and emancipation through enlightenment and that does not cling dogmatically to its own doctrinal assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Geuss, Raymond (1981). ''The idea of a critical theory: Habermas and the Frankfurt school''. Cambridge University Press, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Adrian 2000 p. 208-220"&gt;Carr, Adrian (2000). "Critical theory and the management of change in organizations". In: ''Journal of Organizational Change Management'', 13, 3, p. 208–220&lt;/ref&gt; The original aim of critical theory was to analyze the true significance of "the ruling understandings" generated in bourgeois society, in order to show how they {{em|misrepresented}} actual human interaction in the real world, and in so doing functioned to {{em|justify}} or {{em|legitimize}} the domination of people by capitalism. A certain sort of story (a narrative) was provided to explain what was happening in society, but the story concealed as much as it revealed. The Frankfurt theorists generally assumed that their task was mainly to interpret the areas of society Marx had not dealt with, especially in the [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of society.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jay, ''The Dialectical Imagination. A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''. London: Heinemann, 1973, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer opposed it to ''traditional theory'', which refers to theory in the positivistic, [[scientism|scientistic]], or purely observational mode—that is, which derives generalizations or "[[scientific law|laws]]" about different aspects of the world. Drawing upon Max Weber, Horkheimer argued that the [[social science]]s differ from the [[natural science]]s inasmuch as generalizations cannot be easily made from so-called experiences because the understanding of a "social" experience itself is always fashioned by ideas that are in the researchers themselves. What the researcher does not realize is that s/he is caught in a historical context in which ideologies shape the thinking; thus, theory would conform to the ideas in the mind of the researcher rather than to the experience itself:

{{quote|The facts which our senses present to us are socially performed in two ways: through the historical character of the object perceived and through the historical character of the perceiving organ. Both are not simply natural; they are shaped by human activity, and yet the individual perceives himself as receptive and passive in the act of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976). "Traditional and critical theory". In: Connerton, P (Eds), ''Critical Sociology: Selected Readings'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Horkheimer, approaches to understanding in the social sciences cannot simply imitate those in the natural sciences. Although various theoretical approaches would come close to breaking out of the ideological constraints that restricted them, such as positivism, [[pragmatism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], Horkheimer argued that they failed because all were subject to a "logico-mathematical" prejudice that separates theoretical activity from actual life (meaning that all these schools sought to find a logic that always remains true, independently of and without consideration for ongoing human activities). According to Horkheimer, the appropriate response to this dilemma is the development of a critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, D. (1996). "Critical theory and philosophy". In: Rasmussen, D. (Eds), ''The Handbook of Critical Theory'', Blackwell, Oxford, p .18&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, Horkheimer argued, is [[epistemology|epistemological]]: we should reconsider not merely the scientist but the knowing individual in general.&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[orthodox Marxism]], which merely applies a ready-made "template" to both critique and action, critical theory seeks to be self-critical and rejects any pretensions to [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. Critical theory defends the primacy of neither matter (materialism) nor consciousness ([[idealism]]), and argues that both epistemologies distort reality to the benefit, eventually, of some small group. What critical theory attempts to do is to place itself outside of philosophical strictures and the confines of existing structures. However, as a way of thinking and "recovering" humanity's self-knowledge, critical theory often looks to Marxism for its methods and tools.&lt;ref name="Carr, Adrian 2000 p. 208-220"/&gt;

Horkheimer maintained that critical theory should be directed at the totality of society in its [[Zeitgeist|historical specificity]] (i.e., how it came to be configured at a specific point in time), just as it should improve understanding of society by integrating all the major social sciences, including geography, economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology. While critical theory must at all times be self-critical, Horkheimer insisted that a theory is critical only if it is explanatory. Critical theory must, therefore, combine practical and normative thinking to "explain what is wrong with current social reality, identify actors to change it, and provide clear norms for criticism and practical goals for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Bohman, J (1996). "Critical theory and democracy". In: Rasmussen, D. (Eds), ''The Handbook of Critical Theory'', Blackwell, Oxford, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas traditional theory can only mirror and explain reality as it presently is, critical theory's purpose is to {{em|change}} it; in Horkheimer's words the goal of critical theory is "the emancipation of human beings from the circumstances that enslave them".&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976), p. 219 (see also p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt School theorists explicitly linked up with the critical philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], in which the term ''[[critique]]'' meant philosophical reflection on the limits of claims made for certain kinds of knowledge and direct connection between such critique and the emphasis on [[Autonomy#Philosophy|moral autonomy]] as opposed to traditionally deterministic and static theories of human action. In an intellectual context defined by dogmatic positivism and scientism on the one hand and dogmatic "[[scientific socialism]]" on the other, critical theorists intended to rehabilitate Marx's ideas through a philosophically critical approach.

Whereas both [[Marxist–Leninist]] and [[social democratic]] orthodox thinkers viewed Marxism as a new kind of positive science, Frankfurt School theorists such as Horkheimer instead based their work on the epistemological base of Marx's work, which presented itself as critique, as in Marx's ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. They thus emphasized that Marx attempted to create a new kind of critical analysis oriented toward the unity of theory and [[praxis (process)|revolutionary practice]] rather than a new kind of positive science. Critique, in this Marxian sense, means taking the ideology of a society (for example, the belief in [[individual freedom]] or [[free market]] capitalism) and critiquing it by comparing it with a posited social reality of that very society (for example, [[social inequality]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]). Frankfurt School theorists grounded this on the dialectical methodology established by Hegel and Marx.

===Dialectical method===
The Institute also attempted to reformulate dialectics as a concrete method. The use of such a dialectical method can be traced back to the philosophy of Hegel, who conceived dialectic as the tendency of a notion to pass over into its own negation as the result of conflict between its inherent contradictory aspects.&lt;ref name="dialectic1"&gt;dialectic. (2009). In [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved 19 December 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/161174/dialectic http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/161174/dialectic]&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to previous modes of thought, which viewed things in abstraction, each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties, Hegelian dialectic has the ability to consider ideas according to their movement and change in time, as well as according to their interrelations and interactions.&lt;ref name="dialectic1" /&gt;

History, according to Hegel, proceeds and evolves in a dialectical manner: the present embodies the rational [[Aufheben|sublation]], or "synthesis", of past contradictions. History may thus be seen as an intelligible process (which Hegel referred to as {{lang|de|[[Geist#The Weltgeist|Weltgeist]]}}), which is the [[Idea of Progress|moving towards a specific condition]]—the rational realization of human freedom.&lt;ref name="HegelStanford"&gt;Little, D. (2007). "Philosophy of History", The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (Sun 18 February 2007), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Problem of future contingents|considerations about the future]] were of no interest to Hegel,&lt;ref&gt;"When philosophy paints its grey on grey, then has a shape of life grown old. (...) The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk" – Hegel, G. W. F. (1821). {{lang|de|[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts]]}}, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hegel's philosophy, and in particular his political philosophy, purports to be the rational formulation of a definite historical period, and Hegel refuses to look further ahead into the future." – Peĺczynski, Z. A. (1971). ''Hegel's political philosophy—problems and perspectives: a collection of new essays'', CUP Archive. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JEI4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 Google Print, p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt; for whom philosophy cannot be [[Normative#Philosophy|prescriptive]] because it understands only in hindsight. The study of history is thus limited to the description of past and present realities.&lt;ref name="HegelStanford" /&gt; Hence for Hegel and his [[Right Hegelians|successors]], dialectics inevitably lead to the approval of the [[status quo]]—indeed, Hegel's philosophy served as a justification for [[Christian theology]] and the [[Prussia|Prussian state]].

This was fiercely criticized by Marx and the [[Young Hegelians]], who argued that Hegel had gone too far in defending his abstract conception of "absolute Reason" and had failed to notice the "real"—i.e. {{em|undesirable}} and {{em|irrational}}—life conditions of the [[Proletariat|working class]]. By turning Hegel's idealist dialectics upside-down, Marx advanced his own theory of [[dialectical materialism]], arguing that "it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx (1859), Preface to {{lang|de|[[Das Kapital|Das Kapital: Kritik der politischen Ökonomie]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's theory follows a [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] and [[Marxist geography|space]],&lt;ref&gt;Soja, E. (1989). Postmodern Geographies. London: Verso. (esp. pp. 76–93)&lt;/ref&gt; where the development of the productive forces is seen as the primary motive force for historical change, and according to which the social and material [[Contradictions#Dialectical materialism|contradictions]] inherent to capitalism inevitably lead to its negation—thereby replacing capitalism with a new rational form of society: [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |editor=Jonathan Wolff, Ph.D. |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Karl Marx |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/ |access-date=17 September 2009 |edition= |date= |year= |publisher=Stanford |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx thus extensively relied on a form of dialectical analysis. This method—to know the truth by uncovering the contradictions in presently predominant ideas and, by extension, in the social relations to which they are linked—exposes the underlying struggle between opposing forces. For Marx, it is only by becoming aware of the dialectic (i.e., [[class consciousness]]) of such opposing forces, in a struggle for power, that individuals can liberate themselves and change the existing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Robert M. "Human Communication in the Critical Theory Tradition", University of Calgary, [http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/critical.htm Online Publication]&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly came to realize that a dialectical method could only be adopted {{em|if it could be applied to itself}}—that is to say, if they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that would enable them to correct previous false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the [[historicism]] and materialism of [[orthodox Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, J. M. (1994) ''The Frankfurt School: critical assessments'', Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 208 (See also pp. 199–202)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the material tensions and [[class struggle]]s of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same [[Communist revolution|revolutionary potential]] within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations and predictions were either incomplete or incorrect.

Contrary to orthodox Marxist [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], which solely seeks to implement an unchangeable and narrow idea of "communism" into practice, critical theorists held that praxis and theory, following the dialectical method, should be interdependent and should mutually influence each other. When Marx famously stated in his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it", his real idea was that philosophy's only validity was in how it informed action. Frankfurt School theorists would correct this by arguing that when action fails, then the theory guiding it must be reviewed. In short, socialist philosophical thought must be given the ability to criticize itself and "overcome" its own errors. While theory must inform praxis, praxis must also have a chance to inform theory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

|}

Responding to the intensification of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[irrationality]] in an [[advanced capitalist society]], critical theory is a comprehensive, ideology-critical, historically self-reflective body of theory aiming simultaneously to explain domination and point to the possibilities of bringing about a rational, humane, and free society. Frankfurt School critical theorists developed numerous theories of the economic, political, cultural, and psychological domination structures of advanced industrial civilization.

The Institute made major contributions in two areas relating to the possibility of human [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s to be rational, i.e., individuals who could act rationally to take charge of their own [[society]] and their own [[history]]. The first consisted of social phenomena previously considered in Marxism as part of the "[[base and superstructure|superstructure]]" or as [[ideology]]: [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[family]] and [[authority]] structures (one of the earliest works published bore the title ''Studies of Authority and the Family''), and the realm of [[aesthetics]] and mass culture. Studies saw a common concern here in the ability of capitalism to destroy the preconditions of critical, revolutionary [[political consciousness]]. This meant arriving at a sophisticated awareness of the depth dimension in which social [[oppression]] sustains itself. It also meant the beginning of critical theory's recognition of ideology as part of the foundations of social structure.

===Critique of Western civilization===
====''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' and ''Minima Moralia''====
The second phase of Frankfurt School critical theory centres principally on two works: [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944) and Adorno's ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' (1951). The authors wrote both works during the Institute's exile in America. While retaining much of a Marxian analysis, in these works critical theory shifted its emphasis from the critique of capitalism to a critique of [[Western civilization]] as a whole, as seen in ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', which uses the  ''[[Odyssey]]'' as a paradigm for their analysis of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] consciousness. In these works, Horkheimer and Adorno present many themes that have come to dominate the [[social thought]] of recent years; for instance, their exposition of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|domination of nature]] as a central characteristic of [[instrumental rationality]] in Western civilization was made long before [[ecology]] and [[environmentalism]] had become popular concerns.

The analysis of reason now goes one stage further: The [[rationality]] of Western civilization appears as a fusion of domination and technological rationality, bringing all of external and internal nature under the power of the human subject. In the process, however, the subject itself gets swallowed up and no social force analogous to the [[proletariat]] can be identified that enables the subject to emancipate itself. Hence the subtitle of ''Minima Moralia'': "Reflections from Damaged Life". In Adorno's words,

{{quote|For since the overwhelming objectivity of historical movement in its present phase consists so far only in the dissolution of the subject, without yet giving rise to a new one, individual experience necessarily bases itself on the old subject, now historically condemned, which is still for-itself, but no longer in-itself. The subject still feels sure of its autonomy, but the nullity demonstrated to subjects by the concentration camp is already overtaking the form of subjectivity itself.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Minima Moralia: Reflections on a Damaged Life,'' Verso (2006), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consequently, at a time when it appears that reality itself has become the basis for ideology, the greatest contribution that critical theory can make is to explore the dialectical contradictions of individual subjective experience on the one hand, and to preserve the truth of theory on the other. Even dialectical progress is put into doubt: "its truth or untruth is not inherent in the method itself, but in its intention in the historical process." This intention must be oriented toward integral freedom and happiness: "The only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves from the standpoint of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]." Adorno goes on to distance himself from the "optimism" of orthodox Marxism: "beside the demand thus placed on thought, the question of the reality or unreality of redemption [i.e. human emancipation] itself hardly matters."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (2006), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a sociological point of view, both Horkheimer's and Adorno's works contain a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence that gave rise to the "pessimism" of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. W., with Max Horkheimer. (2002). ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Trans. Edmund Jephcott. Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; This ambivalence was rooted, of course, in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, in particular, the rise of [[National Socialism]], [[state capitalism]], and [[mass culture]] as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology.&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer's circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions" – Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''. Trans. Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 116.{{pb}}See also: Dubiel, Helmut. (1985). ''Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory''. Trans. Benjamin Gregg. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the "[[relations of production]]" and "material [[productive forces]] of society"—a tension that, according to traditional [[Marxist theory]], constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The previously "free" market (as an "unconscious" mechanism for the distribution of goods) and "irrevocable" [[private property]] of Marx's epoch have gradually been replaced by the [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and socialized ownership of the [[means of production]] in contemporary Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;"[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism." – Horkheimer, Max and Theodor Adorno. (2002). ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialectic through which Marx predicted the emancipation of modern society is thus suppressed, effectively being subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination.

Of this second "phase" of the Frankfurt School, philosopher and critical theorist Nikolas Kompridis writes that:

{{quote|According to the now canonical view of its history, Frankfurt School critical theory began in the 1930s as a fairly confident interdisciplinary and materialist research program, the general aim of which was to connect normative social criticism to the emancipatory potential latent in concrete historical processes. Only a decade or so later, however, having revisited the premises of their philosophy of history, Horkheimer and Adorno's ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' steered the whole enterprise, provocatively and self-consciously, into a skeptical cul-de-sac. As a result they got stuck in the irresolvable dilemmas of the "philosophy of the subject," and the original program was shrunk to a negativistic practice of critique that eschewed the very normative ideals on which it implicitly depended.&lt;ref name="Kompridis, Nikolas. 2006, p. 256"&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kompridis argues that this "sceptical cul-de-sac" was arrived at with "a lot of help from the once unspeakable and unprecedented barbarity of European fascism," and could not be gotten out of without "some well-marked [exit or] {{lang|de|Ausgang}}, showing the way out of the ever-recurring nightmare in which Enlightenment hopes and Holocaust horrors are fatally entangled." However, this {{lang|de|Ausgang}}, according to Kompridis, would not come until later – purportedly in the form of Jürgen Habermas's work on the intersubjective bases of [[communicative rationality]].&lt;ref name="Kompridis, Nikolas. 2006, p. 256"/&gt;

====Philosophy of music====
Adorno, a trained classical pianist, wrote ''The Philosophy of Modern Music'' (1949), in which he, in essence, polemicizes against [[popular music]]―because it has become part of the culture industry of [[Advanced capitalism|advanced capitalist society]]{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and the [[false consciousness]] that contributes to social domination. He argued that radical art and music may preserve the truth by capturing the reality of human suffering. Hence:

{{quote|What radical music perceives is the untransfigured suffering of man [...] The seismographic registration of traumatic shock becomes, at the same time, the technical structural law of music. It forbids continuity and development. Musical language is polarized according to its extreme; towards gestures of shock resembling bodily convulsions on the one hand, and on the other towards a crystalline standstill of a human being whom anxiety causes to freeze in her tracks [...] Modern music sees absolute oblivion as its goal. It is the surviving message of despair from the shipwrecked.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (2003) ''The Philosophy of Modern Music''. Translated into English by Anne G. Mitchell and Wesley V. Blomster. Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view of [[modern art]] as producing truth only through the negation of traditional aesthetic form and traditional norms of beauty because they have become ideological is characteristic of Adorno and of the Frankfurt School generally. It has been criticized by those who do not share its conception of modern society as a false totality that renders obsolete traditional conceptions and images of beauty and harmony.

In particular, Adorno despised [[jazz]] and [[popular music]], viewing it as part of the [[culture industry]], that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it "aesthetically pleasing" and "agreeable". The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] saw Adorno as producing 'reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a 'fetishized' commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine.'&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. ''The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope'' 2010, p. 89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical theory and domination===
====Negative dialectics====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
With the growth of advanced industrial society during the [[Cold War]] era, critical theorists recognized that the path of capitalism and history had changed decisively, that the modes of oppression operated differently, and that the industrial [[working class]] no longer remained the determinate negation of capitalism. This led to the attempt to root the dialectic in an absolute method of negativity, as in Marcuse's ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964) and Adorno's ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966). During this period the Institute of Social Research resettled in [[Frankfurt]] (although many of its associates remained in the United States) with the task not merely of continuing its research but of becoming a leading force in the sociological education and [[democratization]] of West Germany. This led to a certain systematization of the Institute's entire accumulation of empirical research and theoretical analysis.

During this period, Frankfurt School critical theory particularly influenced some segments of the [[left-wing politics|left wing]] and leftist thought, particularly the [[New Left]]. Herbert Marcuse has occasionally been described as the theorist or intellectual progenitor of the New Left. Their critique of technology, totality, teleology and (occasionally) civilization is an influence on [[anarcho-primitivism]]. Their work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on [[popular culture]] and scholarly [[popular culture studies]].

More importantly, however, the Frankfurt School attempted to define the fate of reason in the new historical period. While Marcuse did so through analysis of structural changes in the [[labour (economics)|labor]] process under capitalism and inherent features of the [[methodology]] of [[science]], Horkheimer and Adorno concentrated on a re-examination of the foundation of critical theory. This effort appears in systematized form in Adorno's ''Negative Dialectics'', which tries to redefine dialectics for an era in which "philosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment to realize it was missed". Negative dialectics expresses the idea of critical thought so conceived that the apparatus of domination cannot co-opt it.

Its central notion, long a focal one for Horkheimer and Adorno, suggests that the [[original sin]] of thought lies in its attempt to eliminate all that is other than thought, the attempt by the subject to devour the object, the striving for [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]. This [[reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] makes thought the accomplice of domination. ''Negative Dialectics'' rescues the "preponderance of the object", not through a naïve [[Epistemological realism|epistemological]] or [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realism]] but through a thought based on [[differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]], [[paradox]], and ruse: a "logic of disintegration". Adorno thoroughly criticizes [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s fundamental [[ontology]], which he thinks reintroduces idealistic and identity-based concepts under the guise of having overcome the philosophical tradition.

''Negative dialectics'' comprises a monument to the end of the tradition of the individual subject as the locus of criticism. Without a revolutionary working class, the Frankfurt School had no one to rely on but the individual subject. But, as the [[liberalism|liberal]] capitalist social basis of the autonomous individual receded into the past, the dialectic based on it became more and more abstract.

====Habermas and communicative rationality====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
{{Main|Jürgen Habermas}}
Habermas's work takes the Frankfurt School's abiding interests in rationality, the human subject, [[democratic socialism]], and the dialectical method and overcomes a set of contradictions that always weakened critical theory: the contradictions between the materialist and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] methods, between Marxian social theory and the [[individualism|individualist]] assumptions of critical [[rationalism]] between technical and social rationalization, and between cultural and psychological phenomena on the one hand and the [[economics|economic]] structure of society on the other.

The Frankfurt School avoided taking a stand on the precise relationship between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among their readers. Habermas's epistemology synthesizes these two traditions by showing that phenomenological and transcendental analysis can be subsumed under a materialist theory of [[social evolution]], while the materialist theory makes sense only as part of a quasi-transcendental theory of emancipatory knowledge that is the self-reflection of cultural evolution. The simultaneously empirical and transcendental nature of emancipatory knowledge becomes the foundation stone of critical theory.

By locating the conditions of rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in [[Social interaction|interaction]]. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted [[communication]]. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative [[ethics]] as the highest stage in the internal logic of the evolution of ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new [[politics|political]] practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.

==Criticism of Frankfurt School theorists==
===Horkheimer and Adorno's pessimism===
An early criticism, originating from the left, argues that Frankfurt School critical theory is nothing more than a form of "bourgeois idealism" devoid of any actual relation to political practice, and is hence totally isolated from the reality of any ongoing revolutionary movement. This criticism was captured in [[Georg Lukács]]'s phrase "Grand Hotel Abyss" as a syndrome he imputed to the members of the Frankfurt School:

{{quote|A considerable part of the leading German intelligentsia, including Adorno, have taken up residence in the ''Grand Hotel Abyss'' which I described in connection with my critique of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as "a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered."&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, Georg. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel''. MIT Press, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] equally believed that the school did not live up to Marx's promise of a better future:

{{quote|Marx's own condemnation of our society makes sense. For Marx's theory contains the promise of a better future. But the theory becomes vacuous and irresponsible if this promise is withdrawn, as it is by Adorno and Horkheimer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Karl R. Popper]]: ''Addendum 1974: The Frankfurt School.'' in: ''The Myth of the Framework.'' London New York 1994, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Habermas's solutions: critical theory "between past and future"===
In 2006, Nikolas Kompridis (who undertook a post-doctoral fellowship with Jürgen Habermas) published new criticisms of Habermas's approach to critical theory, calling for a dramatic break with the proceduralist ethics of communicative rationality. He writes:

{{quote|For all its theoretical ingenuity and practical implications, Habermas's reformulation of critical theory is beset by persistent problems of its own... In my view, the depth of these problems indicate just how wrong was Habermas's expectation that the paradigm change to linguistic intersubjectivity would render "objectless" the dilemmas of the philosophy of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1987), ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'', MIT Press, 1987. p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas accused Hegel of creating a conception of reason so "overwhelming" that it solved ''too well'' the problem of modernity's [need for] self-reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1987), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; It seems, however, that Habermas has repeated rather than avoided Hegel's mistake, creating a theoretical paradigm so comprehensive that in one stroke it ''also'' solves too well the dilemmas of the philosophy of the subject ''and'' the problem of modernity's self-reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, he writes that:

{{quote|The change of paradigm to linguistic intersubjectivity has been accompanied by a dramatic change in critical theory's self-understanding. The priority given to questions of justice and the normative order of society has remodeled critical theory in the image of liberal theories of justice. While this has produced an important contemporary variant of liberal theories of justice, different enough to be a challenge to liberal theory, but not enough to preserve sufficient continuity with critical theory's past, it has severely weakened the identity of critical theory and inadvertently initiated its premature dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To prevent that dissolution, Kompridis suggests that critical theory should "reinvent" itself as a "possibility-disclosing" enterprise, incorporating Heidegger's controversial insights into [[world disclosure]] and drawing from the sources of normativity that he feels were blocked from critical theory by its recent change of paradigm. Calling for what [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has named a "new department" of reason,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, Philosophical Arguments pp. 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; with a possibility-disclosing role that Kompridis calls "[[reflective disclosure]]", Kompridis argues that critical theory must embrace its neglected [[German romanticism|German romantic inheritance]] and once again imagine alternatives to existing social and political conditions, "if it is to have a future worthy of its past."&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of psychoanalytic categorizations===
In an interview with Casey Blake and [[Christopher Phelps]], historian [[Christopher Lasch]] criticized the Frankfurt School's initial tendencies towards "automatically" rejecting opposing political criticisms on "psychiatric" grounds:

{{quote|''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' had a tremendous influence on [[Richard Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] and other liberal intellectuals, because it showed them how to conduct political criticism in psychiatric categories, to make those categories bear the weight of political criticism. This procedure excused them from the difficult work of judgment and argumentation. Instead of arguing with opponents, they simply dismissed them on psychiatric grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Casey and Christopher Phelps. (1994). "History as social criticism: Conversations with Christopher Lasch", ''Journal of American History'' 80, No. 4 (March), pp. 1310–1332&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Economic and media critiques===
During the 1980s, anti-authoritarian socialists in the United Kingdom and New Zealand criticised the rigid and determinist view of popular culture deployed within the Frankfurt School theories of capitalist culture, which seemed to preclude any prefigurative role for social critique within such work. They argued that [[EC Comics]] often did contain such cultural critiques.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Barker: ''A Haunt of Fears: The Strange History of the British Horror Comics Campaign'': London: Pluto Press: 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Shuker, Roger Openshaw and Janet Soler: ''Youth, Media and Moral Panic: From Hooligans to Video Nasties'': Palmerston North: Massey University Department of Education: 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Recent criticism of the Frankfurt School by the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]] focused on the claim that culture has grown more sophisticated and diverse as a consequence of free markets and the availability of niche cultural text for niche audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, Tyler (1998) "Is Our Culture in Decline?" Cato Policy Report, http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v20n5/culture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radoff, Jon (2010) "The Attack on Imagination," {{cite web |url=http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926222855/http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weyrich first presented his notion of Cultural Marxism in a 1998 speech to the [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas Institute]]'s [[Civitas Institute#Events|Conservative Leadership Conference]], later repeating this usage in his widely syndicated "[[Paul Weyrich#Culture war letter|culture war letter]]".&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

Lind wrote a short history of his conception of Cultural Marxism for the [[Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|Free Congress Foundation]]; in it Lind identifies the presence of openly gay people on television as proof of Cultural Marxist control over the [[mass media]] and claims that Herbert Marcuse considered a coalition of "[[Black people|blacks]], students, [[feminist]] women, and homosexuals" as a vanguard of cultural revolution.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lind"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lind|first1=William S.|title=What is Cultural Marxism?|url=http://www.marylandthursdaymeeting.com/Archives/SpecialWebDocuments/Cultural.Marxism.htm|website=Maryland Thursday Meeting|access-date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HOROWITZ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lind|first1=William S.|title=Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1332|website=Discover The Networks|publisher=David Horowitz|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lind has since published his own depiction of a fictional Cultural Marxist apocalypse.&lt;ref name="TAC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lind|first1=William S.|title=Washington's Legitimacy Crisis|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/washingtons-legitimacy-crisis/|website=The American Conservative|access-date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VICTORIA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lind|first1=William S.|title=Victoria: A Novel of 4th Generation Warefare|publisher=Castalia House|isbn=978-952-7065-45-7|url=https://www.traditionalright.com/victoria/|access-date=30 November 2015|date=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lind and Weyrich's writings on this subject advocate fighting what they perceive as Cultural Marxism with "a vibrant [[cultural conservatism]]" composed of "retroculture" fashions from the past, a return to rail systems as public transport, and an [[Agrarianism|agrarian culture]] of self-reliance modeled after the [[Amish]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

In 1999, Lind led the creation of an hour-long program entitled "Political Correctness: The Frankfurt School".&lt;ref name="Jay" /&gt;

The historian [[Martin Jay]] commented on this phenomenon saying that Lind's original documentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;spawned a number of condensed textual versions, which were reproduced on a number of radical right-wing sites. These in turn led to a welter of new videos now available on YouTube, which feature an odd cast of pseudo-experts regurgitating exactly the same line. The message is numbingly simplistic: all the ills of modern American culture, from feminism, [[affirmative action]], [[sexual liberation]] and [[gay rights]] to the decay of traditional education and even [[environmentalism]] are ultimately attributable to the insidious influence of the members of the Institute for Social Research who came to America in the 1930's.&lt;ref name="Jay" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heidi Beirich likewise holds that the conspiracy theory is used to [[demonize]] various conservative "[[wikt:bête noire#English|bêtes noires]]" including "feminists, homosexuals, [[secular humanist]]s, multiculturalists, [[Sex education|sex educators]], environmentalists, immigrants, and [[black nationalist]]s".&lt;ref name="PERRY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Barbara (ed.)|last2=Beirich|first2=Heidi|title=Hate crimes [vol.5]|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-275-99569-0|pages=119|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M7p6TDR1zwcC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Heidi+Beirich+Cultural+Marxism#v=onepage&amp;q=noires&amp;f=false|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chip Berlet]], who specializes in the study of [[far-right]] movements, the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory found a place within the [[Tea Party movement]] of 2009, with contributions published in the ''[[American Thinker]]'' and ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' highlighted by some Tea Party websites.&lt;ref name="Collectivists"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://crs.sagepub.com/content/38/4/565.abstract |title=Collectivists, Communists, Labor Bosses, and Treason: The Tea Parties as Right-Wing Populist Counter-Subversion Panic |author=Berlet, Chip |journal=Critical Sociology |date=July 2012 |volume=38 |pages=565–587 |doi=10.1177/0896920511434750 |issue=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115213944/http://crs.sagepub.com/content/38/4/565.abstract |archivedate=15 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KIMBALL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kimball|first1=Linda|title=Cultural Marxism|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2007/02/cultural_marxism.html|website=American Thinker|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has reported that William S. Lind in 2002 gave a speech at a [[Holocaust denial]] conference on the topic of Cultural Marxism. In this speech Lind noted that all the members of The Frankfurt School were "to a man, Jewish", but it is reported that Lind claims not to question whether the Holocaust occurred and suggests he was present in an official capacity for the Free Congress Foundation "to work with a wide variety of groups on an issue-by-issue basis".&lt;ref name="BERK"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Bill|title=Ally of Christian Right Heavyweight Paul Weyrich Addresses Holocaust Denial Conference|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/ally-christian-right-heavyweight-paul-weyrich-addresses-holocaust-denial-conference|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|publisher=SPLC 2003|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BILL" /&gt;

Although the theory became more widespread in the late 1990s and through the 2000s, the modern iteration of the theory originated in Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay "New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness{{'"}}, published in [[Fidelio (magazine)|''Fidelio Magazine'']] by the [[Schiller Institute]].&lt;ref name="Jay"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jay |first1=Martin |title=Dialectic of Counter-Enlightenment: The Frankfurt School as Scapegoat of the Lunatic Fringe |url=http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm |website=skidmore.edu |publisher=''Salmagundi Magazine'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124045123/http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm |archivedate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schillerinstitute.org"&gt;[http://www.schillerinstitute.org/fid_91-96/921_frankfurt.html "New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness{{'"}}], Schiller Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay (2010) notes that Daniel Estulin's book cites this essay and that [[Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|The Free Congress Foundation's]] program was inspired by it.&lt;/ref&gt; The Schiller Institute, a branch of the [[LaRouche movement]], further promoted the idea in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Minnicino (1994), [http://www.schillerinstitute.org/conf-iclc/1990s/conf_feb_1994_minnicino.html Freud and the Frankfurt School] ([[Schiller Institute]] 1994), part of "Solving the Paradox of Current World History", a conference report published in ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Minnicino article charges that the Frankfurt School promoted [[Modernism]] in [[Modern art|the arts]] as a form of [[cultural pessimism]] and shaped the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] (such as the British pop band [[The Beatles]]) after the [[Wandervogel]] of the [[Monte Verità|Ascona commune]].&lt;ref name="schillerinstitute.org" /&gt; According to [[Samuel Moyn]], the fear of "cultural Marxism” is originally "an American contribution to the phantasmagoria of the alt-right", while the theory is "a crude slander, referring to something that does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Alt-Right’s Favorite Meme is 100 Years Old |author=Samuel Moyn |authorlink=Samuel Moyn |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/opinion/cultural-marxism-anti-semitism.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=sectionfront |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Norwegian terrorist [[Anders Behring Breivik]] included the term in his document "2083: A European Declaration of Independence", which—along with [[Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|The Free Congress Foundation's]] ''Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology''—was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses approximately 90 minutes before [[2011 Norway attacks|the 2011 bomb blast in Oslo]] for which Breivik was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Breivik manifesto' details chilling attack preparation|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-14267007|access-date=2 August 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trilling|first1=Daniel|title=Who are Breivik's fellow travellers?|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2012/04/who-are-breivik%E2%80%99s-fellow-travellers|access-date=18 July 2015|publisher=New Statesman|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QANTARA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buruma|first1=Ian|title=Breivik's Call to Arms|url=http://en.qantara.de/content/islamophobia-in-europe-breiviks-call-to-arms|website=Qantara|publisher=German Federal Agency for Civic Education &amp; Deutsche Welle|access-date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segments of William S.

In July 2017, Rich Higgins was removed by US National Security Advisor [[H. R.

Philosopher and political science lecturer Jérôme Jamin has stated that "[n]ext to the global dimension of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, there is its innovative and original dimension, which lets its authors avoid racist discourses and pretend to be defenders of democracy".&lt;ref name="JAMIN"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shekhovtsov |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |last=Jamin |first=Jérôme |title=The Post-War Anglo-American Far Right: A Special Relationship of Hate |chapter=Cultural Marxism and the Radical Right |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-1-137-39619-8 |doi=10.1057/9781137396211.0009 |pages=84–103 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbLSBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA84 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor and [[Oxford fellow]] Matthew Feldman has traced the terminology back to the pre-war German concept of [[Cultural Bolshevism]], locating it as part of the [[degeneration theory]] that aided in [[Hitler's rise to power]].&lt;ref name="MATT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthew|first1=Feldman|last2=Griffin|first2=Roger (editor)|title=Fascism: Fascism and culture|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-29018-0 |page=343|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOH4yTFvBokC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=Cultural+Marxism|access-date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; William S.

'''A generative theory of tonal music''' (GTTM) is a theory of music&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred/Jackendoff, Ray (1983): ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'', Cambridge, Mass.: [[MIT Press]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; conceived by American composer and music theorist [[Fred Lerdahl]] and American linguist [[Ray Jackendoff]] and presented in the 1983 book of the same title. It constitutes a "formal description of the musical intuitions of a listener who is experienced in a musical idiom"&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred/Jackendoff, Ray (1983): ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'', Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of illuminating the unique human capacity for musical understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred and Ray Jackendoff (1983).

The collaboration between Lerdahl and Jackendoff was inspired by [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s 1973 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] at Harvard University, wherein he called for researchers to uncover a musical grammar that could explain the human musical mind in a scientific manner comparable to [[Noam Chomsky]]'s revolutionary [[transformational grammar|transformational]] or [[generative grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1957). ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague: Mouton; Chomsky, Noam (1965). ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chomsky, Noam (1966). ''Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar''. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the major methodologies of music analysis that preceded it, GTTM construes the mental procedures under which the listener constructs an unconscious understanding of music, and uses these tools to illuminate the structure of individual compositions. The theory has been influential, spurring further work by its authors and other researchers in the fields of [[music theory]], [[music cognition]] and [[cognitive musicology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackendoff, Ray (1987). ''Consciousness and the Computational Mind''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Temperley, David (2001). ''The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Lerdahl, Fred (2001). ''Tonal Pitch Space''. New York: Oxford University Press; Lerdahl, F., &amp; R. Jackendoff (2006). The Capacity for Music: What Is It, and What's Special About It? ''Cognition'', 100.1, 33–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theory==

GTTM focuses on four hierarchical systems that shape our musical intuitions. Each of these systems is expressed in a strict hierarchical structure where dominant regions contain smaller subordinate elements and equal elements exist contiguously within a particular and explicit hierarchical level. In GTTM any level can be small-scale or large-scale depending on the size of its elements.

===The structures===

====I. Grouping structure====

GTTM considers grouping analysis to be the most basic component of musical understanding. It expresses a hierarchical segmentation of the piece into motives, phrases, periods and still larger sections.

====II. Metrical structure====

Metrical structure expresses the intuition that the events of a piece are related to a regular alternation of strong and weak beats at a number of hierarchical levels. It is a crucial basis for all the structures and reductions of GTTM.

====III. Time-span reduction====

Time-span reductions (TSRs) are based on information gleaned from metrical and grouping structures. They establish [[tree structure]]-style hierarchical organizations uniting time-spans at all temporal levels of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Their function is double: they establish tree structure relations (time-span trees), and they provide rhythmic criteria to supplement pitch criteria that determine the structural importance of events (p. 119).&lt;/ref&gt;  The TSR analysis begins at the smallest levels, where metrical structure marks off the music into beats of equal length (or more precisely into attack points separated by uniform time-spans&lt;ref&gt;A time-span is a length of time spanning from one metrical event up to, but not including, the next event. (This is the minimal condition on time-spans.)&lt;/ref&gt;) and moves through all larger levels where grouping structure divides the music into motives, phrases, periods, theme groups and still greater divisions. It further specifies a “head” (or most structurally important event) for each time-span at all hierarchical levels of the analysis. A completed TSR analysis is often called a time-span tree.

====IV. Prolongational reduction====

Prolongational reduction (PR) provides our "psychological" awareness of tensing and relaxing patterns in a given piece with precise structural terms. In time-span reduction, the hierarchy of less and more important events is established according to rhythmic stability. In prolongational reduction, hierarchy is concerned with relative stability expressed in terms of continuity and progression, the movement toward tension or relaxation, and the degree of closure or non-closure.  A PR analysis also produces a tree-structure style hierarchical analysis, but this information is often conveyed in a visually condensed modified "slur" notation.

The need for prolongational reduction mainly arises from two limitations of time-span reductions. The first is that time-span reduction fails to express the sense of continuity produced by harmonic rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Harmonic rhythm is the pattern of durations produced by changes in the harmony at the musical surface.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that time-span reduction—even though it establishes that particular pitch-events are heard in relation to a particular beat, within a particular group—fails to say anything about how music flows across these segments.&lt;ref&gt;F. Lerdahl and R. Jackendoff (1983). ''The generative theory of tonal music''. p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

===More on TSR vs. PR===

It is helpful to note some basic differences between a time-span tree produced by TSR and a prolongational tree produced by PR. First, though the basic branching divisions produced by the two trees are often the same or similar at high structural levels, branching variations between the two trees are often observed as one travels further down towards the musical surface.

A second and equally important differentiation is that a prolongational tree carries three types of branching: strong prolongation (represented by an open node at the branching point), weak prolongation (represented by a filled node at the branching point) and progression (represented by simple branching, with no node). Time-span trees do not make this distinction. All time-span trees branches are simple branches without nodes. (Although time-span tree branches are often annotated with other helpful comments.)

==The rules==

Each of the four major hierarchical organizations (grouping structure, metrical structure, time-span reduction and prolongational reduction) is established through rules, which are divided into three categories:

#The well-formedness rules, which specify possible structural descriptions.
#The preference rules, which draw on possible structural descriptions eliciting those descriptions that correspond to experienced listeners’ hearings of any particular piece.
#The transformational rules, which provide a means of associating distorted structures with well-formed descriptions.

===I. Grouping structure rules===

====Grouping well-formedness rules (G~WFRs)====

#"Any contiguous sequence of pitch-events, drum beats, or the like can constitute a group, and only contiguous sequences can constitute a group."
#"A piece constitutes a group."
#"A group may contain smaller groups."
#"If a group G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; contains part of a group G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it must contain all of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;."
#'If a group G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; contains a smaller group G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; must be exhaustively partitioned into smaller groups."

====Grouping preference rules (G~PRs)====

#"Avoid analyses with very small groups  – the smaller, the less preferable."
#(Proximity) Consider a sequence of four notes, n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the transition n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may be heard as a group boundary if: a.(slur/rest) the interval of time from the end of n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than that from the end of n1 to the beginning of n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that from the end of n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to the beginning of n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or if b.(attack/point) the interval of time between the attack point of n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than that between the attack points of n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that between the attack points of n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
#(Change) Consider a sequence of four notes, n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the transition n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may be heard as a group boundary if marked by a. register, b. dynamics, c. articulation, d. length.
#(Intensification) "Where the effects pick out by a GPRs 2 and 3 are relatively more pronounced, a larger-level group may be placed."
#(Symmetry)  "Prefer grouping analyses that most closely approach the ideal subdivision of groups into two parts of equal length."
#(Parallelism) "Where two or more segments of music can be construed as parallel, they preferably form parallel parts of groups."
#(Time-span and prolongational stability) "Prefer a grouping structure that results in more stable time-span and/or prolongational reductions."

====Transformational grouping rules====

#Grouping overlap (p.&amp;nbsp;60).
#Grouping elision (p.&amp;nbsp;61).

===II. Metrical structure rules===

====Metrical well-formedness rules (M~WFRs)====

#"Every attack point must be associated with a beat at the smallest metrical level present at that point in the piece."
#"Every beat at a given level must also be a beat at all smaller levels present at that point in that piece."
#"At each metrical level, strong beats are spaced either two or three beats apart."
#"The tactus and immediately larger metrical levels must consist of beats equally spaced throughout the piece. At subtactus metrical levels, weak beats must be equally spaced between the surrounding strong beats."

====Metrical preference rules (M~PRs)====

#(Parallelism) "Where two or more groups or parts of groups can be construed as parallel, they preferably receive parallel metrical structure."
#(Strong beat early) "Weakly prefer a metrical structure in which the strongest beat in a group appears relatively early in the group."
#(Event) "Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that coincide with the inception of pitch-events are strong beats of L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;."
#(Stress) "Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that are stressed are strong beats of L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;."
#(Length) Prefer a metrical structure in which a relatively strong beat occurs at the inception of either relatively long: a. pitch-event; b. duration of a dynamic; c. slur; d. pattern of articulation; e. duration of a pitch in the relevant levels of the time-span reduction; f. duration of a harmony in the relevant levels of the time-span reduction (harmonic rhythm).
#(Bass) "Prefer a metrically stable bass."
#(Cadence) "Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which cadences are metrically stable; that is, strongly avoid violations of local preference rules within cadences."
#(Suspension) "Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which a suspension is on a stronger beat than its resolution."
#(Time-span interaction) "Prefer a metrical analysis that minimizes conflict in the time-span reduction."
#(Binary regularity) "Prefer metrical structures in which at each level every other beat is strong."

====Transformational metrical rule====

#Metrical deletion (p.&amp;nbsp;101).

===III. Time-span reduction rules===

Time-span reduction rules begin with two segmentation rules and proceed to the standard WFRs, PRs and TRs.

====Time-span segmentation rules====

#"Every group in a piece is a time-span in the time-span segmentation of the piece."
#"In underlying grouping structure: a. each beat B of the smallest metrical level determines a time-span T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; extending from B up to but not including the next beat of the smallest level; b. each beat B of metrical level Li determines a regular time-span of all beats of level L&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; from B up to but not including (i) the next beat B’ of level L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or (ii) a group boundary, whichever comes sooner; and c. if a group boundary G intervenes between B and the preceding beat of the same level, B determines an augmented time-span T’&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the interval from G to the end of the regular time-span T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;."

====Time-span reduction well-formedness rules (TSR~WFRs)====

#"For every time-span T there is an event e (or a sequence of events e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that is the head of T."
#"If T does not contain any other time-span (that is, if T is the smallest level of time-spans), there e is whatever event occurs in T."
#If T contains other time-spans, let T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the (regular or augmented) time-spans immediately contained in T and let e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be their respective heads. Then the head is defined depending on: a. ordinary reduction; b. fusion; c. transformation; d. cadential retention (p.&amp;nbsp;159).
#"If a two-element cadence is directly subordinate to the head e of a time-span T, the final is directly subordinate to e and the penult is directly subordinate to the final."

====Time-span reduction preference rules (TSR~PRs)====

#(Metrical position) "Of the possible choices for head of time-span T, prefer that is in a relatively strong metrical position."
#(Local harmony) "Of the possible choices for head of time-span T, prefer that is: a. relatively intrinsically consonant, b. relatively closely related to the local tonic."
#(Registral extremes) "Of the possible choices for head of time-span T, weakly prefer a choice that has: a. a higher melodic pitch; b. a lower bass pitch."
#(Parallelism) "If two or more time-spans can be construed as motivically and/or rhythmically parallel, preferably assign them parallel heads."
#(Metrical stability) "In choosing the head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more stable choice of metrical structure."
#(Prolongational stability) "In choosing the head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more stable choice of prolongational structure."
#(Cadential retention) (p.&amp;nbsp;170).
#(Structural beginning) "If for a time-span T there is a larger group G containing T for which the head of T can function as the structural beginning, then prefer as head of T an event relatively close to the beginning of T (and hence to the beginning of G as well)."
#"In choosing the head of a piece, prefer the structural ending to the structural beginning."

===IV. Prolongational reduction rules===

====Prolongational reduction well-formedness rules (PR~WFRs)====

#"There is a single event in the underlying grouping structure of every piece that functions as prolongational head."
#"An event e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can be a direct elaboration of another pitch e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; in any of the following ways: a. e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a strong prolongation of e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; if the roots, bass notes, and melodic notes of the two events are identical; b. e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a weak prolongation of e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; if the roots of the two events are identical but the bass and/or melodic notes differ; c. e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a progression to or from e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; if the harmonic roots of the two events are different."
#"Every event in the underlying grouping structure is either the prolongational head or a recursive elaboration of the prolongational head."
#(No crossing branches) "If an event e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a direct elaboration of an event e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, every event between e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; must be a direct elaboration of either e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, or some event between them."

====Prolongational reduction preference rules (PR~PRs)====

#(Time-span importance) "In choosing the prolongational most important event e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of a prolongational region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;), strongly prefer a choice in which e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is relatively time-span important."
#(Time-span segmentation) "Let e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the prolongationally most important region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;). If there is a time-span that contains e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; but not e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, prefer a prolongational reduction in which e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is an elaboration of e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;; similarly with the roles of e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; reversed."
#(Prolongational connection) "In choosing the prolongationally most important  region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;), prefer an e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; that attaches to as to form a maximally stable prolongational connections with one of the endpoints of the region."
#(Prolongational importance) "Let e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the prolongationally most important region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;). Prefer a prolongational reduction in which e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is an elaboration of the prolongationally more important of the endpoints."
#(Parallelism) "Prefer a prolongational reduction in which parallel passages receive parallel analyses."
#(Normative prolongational structure) "A cadenced group preferably contains four (five) elements in its prolongational structure: a. a prolongational beginning; b. a prolongational ending consisting of one element of the cadences; (c. a right-branching prolongational as the most important direct elaboration direct of the prolongational beginning); d. a right-branching progression as the (next) most important direct elaboration of the prolongational beginning; e. a left-branching ‘subdominant’ progression as the most important elaboration of the first element of the cadence."

====Prolongational reduction transformational rules====

#Stability conditions for prolongational connection (p. 224): a. Branching condition; b. Pitch-collection condition; c. Melodic Condition; d. Harmonic Condition.
#Interaction principle: "In order to make a sufficiently stable prolongational connection e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; must be chosen from the events in the two most important levels of time-span reduction represented in (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)."

[[File:Gizzard of Chicken.JPG|thumb|250x250px|Gizzard of a chicken]]
The '''gizzard''', also referred to as the '''ventriculus''', '''gastric mill''', and '''gigerium''', is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] found in the [[digestive tract]] of some animals, including [[archosaurs]] ([[pterosaur]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[alligator]]s, and [[dinosaur]]s, including [[bird]]s), [[earthworm]]s, some [[gastropod]]s, some [[fish]], and some [[crustacean]]s. This specialized [[stomach]] constructed of thick muscular walls is used for grinding up food, often aided by particles of stone or grit. In certain [[insects]] and [[molluscs]], the gizzard features [[chitin]]ous plates or teeth.

==Etymology==
The word ''gizzard'' comes from the [[Middle English]] ''giser'', which derives from a similar word in [[Old French]] ''gésier'', which itself evolved from the [[Latin]] ''gigeria'', meaning [[giblets]].&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gizzard |title=Gizzard |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PigeonAnatomy.png|thumb|240px|The gizzard (serial 8) of a [[pigeon]], seen at the right of the [[duodenum]] between the legs.]]

===In birds===
[[Bird anatomy|Birds]] swallow food and store it in their [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]] if necessary. Then the food passes into their glandular stomach, also called the [[proventriculus]], which is also sometimes referred to as the true stomach. This is the secretory part of the stomach. Then the food passes into the gizzard (also known as the ''muscular stomach'' or ''ventriculus''). The gizzard can grind the food with previously swallowed stones and pass it back to the true stomach, and vice versa. In layman's terms, the gizzard 'chews' the food for the bird as it does not have teeth to chew food the way humans do. Bird gizzards are lined with a tough layer made of the carbohydrate-protein complex [[koilin]], to protect the muscles in the gizzard.

By comparison, while in birds the stomach occurs in the digestive tract prior to the gizzard, in grasshoppers the gizzard occurs prior to the stomach, while in earthworms there is only a gizzard, and no stomach.

===Gizzard stones===
Some animals that lack teeth will swallow stones or grit to aid in fragmenting hard foods. All birds have gizzards, but not all will swallow stones or grit. Those that do employ the following method of chewing:

:"A bird swallows small bits of gravel that act as 'teeth' in the gizzard, breaking down hard food such as seeds and thus helping digestion." (Solomon et al.,&amp;nbsp;2002).
These stones are called ''gizzard stones'' or ''[[gastrolith]]s'' and usually become round and smooth from the polishing action in the animal's stomach. When too smooth to do their required work, they may be excreted or regurgitated.

==Animals with gizzards==

===Fish===
The mullet ([[Mugilidae]]) found in [[Estuary|estuarine]] waters worldwide, and the gizzard or mud [[shad]], found in freshwater lakes and streams from New York to Mexico, have gizzards.
The [[gillaroo]] (''Salmo stomachius''), a richly colored species of [[trout]] found in [[Lough Melvin]], a lake in the north of Ireland, has a gizzard which is used to aid the digestion of water snails, the main component of its diet.

===Reptiles===
[[Alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s also have gizzards.

===Earthworms===
[[Earthworm]]s also have gizzards.

===Birds===
All birds have gizzards. The gizzards of [[emu]]s, [[domesticated turkey|turkeys]], [[chickens]], [[parrots]], and [[ducks]] are most notable in cuisine (see below).

===Crustaceans===
[[File:Krillanatomykils.jpg|thumb|right|Body structure of a typical crustacean – krill]]
Some crustaceans have a gizzard although this is usually referred to as a gastric mill.&lt;ref name="Sakai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=K. Sakai |year=2004 |journal=[[Crustaceana]] |title=The diphyletic nature of the Infraorder Thalassinidea (Decapoda, Pleocyemata) as derived from the morphology of the gastric mill |volume=77 |issue=9 |pages=1117–1129 |doi=10.1163/1568540042900268 |jstor=20107419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-avian dinosaurs===
[[Dinosaur]]s that are believed to have had gizzards based on the discovery of gizzard stones recovered near fossils include:
* ''[[Psittacosaurus]]''
* ''[[Massospondylus]]''
* ''[[Sellosaurus]]''
* ''[[Omeisaurus]]''
* ''[[Apatosaurus]]''
* ''[[Barosaurus]]''
* ''[[Dicraeosaurus]]''
* ''[[Seismosaurus]]''
The belief that ''[[Claosaurus]]'' had a gizzard has been discredited on the grounds that the fossil remains this claim was based on were another species and the stones merely from a stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creisler|first=Benjamin S|title=Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs|date=2007|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0253348173|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pterosaurs===
At least some pterosaurs seemingly had gizzards. The most notable cases are ''[[Pterodaustro]]'' (inferred via gastroliths) and ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]'' (directly preserved).&lt;ref&gt;Codorniú et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy|author=Wilton, Mark P. |isbn=0691150613|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cuisine==
[[File:FriedGizzards.JPG|thumb|Fried gizzards and livers]]
[[Poultry]] gizzards are a popular food throughout the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Grilled [[chicken]] gizzards are sold as [[street food]] in [[Haiti]] and throughout [[Southeast Asia]]. In [[Indonesia]], gizzard and liver are considered part of a complete fried poultry dish.

In [[Mexico]] they are eaten with rice or with chicken soup. They are also served grilled and prepared scrambled with eggs, onions, garlic, and salsa; and served with beans and tortillas for breakfast and other meals.

Stewed gizzards are eaten as a snack in [[Portugal]].

In [[Hungary]] it is made with [[paprika]].

In Ghana, it is eaten boiled, fried or grilled. Grilled, skewered gizzards, with spices and optional green peppers and onions, are popular.

In [[Nigeria]] gizzard is either grilled or fried and served with stew and fried [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]].

[[Pickling|Pickle]]d [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] gizzards are a traditional food in some parts of the [[Midwestern United States]]. In [[Chicago]], gizzard is battered, deep fried and served with [[french fries]] and sauce. The [[Chamber of Commerce]] in [[Potterville, Michigan]] has held a Gizzard Fest each June since 2000; a gizzard-eating contest is among the weekend's events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizzardfest.com/gizzardfest.html |title=Gizzard Fest |publisher=Potterville Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern United States, the gizzard is typically served fried, sometimes eaten with hot sauce or honey mustard, or added to [[crawfish]] boil along with crawfish [[sauce]], and it is also used in traditional New Orleans [[gumbo]].

Gizzard and mashed potato is a popular food in many European countries.

In [[France]], especially the [[Dordogne]] region, duck gizzards are eaten in the traditional [[Périgordian]] salad, along with [[walnuts]], [[croutons]] and [[lettuce]].

In [[Iran]] some kebab restaurants mix chicken gizzards in their [[koobideh]] kebabs to increase the meat content.

In [[Italy]] gizzards are often used mixed with other [[offal]].

In [[Japan]], gizzard is called ''zuri'' or ''sunagimo''; usually it is cooked in [[yakitori]] (Japanese style skewered barbecue). In [[Kyushu]] (southern Japan), gizzard is fried into [[karaage]].

In [[Korea]], chicken gizzard, called ''[[dak-ttongjip]]'', is stir-fried and eaten as [[anju (food)|anju]] or [[yasik]].

The word ''Sangdana'' is commonly used to refer to chicken gizzards in Northern [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. The word is derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] (Sang = stone and dana = grain). Another name for it is ''Pathri''. It may be served cooked in a curry while barbecued skewered gizzards are also popular.

In [[Nepal]], gizzard is called ''jaatey'' or ''pangra''. It is eaten most often with drinks.

In [[Yiddish]], gizzards are referred to as ''pipik'lach'', literally meaning [[navel]]s. The gizzards of [[kosher]] species of birds have a green or yellowish membrane lining the inside, which must be peeled off before cooking, as it lends a very bitter taste to the food. In traditional Eastern European [[Jewish cuisine]], the gizzards, necks, and feet of [[chickens]] were often cooked together, although not the [[liver]], which per [[Kosher]] law must be [[broil]]ed. Kosher butchers often sell roasting chickens with the gizzard, neck, and feet butchered and left in the cavity to be used for making [[chicken soup]].

In [[Uganda]], [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]], the gizzard of a cooked chicken is traditionally set aside for the oldest or most respected male at the table.

[[Giblets]] consist of the heart, liver and gizzard of a bird, and are often eaten themselves or used as the basis for a soup or stock.

In Taiwan, gizzards are often slow-cooked and served hot or cold in slices, with green onions and soy sauce.

In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], gizzards are curried and served with rice or [[roti]] bread, it can also be stewed.

In [[Mainland China]], [[duck gizzard]] is a common snack, eaten alongside other duck parts such as feet, neck, heart, tongue, or head.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Mair]] (2015), [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=16913 Chinese words and characters for "gizzard"], ''Language Log'', 7 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas famous for their gizzard are [[Sichuan]] and [[Hubei]] provinces. [[Wuhan]] city in Hubei is famous for its brand of spicy gizzard, called ''Jiujiuya'' (Simplified Chinese:久久鸭). In Northern China, one can find barbecued duck gizzard.

== Generic meaning ==
The term "gizzard" can also, by extension, refer to the general guts, innards or entrails of animals.&lt;ref name=mw /&gt;

[[Image:Steelyard weight Eleutherion.JPG|thumb|Steelyard weight found in the Port of Theodosius]]
The '''Harbour of Eleutherios''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|λιμήν Ἐλευθερίου}}}}), later known as the '''Harbour of [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]]''' ({{lang-el|λιμήν Θεοδοσίου}}, {{lang-la|Portus Theodosiacus}}) was one of the ports of ancient [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], located beneath the modern [[Yenikapi]] neighbourhood  of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].

The harbour was located on the south side of the peninsula where the city is built, facing towards the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The other harbours of the city were the Harbour of Julian and the small harbour of the [[Boukoleon Palace]], likewise on the southern shore, and the harbours of [[Neorion Harbour|Neorion]] and [[Prosphorion Harbour|Prosphorion]] on the northern side. The harbour was built in the late 4th century during the reign of [[Theodosius I]], and was the city's major point of trade in [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeology  slows down building of Europe-Asia tunnel|url=http://www.machuproject.eu/news/news-28.htm|publisher=Manchu Project|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was later transformed for [[agricultural]] use due to the effects of erosion and [[silt]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Treasures of Constantinople Test Turkey's 21st-century Ambition|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-24-2006-87247.asp|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090315200337/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-24-2006-87247.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 March 2009|publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media|accessdate=15 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times, the area was built over.

In November 2005, workers on the [[Marmaray|Bosphorus Tunnel Project]] discovered the silted-up remains of the harbour. Excavations produced evidence of the 4th-century Port of Theodosius. There, archaeologists uncovered traces of the [[Walls of Constantinople|city wall]] of [[Constantine the Great]], and the remains of over 35 Byzantine ships from the 7th to 10th centuries, including several Byzantine [[galley]]s, remains of which had never before been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.archaeology.org/0707/abstracts/istanbul.html |author=Rose, Mark |author2=Aydingün, Sengül |title=Under Istanbul |accessdate=2008-10-27 |work=Archaeology.org |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the excavation has uncovered the oldest evidence of settlement in Constantinople, with artifacts, including [[amphorae]], pottery fragments, shells, pieces of bone, horse skulls, and nine human skulls found in a bag, dating back to 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article3111023.ece Nautical archaeology takes a leap forward]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is an [[industrial symbiosis]] network located in [[Kalundborg]], [[Denmark]], in which companies in the region collaborate to use each other's by-products and otherwise share resources.

The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is the first full realization of industrial symbiosis.&lt;ref name=Chertow2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chertow|first=Marian|title=Industrial symbiosis: literature and taxonomy|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|year=2000|volume=25|pages=313–337|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collaboration and its environmental implications arose unintentionally through private initiatives, as opposed to government planning, making it a model for private planning of eco-industrial parks.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; At the center of the exchange network is the [[Asnæs Power Station]], a 1500MW [[Coal power plant|coal-fired power plant]], which has material and energy links with the community and several other companies.  [[Waste heat|Surplus heat]] from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby [[fish farm]], whose [[sludge]] is then sold as a [[fertilizer]].  [[Steam]] from the power plant is sold to [[Novo Nordisk]], a [[pharmaceutical]] and [[enzyme]] manufacturer, in addition to [[Statoil]] power plant.  This reuse of [[Waste heat|heat]] reduces the amount [[thermal pollution]] discharged to a nearby [[fjord]].  Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's [[sulfur dioxide]] [[scrubber]] contains [[gypsum]], which is sold to a [[wallboard]] manufacturer.  Almost all of the manufacturer's [[gypsum]] needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of [[open-pit mining]] needed.  Furthermore, [[fly ash]] and [[Clinker (waste)|clinker]] from the power plant is used for road building and [[cement]] production.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld"/&gt; These exchanges of waste, water and materials have greatly increased environmental and economic efficiency, as well as created other less tangible benefits for these actors, including sharing of personnel, equipment, and information.&lt;ref name=Chertow2 /&gt;

==History==
The Kalundborg Industrial Park was not originally planned for industrial symbiosis. Its current state of waste heat and materials sharing developed over a period of 20 years. Early sharing at Kalundborg tended to involve the sale of waste products without significant pretreatment.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt;  Each further link in the system was negotiated as an independent business deal, and was established only if it was expected to be economically beneficial.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt;

The park began in 1959 with the start up of the [[Asnæs Power Station]]. The first episode of sharing between two entities was in 1972 when Gyproc, a plaster-board manufacturing plant, established a pipeline to supply gas from [[Tidewater Petroleum|Tidewater Oil Company]]. In 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completed a district heating distribution network within the city of Kalundborg, which utilized waste heat from the power plant.&lt;ref name="Industrial Green Book" &gt;National Research Council (1998). The Ecology of Industry: Sector and Linkages. Washington DC: The National Academies Press. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the facilities in Kalundborg have been expanding, and have been sharing a variety of materials and waste products, some for the purpose of industrial symbiosis and some out of necessity, for example,  freshwater scarcity in the area has led to water reuse schemes. In particular, 700,000 cubic meters per year of cooling water is piped from Statoil to Asnaes per year.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt;

A timeline of the creation of the industrial park:
* 1959 The [[Asnæs Power Station]] was started up
* 1961 Tidewater Oil Company constructed a pipeline from [[Tissø|Lake Tissø]] to provide water for its operation
* 1963 Tidewater Oil Company's oil refinery is taken over by [[Esso]]
* 1972 Gyproc establishes plaster-board manufacturing plant. A pipeline from the refinery to the Gyproc facility is constructed to supply excess refinery gas
* 1973 The [[Asnæs Power Station]] is expanded. A connection is built to the Lake Tissø-Statoil pipeline
* 1976 [[Novo Nordisk]] starts delivering biological sludge to neighboring farms
* 1979 [[Asnæs Power Station]] starts supplying [[fly ash]] to cement manufacturers in northern [[Denmark]]
* 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completes a district heating distribution network within the city that utilizes waste heat from the power plant
* 1982 [[Novo Nordisk]] and the [[Statoil]] refinery complete construction of steam supply pipelines from the power plant. By purchasing process steam from the power plant, the companies are able to shut down inefficient steam boilers
* 1987 The [[Statoil]] refinery completes a pipeline to supply its [[effluent]] cooling water to the power plant for use as raw boiler feed water.
* 1989 The power plant starts using waste heat from its salt cooling water to produce trout and turbot at its local fish farm
* 1989 [[Novo Nordisk]] enters into agreement with Kalundborg municipality, the power plant, and the refinery to connect to the water supply grid from Lake Tissø
* 1990 The [[Statoil]] refinery completes construction of a sulphur recovery plant. The recovered sulphur is sold as raw material to a sulfuric acid manufacturer in [[Fredericia]]
* 1991 The [[Statoil]] refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply biologically treated refinery [[effluent]] water to the power plant for cleaning purposes, and for [[fly ash]] stabilization
* 1992 The [[Statoil]] refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply [[flare gas]] to the power plant as a supplementary fuel
* 1993 The power plant completes a stack [[flue gas]] desulfurization project. The resulting calcium sulphate is sold to Gyproc, where it replaces imported natural [[gypsum]]&lt;ref name="Industrial Green Book" /&gt;

== The Symbiosis ==
The relationships among the firms comprising the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park form an [[industrial symbiosis]]. Generally speaking, the actors involved in the symbiosis at Kalundborg exchange material wastes, energy, water, and information.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Domenech|first=Teresa|author2=Michael Davies|title=Structure and morphology of industrial symbiosis networks: The case of Kalundborg|journal=Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences|year=2011|volume=10|pages=79–89|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kalundborg network involves a number of actors, including a power station, two big energy firms, a plaster board company, and a soil remediation company. Other actors include farmers, recycling facilities, and fish factories that use some of the material flows.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies" /&gt;  [http://www.kalundborg.dk/Erhverv/Erhvervsudvikling/%20Kalundborg_EU-kontor.aspx Kalundborg Municipality] plays an active role. Additionally, other actors, such as Novoren, a recycling and urban land field firm, are formally part of the network but do not contribute
tangibly in the exchange.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies" /&gt;

=== Partners ===
[[File:Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park Symbiosis Map.jpg|thumb|A flowchart to show the material sharing between entities in the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park]]

There are currently over thirty exchanges of materials among the actors of Kalundborg.&lt;ref name=Municipality&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalundborg Municipality|title=Kalundborg Symbiosis|url= http://www.kalundborg.dk/Erhverv/Erhvervsudvikling/Kalundborg_Symbiosis.aspx |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Asnaes Power Station is at the heart of the network.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenfeld|first=John |author2=Nicholas Gertler|title=Industrial Ecology in Practice:  The Evolution of Interdependence at Kalundborg|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|year=1997|volume=1|pages=67–79 |doi=10.1162/jiec.1997.1.1.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power company gives its steam residuals to the Statoil Refinery, meeting 40% of its steam requirements,&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; in exchange for waste gas from the refinery.

Water reuse schemes have also been developed within Kalundborg. Statoil pipes 700,000 cubic meters of cooling water per year to Asnaes, which purifies it and uses it as "boiler feed-water."&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; Asnaes also uses approximately 200,000 cubic meters of Statoil's treated wastewater per year for cleaning.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; The 90&amp;nbsp;°C residual heat from the refinery is not used for district heating due to taxes.

==Savings and Environmental Impacts==
[[File:Wastes avoided at Kalundborg.jpg|thumbnail|right|Annual wastes avoided in Kalundborg as of 1997]]
[[File:Savings from Kalundborg.jpg|thumbnail|right|Annual resource savings in Kalundborg as of 1997]]

Since its start over 25 years ago, Kalundborg has been operating successfully as an eco-industrial park. One of the main goals of industrial symbiosis is to make goods and services that use the least-cost combination of inputs. These relationships were formed on an economic and environmental basis.&lt;ref name="Desrochers"&gt;Desrochers, Pierre (2001). "Cities and Industrial Symbiosis: Some Historical Perspectives and Policy Implications." Journal of Industrial Ecology 5.4 : 29-44. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, there are over thirty exchanges occurring in Kalundborg. While Kalundborg does operate using trades between various firms in the vicinity, it itself is not self-sufficient or contained to the industrial park. There are many trades that occur with companies outside of this park region.&lt;ref name="Desrochers" /&gt;

All of these exchanges have contributed to water savings, and savings in fuel and input chemicals. Wastes were also avoided through these interchanges. For example, in 1997, Asnaes (the power station) saved 30,000 tons of coal (~2% of throughput) by using Statoil (large oil refinery) fuel gas. And 200,000 tons of fly ash and clinker were avoided from Asnaes landfill.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt; These resources savings and waste avoidances, documented before 1997, are illustrated in the tables to the right.

A study in 2002 showed that these exchanges also contributed to more than 95% of the total water supply to the power plant. This is up from 70% in 1990.  So, the system is becoming more comprehensive in its ability to save groundwater, however, there is still room for improvement. Out of the 1.2 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of wastewater discharged from Statoil (the refinery), only 9000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; were reused at the power plant.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"&gt;Jacobsen, Noel Brings (2006). "Industrial Symbiosis in Kalundborg, Denmark: A Quantitative Assessment of Economic and Environmental Aspects." Journal of Industrial Ecology 10.1-2: 239-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent numbers show a vast improvement, when comparing to the numbers from 1997, in resource savings. Data from around 2004 show annual savings of 2.9 million cubic meters of ground water, and 1 million cubic meters of surface water. Gypsum savings are estimated around 170,000 tons, and sulfur dioxide waste avoidance is estimated around 53 Tn. These numbers are mostly estimations. Aspects of the eco-industrial park have changed, and there are many levels to consider when doing these calculations. All together though, these interchanges have shown annual savings of up to $15 million (US), with investments around $78.5 million (US). The total accumulated savings is estimated around $310 million (US).&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies"/&gt;

==As a Model==
Kalundborg was the first example of separate industries grouping together to gain competitive advantage by material exchange, energy exchange, information exchange, and/or product exchange. The very term,  [[Industrial symbiosis|Industrial Symbiosis]] (IS) was first defined by a station manager in Kalundborg as "a cooperation between different industries by which the presence of each…increases the viability of the others, and by which the demands of society for resource savings and environmental protection are considered" .&lt;ref&gt;Chertow, Marian R (2007). ""Uncovering" Industrial Symbiosis." Journal of Industrial Ecology 11.1: 11-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg's success helped generate interest in industrial symbiosis. Developed nations such as the United States began to formulate incentives for corporations to implement materials exchange with other corporations. Industrial and political circles began to look into the implementation of [[eco-industrial park]]s  (EIPs). Specifically, the United States worked to put into service several planned EIPs. The U.S President's Council on Sustainable Development in 1996 proposed fifteen eco-industrial parks to pursue the idea of industrial symbiosis. These parks were created by grouping diverse stakeholders with common material flows together, with added governmental incentives to encourage materials exchange. The goal of these planned EIPs was to test if the industrial symbiosis that worked so well in Kalundborg could be replicated. The Council on Sustainable Development also defined 5 major characteristics of a successful EIP to help guide EIP development. These characteristics include: (1) some form of material exchange between multiple separate entities, (2) industries within close proximity to each other, (3) cooperation between plant management of the different corporations, (4) an existing infrastructure for material sharing that does not require much retooling, and (5) "anchor" tenants (large corporation with resources to support early implementation). Devens Regional Enterprise Zone is a good example of a successful EIP in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lowitt, Peter C (2008). "Devens Redevelopment: Emergence of a Successful Eco-Industrial Park in the United States." Journal of Industrial Ecology 12.4: 497-500. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg became an attractive topic in academia as well because of the obvious sustainability advantages of industrial symbiosis. Research conducted on planning and implementation of eco-industrial parks revealed interesting results. Experts argued over the idea of "planned parks" versus "self organized parks". Research showed systematic failure of forced or planned EIPs. Most successful EIPs originate from industrial symbiosis that occurs naturally during industry life, much like the Kalundborg case. This conclusion served to deflate the momentum that the success of Kalundborg generated. Organizations began to recognize the difficulties associated with forcing eco-industrial parks to coalesce and abandoned the idea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">The '''King Hezekiah bulla''' is a 3 mm thick soft [[bulla (seal)|bulla]] (piece of clay with the impression of a seal) measuring 13 x 12 mm (½ in × ½ in). It was found  in an archaeological excavation together with 33 other seals, figurines and ceramics, in an ancient refuse dump adjacent to the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] by Israeli archaeologist [[Eilat Mazar]].

==Description==
The bulla, excavated in 2015, was dated to the reign of Judean king  [[Hezekiah]] between 715 and 686 BCE and bears an inscription in [[Paleo-Hebrew]] script: "Belonging to Hezekiah [son of] Ahaz king of Judah," and a two-winged sun, with wings turned downward, flanked by two ankh symbols symbolizing life.

==Location==
The building in which the bulla was found had been an administrative or royal building that the [[Babylonians]] destroyed when they conquered [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BCE.  According to Mazar, "although seal impressions bearing King Hezekiah's name have already been known from the antiquities market since the middle of the 1990s, some with a winged scarab (dung beetle) symbol and others with a winged sun, this is the first time that a seal impression of an [[Israelite]] or Judean king has ever come to light in a scientific archaeological excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151202132519.htm|title=Impression of King Hezekiah's royal seal discovered in excavations in Jerusalem: First seal impression of an Israelite or Judean king ever exposed in situ in a scientific archaeological excavation|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==King Hezekiah==
It attests that Jerusalem in King Hezekiah's time had  highly developed administrative system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/what-the-hezekiah-seal-proves-jerusalem-status-1.5385544|title=Hezekiah Seal Proves Ancient Jerusalem Was a Major Judahite Capital|last=Fridman|first=Julia|date=2016|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the discovery, [[Christopher Rollston]] of [[George Washington University]] said that the presence of ankh, an Egyptian symbol on a seal was not surprising as Judah had formed alliances with Egypt at various times during its history.

The [[Ophel]] is part of the ancient city of Jerusalem situated immediately south of  Temple Mount, the site of two Jewish temples in antiquity, considered to be the holiest site in [[Judaism]]  and the third holiest site of [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/seal-bearing-name-of-judean-king-found-in-jerusalem/|title=Seal bearing name of Judean king found in Jerusalem|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations at the site,  a collaborative effort by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and [[Hebrew University]] had unearthed some of the earliest artifacts ever found in Jerusalem dating as far back as the 12th and 11th centuries BCE.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

King Hezekiah was one of the most important kings after [[King David]]," said Mazar. The Bible describes Hezekiah as a daring monarch “There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him” ([[2 Kings]] 18:5) - who was dedicated to eliminating idoltary in his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-archaeology-jerusalem/rare-mark-from-biblical-kings-seal-found-in-jerusalem-idUSKBN0TL1AB20151203|title=Rare mark from biblical king's seal found in Jerusalem|last=|first=|date=2015-12-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-02-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kino Border Initiative (KBI)''' since 2008 has united six [[Catholic church|Catholic]] organizations in an effort to be a humanizing presence and to foster bi-national solidarity on the issue of migration on the U.S.-Mexico border through direct assistance and accompaniment, education, research, and advocacy.

==History==
In 2008 and 2009 in [[Nogales, Arizona]], and [[Nogales, Sonora]], Mexico, this work was begun by six organizations: the California Province of the [[Society of Jesus]], [[Jesuit Refugee Service]]/USA, the Missionary Sisters of the Eucharist, the Mexican Province of the Society of Jesus, the [[Diocese of Tucson]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]]. Its purpose is to break down barriers to humane, just, and workable migration, affirming human dignity and solidarity. KBI gives direct assistance and accompanies migrants, educates communities on both sides of the border, and collaborates with networks of research and advocacy to transform policy at all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asucatholic.org/MissionTrip|title=Mission Trip|website=All Saints Catholic Newman Center|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sees its work in continuity with the historic record of the USA in welcoming immigrants, and in support of international standards for the treatment of refugees.

'''Korean sculpture''' has a long history.

==Ancient Sculpture==
Korean sculpture was exported abroad, primarily during the [[Baekje]] period, to [[Japan]], where [[Korean Buddhist sculpture]]s from the seventh century still exist. Main Korean sculptures were generally made of wood, then later stone, and then ceramics, with votive sculptures being the greatest in  number. Smaller sculptures were also made using jade, gold and other metals. The greatest Korean sculptures were produced in the time of [[Korean Buddhist art]].

==Modern Sculpture==
A modern sculpture project that can be mentioned is ''[[Greetingman]]'', by [[Yoo Young-ho]].&lt;!-- Please read the article --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2180">'''Leaf flushing''' is the production of a flush of new leaves typically produced simultaneously on all branches of a bare plant or tree. Leaf flushing succeeds leaf fall, and is delayed by winter in the temperate zone or by extreme dryness in the tropics but leaf fall and leaf flushing in tropical [[deciduous]] forests can overlap, with new leaves produced during the same period when old leaves are shed.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliott|first1=Stephen|last2=Baker|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Borchert|first3=Rolf|title=Leaf flushing during the dry season: the paradox of Asian monsoon forests|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|date=May 2006|volume=15|issue=3|pages=248–257|doi=10.1111/j.1466-822x.2006.00213.x|url=http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/pdfs/ToDelete/Elliott_etal_2006_GlobalEcolBiogeogr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heatwole|first1=Harold|last2=Lowman|first2=Margaret D.|last3=Donovan|first3=Christopher|last4=McCoy|first4=Maria|title=Phenology of leaf-flushing and macroarthropod abundances in canopies of ''Eucalyptus'' saplings|journal=Selbyana|date=1 January 1997|volume=18|issue=2|pages=200–214|jstor=41760435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaf-flushing can be synchronized among trees of a single species or even across species in an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2388052 |jstor=2388052 |title=The Causes and Consequences of Synchronous Flushing in a Dry Tropical Forest |journal=Biotropica |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=193 |year=1984 |last1=Lieberman |first1=Diana |last2=Lieberman |first2=Milton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcoule Nuclear Site''' ({{lang-fr|Site nucléaire de Marcoule}}) is a nuclear facility in the [[Chusclan]] and [[Codolet]] [[Commune of France|commune]]s, near [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in the [[Gard]] [[French Department|department]] of [[France]], which is in the tourist, wine and agricultural [[Côtes-du-Rhône]] region. The plant is around 25&amp;nbsp;km north west of [[Avignon]], on the banks of the [[Rhone]].

Operational since 1956, Marcoule is a gigantic site run by the atomic energy organization [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]] (CEA) and [[Areva NC]] and is known as CEA VALRHO Marcoule. The first industrial and military [[plutonium]] experiments took place in Marcoule. Diversification of the site was started in the 1970s with the creation of the [[Phénix]] prototype [[fast breeder]] reactor, which was operational until 2009, and is nowadays an important site for [[decommissioning nuclear facilities]] activities. {{Asof|2016}} the Phénix reactor may be succeeded by the [[sodium-cooled fast reactor]] [[ASTRID (reactor)|ASTRID]] (Advanced Sodium Technical Reactor for Industrial Demonstration) foreseen to become operational in the 2030s.&lt;ref name=asahi-20160922&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201609220057.html |title=Ministries spar as Japan focuses on fast reactor project in France |newspaper= [[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=22 September 2016 |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1995, the MELOX factory has been producing [[MOX]] from a mix of uranium and plutonium oxides. MOX is used to recycle plutonium from nuclear fuel; this plutonium comes from the [[COGEMA La Hague site]].

The ''ATelier Alpha et Laboratoires pour ANalyses, Transuraniens et Etudes de retraitement'' (ATALANTE) is a CEA laboratory investigating the issues of [[nuclear reprocessing]] of [[nuclear fuel]] and of [[radioactive waste]].

==Reactors==
The site housed a number of the first generation French [[UNGG reactor]]s, all of which have been shut down. Since then, it has also operated two [[heavy water reactor]]s to produce [[tritium]].  Cooling for all of the plants comes from the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] river.

'''Microelectromechanical systems''' ('''MEMS''', also written as ''micro-electro-mechanical'',  ''MicroElectroMechanical'' or ''microelectronic and microelectromechanical systems'' and the related ''micromechatronics'') is the technology of microscopic devices, particularly those with moving parts. It merges at the nano-scale into [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (NEMS) and [[nanotechnology]]. MEMS are also referred to as [[Micromachinery|micromachines]] in Japan, or ''micro systems technology'' (''MST'') in Europe.

MEMS are made up of components between 1 and 100 micrometers in size (i.e., 0.001 to 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm), and MEMS devices generally range in size from 20 micrometres to a millimetre (i.e., 0.02 to 1.0&amp;nbsp;mm), although components arranged in arrays (e.g., [[digital micromirror device]]s) can be more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Small_Machines_Large_Opportunities.html?id=7lKytgAACAAJ|title=Small Machines, Large Opportunities: A Report on the Emerging Field of Microdynamics : Report of the Workshop on Microelectromechanical Systems Research ; Sponsored by the National Science Foundation|last=Kaigham|first=Gabriel|last2=Jarvis|first2=John|last3=Trimmer|first3=William|publisher=AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They usually consist of a central unit that processes data (the microprocessor) and several components that interact with the surroundings such as microsensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste| author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner | title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |place = London |year = 2008 |page = 205 |isbn = 1-84821-009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the large surface area to volume ratio of MEMS, forces produced by ambient [[electromagnetism]] (e.g., electrostatic charges and [[magnetic moment]]s), and fluid dynamics (e.g., [[surface tension]] and [[viscosity]]) are more important design considerations than with larger scale mechanical devices. MEMS technology is distinguished from [[molecular nanotechnology]] or [[molecular electronics]] in that the latter must also consider [[surface chemistry]].

The potential of very small machines was appreciated before the technology existed that could make them (see, for example, [[Richard Feynman]]'s famous 1959 lecture [[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]). MEMS became practical once they could be fabricated using modified [[semiconductor device fabrication]] technologies, normally used to make [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=James B.

==Materials for MEMS manufacturing==
The fabrication of MEMS evolved from the process technology in [[semiconductor device fabrication]], i.e. the basic techniques are [[Deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] of material layers, patterning by [[photolithography]] and etching to produce the required shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=R. Ghodssi |author2=P. Lin | title = MEMS Materials and Processes Handbook | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | place = Berlin | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-387-47316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon===
[[Silicon]] is the material used to create most [[integrated circuit]]s used in consumer electronics in the modern industry.  The [[economies of scale]], ready availability of inexpensive high-quality materials, and ability to incorporate electronic functionality make silicon attractive for a wide variety of MEMS applications.  Silicon also has significant advantages engendered through its material properties.  In single crystal form, silicon is an almost perfect [[Hooke's law|Hookean]] material, meaning that when it is flexed there is virtually no [[hysteresis]] and hence almost no energy dissipation.  As well as making for highly repeatable motion, this also makes silicon very reliable as it suffers very little [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and can have service lifetimes in the range of [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] to [[1000000000000 (number)|trillions]] of cycles without breaking.

===Polymers===
Even though the electronics industry provides an economy of scale for the silicon industry, crystalline silicon is still a complex and relatively expensive material to produce.  Polymers on the other hand can be produced in huge volumes, with a great variety of material characteristics.  MEMS devices can be made from polymers by processes such as [[injection molding]], [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]] or [[stereolithography]] and are especially well suited to [[microfluidic]] applications such as disposable blood testing cartridges.

===Metals===
Metals can also be used to create MEMS elements.  While metals do not have some of the advantages displayed by silicon in terms of mechanical properties, when used within their limitations, metals can exhibit very high degrees of reliability. Metals can be deposited by electroplating, evaporation, and sputtering processes. Commonly used metals include [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[titanium]], [[tungsten]], [[platinum]], and [[silver]].

===Ceramics===
The [[nitride]]s of silicon, aluminium and titanium as well as [[silicon carbide]] and other [[ceramic]]s are increasingly applied in MEMS fabrication due to advantageous combinations of material properties. [[aluminium nitride|AlN]] crystallizes in the [[wurtzite structure]] and thus shows [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]] and [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] properties enabling sensors, for instance, with sensitivity to normal and shear forces.&lt;ref name= PC2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. Polster |author2=M. Hoffmann | title = Aluminium nitride based 3D, piezoelectric, tactile sensors | journal = Proc. Chem. | volume = 1 | pages = 144–7 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.proche.2009.07.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[titanium nitride|TiN]], on the other hand, exhibits a high [[electrical conductivity]] and large [[elastic modulus]], making it possible to implement electrostatic MEMS actuation schemes with ultrathin membranes.&lt;ref name= AdFM2011&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Birkholz |author2=K.-E. Ehwald |author3=P. Kulse |author4=J. Drews |author5=M. Fröhlich |author6=U. Haak |author7=M. Kaynak |author8=E. Matthus |author9=K. Schulz |author10=D.

==MEMS basic processes==

===Deposition processes===
One of the basic building blocks in MEMS processing is the ability to deposit thin films of material with a thickness anywhere between one micrometre, to about 100 micrometres. The NEMS process is the same, although the measurement of film deposition ranges from a few nanometres to one micrometre. There are two types of deposition processes, as follows.

====Physical deposition====
Physical vapor deposition ("PVD") consists of a process in which a material is removed from a target, and deposited on a surface.  Techniques to do this include the process of [[sputtering]], in which an ion beam liberates atoms from a target, allowing them to move through the intervening space and deposit on the desired substrate, and  [[Evaporation (deposition)|evaporation]], in which a material is evaporated from a target using either heat (thermal evaporation) or an electron beam (e-beam evaporation) in a vacuum system.

====Chemical deposition====
Chemical deposition techniques include chemical vapor deposition ("CVD"), in which a stream of source gas reacts on the substrate to grow the material desired.  This can be further divided into categories depending on the details of the technique, for example, [[LPCVD]] (Low Pressure chemical vapor deposition) and PECVD ([[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]]).

Oxide films can also be grown by the technique of [[thermal oxidation]], in which the (typically silicon) wafer is exposed to oxygen and/or steam, to grow a thin surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]].

===Patterning===
Patterning in MEMS is the transfer of a pattern into a material.

====Lithography====
Lithography in MEMS context is typically the transfer of a pattern into a photosensitive material by selective exposure to a radiation source such as light. A photosensitive material is a material that experiences a change in its physical properties when exposed to a radiation source. If a photosensitive material is selectively exposed to radiation (e.g. by masking some of the radiation) the pattern of the radiation on the material is transferred to the material exposed, as the properties of the exposed and unexposed regions differs.

This exposed region can then be removed or treated providing a mask for the underlying substrate.  [[Photolithography]] is typically used with metal or other thin film deposition, wet and dry etching. Sometimes, photolithography is used to create structure without any kind of post etching. One example is SU8 based lens where SU8 based square blocks are generated. Then the photoresist is melted to form a semi-sphere  which acts as a lens.

====Electron beam lithography====
{{Main|Electron beam lithography}}
Electron beam lithography (often abbreviated as e-beam lithography) is the practice of scanning a beam of [[electron]]s in a patterned fashion across a surface covered with a film (called the [[resist]]),&lt;ref name="mccord"&gt;{{cite book |last= McCord |first=M. A. |author2=M. J. Rooks |title=SPIE Handbook of Microlithography, Micromachining and Microfabrication|year=2000 |chapter=2|url=http://www.cnf.cornell.edu/cnf_spietoc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("exposing" the resist) and of selectively removing either exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist ("developing"). The purpose, as with [[photolithography]], is to create very small structures in the resist that can subsequently be transferred to the substrate material, often by etching. It was developed for manufacturing [[integrated circuit]]s, and is also used for creating [[nanotechnology]] architectures.

The primary advantage of electron beam lithography is that it is one of the ways to beat the [[diffraction limit]] of light and make features in the [[nanometer]] range.  This form of [[maskless lithography]] has found wide usage in [[photomask]]-making used in [[photolithography]], low-volume production of semiconductor components, and research &amp; development.

The key limitation of electron beam lithography is throughput, i.e., the very long time it takes to expose an entire silicon wafer or glass substrate. A long exposure time leaves the user vulnerable to beam drift or instability which may occur during the exposure. Also, the turn-around time for reworking or re-design is lengthened unnecessarily if the pattern is not being changed the second time.

====Ion beam lithography====
It is known that focused-[[ion beam lithography]] has the capability of writing extremely fine lines (less than 50&amp;nbsp;nm line and space has been achieved) without proximity effect.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, because the writing field in ion-beam lithography is quite small, large area patterns must be created by stitching together the small fields.

====Ion track technology====
[[Ion track technology]] is a deep cutting tool with a resolution limit around 8&amp;nbsp;nm applicable to radiation resistant minerals, glasses and polymers. It is capable of generating holes in thin films without any development process. Structural depth can be defined either by ion range or by material thickness. Aspect ratios up to several 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; can be reached. The technique can shape and texture materials at a defined inclination angle. Random pattern, single-ion track structures and aimed pattern consisting of individual single tracks can be generated.

====X-ray lithography====
[[X-ray lithography]] is a process used in electronic industry to selectively remove parts of a thin film. It uses X-rays to transfer a geometric pattern from a mask to a light-sensitive chemical photoresist, or simply "resist", on the substrate. A series of chemical treatments then engraves the produced pattern into the material underneath the photoresist.

====Diamond patterning====
A simple way to carve or create  patterns on the surface of nanodiamonds without damaging them could lead to a new photonic devices.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Diamond patterning is a method of forming diamond MEMS.  It is achieved by the lithographic application of diamond films to a substrate such as silicon.  The patterns can be formed by selective deposition through a silicon dioxide mask, or by deposition followed by micromachining or focused [[Ion milling machine|ion beam milling]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc J. Madou, ''Fundamentals of Microfabrication and Nanotechnology, Volume III: From MEMS to Bio-MEMS and Bio-NEMS: Manufacturing Techniques and Applications'', p. 252, CRC Press, 2011 {{ISBN|1439895244}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etching processes===
There are two basic categories of etching processes: [[Etching (microfabrication)|wet etching]] and [[dry etching]].  In the former, the material is dissolved when immersed in a chemical solution.  In the latter, the material is sputtered or dissolved using reactive ions or a vapor phase etchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/84.546406|title=Etch rates for micromachining processing|year=1996|last1=Williams|first1=K.R.|last2=Muller|first2=R.S.|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems|volume=5|page=256|issue=4|url=http://www-inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~ee245/fa07/lectures/WetEtchRates.WilliamsMuller.00546406.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bulk"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/5.704259|title=Bulk micromachining of silicon|year=1998|last1=Kovacs|first1=G.T.A.|last2=Maluf|first2=N.I.|last3=Petersen|first3=K.E.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=86|page=1536|issue=8|url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/class/enee416.S2004/Bulk-Micromachining.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wet etching====
{{Main|Etching (microfabrication)}}
Wet chemical etching consists in selective removal of material by dipping a substrate into a solution that dissolves it. The chemical nature of this etching process provides a good selectivity, which means the etching rate of the target material is considerably higher than the mask material if selected carefully.

=====Isotropic etching=====
Etching progresses at the same speed in all directions. Long and narrow holes in a mask will produce v-shaped grooves in the silicon.  The surface of these grooves can be atomically smooth if the etch is carried out correctly, with dimensions and angles being extremely accurate.

=====Anisotropic etching=====
Some single crystal materials, such as silicon, will have different etching rates depending on the crystallographic orientation of the substrate. This is known as anisotropic etching and one of the most common examples is the etching of silicon in KOH (potassium hydroxide), where Si &lt;111&gt; planes etch approximately 100 times slower than other planes ([[crystallography|crystallographic orientations]]). Therefore, etching a rectangular hole in a (100)-Si wafer results in a pyramid shaped etch pit with 54.7° walls, instead of a hole with curved sidewalls as with isotropic etching.

=====HF etching=====
[[Hydrofluoric acid]] is commonly used as an aqueous etchant for silicon dioxide ({{chem|SiO|2}}, also known as BOX for SOI), usually in 49% concentrated form, 5:1, 10:1 or 20:1 BOE ([[buffered oxide etch]]ant) or BHF (Buffered HF). They were first used in medieval times for glass etching. It was used in IC fabrication for patterning the gate oxide until the process step was replaced by RIE.

Hydrofluoric acid is considered one of the more dangerous acids in the [[cleanroom]]. It penetrates the skin upon contact and it diffuses straight to the bone. Therefore, the damage is not felt until it is too late.

=====Electrochemical etching=====
Electrochemical etching (ECE) for dopant-selective removal of silicon is a common method to automate and to selectively control etching.  An active p-n [[diode]] junction is required, and either type of dopant can be the etch-resistant ("etch-stop") material.  Boron is the most common etch-stop dopant.  In combination with wet anisotropic etching as described above, ECE has been used successfully for controlling silicon diaphragm thickness in commercial piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors.  Selectively doped regions can be created either by implantation, diffusion, or epitaxial deposition of silicon.

====Dry etching====
{{Main|Dry etching}}
=====Vapor etching=====

======Xenon difluoride======
[[Xenon difluoride]] ({{chem|XeF|2}}) is a dry vapor phase isotropic etch for silicon originally applied for MEMS in 1995 at University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.220933|title=Gas-phase silicon micromachining with xenon difluoride|year=1995|last1=Chang|first1=Floy I.|page=117|volume=2641|chapter=Gas-phase silicon micromachining with xenon difluoride|series=Microelectronic Structures and Microelectromechanical Devices for Optical Processing and Multimedia Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=M.S. |title=Xenon difluoride etching of silicon for MEMS |last=Chang |first=Floy I-Jung |year=1995 |publisher=University of California |location=Los Angeles |oclc=34531873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily used for releasing metal and dielectric structures by undercutting silicon, {{chem|XeF|2}} has the advantage of a [[stiction]]-free release unlike wet etchants.  Its etch selectivity to silicon is very high, allowing it to work with photoresist, {{chem|SiO|2}}, silicon nitride, and various metals for masking.  Its reaction to silicon is "plasmaless", is purely chemical and spontaneous and is often operated in pulsed mode.  Models of the etching action are available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290690|year=2004|last1=Brazzle|first1=J.D.|last2=Dokmeci|title=17th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems. Maastricht MEMS 2004 Technical Digest|first2=M.R.|last3=Mastrangelo|first3=C.H.|page=737|chapter=Modeling and characterization of sacrificial polysilicon etching using vapor-phase xenon difluoride|isbn=0-7803-8265-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and university laboratories and various commercial tools offer solutions using this approach.

=====Plasma etching=====
Modern VLSI processes avoid wet etching, and use [[plasma etching]] instead. Plasma etchers can operate in several modes by adjusting the parameters of the plasma. Ordinary plasma etching operates between 0.1 and 5 Torr. (This unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 pascals.) The plasma produces energetic free radicals, neutrally charged, that react at the surface of the wafer. Since neutral particles attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic.

Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching.

The source gas for the plasma usually contains small molecules rich in chlorine or fluorine. For instance, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) etches silicon and aluminium, and trifluoromethane etches silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. A plasma containing oxygen is used to oxidize ("ash") photoresist and facilitate its removal.

Ion milling, or sputter etching, uses lower pressures, often as low as 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with energetic ions of noble gases, often Ar+, which knock atoms from the substrate by transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity. Reactive-ion etching (RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching (between 10–3 and 10−1 Torr). Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features.

======Sputtering======
{{Main|Sputtering}}

======Reactive ion etching (RIE)======
{{Main|Reactive-ion etching}}
In reactive-ion etching (RIE), the substrate is placed inside a reactor, and several gases are introduced. A plasma is struck in the gas mixture using an RF power source, which breaks the gas molecules into ions. The ions accelerate towards, and react with, the surface of the material being etched, forming another gaseous material. This is known as the chemical part of reactive ion etching. There is also a physical part, which is similar to the sputtering deposition process. If the ions have high enough energy, they can knock atoms out of the material to be etched without a chemical reaction. It is a very complex task to develop dry etch processes that balance chemical and physical etching, since there are many parameters to adjust. By changing the balance it is possible to influence the anisotropy of the etching, since the chemical part is isotropic and the physical part highly anisotropic the combination can form sidewalls that have shapes from rounded to vertical.
{{Main|Deep reactive ion etching}}

Deep RIE (DRIE) is a special subclass of RIE that is growing in popularity. In this process, etch depths of hundreds of micrometres are achieved with almost vertical sidewalls. The primary technology is based on the so-called "Bosch process",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/SENSOR.2005.1497272|year=2005|last1=Laermer|first1=F.|last2=Urban|title=The 13th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems, 2005. Digest of Technical Papers. TRANSDUCERS '05|first2=A.|page=1118|volume=2|chapter=Milestones in deep reactive ion etching|isbn=0-7803-8994-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after the German company Robert Bosch, which filed the original patent, where two different gas compositions alternate in the reactor. Currently there are two variations of the DRIE. The first variation consists of three distinct steps (the original Bosch process) while the second variation only consists of two steps.

In the first variation, the etch cycle is as follows:

(i) {{chem|SF|6}} isotropic etch;&lt;br /&gt;
(ii) {{chem|C|4|F|8}} passivation;&lt;br /&gt;
(iii) {{chem|SF|6}} anisoptropic etch for floor cleaning.

In the 2nd variation, steps (i) and (iii) are combined.

Both variations operate similarly.  The {{chem|C|4|F|8}} creates a polymer on the surface of the substrate, and the second gas composition ({{chem|SF|6}} and {{chem|O|2}}) etches the substrate. The polymer is immediately sputtered away by the physical part of the etching, but only on the horizontal surfaces and not the sidewalls. Since the polymer only dissolves very slowly in the chemical part of the etching, it builds up on the sidewalls and protects them from etching. As a result, etching aspect ratios of 50 to 1 can be achieved. The process can easily be used to etch completely through a silicon substrate, and etch rates are 3–6 times higher than wet etching.

===Die preparation===
After preparing a large number of MEMS devices on a [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]], individual [[die (integrated circuit)|dies]] have to be separated, which is called [[die preparation]] in semiconductor technology. For some applications, the separation is preceded by [[wafer backgrinding]] in order to reduce the wafer thickness. [[Wafer dicing]] may then be performed either by sawing using a cooling liquid or a dry laser process called [[wafer dicing#Stealth dicing|stealth dicing]].

==MEMS manufacturing technologies==

===Bulk micromachining===
{{Main|Bulk micromachining}}
Bulk micromachining is the oldest paradigm of silicon based MEMS. The whole thickness of a silicon wafer is used for building the micro-mechanical structures.&lt;ref name="bulk"/&gt; Silicon is machined using various [[#Etching processes|etching processes]]. [[Anodic bonding]] of glass plates or additional silicon wafers is used for adding features in the third dimension and for hermetic encapsulation. Bulk micromachining has been essential in enabling high performance [[pressure sensor]]s and [[accelerometer]]s that changed the sensor industry in the 1980s and 90's.

===Surface micromachining===
{{Main|Surface micromachining}}
Surface micromachining uses layers deposited on the surface of a substrate as the structural materials, rather than using the substrate itself.&lt;ref name="surface"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bustillo | first1 = J. M.| last2 = Howe | first2 = R. T.| last3 = Muller | first3 = R. S.| doi = 10.1109/5.704260 | title = Surface Micromachining for Microelectromechanical Systems | journal = [[Proceedings of the IEEE]]| url = http://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/sclu/surface_micromachining.pdf| volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1552–1574| date=August 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.120.4059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface micromachining was created in the late 1980s to render micromachining of silicon more compatible with planar integrated circuit technology, with the goal of combining MEMS and [[integrated circuit]]s on the same silicon wafer. The original surface micromachining concept was based on thin polycrystalline silicon layers patterned as movable mechanical structures and released by sacrificial etching of the underlying oxide layer. Interdigital comb electrodes were used to produce in-plane forces and to detect in-plane movement capacitively. This MEMS paradigm has enabled the manufacturing of low cost [[accelerometer]]s for e.g. automotive air-bag systems and other applications where low performance and/or high g-ranges are sufficient. [[Analog Devices]] has pioneered the industrialization of surface micromachining and has realized the co-integration of MEMS and integrated circuits.

===High aspect ratio (HAR) silicon micromachining===
Both bulk and surface silicon micromachining are used in the industrial production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, [[deep reactive-ion etching]], has made it possible to combine good performance typical of [[bulk micromachining]] with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of [[surface micromachining]]. While it is common in surface micromachining to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2&amp;nbsp;µm, in HAR silicon micromachining the thickness can be from 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;µm. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon micromachining are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures. Integrated circuits are typically not combined with HAR silicon micromachining.

==Industry structure==
The global market for micro-electromechanical systems, which includes products such as automobile airbag systems, display systems and inkjet cartridges totaled $40 billion in 2006 according to Global MEMS/Microsystems Markets and Opportunities, a research report from [[SEMI]] and Yole Developpement and is forecasted to reach $72 billion by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=4479 Worldwide MEMS Systems Market Forecasted to Reach $72 Billion by 2011].

Companies with strong MEMS programs come in many sizes. Larger firms specialize in manufacturing high volume inexpensive components or packaged solutions for end markets such as automobiles, biomedical, and electronics.  Smaller firms provide value in innovative solutions and absorb the expense of custom fabrication with high sales margins. Both large and small companies typically invest in [[R&amp;D]] to explore new MEMS technology.

The market for materials and equipment used to manufacture MEMS devices topped $1 billion worldwide in 2006. Materials demand is driven by substrates, making up over 70 percent of the market, packaging coatings and increasing use of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). While MEMS manufacturing continues to be dominated by used semiconductor equipment, there is a migration to 200&amp;nbsp;mm lines and select new tools, including etch and bonding for certain MEMS applications.

'''Mimesis criticism''' is a method of interpreting texts in relation to their literary or cultural models. Mimesis, or '''imitation''' (''imitatio''), was a widely used rhetorical tool in antiquity up until the 18th century's [[Romanticism|romantic]] emphasis on originality. Mimesis criticism looks to identify [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] relationships between two texts that go beyond simple echoes, [[allusion]]s, [[citation]]s, or [[redaction]]s. The effects of imitation are usually manifested in the later text by means of distinct [[characterization]], [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and/or [[plot (narrative)|plot]] structure.

As a critical method, '''mimesis criticism''' has been pioneered by [[Dennis MacDonald]], especially in relation to [[New Testament]] and other early Christian narratives imitating the "canonical" works of [[Classics|Classical]] Greek literature.

==History==

===Aristotle===
Greek rhetorician [[Aristotle]] (4th century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}) discusses the rhetorical technique of mimesis or imitation; what Aristotle describes, however, is the author's imitation of nature, not earlier literary or cultural models.

===Philodemus===
[[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]] (1st century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}), an [[Epicurean]] philosopher and poet and one of [[Virgil]]'s teachers, affirms that writers of prose histories and fictions used literary models. He writes (rhetorically) in book five of ''On Poetry'', "Who would claim that the writing of prose is not reliant on the Homeric poems?" (5.30.36-31.)

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
A Greek historian and rhetorician from the late first century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}/early first century {{smallcaps|c.e.}}, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] represents a change from the Aristotelian rhetorical notion of [[mimesis]], from imitation of nature to imitation of literature. His most important work in this respect, ''[[Dionysian imitatio|On Mimesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ μιμήσεως}}, ''Perì mimēseōs''), survives only in fragments. Apparently, most of this work concerned the proper selection of literary models.

===Quintilian===
Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian|M. Fabius Quintilianus]] published his twelve-volume [[Institutio Oratoria|''Institutio oratoria'']] around 95 {{smallcaps|c.e}}. In book 10, Quintilian - who was well-read with respect to both Greek and Latin rhetoricians, including [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] - gives advice to teachers who are instructing students in oration. He tells them that, by the time students begin composition, they should be so well-versed in exemplary models that are able to imitate them without physically consulting them (10.1.5). Quintilian writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;For in everything which we teach examples are more effective even than the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the assistance of a teacher, and can rely on his own powers to imitate them. (10.1.15; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also advises that students constantly reread the exemplary models (10.1.19), not only in sections but all the way through (10.1.20), so that they might be empowered to imitate these models with more craft and subtlety.

Of course, the selection of one's literary model is of the utmost importance. In Quintilian's opinion, one could find no better model than Homer, "for he has given us a model and an inspiration for very department of eloquence" (10.1.46; Butler, LCL). When it comes to the act of imitation itself, he writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no doubt that in art no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since, although invention came first and is all-important, it is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented with success. And it is a universal rule of life that we should wish to copy what we approve in others. It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of letters that they may learn to write, and that musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters the works of their predecessors, and peasants the principles of agriculture which have been proved in practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we may note that the elementary study of every branch of learning is directed by reference to some definite standard that is placed before the learner. (10.2.1-2; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, students are encouraged to ''improve'' upon their chosen models (10.2.12). One way for students to accomplish this task, Quintilian says, is to imitate several models in eclectic fashion: "We shall do well to keep a number of different excellences before our eyes, so that different qualities from different authors may impose themselves on our minds, to be adopted for use in the place that becomes them best" (10.2.26; Butler, LCL). On this point, Quintilian was at odds with Cicero, who felt it best for authors to imitate a single author.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knowles Ruthven, ''Critical Assumptions'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1979), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
In order to circumvent the capriciousness of subjectivity, [[Dennis MacDonald|MacDonald]] suggests six criteria for determining whether a claim for a mimetic connection between texts is reasonable: accessibility, analogy, density, order, distinctive traits, and interpretability. The first two criteria concern the status of the text used as a model ("ante-text"); the final four concern the later text that may have used the antetext.

*'''Accessibility''': One must demonstrate that the author of the later text would have been reasonably able to access a copy of the text being imitated. Was the antetext well known or obscure at the time of the later text's composition?
*'''Analogy''': If one text is discovered to imitate a certain antetext, it is probable that other texts have also done so. Are there examples of other authors using this antetext as a literary model?
*'''Density''': The greater number of parallels one can induce between the two texts, the stronger one's case will be for a mimetic relationship between them.
*'''Order''': The more frequently the parallels between the two texts follow the same order, the less likely it becomes that the parallels are just coincidental.
*'''Distinctive Traits''': If there are parallels between two texts, but none of the parallels are anything but one would expect in their respective contexts, then it becomes difficult to argue for a mimetic connection. Especially helpful are [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequiturs]] or other unusual elements present in the later text which parallel the proposed model. It is also typical for authors to use significant names to alert the reader to the textual interplay.
*'''Interpretability''': A common motivation for imitating an earlier text is to rival that text, whether philosophically, theologically, politically, or otherwise. If one can determine such a motivation in a compelling fashion, then there is a stronger case for imitation.

==Mimesis in Early Christianity==

===New Testament===
Two examples of imitation within the New Testament will be outlined. The first pertains to Luke's use of 1 Kings 17 as a literary model. The second outlines Luke's imitation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' 10-12 in Acts 20.&lt;ref&gt;These examples come from MacDonald and can be found in his various publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

One can justifiably argue that Luke used 1 Kings 17:9-24 as a model for Luke 7:11-16 because it meets the criteria of '''mimesis criticism'''. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Luke cites this very story in Luke 4:25-26. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Mark provides an analogous imitation of 1 Kings 17 with his story about the raising of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:35-43). '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be identified in the above table. The most important aspect for '''criterion 5''' is the identical Greek wording for "And he gave him to his mother." '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke improves upon his model in the following ways. In 1 Kings, the widow initiates the miracle by castigating Elijah for causing her son's death; in Luke, Jesus is the one to initiate the miracle. In 1 Kings, Elijah then reproaches God, asking if God has "brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son" (17:20); in Luke, Jesus does not blame God for the boy's death but instead has compassion for her. In 1 Kings, it is the {{smallcaps|Lord}} who raises the boy, not Elijah; in Luke, it is Jesus himself. In 1 Kings, only the widow responds to the miracle; in Luke, a "large crowd" responds positively.

In the same way, one can justifiably argue that Luke has used the story of Elpenor from ''Odyssey'' 10-12 as a model for his account of Eutychus in Acts 20:5-12 using the criteria. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Books 10-12 of ''Odyssey'' were among the most popular in antiquity. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Among the many imitations of these books in antiquity, Virgil's ''Aeneid'' contains two, the stories about Palinurus and Misenus. '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be seen to be met by referring to the above table. Of particular significance is Luke's name choice: Homer often called Elpenor "unlucky" (''Odyssey'' 11.61, 76, 80); Luke's Eutychus literally means "good fortune." Furthermore, the raising of Luke's Eutychus occurs in the Troad, the cite of the Trojan War. '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke emulates Homer in the following ways. Elpenor fell to his death because he was in a drunken stupor; Eutychus appeared to die after falling asleep (out a window) while listening to Paul preach deep into the night. Odysseus was unaware of Elpenor's misfortune; Paul knew immediately about Eutychus' fall and also that "his soul [was] still in him." Later in Homer's story, Elpenor's body was buried at dawn; at dawn, the other believers lifted up Eutychus alive.

In addition to imitating the [[Septuagint]] and Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', MacDonald proposes that Mark's Gospel and Luke-Acts used the following literary models: Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', several [[Homeric hymns|''Homeric Hymns'']], [[Euripides]]' [[The Bacchae|''Bacchae'']] and [[Herakles (Euripides)|''Madness of Heracles'']], and dialogues by [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] about [[Socrates]].

===Christian Apocrypha===
In his seminal work ''Christianizing Homer:'' The Odyssey'', Plato, and'' The Acts of Andrew, MacDonald argues that the second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work, the [[Acts of Andrew]], was a Christian version of Homer's [[Iliad]]. Elsewhere, MacDonald has also argued for the presence of Homeric imitations in the [[Acts of Peter]], another second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work.

==Controversy==

===Scholarly Opposition===
Karl Olav Sandnes, the most vocal of MacDonald's critics, objects that MacDonald's "reading of both Mark's Gospel and Acts assumes a readership with an in-depth as well as extensive familiarity with the Homeric epics. This implies that the curriculum of encyclical studies had penetrated into the Christian movement to an extent which the present study has not confirmed. Ancient education was designed for the upper strata of the population."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, ''The Challenge of Homer: School, Pagan Poets, and Early Christianity'' (Library of New Testament Studies; T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2009), 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Sandnes argues deductively: Since such familiarity with Homer was limited to the upper stratum of society, and since the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts (nor their audiences) are not believed to belong to this stratum, then the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts simply ''could not'' have imitated Homer in the way MacDonald suggests.

MacDonald's response has been threefold. First, a more sure decision about the education of the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts would result from an [[Inductive reasoning|''inductive'']] approach to the question, rather than Sandnes' [[Deductive reasoning|''deductive'']] approach. Second, access to Homer was ''not'' restricted to the cultural elite. According to a first-century {{smallcaps|ce}} writer, "From the earliest age, children beginning their studies are nursed on Homer's teaching. One might say that while we were still in swathing bands we sucked from his epics as from fresh milk. He assists the beginner and later the adult in his prime. In no stage of life, from boyhood to old age, do we ever cease to drink from him."&lt;ref&gt;Ps.-Heraclitus, ''Quaest. Hom.'' 1.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, MacDonald notes that Sandnes does not offer any other explanation for the parallels between the New Testament writings and Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, ''Homer, Vergil, and the New Testament'' (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret M. Mitchell]] has also published a critical response to MacDonald's work on Homeric imitation within the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. Mitchell, "Homer in the New Testament?" ''The Journal of Religion'' 83 (2003): 244-60.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald addresses Mitchell's critiques, as well as earlier criticism from Sandnes,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, "''Imitatio Homeri''? An Appraisal of Dennis R. MacDonald's 'Mimesis Criticism,'" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 124 (2005): 715-32.&lt;/ref&gt; in an article titled, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism.'"&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism,'" (Occasional Papers of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity 53; The Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for Historicity of Jesus===
MacDonald's arguments for the mimetic nature of the Gospel narratives have influenced how some view the question of the [[historicity of Jesus]]. Some have taken the extremist position that all of the Gospel narratives are exclusively the byproduct of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists']] literary imagination, influenced by [[Homer]] and the [[Septuagint|Septuagintal narratives]], and not historical memory. Perhaps this is due to a misunderstanding of MacDonald's claim that the Gospel of [[Gospel of mark|Mark]] was an "intentional fiction." MacDonald believes that such a stance is taking matters too far, although he himself holds to a minimalist view of the [[Historical Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. MacDonald, "My Turn," 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is usually generated in non-academic circles, such as [[YouTube]] [[Vlogs|video blogs]].&lt;ref&gt;One such prolific video blogger on YouTube, with the username [https://www.youtube.com/user/TruthSurge TruthSurge], has posted a number of vlogs on this topic. Particularly relevant are the videos titled, "Excavating the Empty Tomb (beyond a reasonable doubt)," parts 4-9b.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molecular biology''' {{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|k|j|ʊ|l|ər}} is a branch of [[biology]] that concerns the [[molecule|molecular]] basis of biological activity between [[biomolecule]]s in the various systems of a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], including the interactions between [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[protein]]s and their [[protein biosynthesis|biosynthesis]], as well as the regulation of these interactions.&lt;ref name=cell2/&gt; Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1961, [[William Astbury]] described molecular biology as:

{{quote|...not so much a technique as an approach, an approach from the viewpoint of the so-called basic sciences with the leading idea of searching below the large-scale manifestations of classical biology for the corresponding molecular plan. It is concerned particularly with the ''forms'' of biological molecules and [...] is predominantly three-dimensional and structural—which does not mean, however, that it is merely a refinement of morphology. It must at the same time inquire into genesis and function.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;

==Relationship to other biological sciences==
[[File:Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology.svg|thumb|Schematic relationship between [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]] and molecular biology]]

Researchers in molecular biology use specific techniques native to molecular biology but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]].  There is not a defined line between these disciplines. The figure to the right is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationships between the fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=Harvey Lodish ... [et|last2=Berk |first2=Arnold |last3=Zipursky |first3=S. Lawrence|last4=Matsudaira|first4=Paul|last5=Baltimore |first5=David |last6=Darnell |first6=James |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=Scientific American Books |location=New York |isbn=0716731363 |edition=4th |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21475/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Biochemistry''''' is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in live [[organism]]s. [[Biochemist]]s focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of [[biomolecule]]s. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are examples of [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berg|first1=Jeremy M.|last2=Tymoczko|first2=John L.|last3=Stryer |first3=Lubert |last4=Berg|first4=Jeremy M. |last5=Tymoczko|first5=John L.|last6=Stryer |first6=Lubert|title=Biochemistry|publisher=W H Freeman |isbn=0716730510 |edition=5th |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21154/}}chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Genetics''''' is the study of the effect of genetic differences in organisms. This can often be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g. one [[gene]]). The study of "[[mutant]]s" &amp;ndash; organisms which lack one or more functional components with respect to the so-called "[[wild type]]" or normal [[phenotype]]. Genetic interactions ([[epistasis]]) can often confound simple interpretations of such "[[knockout]]" studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reference|first1=Genetics Home|title=Help Me Understand Genetics|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer|website=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Molecular biology''''' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the processes of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]], and cell function.  The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into [[protein]], despite being oversimplified, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. The picture has been revised in light of emerging novel roles for [[RNA]].&lt;ref name="cell2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis |first3=Julian|last4=Morgan|first4=David |last5=Raff |first5=Martin |last6=Roberts |first6=Keith |last7=Walter|first7=Peter |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=9781317563754 |pages=1–10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jK6UBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of molecular biology is quantitative, and recently much work has been done at its interface with computer science in [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. In the early 2000s, the study of gene structure and function, [[molecular genetics]], has been among the most prominent sub-fields of molecular biology. Increasingly many other areas of biology focus on molecules, either directly studying interactions in their own right such as in [[cell biology]] and [[developmental biology]], or indirectly, where molecular techniques are used to infer historical attributes of [[population]]s or [[species]], as in fields in [[evolutionary biology]] such as [[population genetics]] and [[phylogenetics]]. There is also a long tradition of studying [[biomolecule]]s "from the ground up" in [[biophysics]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Techniques of molecular biology==
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|left|DNA animation]]
{{about||more extensive list on protein methods|protein methods|more extensive list on nucleic acid methods|nucleic acid methods}}

===Molecular cloning===
{{main article|Molecular cloning}}
[[File:Transduction image.pdf|thumb|Transduction image]]
One of the most basic techniques of molecular biology to study protein function is [[molecular cloning]]. In this technique, DNA coding for a protein of interest is [[clone (genetics)|clone]]d using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), and/or [[restriction enzyme]]s into a [[plasmid]] ([[expression vector]]). A vector has 3 distinctive features: an origin of replication, a [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS), and a selective marker usually [[antibiotic resistance]]. Located upstream of the multiple cloning site are the [[promoter region]]s and the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] start site which regulate the expression of cloned gene.
This plasmid can be inserted into either bacterial or animal cells. Introducing DNA into bacterial cells can be done by [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] via uptake of naked DNA, [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] via cell-cell contact or by [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] via viral vector. Introducing DNA into [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, such as animal cells, by physical or chemical means is called [[transfection]]. Several different transfection techniques are available, such as calcium phosphate transfection, [[electroporation]], [[microinjection]] and [[liposome transfection]]. The plasmid may be integrated into the [[genome]], resulting in a stable transfection, or may remain independent of the genome, called transient transfection.&lt;ref name="cell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter|title=Isolating, Cloning, and Sequencing DNA|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26837/|accessdate=31 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lessard|first1=Juliane C.|title=Molecular cloning|journal=Methods in Enzymology|date=1 January 2013|volume=529|pages=85–98|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-418687-3.00007-0|pmid=24011038|issn=1557-7988}}subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA coding for a protein of interest is now inside a cell, and the [[protein]] can now be expressed. A variety of systems, such as inducible promoters and specific cell-signaling factors, are available to help express the protein of interest at high levels. Large quantities of a protein can then be extracted from the bacterial or eukaryotic cell. The protein can be tested for enzymatic activity under a variety of situations, the protein may be crystallized so its [[tertiary structure]] can be studied, or, in the pharmaceutical industry, the activity of new drugs against the protein can be studied.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Polymerase chain reaction===
{{main article|Polymerase chain reaction}}

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is an extremely versatile technique for copying DNA. In brief, PCR allows a specific DNA sequence to be copied or modified in predetermined ways. The reaction is extremely powerful and under perfect conditions could amplify one DNA molecule to become 1.07 billion molecules in less than two hours. The PCR technique can be used to introduce restriction enzyme sites to ends of DNA molecules, or to mutate particular bases of DNA, the latter is a method referred to as [[site-directed mutagenesis]]. PCR can also be used to determine whether a particular DNA fragment is found in a [[cDNA]] [[library (biology)|library]]. PCR has many variations, like reverse transcription PCR ([[RT-PCR]]) for amplification of RNA, and, more recently, [[quantitative PCR]] which allow for quantitative measurement of DNA or RNA molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe/docs/techpcr/|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Fact Sheet|url=https://www.genome.gov/10000207/polymerase-chain-reaction-pcr-fact-sheet/|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gel electrophoresis===
{{main article|Gel electrophoresis}}
[[File:Two percent Agarose Gel in Borate Buffer cast in a Gel Tray (Front, angled).jpg|thumb|Two percent Agarose Gel in Borate Buffer cast in a Gel Tray (Front, angled)]]
Gel electrophoresis is one of the principal tools of molecular biology. The basic principle is that DNA, RNA, and proteins can all be separated by means of an electric field and size. In [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], DNA and RNA can be separated on the basis of size by running the DNA through an electrically charged agarose gel. Proteins can be separated on the basis of size by using an [[SDS-PAGE]] gel, or on the basis of size and their [[electric charge]] by using what is known as a [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2D gel electrophoresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Pei Yun|last2=Costumbrado|first2=John|last3=Hsu|first3=Chih-Yuan|last4=Kim|first4=Yong Hoon|title=Agarose Gel Electrophoresis for the Separation of DNA Fragments|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|date=20 April 2012|issue=62|doi=10.3791/3923|pmc=4846332|issn=1940-087X|pmid=22546956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macromolecule blotting and probing===
The terms ''northern'', ''western'' and ''eastern'' blotting are derived from what initially was a molecular biology joke that played on the term ''[[Southern blot]]ting'', after the technique described by [[Edwin Southern]] for the hybridisation of blotted DNA. Patricia Thomas, developer of the RNA blot which then became known as the ''northern blot'', actually didn't use the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| quotes = | last = Thomas| first = P.S.| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1980| month = | title = Hybridization of denatured RNA and small DNA fragments transferred to nitrocellulose| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]| volume = 77| issue = 9| pages = 5201–5| publisher = | location = | issn = 1091-6490| pmid = 6159641| pmc = 350025| doi = 10.1073/pnas.77.9.5201| bibcode =1980PNAS...77.5201T | oclc =| id = | language = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southern blotting====
{{main article|Southern blot}}

Named after its inventor, biologist [[Edwin Southern]], the [[Southern blot]] is a method for probing for the presence of a specific DNA sequence within a DNA sample. DNA samples before or after [[restriction enzyme]] (restriction endonuclease) digestion are separated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a membrane by blotting via [[capillary action]]. The membrane is then exposed to a labeled DNA probe that has a complement base sequence to the sequence on the DNA of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=T.|title=Southern blotting|journal=Current Protocols in Immunology|date=1 May 2001|volume=Chapter 10|pages=Unit 10.6A|doi=10.1002/0471142735.im1006as06|pmid=18432697|issn=1934-368X}}subscription required&lt;/ref&gt; Southern blotting is less commonly used in laboratory science due to the capacity of other techniques, such as [[PCR]], to detect specific DNA sequences from DNA samples. These blots are still used for some applications, however, such as measuring [[transgene]] copy number in [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic mice]] or in the engineering of [[gene knockout]] [[Stem cell line|embryonic stem cell lines]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[northern blot]] is used to study the expression patterns of a specific type of RNA molecule as relative comparison among a set of different samples of RNA.  It is essentially a combination of [[denaturing gel|denaturing RNA gel electrophoresis]], and a [[blot (biology)|blot]].  In this process RNA is separated based on size and is then transferred to a membrane that is then probed with a labeled [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complement]] of a sequence of interest. The results may be visualized through a variety of ways depending on the label used; however, most result in the revelation of bands representing the sizes of the RNA detected in sample.  The intensity of these bands is related to the amount of the target RNA in the samples analyzed.  The procedure is commonly used to study when and how much gene expression is occurring by measuring how much of that RNA is present in different samples.  It is one of the most basic tools for determining at what time, and under what conditions, certain genes are expressed in living tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|first1=edited by Henrik|last2=Nielsen|first2=Henrik|title=RNA methods and protocols|date=2011|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-59745-248-9|pages=87–105|pmid=21125485}}subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=Shan L.|title=Northern blot|pmc=4287216|journal=Methods in Enzymology|volume=530|pages=75–87|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-420037-1.00003-8|date=1 January 2013|pmid=24034315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western blotting====
{{main article|Western blot}}
In [[western blot]]ting, proteins are first separated by size, in a thin gel sandwiched between two glass plates in a technique known as [[SDS-PAGE]]. The proteins in the gel are then transferred to a [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF), nitrocellulose, nylon, or other support membrane. This membrane can then be probed with solutions of [[antibody|antibodies]]. Antibodies that specifically bind to the protein of interest can then be visualized by a variety of techniques, including colored products, [[chemiluminescence]], or [[autoradiography]]. Often, the antibodies are labeled with enzymes. When a [[chemiluminescent]] [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] is exposed to the [[enzyme]] it allows detection. Using western blotting techniques allows not only detection but also quantitative analysis. Analogous methods to western blotting can be used to directly stain specific proteins in live [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[biological tissue|tissue]] sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahmood|first=Tahrin|last2=Yang|first2=Ping-Chang|date=2016-12-31|title=Western Blot: Technique, Theory, and Trouble Shooting|journal=North American Journal of Medical Sciences|volume=4|issue=9|pages=429–434|doi=10.4103/1947-2714.100998|issn=2250-1541|pmc=3456489|pmid=23050259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurien|first1=Biji T.|last2=Scofield|first2=R.

===Microarrays===
{{main article|DNA microarray}}
[[Image:Microarray printing.ogv|thumb|200px|left|A DNA microarray being printed]]
[[File:NA hybrid.svg|thumb|Hybridization of target to probe]]
[[DNA]] microarray is a collection of spots attached to a solid support such as a [[microscope slide]] where each spot contains one or more single-stranded DNA [[oligonucleotide]] fragment. Arrays make it possible to put down large quantities of very small (100 micrometre diameter) spots on a single slide. Each spot has a DNA fragment molecule that is complementary to a single DNA sequence. A variation of this technique allows the [[gene expression]] of an organism at a particular stage in development to be qualified ([[expression profiling]]). In this technique the RNA in a tissue is isolated and converted to labeled [[cDNA]]. This cDNA is then hybridized to the fragments on the array and visualization of the hybridization can be done. Since multiple arrays can be made with exactly the same position of fragments they are particularly useful for comparing the gene expression of two different tissues, such as a healthy and cancerous tissue. Also, one can measure what genes are expressed and how that expression changes with time or with other factors.  
There are many different ways to fabricate microarrays; the most common are silicon chips, microscope slides with spots of ~100 micrometre diameter, custom arrays, and arrays with larger spots on porous membranes (macroarrays). There can be anywhere from 100 spots to more than 10,000 on a given array. Arrays can also be made with molecules other than DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microarrays|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe/docs/techmicroarray/|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bumgarner|first1=Roger|title=DNA microarrays: Types, Applications and their future|journal=Current protocols in molecular biology / edited by Frederick M.

===Allele-specific oligonucleotide===
{{Main article|Allele-specific oligonucleotide}}
[[Allele-specific oligonucleotide]] (ASO) is a technique that allows detection of single base mutations without the need for PCR or gel electrophoresis. Short (20-25 nucleotides in length), labeled probes are exposed to the non-fragmented target DNA, hybridization occurs with high specificity due to the short length of the probes and even a single base change will hinder hybridization. The target DNA is then washed and the labeled probes that didn't hybridize are removed. The target DNA is then analyzed for the presence of the probe via radioactivity or fluorescence. In this experiment, as in most molecular biology techniques, a control must be used to ensure successful experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhang|first1=edited by Liang Cheng, David Y.|last2=Zhang|first2=David Y.|title=Molecular genetic pathology|date=2008|publisher=Humana|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=9781597454056|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_7QXO0ZBigC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Allele-specific+oligonucleotide&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT2O_avp_RAhXGYyYKHfR2DJQQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Allele-specific%20oligonucleotide&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Debra G.

[[File:SDS-PAGE.jpg|thumb|125 px|SDS-PAGE]]
In molecular biology, procedures and technologies are continually being developed and older technologies abandoned. For example, before the advent of DNA [[gel electrophoresis]] ([[agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose]] or [[SDS-PAGE|polyacrylamide]]), the size of DNA molecules was typically determined by rate [[sedimentation]] in [[sucrose gradient centrifugation|sucrose gradients]], a slow and labor-intensive technique requiring expensive instrumentation; prior to sucrose gradients, [[viscometry]] was used. Aside from their historical interest, it is often worth knowing about older technology, as it is occasionally useful to solve another new problem for which the newer technique is inappropriate.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==History==
{{main article|History of molecular biology}}

While molecular biology was established in the 1930s, the term was coined by [[Warren Weaver]] in 1938. Weaver was the director of Natural Sciences for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] at the time and believed that biology was about to undergo a period of significant change given recent advances in fields such as [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weaver|first1=Warren|title=Molecular Biology: Origin of the Term|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/170/3958/581.2|website=Science|accessdate=31 December 2016|pages=581–582|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.170.3958.581-a|date=6 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bynum|first1=William|title=A History of Molecular Biology|journal=Nature Medicine|date=1 February 1999|volume=5|issue=2|pages=140–140|doi=10.1038/5498|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v5/n2/full/nm0299_140.html|accessdate=31 December 2016|language=en|issn=1078-8956}}subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are partly covered under [[gene therapy]]. The use of molecular biology or [[molecular cell biology]] approaches in medicine is now called [[molecular medicine]]. Molecular biology also plays important role in understanding formations, actions, and regulations of various parts of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s which can be used to efficiently target new [[drug]]s, diagnosis disease, and understand the physiology of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Bello EA, Schwinn DA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20886">'''Multiple trace theory''' is a [[memory consolidation]] model advanced as an alternative model to strength theory. It posits that each time some information is presented to a person, it is neurally encoded in a unique memory trace composed of a combination of its attributes.&lt;ref name=Semon&gt;{{cite book|last=Semon|first=RW|title=Mnemonic psychology|year=1923|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further support for this theory came in the 1960s from empirical findings that people could remember specific attributes about an object without remembering the object itself.&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;{{cite journal|last=Underwood|first=BJ|title=Some correlates of item repetition in free-recall learning|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1969|volume=8|pages=83–94|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(69)80015-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mode in which the information is presented and subsequently encoded can be flexibly incorporated into the model. This memory trace is unique from all others resembling it due to differences in some aspects of the item's attributes, and all memory traces incorporated since birth are combined into a multiple-trace representation in the brain.&lt;ref name=Hintzman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hintzman|first=DL|author2=Block RA|title=Repetition and memory: Evidence for a multiple trace hypothesis|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1971|volume=88|pages=297–306|doi=10.1037/h0030907}}&lt;/ref&gt; In memory research, a mathematical formulation of this theory can successfully explain empirical phenomena observed in [[Recognition memory|recognition]] and [[Recall (memory)|recall]] tasks.

==Attributes==
The attributes an item possesses form its trace and can fall into many categories. When an item is committed to memory, information from each of these attributional categories is encoded into the item's trace. There may be a kind of semantic categorization at play, whereby an individual trace is incorporated into overarching concepts of an object. For example, when a person sees a pigeon, a trace is added to the “pigeon” cluster of traces within his or her mind. This new “pigeon” trace, while distinguishable and divisible from other instances of pigeons that the person may have seen within his or her life, serves to support the more general and overarching concept of a pigeon.

===Physical===
Physical attributes of an item encode information about physical properties of a presented item. For a word, this could include color, font, spelling, and size, while for a picture, the equivalent aspects could be shapes and colors of objects. It has been shown experimentally that people who are unable to recall an individual word can sometimes recall the first or last letter or even rhyming words,&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=R|author2=Mcneil D|title=The "tip of the tongue" phenomenon|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1966|volume=5|pages=325–337|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(66)80040-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all aspects encoded in the physical orthography of a word's trace. Even when an item is not presented visually, when encoded, it may have some physical aspects based on a visual representation of the item.

===Contextual===
Contextual attributes are a broad class of attributes that define the internal and external features that are simultaneous with presentation of the item. Internal context is a sense of the internal network that a trace evokes.&lt;ref name=Bower&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bower|first=GH|title=A multicomponent theory of the memory trace|journal=The psychology of learning and motivation: Advances in research and theory|year=1967|volume=1|pages=229–325|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60515-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may range from aspects of an individual's mood to other semantic associations the presentation of the word evokes. On the other hand, external context encodes information about the spatial and temporal aspects as information is being presented. This may reflect time of day or weather, for example. Spatial attributes can refer both to physical environment and imagined environment. The [[method of loci]], a mnemonic strategy incorporating an imagined spatial position, assigns relative spatial positions to different items memorized and then "walking through" these assigned positions to remember the items.

===Modal===
Modality attributes possess information as to the method by which an item was presented. The most frequent types of modalities in an experimental setting are auditory and visual. It should be noted, however, that any sensory modality may be utilized practically.

===Classifying===
These attributes refer to the categorization of items presented. Items that fit into the same categories will have the same class attributes. For example, if the item “touchdown” were presented, it would evoke the overarching concept of “football” or perhaps, more generally, “sports”, and it would likely share class attributes with "endzone" and other elements that fit into the same concept. A single item may fit into different concepts at the time it is presented depending on other attributes of the item, like context. For example, the word "star" might fall into the class of astronomy after visiting a space museum or a class with words like "celebrity" or "famous" after seeing a movie.

==Mathematical formulation==
The mathematical formulation of traces allows for a model of memory as an ever-growing matrix that is continuously receiving and incorporating information in the form of a vectors of attributes. Multiple trace theory states that every item ever encoded, from birth to death, will exist in this matrix as multiple traces. This is done by giving every possible attribute some numerical value to classify it as it is encoded, so each encoded memory will have a unique set of numerical attributes.

===Matrix definition of traces===
By assigning numerical values to all possible attributes, it is convenient to construct a [[column vector]] representation of each encoded item. This vector representation can also be fed into computational models of the brain like [[neural networks]], which take as inputs vectorial "memories" and simulate their biological encoding through neurons.

Formally, one can denote an encoded memory by numerical assignments to all of its possible attributes. If two items are perceived to have the same color or experienced in the same context, the numbers denoting their color and contextual attributes, respectively, will be relatively close. Suppose we encode a total of ''L'' attributes anytime we see an object. Then, when a memory is encoded, it can be written as '''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' with ''L'' total numerical entries in a column vector:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m_1} = \begin{bmatrix} m_{1}(1) \\ m_{1}(2) \\ m_{1}(3) \\ \vdots \\m_{1}(L) \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

A subset of the ''L'' attributes will be devoted to contextual attributes, a subset to physical attributes, and so on. One underlying assumption of multiple trace theory is that, when we construct multiple memories, we organize the attributes in the same order. Thus, we can similarly define vectors '''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''m&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' to account for ''n'' total encoded memories. Multiple trace theory states that these memories come together in our brain to form a memory matrix from the simple concatenation of the individual memories:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{m_1} &amp; \mathbf{m_2} &amp; \mathbf{m_3} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{m_n} \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} m_{1}(1) &amp; m_{2}(1) &amp; m_{3}(1) &amp; \cdots &amp; m_{n}(1) \\ m_{1}(2) &amp; m_{2}(2) &amp; m_{3}(2) &amp; \cdots &amp; m_{n}(2) \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\m_{1}(L) &amp; m_{2}(L) &amp; m_{3}(L) &amp; \cdots &amp; m_{n}(L)\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

For ''L'' total attributes and ''n'' total memories, '''M''' will have ''L'' rows and ''n'' columns. Note that, although the ''n'' traces are combined into a large memory matrix, each trace is individually accessible as a column in this matrix.

In this formulation, the ''n'' different memories are made to be more or less independent of each other. However, items presented in some setting together will become tangentially associated by the similarity of their context vectors. If multiple items are made associated with each other and intentionally encoded in that manner, say an item '''a''' and an item '''b''', then the memory for these two can be constructed, with each having ''k'' attributes as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m_{ab}} = \begin{bmatrix} a(1) \\a(2) \\ \vdots \\a(k) \\b(1) \\b(2) \\ \vdots \\b(k) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{a} \\ \mathbf{b} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Context as a stochastic vector===
When items are learned one after another, it is tempting to say that they are learned in the same temporal context. However, in reality, there are subtle variations in context. Hence, contextual attributes are often considered to be changing over time as modeled by a [[stochastic process]].&lt;ref name=Estes&gt;{{cite book|last=Estes|first=WK|title=Component and pattern models with markovian interpretations. studies in mathematical learning theory|year=1959|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering a vector of only ''r'' total context attributes '''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' that represents the context of memory '''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''', the context of the next-encoded memory is given by '''t&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;''':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t_{i+1}(j)} = \mathbf{t_{i}(j) + \epsilon(j)}&lt;/math&gt;

so, 

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t_{i+1}} = \begin{bmatrix} t_i(1)+\epsilon(1) \\t_i(2)+\epsilon(2) \\ \vdots \\ t_i(r)+\epsilon(r) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, '''ε(j)''' is a random number sampled from a [[Gaussian distribution]].

===Summed similarity===
As explained in the subsequent section, the hallmark of multiple trace theory is an ability to compare some probe item to the pre-existing matrix of encoded memories. This simulates the memory search process, whereby we can determine whether we have ever seen the probe before as in recognition tasks or whether the probe gives rise to another previously encoded memory as in cued recall.

First, the probe '''p''' is encoded as an attribute vector. Continuing with the preceding example of the memory matrix '''M''', the probe will have ''L'' entries:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix} p(1) \\ p(2) \\ \vdots \\p(L) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This '''p''' is then compared one by one to all pre-existing memories (trace) in '''M''' by determining the [[Euclidean distance]] between '''p''' and each '''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''':

::&lt;math&gt;\left \Vert \mathbf{p-m_i} \right \| = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^L (p(j)-m_i(j))^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the stochastic nature of context, it is almost never the case in multiple trace theory that a probe item exactly matches an encoded memory. Still, high similarity between '''p''' and '''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is indicated by a small Euclidean distance. Hence, another operation must be performed on the distance that leads to very low similarity for great distance and very high similarity for small distance. A linear operation does not eliminate low-similarity items harshly enough. Intuitively, an exponential decay model seems most suitable:

::&lt;math&gt;similarity(\mathbf{p,m_i}) = e^{-\tau \left \Vert \mathbf{p-m_i} \right \|} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''τ''' is a decay parameter that can be experimentally assigned. We can go on to then define similarity to the entire memory matrix by a summed similarity '''SS(p,M)''' between the probe '''p''' and the memory matrix '''M''':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{SS(p,M)} = \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-\tau \left \Vert \mathbf{p-m_i} \right \|} = \sum_{i=1}^n e^{-\tau \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^L (p(j)-m_i(j))^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the probe item is very similar to even one of the encoded memories, '''SS''' receives a large boost. For example, given '''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' as a probe item, we will get a near 0 distance (not exactly due to context) for i=1, which will add nearly the maximal boost possible to '''SS'''.  To differentiate from background similarity (there will always be some low similarity to context or a few attributes for example), '''SS''' is often compared to some arbitrary criterion. If it is higher than the criterion, then the probe is considered among those encoded. The criterion can be varied based on the nature of the task and the desire to prevent [[false alarms]]. Thus, multiple trace theory predicts that, given some cue, the brain can compare that cue to a criterion to answer questions like "has this cue been experienced before?" (recognition) or "what memory does this cue elicit?" (cued recall), which are applications of summed similarity described below.

==Applications to memory phenomena==

===Recognition===
Multiple trace theory fits well into the conceptual framework for [[recognition memory|recognition]]. Recognition requires an individual to determine whether or not they have seen an item before. For example, facial recognition is determining whether one has seen a face before. When asked this for a successfully encoded item (something that has indeed been seen before), recognition should occur with high probability. In the mathematical framework of this theory, we can model recognition of an individual probe item '''p''' by summed similarity with a criterion. We translate the test item into an attribute vector as done for the encoded memories and compared to every trace ever encountered. If summed similarity passes the criterion, we say we have seen the item before. Summed similarity is expected to be very low if the item has never been seen but relatively higher if it has due to the similarity of the probe's attributes to some memory of the memory matrix. 

::&lt;math&gt;P(recognizing~p)~=~P(\mathbf{SS(p,M)}&gt;criterion)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be applied both to individual item recognition and associative recognition for two or more items together.

===Cued recall===
The theory can also account for [[cued recall]]. Here, some cue is given that is meant to elicit an item out of memory. For example, a factual question like "Who was the first President of the United States?" is a cue to elicit the answer of "George Washington". In the '''"ab"''' framework described above, we can take all attributes present in a cue and list consider these the '''a''' item in an encoded association as we try to recall the '''b''' portion of the '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' memory. In this example, attributes like "first", "President", and "United States" will be combined to form the '''a''' vector, which will have already been formulated into the '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' memory whose '''b''' values encode "George Washington". Given '''a''', there are two popular models for how we can successfully recall '''b''':

1) We can go through and determine similarity (not summed similarity, see above for distinction) to every item in memory for the '''a''' attributes, then pick whichever memory has the highest similarity for the '''a'''. Whatever '''b'''-type attributes we are linked to gives what we recall. The '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' memory gives best chance of recall since its '''a''' elements will have high similarity to the cue '''a'''. Still, since recall does not always occur, we can say that the similarity must pass a criterion for recall to occur at all. This is similar to how the IBM machine [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] operates. Here, the similarity compares only the '''a'''-type attributes of '''a''' to m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;P(recalling~m_{ab})~=~P(similarity(a,m_{ab})&gt;criterion)&lt;/math&gt;

2) We can use a probabilistic choice rule to determine probability of recalling an item as proportional to its similarity. This is akin to throwing a dart at a dartboard with bigger areas represented by larger similarities to the cue item. Mathematically speaking, given the cue '''a''', the probability of recalling the desired memory '''m&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''' is:

::&lt;math&gt;P(recalling~m_{ab})~=~\frac{similarity(a,m_{ab})}{SS(a,M)+error}&lt;/math&gt;

In computing both similarity and summed similarity, we only consider relations among '''a'''-type attributes. We add the '''error''' term because without it, the probability of recalling any memory in '''M''' will be 1, but there are certainly times when recall does not occur at all.

===Other common results explained===
Phenomena in memory associated with repetition, word frequency, recency, forgetting, and contiguity, among others, can be easily explained in the realm of multiple trace theory. Memory is known to improve with repeated exposure to items. For example, hearing a word several times in a list will improve recognition and recall of that word later on. This is because repeated exposure simply adds the memory into the ever-growing memory matrix, so summed similarity for this memory will be larger and thus more likely to pass the criterion. 

In recognition, very common words are harder to recognize as part of a memorized list, when tested, than rare words. This is known as the word frequency effect and can be explained by multiple trace theory as well. For common words, summed similarity will be relatively high, whether the word was seen in the list or not, because it is likely that the word has been encountered and encoded in the memory matrix several times throughout life. Thus, the brain typically selects a higher criterion in determining whether common words are part of a list, making them harder to successfully select. However, rarer words are typically encountered less throughout life and so their presence in the memory matrix is limited. Hence, low overall summed similarity will lead to a more lax criterion. If the word was present in the list, high context similarity at time of test and other attribute similarity will lead to enough boost in summed similarity to excel past criterion and thus recognize the rare word successfully.

Recency in the [[serial position effect#Recency|serial position effect]] can be explained because more recent memories encoded will share a temporal context most similar to the present context, as the stochastic nature of time will not have had as pronounced an effect. Thus, context similarity will be high for recently encoded items, so overall similarity will be relatively higher for these items as well. The stochastic contextual drift is also thought to account for forgetting because the context in which a memory was encoded is lost over time, so summed similarity for an item only presented in that context will decrease over time.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=ES|title=Association theory to-day; an essay in systematic psychology|year=1932|publisher=The Century Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karpicke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karpicke|first=JD|author2=Roediger HL|title=Repeated retrieval during learning is the key to long-term retention|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=2007|volume=57|pages=151–162|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, empirical data have shown a [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity effect]], whereby items that are presented together temporally, even though they may not be encoded as a single memory as in the '''"ab"''' paradigm described above, are more likely to be remembered together. This can be considered a result of low contextual drift between items remembered together, so the contextual similarity between two items presented together is high.

==Shortcomings==
One of the biggest shortcomings of multiple trace theory is the requirement of some item with which to compare the memory matrix when determining successful encoding. As mentioned above, this works quite well in recognition and cued recall, but there is a glaring inability to incorporate [[free recall]] into the model. Free recall requires an individual to freely remember some list of items. Although the very act of asking to recall may act as a cue that can then elicit cued recall techniques, it is unlikely that the cue is unique enough to reach a summed similarity criterion or to otherwise achieve a high probability of recall.  

Another major issue lies in translating the model to biological relevance. It is hard to imagine that the brain has unlimited capacity to keep track of such a large matrix of memories and continue expanding it with every item with which it has ever been presented. Furthermore, searching through this matrix is an exhaustive process that would not be relevant on biological time scales.&lt;ref name=Burrows&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burrows|first=D|author2=Okada R|title=Memory retrieval from short and long lists|journal=Science|year=1975|volume=188|pages=1031–1033| doi=10.1126/science.188.4192.1031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurodegeneration''' is the progressive loss of structure or function of [[neurons]], including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases – including [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Huntington's disease]] – occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. Such diseases are incurable, resulting in progressive degeneration and/or death of neuron cells.&lt;ref name=JPND&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Neurodegenerative Disease?|url=http://www.neurodegenerationresearch.eu/about/what/|website=JPND Research|publisher=JPND Research|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As research progresses, many similarities appear that relate these diseases to one another on a [[sub-cellular]] level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rubinsztein DC| title = The roles of intracellular protein-degradation pathways in neurodegeneration| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 780–6|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051204| doi = 10.1038/nature05291| bibcode=2006Natur.443..780R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bredesen&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bredesen DE, Rao RV, Mehlen P | title = Cell death in the nervous system| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 796–802|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051206| doi = 10.1038/nature05293| bibcode=2006Natur.443..796B| pmc=3970704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic.

==Risk factor==
The greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is [[ageing|aging]]. [[Free-radical theory of aging#Mitochondrial theory of aging|Mitochondrial DNA mutations]] as well as [[oxidative stress]] both contribute to aging.&lt;ref name = lin /&gt; Many of these diseases are late-onset, meaning there is some factor that changes as a person ages for each disease.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt; One constant factor is that in each disease, neurons gradually lose function as the disease progresses with age. It has been proposed that [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] accumulation provides the underlying causative link between [[ageing|aging]] and neurodegenerative disease.&lt;ref name= Bernsteinbook&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H.

==Mechanisms==

===Genetics===
{{see also|Epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases}}
Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by [[genetic mutation]]s, most of which are located in completely unrelated genes. In many of the different diseases, the mutated gene has a common feature: a repeat of the CAG nucleotide triplet. CAG encodes for the amino acid [[glutamine]]. A repeat of CAG results in a [[polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine (polyQ) tract]]. Diseases showing this are known as [[polyglutamine disease]]s.&lt;ref name = thompson&gt;{{cite journal| author = Thompson LM| title = Neurodegeneration: a question of balance| journal = Nature| volume = 452| issue = 7188| pages = 707–8|date=April 2008| pmid = 18401401| doi = 10.1038/452707a|bibcode = 2008Natur.452..707T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = marsh&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Marsh JL, Lukacsovich T, Thompson LM | title = Animal Models of Polyglutamine Diseases and Therapeutic Approaches| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7431–5|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957429| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800065200| pmc = 2658038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Polyglutamine:''' A repeat in this causes dominant pathogenesis. Extra glutamine residues can acquire toxic properties through a variety of ways, including irregular protein folding and degradation pathways, altered subcellular localization, and abnormal interactions with other cellular proteins.&lt;ref name = thompson /&gt; PolyQ studies often use a variety of animal models because there is such a clearly defined trigger – repeat expansion. Extensive research has been done using the [[model organism|models]] of [[nematode]] (''C. elegans''), and fruit fly (''Drosophila''), mice, and non-human primates. Mammalian data is often needed for FDA approval of drugs, which means that the bulk of the research is done using mice. Using data from the other animals (''C. elegans'' and ''Drosophila'' primarily) is often a precursor to finding the equivalent mammalian gene.&lt;ref name = marsh /&gt;&lt;ref name = orr&gt;{{cite journal| author = Orr HT| title = Unstable Nucleotide Repeat Minireview Series: A Molecular Biography of Unstable Repeat Disorders| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7405|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957428| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800067200| pmc = 2658033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Nine inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the expansion of the CAG trinucleotide and polyQ tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zoghbi HY, Orr HT | title = Pathogenic Mechanisms of a Polyglutamine-mediated Neurodegenerative Disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7425–9|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957430| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800041200| pmc = 2658037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples are [[Huntington's disease]] and the [[spinocerebellar ataxia]]s. For a complete list, see the table under '''Polyglutamine (PolyQ) Diseases''' in the article [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder]]. While polyglutamine-repeat diseases encompass many different neurodegenerative disorders, there are many more it does not apply to. The genetics behind each disease are different and often unknown.

===Protein misfolding===
Several neurodegenerative diseases are classified as [[proteopathy|proteopathies]] as they are associated with the [[protein aggregation|aggregation]] of [[protein folding|misfolded proteins]].
*'''[[alpha-synuclein]]:''' can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by [[Lewy bodies]], such as Parkinson's disease, [[dementia with Lewy bodies]], and multiple system atrophy. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. In addition, an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC), is found in amyloid plaques in [[Alzheimer's disease]].
*'''tau:''' hyperphosphorylated [[tau protein]] is the main component of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''[[beta amyloid]]:''' the major component of [[senile plaques]] in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''[[prion]]:''' main component of prion diseases and [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]].

===Intracellular mechanisms===

====Protein degradation pathways====
[[Parkinson's]] disease and [[Huntington's]] disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures:&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

* cytosol, e.g. [[Parkinson's]] &amp; [[Huntington's]]
* nucleus, e.g. [[Spinocerebellar ataxia]] type 1 (SCA1)
* endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (as seen with neuroserpin mutations that cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies)
* extracellularly excreted proteins, amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease

There are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles:

*'''ubiquitin–proteasome:''' protein [[ubiquitin]] along with enzymes is key for the degradation of many proteins that cause proteinopathies including polyQ expansions and alpha-synucleins. Research indicates proteasome enzymes may not be able to correctly cleave these irregular proteins, which could possibly result in a more toxic species. This is the primary route cells use to degrade proteins.&lt;ref name ="rubinsztein"/&gt;
** Decreased proteasome activity is consistent with models in which intracellular protein aggregates form. It is still unknown whether or not these aggregates are a cause or a result of neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;
*'''autophagy–lysosome pathways:''' a form of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD), this becomes the favorable route when a protein is aggregate-prone meaning it is a poor proteasome substrate. This can be split into two forms of autophagy: '''[[macroautophagy]]''' and '''chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)'''.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;
**'''macroautophagy''' is involved with nutrient recycling of macromolecules under conditions of starvation, certain apoptotic pathways, and if absent, leads to the formation of ubiquinated inclusions. Experiments in mice with neuronally confined macroautophagy-gene knockouts develop intraneuronal aggregates leading to neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name ="rubinsztein"/&gt;
**'''chaperone-mediated autophagy''' defects may also lead to neurodegeneration. Research has shown that mutant proteins bind to the CMA-pathway receptors on lysosomal membrane and in doing so block their own degradation as well as the degradation of other substrates.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

====Membrane damage====
Damage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases. Alpha-synuclein can damage membranes by inducing membrane curvature,&lt;ref name=curvature&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Varkey J, Isas JM, Mizuno N, etal |title=Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=285 |issue=42 |pages=32486–93 |date=October 2010  |pmid=20693280 |pmc=2952250 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M110.139576}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cause extensive tubulation and vesiculation when incubated with artificial phospholipid vesicles.&lt;ref name=curvature/&gt;
[http://www.jbc.org/content/287/35/29301.long The tubes formed from these lipid vesicles consist of both micellar as well as bilayer tubes. Extensive induction of membrane curvature is deleterious  to the cell and would eventually lead to cell death.][http://www.jbc.org/content/288/24/17620.long Apart from tubular structures, alpha-synuclein can also form lipoprotein nanoparticles similar to apolipoproteins.]

====Mitochondrial dysfunction====
The most common form of cell death in neurodegeneration is through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of [[cytochrome c]] from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and [[glutathione peroxidase]]. Over production of ROS ([[oxidative stress]]) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, [[mitochondrial fission]] and [[mitochondrial fusion|fusion]], lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition. Mitochondrial disease leading to neurodegeneration is likely, at least on some level, to involve all of these functions.&lt;ref name = dimauro&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=DiMauro S, Schon EA | title = Mitochondrial disorders in the nervous system| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 91–123| year = 2008| pmid = 18333761| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a causal role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, including in four of the more well known diseases [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Huntington's]], and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].&lt;ref name = lin&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lin MT, Beal MF | title = Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 787–95|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051205| doi = 10.1038/nature05292|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..787L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuron]]s are particularly vulnerable to [[oxidative stress|oxidative damage]] due to their strong metabolic activity associated with high [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] levels, high oxygen consumption, and weak [[antioxidant]] defense.&lt;ref name="pmid28785371"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu Z, Zhou T, Ziegler AC, Dimitrion P, Zuo L |title=Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications |journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev |volume=2017 |issue= |pages=2525967 |date=2017 |pmid=28785371 |pmc=5529664 |doi=10.1155/2017/2525967 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27663141"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Dharmalingam P, Vasquez V, Mitra J, Boldogh I, Rao KS, Kent TA, Mitra S, Hegde ML |title=Chronic oxidative damage together with genome repair deficiency in the neurons is a double whammy for neurodegeneration: Is damage response signaling a potential therapeutic target? |journal=Mech.

====DNA Damage====

The brain metabolizes as much as a fifth of consumed oxygen, and [[reactive oxygen species]] produced by oxidative metabolism are a major source of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] in the [[brain]].  Damage to a cell’s [[DNA]] is particularly harmful because DNA is the blueprint for protein production and unlike other molecules it cannot simply be replaced by re-synthesis. The vulnerability of post-mitotic neurons to DNA damage (such as oxidative lesions or certain types of DNA strand breaks), coupled with a gradual decline in the activities of [[DNA repair|repair mechanisms]], could lead to accumulation of DNA damage with age and contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name="pmid25033177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Madabhushi R, Pan L, Tsai LH |title=DNA damage and its links to neurodegeneration |journal=Neuron |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=266–282 |date=July 2014 |pmid=25033177 |pmc=5564444 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.06.034 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA single-strand breaks are common and are associated with the neurodegenerative disease ataxia-[[oculomotor apraxia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21550379"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeppesen DK, Bohr VA, Stevnsner T |title=DNA repair deficiency in neurodegeneration |journal=Prog.

====Axonal transport====
Axonal swelling and spheroids have been observed in many different neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that defective axons are not only present in diseased neurons, but also that they may cause certain pathological insult due to accumulation of organelles. Axonal transport can be disrupted by a variety of mechanisms including damage to: [[kinesin]] and [[cytoplasmic dynein]], [[microtubules]], cargoes, and [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name = devos&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=De Vos KJ, Grierson AJ, Ackerley S, Miller CC | title = Role of axonal transport in neurodegenerative diseases| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 151–73| year = 2008| pmid = 18558852| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090711}}&lt;/ref&gt; When axonal transport is severely disrupted a degenerative pathway known as [[Wallerian degeneration|Wallerian-like degeneration]] is often triggered.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman MP &amp; Freeman MF 'Wallerian degeneration, WldS and Nmnat' Annual Review of Neuroscience 2010, 33: 245-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmed cell death===
[[Programmed cell death]] ('''PCD''') is death of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] in any form, mediated by an intracellular program.&lt;ref name = engelberg&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Engelberg-Kulka H, Amitai S, Kolodkin-Gal I, Hazan R | title = Bacterial Programmed Cell Death and Multicellular Behavior in Bacteria| journal = PLoS Genetics| volume = 2| issue = 10| pages = e135|date=October 2006| pmid = 17069462| pmc = 1626106| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can be activated in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vila|first1=Miquel|last2=Przedbroski|first2=Serge|title=Targeting Programmed Cell Death in Neurodegenrative Diseases|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |doi=10.1038/nrn1100|date=May 2003|volume=4|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, situations in which these mediated pathways are artificially stimulated due to injury or disease.&lt;ref name = bredesen/&gt;

====Apoptosis (type I)====
[[Apoptosis]] is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. It is one of the main types of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD) and involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death.

*'''Extrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' Occur when factors outside the cell activate cell surface death receptors (e.g., Fas) that result in the activation of [[caspases]]-8 or -10.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;
*'''Intrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' Result from mitochondrial release of [[cytochrome c]] or endoplasmic reticulum malfunctions, each leading to the activation of caspase-9. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] are other organelles that have damage sensors, which can lead the cells down apoptotic pathways.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;&lt;ref name = green&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Green DR, Kroemer G | title = Pharmacological manipulation of cell death: clinical applications in sight?| journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation| volume = 115| issue = 10| pages = 2610–7|date=October 2005| pmid = 16200193| pmc = 1236695| doi = 10.1172/JCI26321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caspases]] (cysteine-aspartic acid proteases) cleave at very specific [[amino acid]] residues. There are two types of caspases: '''initiators''' and '''effectors'''. Initiator caspases cleave inactive forms of effector caspases. This activates the effectors that in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

====Autophagic (type II)====
Autophagy is essentially a form of intracellular [[phagocytosis]] in which a cell actively consumes damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by encapsulating them into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome to destroy the contents of the autophagosome. Many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates. This could potentially be a result of underlying autophagic defect common to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that this is a hypothesis, and more research must be done.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

====Cytoplasmic (type III)====
The final and least understood PCD mechanism is through non-apoptotic processes. These fall under Type III, or cytoplasmic cell death. Many other forms of PCD are observed but not fully understood or accepted by the scientific community. For example, PCD might be caused by trophotoxicity, or hyperactivation of trophic factor receptors. In addition to this, other cytotoxins that induce PCD at low concentrations act to cause [[necrosis]], or aponecrosis – the combination of apoptosis and necrosis, when in higher concentrations. It is still unclear exactly what combination of apoptosis, non-apoptosis, and necrosis causes different kinds of aponecrosis.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

===PCD===
In the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases, PCD may be pathogenic. In order to identify the potential of neuroprotective targets in PCD machinery, there were experimental models conducted on these neurodegenerative diseases. These studies showed that the expression of certain components have been altered by genetic and pharmacological means. Expression of PCD molecular components are said to be controlled by gene and antisense therapy, but this needs further research. Pharmacological approaches involve inhibitors of caspase activity, and caspase inhibition might delay cell death in the different experimental models.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;

===Transglutaminase===

[[Transglutaminase]]s are human [[enzymes]] [[ubiquitously]] present in the human body and in the brain in particular.&lt;ref name="caccamo"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Caccamo D, etal| title = Critical role of transglutaminase and other stress proteins during neurodegenerative processes| journal = Amino Acids| volume = 38| issue = | pages = 653–8|date=2010| pmid = 19960212| doi = 10.1007/s00726-009-0428-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main function of [[transglutaminases]] is [[Molecular binding|bind]] proteins and peptides intra- and intermolecularly, by a type of [[covalent bonds]] termed [[isopeptide bond]]s, in a reaction termed [[Isopeptide bond|transamidation]] or [[Isopeptide bond|crosslinking]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

[[Transglutaminase]] [[Chemical bond|binding]] of these proteins and peptides make them clump together. The resulting structures are turned extremely resistant to chemical and mechanical disruption.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

Most relevant human neurodegenerative diseases share the property of having [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures made up of proteins and peptides]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

Each of these neurodegenerative disesases have one (or several) specific main protein or peptide. In [[Alzheimer's disease]], these are [[amyloid-beta]] and [[tau]]. In [[Parkinson’s]] disease, it is [[alpha-synuclein]]. In [[Huntington’s]] disease, it is [[huntingtin]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''[[Transglutaminase]] [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]]:'''
[[Amyloid-beta]], [[tau]], [[alpha-synuclein]] and [[huntingtin]] have been proved to be [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] of [[transglutaminases]] in vitro or in vivo, that is, they can be [[Chemical bond|bonded]] by trasglutaminases by [[covalent bonds]] to each other and potentially to any other transglutaminase substrate in the brain.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''[[Transglutaminase]] augmented expression:'''
It has been proved that in these neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease) the [[Gene expression|expression]] of the [[transglutaminase]] [[enzyme]] is increased.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''Presence of [[isopeptide bond]]s in these structures:'''
The presence of [[isopeptide bond]]s (the result of the [[transglutaminase]] reaction) have been detected in the [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures that are characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''Co-localization:'''
Co-localization of transglutaminase mediated [[isopeptide bond]]s with these [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures]] has been detected in the autopsy of brains of patients with these diseases.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

==Specific disorders==

===Alzheimer's disease===
[[File:Alzheimer's Disease.gif|thumb|Normal cerebral cortex vs Alzheimer's disease]]
{{main|Alzheimer's disease}}

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross [[atrophy]] of the affected regions, including degeneration in the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], and parts of the [[frontal cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]].&lt;ref name="pmid12934968"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wenk GL|title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease|journal=J Clin Psychiatry|volume=64 Suppl 9|pages=7–10|year=2003|pmid=12934968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alzheimer's disease has been ''hypothesized'' to be a [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease ([[proteopathy]]), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and [[Tau protein|tau proteins]] in the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid14528050"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hashimoto M, Rockenstein E, Crews L, Masliah E |title=Role of protein aggregation in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases|journal=Neuromolecular Med.|volume=4|issue=1–2|pages=21–36|year=2003|pmid=14528050|doi=10.1385/NMM:4:1-2:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques are made up of small [[peptide]]s, 39–43&amp;nbsp;amino acids in length, called [[beta-amyloid]] (also written as A-beta or Aβ). Beta-amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein called [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP), a [[transmembrane protein]] that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair.&lt;ref name="pmid16822978"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Priller C, Bauer T, Mitteregger G, Krebs B, Kretzschmar HA, Herms J |title=Synapse formation and function is modulated by the amyloid precursor protein|journal=J.

===Parkinson's disease===
{{main|Parkinson's disease}}

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26718594 | doi=10.1016/j.neurol.2015.09.012 | volume=172 | title=Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease |vauthors=Elbaz A, Carcaillon L, Kab S, Moisan F | journal=Rev Neurol (Paris) | pages=14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It results from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of cell-death is unknown. The following paragraph is an excerpt from the Pathophysiology section of the article [[Parkinson's disease]].

The mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost ''may'' consist of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. The [[alpha-synuclein]]-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteasome.  This [[protein]] accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called [[Lewy bodies]]. The latest research on pathogenesis of disease has shown that the death of dopaminergic neurons by alpha-synuclein is due to a defect in the machinery that transports proteins between two major cellular organelles – the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Certain proteins like Rab1 may reverse this defect caused by alpha-synuclein in animal models.&lt;ref&gt;"Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Discovered," [http://www.hhmi.org/news/lindquist20060622.html HHMI Research News] June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research suggests that impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein leads to its accumulation in the Lewy bodies. Experiments have revealed reduced transport rates of both wild-type and two familial Parkinson's disease-associated mutant alpha-synucleins through axons of cultured neurons.&lt;ref name = devos /&gt; Membrane damage by alpha-synuclein could be another Parkinson's disease mechanism.&lt;ref name=curvature/&gt;

The main known risk factor is age. Susceptibility genes including α-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK-2), and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have shown that genetic predisposition is another important causal factor.

Mutant [[Huntingtin]] is an aggregate-prone protein. During the cells' natural clearance process, these proteins are retrogradely transported to the cell body for destruction by lysosomes. It is a possibility that these mutant protein aggregates damage the retrograde transport of important cargoes such as [[BDNF]] by damaging molecular motors as well as microtubules.&lt;ref name = devos /&gt;

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)===
{{main|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}}

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) is a disease in which motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. In 1993, missense mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 ([[SOD1]]) were discovered in subsets of patients with familial ALS. This discovery led researchers to focus on unlocking the mechanisms for SOD1-mediated diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying SOD1 mutant toxicity has yet to be resolved.  More recently, [[TDP-43]] and [[FUS (gene)|FUS]] protein aggregates have been implicated in some cases of the disease, and a mutation in chromosome 9 ([[C9orf72]]) is thought to be the most common known cause of sporadic ALS.

Recent independent research by Nagai et al.&lt;ref name = nagai&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagai M, Re DB, Nagata T, etal | title = Astrocytes expressing ALS-linked mutated SOD1 release factors selectively toxic to motor neurons| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 615–22|date=May 2007| pmid = 17435755| doi = 10.1038/nn1876| pmc = 3799799}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Di Giorgio et al.&lt;ref name ="  digiorgio"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Di Giorgio FP, Carrasco MA, Siao MC, Maniatis T, Eggan K | title = Non–cell autonomous effect of glia on motor neurons in an embryonic stem cell–based ALS model| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 608–14|date=May 2007| pmid = 17435754| doi = 10.1038/nn1885| pmc = 3139463}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide ''in vitro'' evidence that the primary cellular sites where SOD1 mutations act are located on astrocytes. [[Astrocytes]] then cause the toxic effects on the [[motor neurons]].

===Batten disease===
[[Batten disease]] is a rare and fatal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that begins at birth.

==Therapeutics==
The process of neurodegeneration is not well understood, so the diseases that stem from it have, as yet, no cures. In the search for effective treatments (as opposed to [[palliative care]]), investigators employ [[animal model]]s of disease to test potential therapeutic agents. Model organisms provide an inexpensive and relatively quick means to perform two main functions: target identification and target validation. Together, these help show the value of any specific therapeutic strategies and drugs when attempting to ameliorate disease severity. An example is the drug [[Dimebon]] (Medivation). This drug is in phase III clinical trials for use in Alzheimer's disease, and also recently finished phase II clinical trials for use in Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name = marsh /&gt; In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug Dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2387 Dimebon Disappoints in Phase 3 Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for Dimebon (latrepirdine) in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sweetlove M: Phase III CONCERT Trial of Latrepirdine. Negative results. Pharm Med 2012;26(2):113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment using a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, it was demonstrated that systemic administration of hypothalamic proline-rich peptide (PRP)-1 offers neuroprotective effects and can prevent neurodegeneration in hippocampus [[amyloid-beta]] 25–35. This suggests that there could be therapeutic value to PRP-1.&lt;ref name = galoyan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galoyan AA, Sarkissian JS, Chavushyan VA, etal | title = Neuroprotection by hypothalamic peptide proline-rich peptide-1 in Aβ25–35 model of Alzheimer's disease| journal = Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 332–44|date=September 2008| pmid = 18790460| doi = 10.1016/j.jalz.2007.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein degradation offers therapeutic options both in preventing the synthesis and degradation of irregular proteins. There is also interest in upregulating autophagy to help clear protein aggregates implicated in neurodegeneration. Both of these options involve very complex pathways that we are only beginning to understand.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

The goal of [[immunotherapy]] is to enhance aspects of the immune system. Both active and passive vaccinations  have been proposed for Alzheimer's disease and other conditions, however more research must be done to prove safety and efficacy in humans.&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brody DL, Holtzman DM | title = Active and Passive Immunotherapy for Neurodegenerative Disorders| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 175–93| year = 2008| pmid = 18352830| pmc = 2561172| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost, time and quality are the main variables that drive customer needs. Aiming at these three variables, [[company|companies]] develop continuous practices and strategies to better satisfy [[customer requirement]]s and to increase their own [[market share]] by a regular development of new products.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} There are many uncertainties and challenges which companies must face throughout the process. The use of [[best practice]]s and the elimination of barriers to communication are the main concerns for the [[management]] of the NPD .{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Process structure ==
The product development process typically consists of several activities that firms employ in the complex process of delivering new products to the market. A [[process management]] approach is used to provide a structure. Product development often overlaps much with the [[engineering design]] process, particularly if the new product being developed involves application of math and/or science. Every new product will pass through a series of stages/phases, including [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] among other aspects of [[design]], as well as [[manufacturing]] and market introduction.  In highly complex engineered products (e.g. aircraft, automotive, machinery), the NPD process can be likewise complex regarding management of personnel, milestones and deliverables.  Such projects typically use an [[integrated product team]] approach.  The process for managing large-scale complex engineering products is much slower (often 10-plus years) than that deployed for many types of consumer goods.

The product development process is articulated and broken down in many different ways, many of which often include the following phases/stages:
#  '''Fuzzy front-end''' (FFE) is the set of activities employed before the more formal and well defined [[requirements engineering|requirements specification]] is completed.  [[Requirements]] speak to what the product should do or have, at varying degrees of specificity, in order to meet the perceived market or business need.
#  '''Product design''' is the development of both the [[High-level design|high-level]] and [[Detailed design document|detailed-level]] design of the product:  which turns the ''what'' of the requirements into a specific ''how'' this particular product will meet those requirements. This typically has the most overlap with the [[engineering design]] process, but can also include [[industrial design]] and even purely aesthetic aspects of design. On the marketing and planning side, this phase ends at pre-commercialization analysis{{clarify|date=April 2015}} stage.
#  '''Product implementation''' often refers to later stages of detailed engineering design (e.g. refining mechanical or electrical hardware, or software, or [[consumer good|goods]] or other product forms), as well as [[verification and validation|test process]] that may be used to validate that the prototype actually meets all design specifications that were established.
#  '''Fuzzy back-end''' or commercialization phase represent the action steps where the [[manufacturing|production]] and market launch occur.

The front-end marketing phases have been very well researched, with valuable models proposed. Peter Koen et al. provides a five-step front-end activity called front-end innovation: opportunity identification, opportunity analysis, idea genesis, idea selection, and idea and technology development. He also includes an engine in the middle of the five front-end stages and the possible outside barriers that can influence the process outcome. The engine represents the management driving the activities described. The front end of the innovation is the greatest area of weakness in the NPD process. This is mainly because the FFE is often chaotic, unpredictable and unstructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koen|first1=Peter A.|title=The fuzzy front-end for incremental, breakthrough and platform products and services|accessdate=February 5, 2017|issue=1|publisher=Consortium for corporate entrepreneurship|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32151604/FuzzyFrontEnd_Old.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1486329441&amp;Signature=8XPQsXKa5HC7W0UjVcloWV6Qp0Q%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D1_Fuzzy_Front_End_Effective_Methods_Tool.pdf}} {{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Engineering design is the process whereby a technical solution is developed iteratively to solve a given problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=P. Robert|last2=Eppinger|first2=P. Steven|title=Identifying controlling features of engineering design iteration|journal=Management Science|date=1997|volume=43|issue=3|pages=276–293|doi=10.1287/mnsc.43.3.276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;Yassine, Ali; Braha, Dan (2003),[http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/CERA.pdf "Complex Concurrent Engineering and the Design Structure Matrix Approach."] Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications, '''11''' (3):165–177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yassine, Ali; Joglekar, Nitin; Braha, Dan; Eppinger, Steven; Whitney, Daniel (2003),"Information hiding in product development: the design churn effect." Research in Engineering Design, '''14''' (3): 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt;
The design stage is very important because at this stage most of the product life cycle costs are engaged. Previous research shows that 70–80% of the final product quality and 70% of the product entire life-cycle cost are determined in the product design phase, therefore the design-manufacturing interface represent the greatest opportunity for cost reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yan-mei|first1=Zhou|title=Cost-benefit of interface management improvement in design-manufacturing chain|journal=Chinese academy of science and technology management|date=2009|volume=14|issue=3|pages=380–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Design projects last from a few weeks to three years with an average of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hargadon|first1=Andrew|title=Technology brokering and innovation in a product development firm|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|date=1997|volume=42|issue=4|pages=716–749|doi=10.2307/2393655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design and Commercialization phases usually start a very early collaboration. When the concept design is finished it will be sent to manufacturing plant for prototyping, developing a Concurrent Engineering approach by implementing practices such as [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], [[Design for manufacturability|DFM]]/[[Design for assembly|DFA]] and more.
The output of the design (engineering) is a set of product and process specifications – mostly in the form of drawings, and the output of manufacturing is the product ready for sale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=S. Paul|title=Interdepartmental interdependence and coordination: the case of the design/manufacturing interface|journal=Organisation Science|date=1995|volume=6|issue=2|pages=147–167|doi=10.1287/orsc.6.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, the design team will develop drawings with technical specifications representing the future product, and will send it to the manufacturing plant to be executed. Solving product/process fit problems is of high priority in information communication design because 90% of the development effort must be scrapped if any changes are made after the release to manufacturing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== NPD Process ==

#'''New Product Strategy''' – Innovators have clearly defined their goals and objectives for the new product.
#'''Idea Generation''' – Collective brainstorming through internal and external sources.
#'''Screening''' – Condense the number of brainstormed ideas.
#'''Concept Testing''' – Structure an idea into a detailed concept.
#'''Business Analysis''' – Understand the cost and profits of the new product and determining if they meet company objectives.
#'''Product Development''' – Developing the product.
#'''Market Testing''' – Marketing mix is tested through a trial run of the product.
#'''Commercialization''' – Introducing the product to the public.

==Models==
Conceptual models have been designed in order to facilitate a smooth process. The concept adopted by IDEO, a successful design and consulting firm, is one of the most researched processes in regard to new product development and is a five-step procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moen|first1=Ron|title=A review of the IDEO process|website=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/web-assets/2001/10/a-review-of-the-ideo-process|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps are listed in chronological order:
# Understand and observe the market, the client, the technology, and the limitations of the problem;
# Synthesize the information collected at the first step;
# Visualise new customers using the product;
# Prototype, evaluate and improve the concept;
# Implementation of design changes which are associated with more technologically advanced procedures and therefore this step will require more time.
One of the first developed models that today companies still use in the NPD process is the Booz, Allen and Hamilton (BAH) Model, published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen &amp; Hamilton|first1=Booz|title=New products management for the 1980s|accessdate=22 October 2014|publisher=Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton – original from Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the best known model because it underlies the NPD systems that have been put forward later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruiyan|first1=Nadia|title=A framework for successful new product development|journal=Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management|date=2011|volume=4|issue=4|pages=746–770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model represents the foundation of all the other models that have been developed afterwards. Significant work has been conducted in order to propose better models, but in fact these models can be easily linked to BAH model. The seven steps of BAH model are: new [[product strategy]], idea generation, screening and evaluation, business analysis, development, testing, and commercialization. &lt;br /&gt;
A pioneer of NPD research in the consumers goods sector is Robert G. Cooper. Over the last two decades he conducted significant work in the area of NPD. The Stage-Gate model developed in the 1980s was proposed as a new tool for managing new products development processes.  This was mainly applied to the consumers goods industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Robert|title=Stage-gare systems: A new tool for managing new products|journal=Business Horizons|date=1990|volume=33|issue=3|pages=44–55|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(90)90040-i}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 APQC benchmarking study reveals that 88% of U.S. businesses employ a stage-gate system to manage new products, from idea to launch. In return, the companies that adopt this system are reported to receive benefits such as improved teamwork, improved success rates, earlier detection of failure, a better launch, and even shorter cycle times – reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenneth|first1=Kahn|title=The PDMA handbook of new product development|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-470-64820-9|page=34|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings highlight the importance of the stage-gate model in the area of new product development. &lt;br /&gt;
Over the last few years, the [[Lean Startup]] movement has grown in popularity, challenging many of the assumptions inherent in the stage-gate model.

==Marketing considerations==
There have been a number of approaches proposed for analyzing and responding to the marketing challenges of new product development.  Two of these are ''the eight stages'' process of Peter Koen of the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], and a process known as ''the fuzzy front end.''

=== Fuzzy Front End ===

''The Fuzzy Front End'' (FFE) is the messy "getting started" period of new product engineering development processes. It is also referred to as the "Front End of Innovation",&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55" /&gt; or "Idea Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenbosch et al.|first=|date=2006|title=Idea Management: A Systemic View|url=|journal=Journal of Management Studies|volume=43|pages=259-288|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hhk3.kau.se/im/|title=Idea Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the front end where the organization formulates a concept of the product to be developed and decides whether or not to invest resources in the further development of an idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sukhov|first=Alexandre|date=2018|title=The role of perceived comprehension in idea evaluation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/caim.12262|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the phase between first consideration of an opportunity and when it is judged ready to enter the structured development process (Kim and Wilemon, 2007;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = J. | last2 = Wilemon | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Sources and assessment of complexity in NPD projects | url = | journal = R&amp;D Management | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 16–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koen et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koen|first=|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2001|title=Providing clarity and a common language to the 'fuzzy front end'|url=|journal=Research Technology Management|volume=44|issue=2|pages=46–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes all activities from the search for new opportunities through the formation of a germ of an idea to the development of a precise concept. The Fuzzy Front End phase ends when an organization approves and begins formal development of the concept.

Although the Fuzzy Front End may not be an expensive part of product development, it can consume 50% of development time (see Chapter 3 of the Smith and Reinertsen reference below),&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Preston G. and Reinertsen, Donald G. (1998) ''Developing Products in Half the Time'', 2nd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is where major commitments are typically made involving time, money, and the product's nature, thus setting the course for the entire project and final end product. Consequently, this phase should be considered as an essential part of development rather than something that happens "before development," and its cycle time should be included in the total development cycle time.

Koen et al. (2001), distinguish five different front-end elements (not necessarily in a particular order):&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55"/&gt;
# Opportunity Identification
# Opportunity Analysis
# Idea Genesis
# Idea Selection
# Idea and Technology Development
* The first element is the opportunity identification. In this element, large or incremental business and technological chances are identified in a more or less structured way. Using the guidelines established here, resources will eventually be allocated to new projects.... which then lead to a structured NPPD (New Product &amp; Process Development) strategy.
* The second element is the opportunity analysis. It is done to translate the identified opportunities into implications for the business and technology specific context of the company. Here extensive efforts may be made to align ideas to target customer groups and do market studies and/or technical trials and research.
* The third element is the idea genesis, which is described as evolutionary and iterative process progressing from birth to maturation of the opportunity into a tangible idea. The process of the idea genesis can be made internally or come from outside inputs, e.g. a supplier offering a new material/technology or from a customer with an unusual request.
* The fourth element is the idea selection. Its purpose is to choose whether to pursue an idea by analyzing its potential business value.
* The fifth element is the idea and technology development. During this part of the front-end, the business case is developed based on estimates of the total available market, customer needs, investment requirements, competition analysis and project uncertainty. Some organizations consider this to be the first stage of the NPPD process (i.e., Stage 0).

A universally acceptable definition for Fuzzy Front End or a dominant framework has not been developed so far.&lt;ref&gt;Husig and Kohn (2003), Factors influencing the Front End of the Innovation Process: A comprehensive Review of Selected empirical NPD and explorative FFE Studies, Brusell, Juni 2003, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a glossary of PDMA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PDMA Glossary for New Product Development|publisher=Product Development &amp; Management Association|year=2006|url=http://www.pdma.org/npd_glossary.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321075449/http://www.pdma.org/npd_glossary.cfm|archivedate=2009-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is mentioned that the Fuzzy Front End generally consists of three tasks: strategic planning, idea generation, and pre-technical evaluation. These activities are often chaotic, unpredictable, and unstructured. In comparison, the subsequent new product development process is typically structured, predictable, and formal.
The term ''Fuzzy Front End '' was first popularized by Smith and Reinertsen (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Preston G., Reinertsen Donald G. (1991) Developing products in half the time, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York&lt;/ref&gt;
R.G. Cooper (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R.G. Predevelopment activities determine new product success, in: Industrial Marketing Management, Vol.17 (1988), No 2, pp. 237–248&lt;/ref&gt;  it describes the early stages of NPPD as a four-step process in which ideas are generated (I), subjected to a preliminary technical and market assessment (II) and merged to coherent product concepts (III) which are finally judged for their fit with existing product strategies and portfolios (IV). 

=== Other conceptualisations ===
Other authors have divided predevelopment product development activities differently. 

====The Phase Zero of the Stage-Gate Model of New Product Development====
The Stage-Gate model of NPD predevelopment activities are summarised in Phase zero and one,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=R.G.|date=|title=What’s Next?: After Stage-Gate|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5437/08956308X5606963|journal=Research-Technology Management|volume=57|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in respect to earlier definition of  predevelopment activities:&lt;ref&gt;Cooper R.G., Edgett, S.J. (2008), Maximizing productivity in product innovation, in: Research Technology Management, March 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

# Preliminary
# Technical assessment
# [[Supply chain|Source-of-supply]] assessment: suppliers and partners or alliances
# [[Market research]]: market size and segmentation analysis, VoC ([[voice of the customer]]) research
# Product idea testing
# [[Customer value proposition|Customer value]] assessment
# Product definition
# Business and financial analysis

These activities yield essential information to make a Go/No-Go to Development decision. These decisions represent the Gates in the Stage-Gate model.

==== Early Phase of the Innovation Process ====
A conceptual model of Front-End Process was proposed which includes early phases of the innovation process. This model is structured in three phases and three gates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Husig|first1=S|last2=Kohn|first2=S|last3=Poskela|first3=J|year=2005|title=The Role of Process Formalisation in the early Phases of the Innovation Process|conference=12th Int. Prod. Development Conf|place=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Phase 1: Environmental screening or opportunity identification stage in which external changes will be analysed and translated into potential business opportunities.
* Phase 2: Preliminary definition of an idea or concept.
* Phase 3: Detailed product, project or service definition, and Business planning.

The gates are:

* Opportunity screening
* Idea evaluation
* Go/No-Go for development

The final gate leads to a dedicated new product development project. Many professionals and academics consider that the general features of Fuzzy Front End (fuzziness, ambiguity, and uncertainty) make it difficult to see the FFE as a structured process, but rather as a set of interdependent activities ( e.g. Kim and Wilemon, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J., Wilemon, D. (2002): Accelerating the Front End Phase in New Product Development  [http://www.iamot.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Husig et al., 2005 [10] argue that front-end not need to be fuzzy, but can be handled in a structured manner.  In fact Carbone &lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Carbone, Critical Success Factors in the Front-End of High Technology Industry New Product Development, Doctoral Dissertation, University of Alabama in Huntsville, November, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Carbone, et al.,''Front-end success factors and the impact on high technology industry new product development.'' 2012 IEEE International Technology Management Conference, Dallas, Tx, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that when using the front end success factors in an integrated process, product success is increased. Peter Koen&lt;ref name="koen2004"&gt;{{citation|last=Koen|first=Peter A.|title=The Fuzzy Front End for Incremental, Platform, and Breakthrough Products|year=2004|journal=PDMA Handbook of New Product Development, 2nd Ed.|pages=81–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that in the FFE for incremental, platform and radical projects, three separate strategies and processes are typically involved.&lt;ref name="koen2004" /&gt; The traditional Stage Gate (TM) process was designed for incremental product development, namely for a single product. The FFE for developing a new platform must start out with a strategic vision of where the company wants to develop products and this will lead to a family of products. Projects for breakthrough products start out with a similar strategic vision, but are associated with technologies which require new discoveries.

==== Activity view on Fuzzy-Front End ====
Predevelopment is the initial stage in NPD and consists of numerous activities, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khurana|first1=A|last2=Rosenthal|first2=S.R.|title=Towards Holistic 'Front Ends' in New Product Development|doi=10.1016/S0737-6782(97)00066-0|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|volume=15|year=1998|issue=1|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* product strategy formulation and communication
* opportunity identification and assessment
* idea generation
* product definition
* project planning
* executive reviews

Economical analysis, benchmarking of competitive products and modeling and prototyping are also important activities during the front-end activities.

The outcomes of FFE are the:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

* mission statement
* customer needs
* details of the selected idea
* product definition and specifications
* economic analysis of the product
* the development schedule
* project staffing and the budget
* a business plan aligned with corporate strategy

Incremental, platform and breakthrough products include:&lt;ref name="koen2004"/&gt;
* ''Incremental products'' are considered to be cost reductions, improvements to existing product lines, additions to existing platforms and repositioning of existing products introduced in markets.
* ''Breakthrough products'' are new to the company or new to the world and offer a 5–10 times or greater improvement in performance combined with a 30–50% or greater reduction in costs.
* ''Platform products'' establish a basic architecture for a next generation product or process and are substantially larger in scope and resources than incremental projects.

==Strategies==
* [[Lean product development]]
* [[Design for six sigma]]
* [[Quality function deployment]]
* [[Phase–gate model]]
* [[User-centered design]]

&lt;ref&gt;Gary Armstrong, P. K. (2013). Marketing an introduction (11th ed.). Harlow, England: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies must take a holistic approach to managing this process and must continue to innovate and develop new products if they want to grow and prosper.
* CUSTOMER CENTERED New Product Development. Focuses on:
** Finding new ways to solve customer problems.
** Create more customer-satisfying experience
*: Companies often rely on technology, but the real success comes from understanding customer needs and values.
*: The most successful companies were the ones that:
** Differentiated from others
** Solved major customer problems
** Offered a compelling customer value proposition
** Engaged customer directly
* TEAM BASED New Product Development
** An approach:
** To deserving new products in which various company's departments work closely together overlapping the steps in the product development process in order to:
*** Save time
*** Increase effectiveness
** Company departments work closely together in cross functional teams overlapping the steps in the product development process (to save time and increase effectiveness).
** Those departments are: legal, marketing, finances, design and manufacturing, suppliers and customer companies.
** If there is a problem, all the company can work.
* SYSTEMATIC New Product Development
** Development process should be holistic (alternative) and systematic not to good ideas die.
** This process is installed on Innovation Management System that collect, review, evaluate new product ideas and manage
*** the company appoints to a senior person to be the Innovation Manager who encourage all the company
*** employees, suppliers, distributors and dealers to become involved in finding and developing new products.
** Then, there is a Cross-Functional Innovation Management Committee which:
*** Evaluate new products ideas
*** Help bringing good ideas
** To sum up, New-Product success requires:
** New ways to create valued customer experience, from generating and screening new product ideas to create and roll out want-satisfying products.
* New Product Development IN TURBULENT TIMES
** When we are in a tough economic situation usually management reduces spending on: new-product development. Usually it is done from a short-sighted point of view.
** Tough times might even call for:
*** Greater new-product development, offering solutions for changing customer needs and tastes.
*** Innovation helps
*** Making the company more competitive
*** Positioning it better for future.
* [[Virtual product development]]
** Uses collaboration technology to remove need for co-located teams
** Reduces G&amp;A overhead costs of consulting firms
** Advent of 24-hour development cycle

{{About|the [[Socratic dialogue]] by [[Xenophon]]|the similarly named treatise sometimes said to be written by [[Aristotle]]|Economics (Aristotle)}}
The '''''Oeconomicus''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Οἰκονομικός}}) by [[Xenophon]] is a [[Socratic method|Socratic]] dialogue principally about [[household]] [[management]] and [[agriculture]]. 

It is one of the earliest works on [[economics]] in its original sense of household management, and a significant source for the social and intellectual history of Classical [[history of Athens|Athens]]. Beyond the emphasis on household economics, the dialogue treats such topics as the qualities and relationships of men and women, [[rural]] vs. [[urban area|urban]] life, [[slavery]], [[religion]], and [[education]].

[[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] states that the ''Oeconomicus'' can actually be seen as a treatise on success in leading both an army and a state.

Scholars lean towards a relatively late date in Xenophon's life for the composition of the ''Oeconomicus'', perhaps after 362 BC. [[Cicero]] translated the ''Oeconomicus'' into [[Latin]], and the work gained popularity during the [[Renaissance]] in a number of translations.

==Summary==
The opening framing dialogue is between  Socrates and Critoboulus, the son of [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]]. There Socrates discusses  the meaning of wealth and identifies it with usefulness and well-being, not merely possessions. He links [[moderation]] and hard [[manual labour|work]] to success in household management. The dramatic date of this part of the work can be no earlier than 401 BC, as the [[Battle of Cunaxa]] is referred to at 4.18.

When Critoboulus asks about the practices involved in household management, Socrates pleads ignorance on the subject but relates what he heard of it from an Athenian  [[gentleman]]-[[farmer]] (''[[kalokagathia|kaloskagathos]]'') named Ischomachus. In the discussion related by Socrates, Ischomachus describes the methods he used to educate his wife in [[housekeeping]], their practices in [[governance|ruling]] and [[training]] slaves, and the [[technology]] involved in farming. Approximately two thirds of the dialogue concerns the discussion between Socrates and Ischomachus. There is no final reversion to further discussion with Critoboulos.

==Commentary and interpretation==
[[Leo Strauss]] wrote a [[political]]-[[philosophical]] commentary on the dialogue. He took the ''Oeconomicus'' as a more [[irony|ironic]] examination of the nature of the gentleman, [[virtue]], and domestic relationships.

[[Michel Foucault]] devoted a chapter in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976–1984) to "Ischomachus' Household". He took Xenophon's depiction of the relationship between Ischomachus and his wife as a classical expression of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[ideology]] of [[political power|power]], according to which a man's control of his [[emotions]] was externally reflected in his control of his wife, his slaves, and his political subordinates. 

Following Foucault, [[feminist]] [[scholars]] and [[social history|social historians]] such as [[Sarah B. Pomeroy|Sarah Pomeroy]] have explored the ''Oeconomicus'' as a source for Greek attitudes to the relationship between men and women, but successive interpretations have differed. Some see Xenophon's attitude toward women as [[misogynist]] and [[patriarchal]], while others maintain that he was a proto-feminist in certain ways.  

Some have taken Xenophon's use of Ischomachus as a supposed [[expert]] in the education of a wife as an instance of anachronistic irony, a device used by [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogues]]. This ironic line of interpretation sees Ischomachus as a target of [[satire]] rather than a stand-in for Xenophon. Some have suggested that the Ischomachus of the dialogue is the same man whose family became the subject of ridicule in Athenian political oratory. After this Ischomachus died, his widow moved in with her daughter and son-in-law Callias and soon became pregnant with the man's child, which eventually led to the daughter's [[suicide]] attempt. Callias was frequently parodied in Athenian comedies for his [[Human sexuality|sexual]] excesses and [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectualism]].

The import of such irony has also been the subject of much contention: are his wife's actions a sign of a bad education or just the inevitable result of the loss of the controlling influence in her life? How responsible was Ischomachus for his daughter's marriage to a man of such poor [[moral character|character]]?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6355">The '''patriarch hypothesis''' is a hypothesis that explains the occurrence of [[menopause]] in human females and how a long post-fertile period (up to one third of a females life-span)&lt;ref&gt;Harman, S.M. and Talbert, G.B. (1985). Reproductive aging. In: Handbook of the Biology of Aging, by C. E. Finch and L. Hayflick (eds). pp 457-510. Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; could confer an evolutionary advantage. It is an alternative theory to the [[grandmother hypothesis]] which tends to ignore male benefits of continued spermatogenesis and their roles in assistance.

The patriarch hypothesis incorporates these neglected areas. It suggests selection pressure on male [[longevity]] extended the female lifespan; whose adjustment of [[Life history theory|life history]] has been constrained by the size of the ovaries – resulting in human females surviving beyond the age at which they can reproduce. With an extension of the post-reproductive female life stage, they could enhance their inclusive fitness by giving [[kin selection|kin assistance]]. This way, with no choice in the timing of fertility termination, females are optimising an essentially bad situation.

[[Frank Marlowe (gerontologist)|Frank Marlowe]] first put forward the patriarch hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Marlowe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marlowe | first1 = F | year = 1999 | title = Male care and mating effort among Hadza foragers | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 57–64 | doi=10.1007/s002650050592}}&lt;/ref&gt; He postulates that if women survive beyond an age at which they can reproduce and men continue [[spermatogenesis]], then old males can benefit greatly if they can copulate with younger females. It is theorised that increased use of tools and weapons compensates for the decline in natural fighting ability with age.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, F. (2000). The Patriarch Hypothesis: An Alternative Explanation of Menopause. Human Nature. 11(1): 27-42.&lt;/ref&gt; This serves to produce a more stable male hierarchy, where attainment of high social status and reproductive access is less reliant on physical strength.

With such a scenario older males are able to retain a competitive ability with younger males, thereby asserting a selection pressure on extending longevity in males that could retain social status. Higher ranking males may also be a more attractive mate choice. One mechanism that could extend the lifespan is delaying the age at maturity. Offspring with a slower life history would exhibit a protracted period of dependence. If depletion of [[oocytes]] occurs at age 50, females should selectively counter this as it reduces their [[fecundity]].

Recruitment of help from kin and husbands may compensate by enabling females to reduce birth intervals by weaning offspring at an earlier age. In addition, by passing on longevity to her sons, a female would stand to gain [[inclusive fitness]].&lt;ref name="Marlowe" /&gt;

==Evidence for==
The patriarch hypothesis rests on three assumptions:

*Older males must reproduce.
*:It is clear that older males do reproduce, as the oldest verified paternity is 94 years, 35 years beyond the oldest documented birth attributed to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seymour | first1 = F.I. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = C. | last3 = Koerner | first3 = A. | year = 1935 | title = A case of authenticated fertility in a man of 94 | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1423–1424 | doi=10.1001/jama.1935.92760440002009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The allele for slowing life history and extending longevity is not on the Y chromosome.
*:To date a ‘longevity’ gene(s) is still elusive. However, [[Ink4|INK4]]a/ARF situated on the human chromosome 9p21 does appear to act as a tumour suppressor&lt;ref&gt;Sharpless, N.E. (2004a). Ink4a/Arf Links Senescence and Aging. Experimental Gerontology. In Press. – available via www.sciencedirect.com.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore extending longevity.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpless, N.E. (2004b).

In Press – available via www.sciencedirect.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Increasing the ovarian follicular reserve is difficult.
*:There are few explanations on density restrictive mechanisms other than physical size. [[NOS3]] has been proposed as a candidate gene for the regulation and timing of reproductive functions, such as menopause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tempfer | first1 = C. | last2 = Moreno | first2 = R.M. | last3 = O'Brien | first3 = W.E. | last4 = Gregg | first4 = A.R. | year = 2000 | title = Genetic Contributions of the Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Gene to Ovulation and Menopause in a Mouse Model | url = | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 73 | issue = 5| pages = 1025–1031 | doi=10.1016/s0015-0282(00)00417-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is unclear why timing has not adjusted with longevity. More importantly there is a lack of understanding why 70-99.9% of mammalian follicles are subjected to [[Ovarian follicle atresia|atresia]]. Future analysis of the differential expression of genes of the [[bcl-2]] family may hold the key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hsueh | first1 = A.J.W. | last2 = Billing | first2 = H. | last3 = Tsafriri | first3 = A. | year = 1994 | title = Ovarian Follicle Atresia: A Hormonally Controlled Apoptotic Process | url = | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 707–725 | doi=10.1210/er.15.6.707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longevity is a central determinant of the [[grandmother hypothesis]]; selection for greater longevity in males, as suggested by the patriarch hypothesis, could extend female lifespan, provided such a gene is not on the Y chromosome. Males have much to gain from late reproduction, even if they die shortly after conception.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, M. (2005). Why do females (especially human females) survive beyond an age at which they can reproduce? Sussex University Press. Brighton&lt;/ref&gt; Females that found their longevity extended, were constrained by the difficulties of increasing their follicular reserves and thus could enhance their inclusive fitness by giving kin assistance.

'''Pop culture pathology''' (or '''Popular culture pathology''') is the forensic study of [[popular culture]] in fields such as celebrity,&lt;ref&gt;Gans, J.H. (1999). ''Popular Culture and High Culture: an analysis and evaluation of taste''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; music, fashion, food, aesthetic desire, television, as well as additional and often obscure media and stimuli. Pop culture pathology is an obscure branch of both [[Critical Theory]] and [[Cultural Studies]].

Originating in private universities in the United States around the turn of the millennium, pop culture pathology is the systematic attempt to analyze trends in culture in order to examine more closely the relationships that the individual has to the world around them. The studies include experiments with the [[aesthetic]] experiences that people have in common, with the goal being to uncover the intrinsic trend that allows for the phenomenon of extrinsic trends. Some common philosophical foundations for this tradition are [[Michel Foucault]] and the philosophy of [[deconstruction]] pioneered by [[Jacques Derrida]].

== The Botto Experiment==
The most common way to test theories in pop culture pathology is to attempt to simulate situations of complete cultural ignorance. For example, a test done in 2005 at University of California, Berkeley, is referred to as the "Botto Experiment".  A young student named Nicholas Botto was given a CD on its release date that had received no radio play and which he had no exposure to. He listened to only this album for two months and was readmitted to society. He was told to return in a year's time with 5 albums that he found he enjoyed in light of the album he had been assigned. In the experiment the album that was famously used was ''In An Aeroplane Over The Sea'' by the [[indie rock]] band [[Neutral Milk Hotel]]. The style of music was known as "[[Lo-Fi]]" which was uncommon at the time. A year later Botto returned with five similar albums. His choices perfectly predicted a generation of music in the Lo-Fi genre, opening the door for pop culture pathology to be known as a legitimate subject.

==Implications of Popular Culture Pathology==
The postmodern implications of this type of experimentation are still being realized by scientists and philosophers. By assigning meaning to a certain cultural item the person conducting the experiment is deciding what will matter in the entirety of the next year for the subject. It seems to go without saying that this type of influence poses solutions for current cultural trends that are deemed "immoral." By making the greater good more fashionable socially many of the worlds problems have the potential to be fixed in the future.

===Failures of Popular Culture Pathology===
Unfortunately the Botto Experiment caused irreversible side effects. The cultural boom that the experiment predicted engulfed the subject forcing an end to the next stage of the experiment.  Next, the subject was supposed to be given the same album a second time and told to return with an additional five. The second phase was supposed to show the instability of modern society and the impossibility of forcing the individual to move against it. This was proven wrong as the subject returned to the same five albums as before, effectively ruining the study.

===Macro Ventures in PCP===
This type of experiment has taken place on different scales and in different ways. For example, the [[Music Genome Project]] has created a service known as [[Pandora Radio]] that allows the user to connect with various types of music according to extremely limited initial criteria. This type of conditioning is also present in the latest incarnation of Apple's [[iTunes]]. The new "Genius" feature allows the user to discover music that perpetuates their current cultural trend, furthering the flawed results of the perplexing but vastly studied Botto Experiment.

==What comes next?==
Academia has been waiting anxiously for the next manifestation of popular culture pathology.  The anticipation has caused the creation of two different views on the subject. One, pioneered in the United States, predicts that the science will next try to cause moral reform. Much fear surrounds this popular view but more than that there is suspicion that the sentiment has simply been placed at the influence of another experiment in the field itself. Given the ironic nature of the study it seems likely that the next manifestation will be at the hands of the next philosopher daring enough to repeat the Botto Experiment with a focus on the field of popular culture pathology instead of popular culture itself.

The second prediction arose in Europe and is more secular. Philosophers there believe that popular culture pathology is the end of the moral focus of the "new world." The term "new world" has been used here in order to call attention to the fact that the Americas have habitually been ahead of Europe technologically, but far behind intellectually. The idea that morality is facing its doom is generally coming, again, from postmodern European philosophy (see [[Nietzsche]], [[Baudrillard]], [[Heidegger]]) predicting the realization that meaning is being assigned by the institution not the individual. This brings the field back to Michel Foucault and the problem of the individual. This view harbors intense curiosity at the cyclical nature of the study. In the end only time will tell the future of this curious new field of study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">'''Preservation survey''' (also known as '''condition survey''', '''conservation needs survey''' or '''preservation assessment''') is the process of collecting and analyzing data about the physical condition of [[library]] materials.

Preservation surveys are used by libraries to determine the condition of their collections and identify necessary actions for preserving, conserving or repairing materials.  They are most often conducted at research and university libraries.

Preservation surveys are often the first step when planning and implementing a preservation program in a library.  By collecting data and compiling statistics about a collection’s condition, library staff can determine environmental threats and preservation needs.  It is also possible to use the resulting data to predict future deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Robert DeCandido. “Condition Survey of the United States History, Local History and Genealogy Collection of the New York Public Library,” ''Library Resources and Technical Services'', 33,3 (July, 1989), 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since preservation needs usually well exceed an institution’s resources, the data acquired in an assessment can aid libraries in establishing priorities in regard to deteriorating materials.&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Baird, Jana Krentz, and Brad Schaffner, “Findings from the Condition Surveys Conducted by the University of Kansas Libraries,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 58, 2 (March 1997), 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Ross Harvey wrote in his ''Preservation in Libraries'', the data from surveys can "be used to plan how best to deploy available resources."&lt;ref&gt;Ross Harvey, ''Preservation in Libraries: Principles, Strategies and Practices for Librarians'', London: Bowker-Saur, 1993, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The need for surveying library materials was born of the increasing awareness of the problem of brittle books.  [[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]]’s ''Deterioration of Book Stock: Problems and Remedies'' from 1959 alerted the library world to the alarmingly short shelf life of books composed of acidic paper.  While major libraries had estimated high percentages of acidic books,&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 111.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn’t until 1979 that an empirical study was conducted on a library collection to determine its condition.  This study,&lt;ref&gt;Sara Buchanan and Sandra Coleman, “Deterioration Survey of the Stanford University Libraries Green Library Stack Collection,” In ''Preservation Planning Program Resource Notebook'', comp. Pamela W. Darling (Washington DC: Association of Research Libraries, Office of Management Studies, 1987): 159-230.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Stanford University]]’s Green Library, was a benchmark in the field and established the methodology for conducting preservation surveys in research libraries.

[[Yale University]] conducted a large-scale assessment of its library materials in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 111-132.&lt;/ref&gt; that is also considered a landmark in the field.  Yale’s survey sounded the warning bell for research libraries worldwide, discovering that 86% of the more that 36,500 books in the sample were either brittle or composed of paper with an acidic pH.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting a Survey==
Many preservation surveys are conducted by collecting data on a random sample of items.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carl Drott, "Random Sampling: A Tool for Library Research," ''College and Research Libraries'' 30 (March 1969), 119-125&lt;/ref&gt;  University librarians may consult with the institution’s statistics department to design a reliable sampling plan.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  A random sample may be derived by the randomization of call numbers, by the creation of a sampling frame that assigns a unique number to each item in the target population&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; or by generating random numbers and locating volumes by counting on the shelf.&lt;ref&gt;Robert DeCandido. “Condition Survey of the United States History, Local History and Genealogy Collection of the New York Public Library,” ''Library Resources and Technical Services'', 33,3 (January, 1989), 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot survey of a small sample population may be run prior to the actual survey in order to address any problems with the sampling plan or the survey questions.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Walker, Jane Greenfield, John Fox, and Jeffrey S. Simonoff, “The Yale Survey: A Large-Scale Study of Book Deterioration in the Yale University Library,” ''College and Research Libraries'', 46 (March 1985), 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pilot survey may reveal unclear or ambiguous wording, superfluous questions, or existing conditions that have not been addressed.

After the pilot survey, the library may hold a workshop to train surveyors to properly collect data and handle materials.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Chrzastowski, David Cobb, Nancy Davis, Jean Geil, and Betsy Kruger “Library Collection Deterioration: A Study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,” College and Research Libraries, 50, 5 (September 1989): 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
Qillqatani is the first archaeological site in the [[Lake Titicaca]] basin to be systematically excavated. Archaeologists have identified 36 cultural strata at the site. From 7500 to 4000 [[Before present|BP]], Qillqatani was inhabited by hunter-gatherers as a seasonal campsite. These early occupants hunted mostly camelids, and some deer.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}} From 3660 BP onwards, Qillqatani was inhabited by pastoralist camelid-herders who built houses and began to occupy the site long-term.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}} These later occupants also began to trade with people from lower attitudes to obtain ''[[Chenopodium]]''.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}}

The '''''Software Engineering Body of Knowledge''''' ('''SWEBOK''') is an international standard ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897|title=ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying a guide to the generally accepted Software Engineering Body of Knowledge.

The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) has been created through cooperation among several professional bodies and members of industry and is published by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] ([[IEEE]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Guide to the software engineering body of knowledge : 2004 version," Library of Congress Online Catalog, 2005, http://lccn.loc.gov/2005921729. Retrieved 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard can be accessed freely from the [[IEEE Computer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/home |title=SWEBOK |publisher=Computer.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, SWEBOK V3 was approved for publication and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/pressroom/New-Version-of-Guide-to-the-Software-Engineering-Body-of-Knowledge-Approved |title=New Version of Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge Approved | accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the IEEE Computer Society kicked off the SWEBoK Evolution effort to develop future iterations of the body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/web/peb/swebok-evolution |title=SWEBoK Evolution | accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SWEBOK Version 3==
The published version of SWEBOK V3 has the following 15 [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:

* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* [[Software engineering management]]
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering]] models and methods
* [[Software quality]]
* [[Software engineering professional practice]]
* [[Software engineering economics]]
* Computing foundations
* Mathematical foundations
* Engineering foundations

It also recognized, but did not define, these related disciplines:

* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Systems engineering]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* General [[management]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Mathematics]]

== 2004 Edition of the SWEBOK ==
The 2004 edition of the SWEBOK guide defined ten [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:
* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* Software engineering management ([[Engineering management]])
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering tools and methods]]
* [[Software quality]]

The SWEBOK also defines disciplines related to software engineering:
* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Management]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* Software ergonomics ([[Cognitive ergonomics]])
* [[Systems engineering]]

== Similar Efforts ==
A similar effort to define a body of knowledge for software engineering is the "Computing Curriculum Software Engineering (CCSE)," officially named [[Software Engineering 2004]] (SE2004). The curriculum largely overlaps with the 2004 SWEBOK V2 because the SWEBOK has been used as one of its sources; however, it is more directed towards academia. Whereas the [[SWEBOK]] Guide defines the [[software engineering]] knowledge that practitioners should have after four years of practice, SE2004 defines the knowledge that an [[undergraduate]] software engineering student should possess upon graduation (including knowledge of mathematics, general engineering principles, and other related areas). SWEBOK V3 aims to address these intersections.

'''Solemyidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of saltwater clams, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] protobranch [[bivalve]] [[mollusk]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Solemyoida]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur William Baden Powell|Powell A. W. B.]], ''New Zealand Mollusca'', [[HarperCollins|William Collins Publishers Ltd]], Auckland, New Zealand (1979) {{ISBN|0-00-216906-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Solemyids are remarkable in that their digestive tract is either extremely small or non-existent, and their feeding appendages are too short to reach outside the shell.&lt;ref&gt;Reid R. G. B. (1989) The unwhole organism. [http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/3/1133/ American Zoologist 29:1133-1140]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that these clams host [[sulphur]]-[[oxidizing]] [[bacteria]] intracellularly within their [[gill]] filaments. As [[chemoautotrophs]], these bacterial [[symbionts]] synthesize organic matter from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and are the primary source of nutrition for the whole organism.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh C. M., Abbott M. S., Veenhuis M. (1988) Immunochemical localization of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in the symbiont-containing gills of Solemya velum (Bivalvia, Mollusca). [http://www.pnas.org/content/85/20/7786 PNAS 85:7786–7789]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart F. J., Cavanaugh, C. M. (2006) Bacterial endosymbioses in Solemya (Mollusca: Bivalvia) – Model systems for studies of symbiont-host adaptation. [http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 90: 343-360] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130202220900/http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ |date=2013-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the animal host provides its symbionts a habitat in which they have access to the substrates of chemoautotrophy (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced inorganic compounds such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Together, these partners create "animals" with novel metabolic capabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32834">'''Steam-assisted gravity drainage''' (SAGD; "Sag-D") is an [[enhanced oil recovery]] technology for producing [[heavy crude oil]] and [[Asphalt|bitumen]]. It is an advanced form of [[steam injection (oil industry)|steam stimulation]] in which a pair of [[Directional drilling|horizontal well]]s is drilled into the [[Petroleum reservoir|oil reservoir]], one a few metres above the other. High pressure steam is continuously injected into the upper [[wellbore]] to heat the oil and reduce its [[viscosity]], causing the heated oil to drain into the lower wellbore, where it is pumped out. Dr. Roger Butler, engineer at Imperial Oil from 1955 to 1982, invented the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process in the 1970s. Butler "developed the concept of using horizontal pairs of wells and injected steam to develop certain deposits of bitumen considered too deep for mining".&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; In 1983 Butler became director of technical programs for the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] (AOSTRA),&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AOSTRA is now known as the Alberta Energy Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]] created by Alberta [[Peter Lougheed|Premier Lougheed]] to promote new technologies for [[oil sands]] and [[heavy crude oil]] production. AOSTRA quickly supported SAGD as a promising innovation in oil sands extraction technology.&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt;

Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) [[Steam_injection_(oil_industry)]] are two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes used in the oil sands &lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang"&gt;{{cite conference|title=Review of Thermal Recovery Technologies for the Clearwater and Lower Grand Rapids Formations in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta|author1=Qi Jiang|author2=Bruce Thornton|author3=Jen Russel-Houston|author4=Steve Spence|publisher=Osum Oil Sands Corp|conference=Canadian International Petroleum Conference|url=http://www.osumcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/CIPC_Review-of-Thermal-Recovery-Technologies-for-the-Clearwater-and-Lower-Grand-Rapids-Formations-in-the-Cold-Lake-Area-of-Alberta.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Formation (stratigraphy)|Geological formation]] sub-units, such as Grand Rapids Formation, Clearwater Formation, McMurray Formation, General Petroleum Sand, Lloydminster Sand, of the [[Mannville Group]], a [[Geochronology|Stratigraphic range]] in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]].

Canada is now the single largest supplier of imported oil to the United States, supplying over 35% of US imports, much more than Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, and more than all the [[OPEC]] countries combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbblpd_m.htm |title=U.S. Imports by Country of Origin |work=EIA |accessdate=3 February 2015 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the new production comes from Alberta's vast oil sands deposits. There are two primary methods of oil sands recovery. The strip-mining technique is more familiar to the general public, but can only be used for shallow bitumen deposits. However, the more recent steam-assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) is better suited to the much larger deep deposits that surround the shallow ones. Much of the expected future growth of production in the Canadian oil sands is predicted to be from SAGD.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011"&gt;{{cite report|publisher=The Water-Energy Nexus|title=Adding Water to the Energy Agenda|series=A World Policy Paper|author1=Diana Glassman|author2=Michele Wucker|author3=Tanushree Isaacman|author4=Corinne Champilou|author5=Annie Zhou|date=March 2011|url=http://www.nationalfoodhub.com/images/THE_WATER-ENERGY_NEXUS_REPORT.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

{{quote|"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling. As a specific example of an underlying data weakness, this figure excludes the increasingly important steam-assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) method."|The Water-Energy Nexus 2011}}

Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage emissions are equivalent to what is emitted by the steam flood projects which have long been used to produce heavy oil in California's [[Kern River Oil Field]] and elsewhere around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tar-sands-extraction-without-strip-mining/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The SAGD process of heavy oil or bitumen production is an enhancement on the [[Steam injection (oil industry)| steam injection]] techniques originally developed to produce heavy oil from the [[Kern River Oil Field]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.spe.org/dl/docs/2011/Law.pdf | last = Law | first = David | title = A New Heavy Oil Recovery Technology to Maximize Performance and to Maximize Performance and Minimize Environmental Impact | work = SPE Distinguished Lecturer Program | publisher  = [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to all steam flooding processes is to deliver heat to the producing formation to reduce the viscosity of the heavy oil and enable it to move toward the producing well. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process developed for the California heavy oil fields was able to produce oil from some portions of the Alberta oil sands, such as the [[Cold Lake oil sands]], but did not work as well to produce bitumen from heavier and deeper [[McMurray Formation | deposits]] in the [[Athabasca oil sands]] and [[Peace River oil sands]], where the majority of Alberta's oil sands reserves lie. To produce these much larger reserves, the SAGD process was developed, primarily by Dr. Roger Butler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html | title = Dr. Roger M. Butler | work = Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame | publisher  = [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Imperial Oil]] with the assistance of the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] and industry partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Practical_Reservoir_Simulation.html?id=qUx5t8oPlZAC | title = Practical Reservoir Simulation: Using, Assessing, and Developing Results | last = Carlson | first = M.R. | publisher  = [[PennWell Books]] | date = 1 January 2003 | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAGD process is estimated by the [[National Energy Board]] to be economic when oil prices are at least US$30 to $35 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/rprt/archive/pprtntsndchllngs20152006/pprtntsndchllngs20152006-eng.pdf | title = Canada's Oil Sands: Opportunities and Challenges to 2015 | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the SAGD process, two parallel horizontal [[oil well]]s are drilled in the [[Petroleum geology|formation]], one about 4 to 6 metres above the other. The upper well injects steam, and the lower one collects the heated [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen that flows down due to gravity, plus recovered water from the condensation of the injected steam. The basis of the SAGD process is that thermal communication is established with the reservoir so that the injected steam forms a "steam chamber". The heat from the steam reduces the [[viscosity]] of the heavy crude oil or bitumen which allows it to flow down into the lower wellbore. The steam and associated gas rise because of their low density compared to the heavy crude oil below, ensuring that steam is not produced at the lower production well, tend to rise in the steam chamber, filling the void space left by the oil. Associated gas forms, to a certain extent, an insulating heat blanket above (and around) the steam.&lt;ref name="Holdaway_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=Harness Oil and Gas Big Data with Analytics: Optimize Exploration and Production with Data Driven Models |first=Keith |last=Holdaway |work=Wiley |date=13 May 2014  |accessdate=3 February 2014 |isbn=1118910958 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXaVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=Oil+and+water+flow+is+by+a+countercurrent,+gravity+driven+drainage+into+the+lower+well+bore.+The+condensed+water+and&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TE27OxNN7W&amp;sig=AzqWxxf0GAhoRBTj8B99CYBwKhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JDDSVIycCM7HsQTJv4KADg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil and water flow is by a countercurrent, gravity driven drainage into the lower well bore. The condensed water and [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen is recovered to the surface by pumps such as progressive cavity pumps that work well for moving high-viscosity fluids with suspended solids.&lt;ref name="Alberta_Energy_2013"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OilSands/pdfs/FS_SAGD.pdf |format=PDF |title=Talk about SAGD |work=Energy Alberta |date=November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-cool is the difference between the saturation temperature (boiling point) of water at the producer pressure and the actual temperature at the same place where the pressure is measured. The higher the liquid level above the producer the lower the temperature and higher is the sub-cool. However real life reservoirs are invariably heterogeneous therefore it becomes extremely difficult to achieve a uniform sub-cool along the entire horizontal length of a well. As a consequence many operators, when faced with uneven stunted steam chamber development, allow a small quantity of steam to enter into the producer to keep the bitumen in the entire wellbore hot hence keeping its viscosity low with the added benefit of transferring heat to colder parts of the reservoir along the wellbore. Another variation sometimes called Partial SAGD is used when operators deliberately circulate steam in the producer following a long shut-in period or as a startup procedure. Though a high value of sub-cool is desirable from a thermal efficiency standpoint as it generally includes reduction of steam injection rates but it also results in slightly reduced production due to a corresponding higher viscosity and lower mobility of bitumen caused by lower temperature. Another drawback of very high sub-cool is the possibility of steam pressure eventually not being enough to sustain steam chamber development above the injector, sometimes resulting in collapsed steam chambers where condensed steam floods the injector and precludes further development of the chamber.

Continuous operation of the injection and production wells at approximately reservoir pressure eliminates the instability problems that plague all high-pressure and cyclic steam processes and SAGD produces a smooth, even production that can be as high as 70% to 80% of oil in place in suitable reservoirs. The process is relatively insensitive to shale streaks and other vertical barriers to steam and fluid flow because, as the rock is heated, differential thermal expansion allows steam and fluids to gravity flow through to the production well. This allows recovery rates of 60% to 70% of oil in place, even in formations with many thin shale barriers. Thermally, SAGD is generally twice as efficient as the older cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process, and it results in far fewer wells being damaged by the high pressures associated with CSS. Combined with the higher oil recovery rates achieved, this means that SAGD is much more economic than cyclic steam processes where the reservoir is reasonably thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speight | first = James G.  | title = The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum

== History ==

The gravity drainage idea was originally conceived by Dr. Roger Butler, an engineer for [[Imperial Oil]] in the 1970s&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html|title=Dr. Roger M. Butler|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; In 1975 Imperial Oil transferred Butler from Sarnia, Ontario to [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] to head their heavy oil research effort. He tested the concept with Imperial Oil in 1980, in a pilot at [[Cold Lake oil sands|Cold Lake]] which featured one of the first horizontal wells in the industry, with vertical injectors.

=== Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority (AOSTRA) 1974 ===

In 1974, former Premier of Alberta Peter Lougheed created the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] (AOSTRA) as an Alberta [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]] to promote the development and use of new technology for oil sands and heavy crude oil production, and enhanced recovery of conventional crude oil. Its first facility was owned and operated by ten industrial participants and received ample government support (Deutsch and McLennan 2005)&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; including from the [[Alberta Investment Management Corporation|Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund]].&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta-oil-sands-technology-and-research-authority/ | title= Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority.

==== AOSTRA Underground Test Facility 1984 ====

In 1984, AOSTRA initiated the Underground Test Facility in the [[Athabasca oil sands]], located between the MacKay Rivers and the Devon River west of the Syncrude plant as an [[in-situ]] [[Steam assisted gravity drainage|SAGD]] bitumen recovery facility.&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AOSTRA1974"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harbir Chhina keeps Cenovus Energy Inc. running smoothly|publisher=Alberta Oil|first=Marzena|last=Czarnecka|date=1 January 2013|url=http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2013/01/the-executive-vice-president-oil-sands-keeps-cenovus-energy-inc-running-smoothly/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that their first test of twin (horizontal) SAGD wells took place, proving the feasibility of the concept, briefly achieving positive cash flow in 1992 at a production rate of about 2000 bbl/day from 3 well pairs.

=== Foster Creek ===

The Foster Creek plant in Alberta Canada, built in 1996 and operated by [[Cenovus Energy]], was the first commercial Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) project and by 2010 Foster Creek "became the largest commercial SAGD project in Alberta to reach royalty payout status. "&lt;ref name="AOSTRA1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YedlinChhina2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/energy-resources/Yedlin+Showing+cynics+business+done/8545972/story.html?__lsa=50b1-7af0|publisher=Calgary Herald|title=Yedlin: Showing cynics how oil business is done|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=19 June 2013|first=Deborah|last=Yedlin}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original UTF SAGD wells were drilled horizontally from a tunnel in the limestone underburden, accessed with vertical [[Shaft mining|mine shafts]].  The concept coincided with development of directional drilling techniques that allowed companies to drill horizontal wells accurately, cheaply and efficiently, to the point that it became hard to justify drilling a conventional vertical well any more. With the low cost of drilling horizontal well pairs, and the very high [[peak oil|recovery rates]] of the SAGD process (up to 60% of the oil in place), SAGD is economically attractive to oil companies.

At Foster Creek Cenovus has employed its patented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2591498/summary.html?query=cenovus&amp;start=1&amp;num=50&amp;type=basic_search&lt;/ref&gt; 'wedge well' technology to recover residual resources bypassed by regular SAGD operations, this improves the total recovery rate of the operation. The 'wedge well' technology works by accessing the residual bitumen that is bypassed in regular SAGD operations by drilling an infill well between two established operating SAGD well pairs once the SAGD steam chambers have matured to the point where they have merged and are in fluid communication and then what is left to recover in that reservoir area between the operating SAGD well pairs is a 'wedge' of residual, bypassed oil. Wedge well technology has been shown to improve overall recovery rates by 5%-10% at a reduced capital cost as less steam is required once the steam chambers mature to the point where they are in fluid communication and typically at this stage in the recovery process, also commonly known as the 'blow down' phase&lt;ref&gt;https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-165481-MS&lt;/ref&gt;, the injected steam is replaced with a non-condensable gas such as methane, further reducing production costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2011AthabascaCenovusFosterCreekSAGD8623.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current applications ==

This technology is now being exploited due to [[2000s energy crisis|increased oil prices]]. While traditional drilling methods were prevalent up until the 1990s, high crude prices of the 21st Century are encouraging more unconventional methods (such as SAGD) to extract crude oil. The Canadian oil sands have many SAGD projects in progress, since this region is home of one of the largest deposits of bitumen in the world ([[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]] have the world's largest deposits).

The SAGD process allowed the [[Ministry of Energy (Alberta)|Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)]] to increase its proven [[oil reserves]] to 179 billion barrels, which raised Canada's oil reserves to the third highest in the world after [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and approximately quadrupled North American oil reserves. As of 2011, the oil sands reserves stand at around 169 billion barrels.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Oil and water nexus ===

SAGD, a thermal recovery process, consumes large quantities of water and natural gas.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
{{quote|"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling.

"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling." However, by 2011 there was inadequate data on the amount of water used in the increasingly important steam-assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) method.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Evaporators can treat the SAGD produced water to produce high quality freshwater for reuse in SAGD operations.&lt;ref name="Alberta Innovates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lightbown|first1=Vicki|title=NEW SAGD TECHNOLOGIES SHOW PROMISE IN REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OIL SAND PRODUCTION|url=http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925201815/http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-25|website=Alberta Innovates|publisher=Alberta Innovates|accessdate=June 2015|ref=Alberta Innovates}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evaporators produce a high volume blowdown waste which requires further management.&lt;ref name="Alberta Innovates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lightbown|first1=Vicki|title=NEW SAGD TECHNOLOGIES SHOW PROMISE IN REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OIL SAND PRODUCTION|url=http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925201815/http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-25|website=Alberta Innovates|publisher=Alberta Innovates|accessdate=June 2015|ref=Alberta Innovates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of natural gas for steam generation ===

As in all thermal recovery processes, cost of steam generation is a major part of the cost of oil production. Historically, [[natural gas]] has been used as a fuel for Canadian oil sands projects, due to the presence of large [[stranded gas reserve]]s in the oil sands area. However, with the building of natural gas pipelines to outside markets in Canada and the United States, the price of gas has become an important consideration. The fact that natural gas production in Canada has peaked and is now declining is also a problem. Other sources of generating heat are under consideration, notably gasification of the heavy fractions of the produced bitumen to produce [[syngas]], using the nearby (and massive) deposits of [[coal]], or even building [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]] to produce the heat.

=== Use of water for steam generation ===

A source of large amounts of fresh and brackish water and large water re-cycling facilities are required in order to create the steam for the SAGD process. Water is a popular topic for debate in regards to water use and management. As of 2008, American petroleum production (not limited to SAGD) generates over 5 billion gallons of produced water every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph M. Hall, Statement to the Committee on Science and Technology for the Produced Water Utilization Act of 2008, 110th Congress 2d Session, Report 110-801.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Use Breakdown in Alberta 2005|url=http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/GWSW/quantity/waterinalberta/allocation/AL3_purpose.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419171620/http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/GWSW/quantity/waterinalberta/allocation/AL3_purpose.html|archive-date=2012-04-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concern of using large amounts of water has little to do with proportion of water used, rather the quality of the water. Traditionally close to 70 million cubic metres of the water volume that was used in the SAGD process was fresh, surface, water. There has been a significant reduction in fresh water use as of 2010, when approximately 18 million cubic metres were used. Though to offset the drastic reduction in fresh water use, industry has begun to significantly increase the volume of saline [[groundwater]] involved.  This, as well as other, more general water saving techniques have allowed surface water usage by oil sands operations to decrease by more than threefold since production first began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volume and Quality of Water used in Oil and Gas 1976-2010|url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=4 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209182743/http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|archive-date=2011-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Relying upon gravity drainage, SAGD also requires comparatively thick and homogeneous reservoirs, and so is not suitable for all heavy-oil production areas.

== Alternative methods ==

By 2009 the two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes, Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS), were used in oil sands production in the [[Clearwater Formation|Clearwater]] and [[Lower Grand Rapids Formation]]s in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) ===

[[Canadian Natural Resources]] employs cyclic steam or "huff and puff" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection to fracture and heat the formation prior to the production phases. First steam is injected above the formation fracture point for several weeks or months, mobilizing cold bitumen, the well is then shut in for several weeks or months to allow the steam to soak into the formation. Then the flow on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir.&lt;ref name="CNRL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|publisher=CNRL|year=2013|title=Cyclic Steam Stimulation|series=Thermal in situ oil sands|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016105950/http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) also has a number of CSS Follow-up or Enhancement Processes, including Pressure Up and Blow Down (PUBD), Mixed Well Steam Drive and Drainage (MWSDD), Vapor Extraction (Vapex), Liquid Addition to Steam for Enhanced Recovery of Bitumen (LASER) and HPCSS Assisted SAGD and Hybrid Process.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== High pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) ===

"Roughly 35 per cent of all ''in situ'' production in the Alberta oil sands uses a technique called High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS), which cycles between two phases: first, steam is injected into an underground oil sands deposit to fracture and heat the formation to soften the bitumen just like CSS does, excepting at even higher pressures; then, the cycle switches to production where the resulting hot mixture of bitumen and steam (called a “bitumen emulsion”) is pumped up to the surface through the same well, again just like CSS, until the resulting pressure drop slows production to an uneconomical stage. The process is then repeated multiple times. "&lt;ref name="SeversonBaker29Jul2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Lake bitumen blowout first test for new energy regulator|author=Chris Severson-Baker|date=29 July 2013|url=http://www.pembina.org/blog/741}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] (AER) news release explained the difference between high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). "HPCSS has been used in oil recovery in Alberta for more than 30 years. The method involves injecting high-pressure steam, well above the ambient reservoir pressure, into a reservoir over a prolonged period of time. As heat softens the bitumen and water dilutes and separates the bitumen from the sand, the pressure creates fractures, cracks and openings through which the bitumen can flow back into the steam-injector wells. HPCSS differs from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operations where steam is continuously injected at lower pressures without fracturing the reservoir and uses gravity drainage as the primary recovery mechanism. "&lt;ref name="AER18jul2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|title=Alberta Energy Regulator orders enhanced monitoring and further steaming restrictions at Primrose and Wolf Lake projects due to bitumen emulsion releases|date=18 July 2013|publisher=AER|access-date=2013-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730233259/http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|archive-date=2013-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Clearwater Formation near Cold Lake, Alberta the High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS) is used.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt; There are both horizontal and vertical wells. Injection is at fracture pressure. There is a 60 m to 180 m spacing for horizontal wells. Vertical wells are spaced at 2 to 8 Acre spacing for vertical wells. The development can be as low as 7 m net pay. It is used in areas generally with no to minimal bottom water or top gas. The CSOR is 3.3 to 4.5. The ultimate recovery is predicted at 15 to 35%.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt; SAGD thermal recovery method is also used in Clearwater and [[Mannville Group#Grand Rapids Formation#Subunits|Lower Grand Rapids Formations]] with Horizontal Well Pairs (700 to 1000 m), Operating pressure 3 to 5 MPa, Burnt Lake SAGD was started with higher operating pressure close to dilation pressure, 75 m to 120 m spacing, Development to as low as 10 m net pay, In areas with or without bottom water, CSOR: 2.8 to 4.0 (at 100% quality), Predicted ultimate recovery: 45% to 55%.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

[[Canadian Natural Resources|Canadian Natural Resources Limited’s (CNRL)]] Primrose and Wolf Lake in situ oil sands project near [[CFB Cold Lake|Cold Lake, Alberta]] in the [[Clearwater Formation]], operated by CNRL subsidiary [[Horizon Oil Sands]], use the high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS). &lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== Vapor Extraction (Vapex) ===

Alternative enhanced oil recovery mechanisms include VAPEX ('''V'''apor '''A'''ssisted '''P'''etroleum '''Ex'''traction), Electro-Thermal Dynamic Stripping Process (ET-DSP), and ISC (for In Situ Combustion). VAPEX, a "gravity-drainage process that uses vapourized solvents rather than steam to displace or produce heavy oil and reduce its viscosity, was also invented by Butler.&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlocking the oil sands: The late Dr. Roger Butler, Schulich School of Engineering|publisher=University of Calgary|location=Calgary, Alberta|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/community/research/dr_roger_butlers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ET-DSP is a patented process that uses electricity to heat oil sands deposits to mobilize bitumen allowing production using simple vertical wells.  ISC uses [[oxygen]] to generate heat that diminishes oil viscosity; alongside carbon dioxide generated by heavy crude oil displace oil toward production wells. One ISC approach is called THAI for Toe to Heel Air Injection.&lt;ref name="UofC" /&gt;

=== Enhanced Modified Steam and Gas Push (eMSAGP)===

eMSAGP is a MEG Energy patented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2776704/summary.html?query=meg+energy&amp;start=1&amp;num=50&amp;type=basic_search&lt;/ref&gt; process wherein MEG, in partnership with Cenovus&lt;ref&gt;https://katusaresearch.com/canadian-oil-sands-us-shale-innovation-via-necessity/&lt;/ref&gt;, developed a modified recovery process dubbed “enhanced Modified Steam and Gas Push” (eMSAGP), a modification of SAGP designed to improve the thermal efficiency of SAGD by utilizing additional producers located midway between adjacent SAGD well pairs, at the elevation of the SAGD producers. These additional producers, commonly referred to as “infill” wells, are an integral part of the eMSAGP recovery system.

Its presence may not have been verified in the past 20–40 years. A species or community could become SH without such a 20-40 year delay if the only known occurrences in a province or state were destroyed or if it had been extensively and unsuccessfully looked for. The SH rank is reserved for species or communities for which some effort has been made to relocate occurrences, rather than simply using this status for all elements not known from verified extant occurrences.
* '''S1 — Critically Imperiled'''  Critically imperiled in the province or state because of extreme rarity (often 5 or fewer occurrences) or because of some factor(s) such as very steep declines making it especially vulnerable to extirpation from the province or state.
* '''S2 — Imperiled'''  Imperiled in the province or state because of rarity due to very restricted range, very few populations (often 20 or fewer), steep declines, or other factors making it very vulnerable to extirpation from the province or state.
* '''S3 — Vulnerable'''  Vulnerable in the province or state due to a restricted range, relatively few populations (often 80 or fewer), recent and widespread declines, or other factors making it vulnerable to extirpation.
* '''S4 — Apparently Secure'''  Uncommon but not rare; some cause for long-term concern due to declines or other factors.
* '''S5 — Secure'''  Common, widespread, and abundant in the state or province.
* '''SNR — Unranked'''  Province or state conservation status not yet assessed.
* '''SU — Unrankable'''  Currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends.
* '''SNA — Not Applicable'''  A conservation status rank is not applicable because the species is not a suitable target for conservation activities.
* '''S#S# — Range Rank'''  A numeric range rank (e.g., S2S3) is used to indicate any range of uncertainty about the status of the species or community. Ranges cannot skip more than one rank (e.g., SU is used rather than S1S4).

A similar ranking system is used for the "G-ranks" and "N-ranks" which are the Global (G) and National (N) status ranks for species.  Again refer to NatureServe.org for additional details.

'''Tip growth''' is an extreme form of polarised growth of living cells that results in an elongated cylindrical cell morphology with a rounded tip at which the growth activity takes place. Tip growth occurs in algae (e.g., ''[[Acetabularia acetabulum]]''), fungi ([[hypha]]e) and plants (e.g. [[Trichome|root hairs]] and [[pollen tubes]]).

Tip growth is a process that has many similarities in diverse walled cells such as pollen tubes, root hairs, and hyphae.

== Fungal tip growth and hyphal tropisms==

Fungal hyphae extend continuously at their extreme tips, where enzymes are released into the environment and where new wall materials are synthesised. The rate of tip extension can be extremely rapid - up to 40 micrometres per minute. It is supported by the continuous movement of materials into the tip from older regions of the hyphae. So, in effect, a fungal hypha is a continuously moving mass of protoplasm in a continuously extending tube. This unique mode of growth - apical growth - is the hallmark of fungi, and it accounts for much of their environmental and economic significance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/groups/jdeacon/microbes/apical.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2018}}

A '''volume''' is a physical [[book]]. It may be printed or [[Codex|handwritten]]. The term is commonly used to identify a single book that is part of a larger [[wikt:collection|collection]]. Volumes are typically identified [[Sequence|sequentially]] with [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or [[Arabic numerals]], e.g. "Volume 3" or "Volume III." and is commonly abbreviated to "Vol."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Volumes may be published directly, or they may be created out of [[Bookbinding|bound]] issues. For instance, a library that subscribes to a [[Periodical literature|periodical]] and wishes to preserve it typically takes a set of the issues and has them bound into a volume.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BUNN|first=R.M.|date=January 1962|title=BINDING OF PERIODICALS IN THE NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/eb026312|journal=Journal of Documentation|volume=18|issue=1|pages=20–24|doi=10.1108/eb026312|issn=0022-0418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIDNEY DITZION, LEVERETT NORMAN|first=|date=1956|title=Problems of Periodical and Serial Binding|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/5657/librarytrendsv4i3e_opt.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Publishing|publisher]] may also separately publish a volume out of previously published issues; this is common with [[Graphic novel|graphic novels.]] A volume may also be composed of entries, as in an [[encyclopedia]], or chapters, as in a [[monograph]]. 

The term is also used as an identifier for a sequence of periodicals. This is generally based on a single calendar year, but not always. For instance, a school magazine might start each new volume at the beginning of the academic year, or at the beginning of each term/semester. Thus, all issues published in the ''Nth'' term or year will be classified under the ''Nth'' volume.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Journalism-newspapers-magazines-2494/volume-issue.htm|title=All Experts Questions and Answers – Journalism|last=|first=|date=|website=All Experts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202011515/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Journalism-newspapers-magazines-2494/volume-issue.htm|archive-date=2010-02-02|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original function of labelling issues with a volume at publication time was to provide a standard way for libraries to later bind the issues into a physical volume.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Whitelee Wind Farm''' is the largest on-shore [[wind farm]] in the United Kingdom (second in Europe to [[Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm|Fântânele-Cogealac]], in [[Romania]]) with 215 Siemens and Alstom [[wind turbines]] and a total capacity of 539 [[megawatts]] (MW), with the average of 2.5MW per turbine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whiteleewindfarm.co.uk/about_windfarm?nav Whitelee Windfarm&lt;/ref&gt; Whitelee was developed and is operated by ScottishPower Renewables,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottishpowerrenewables.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of the Spanish company [[Iberdrola]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iberdrola.es/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish government]] had a target of generating 31% of [[Renewable energy in Scotland|Scotland's electricity from renewable energy]] by 2011 and 100% by 2020. The majority of this is likely to come from [[wind power]].&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

==Description==
Positioned 300 metres (985 feet) above sea level and {{convert|15|km|mi}} outside [[Glasgow]], Scotland’s largest city, the wind farm has over half a million people living within a 30&amp;nbsp;km radius&lt;!--Why is this relevant?--&gt;. This makes Whitelee one of the first large-scale wind farms to be developed close to a centre of population.&lt;ref name=white&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/05/europes-largest-onshore-wind-farm-is-switched-on-in-scotland Europe's Largest Onshore Wind Farm Is Switched on in Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Whitelee was officially opened to the public by [[Alex Salmond]] MSP, [[First Minister for Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitelee Windfarm Officially Opened http://www.scottishpowerrenewables.com/pages/press_releases.asp?article=47&amp;date_year=2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Whitelee was generating power more than a year before this with the first phase of the wind farm supplying power to the [[electricity grid]] in January 2008.

In May 2009, the [[Scottish Government]] granted permission for an extension to the wind farm to produce up to a further 130 megawatts of power,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Largest wind farm to be expanded. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8057198.stm BBC News 20 May 2009.] Retrieved 2009-05-25&lt;/ref&gt; which would increase the total generating capacity of Whitelee to 452 MW.&lt;ref name=Press&gt;[http://www.iberdrola.es/webibd/gc/prod/en/comunicacion/notasprensa/090520_NP_inauguracion_Whitelee_en.pdf Iberdrola press release dated 20 May 2009.] Retrieved 2009-05-25&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the potential to increase the generating capacity once again by 140 megawatts. This would give Whitelee the potential to generate almost 600 megawatts of renewable energy.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

On 19 March 2010 a blade snapped off a turbine, resulting in temporary suspension of operations until safety checks were completed. Following the accident Keith Anderson, managing director of ScottishPower Renewables, said: "This type of incident is exceptionally rare and highly unusual."&lt;ref&gt;Blade snaps off huge wind turbine. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8582554.stm BBC News 23 March 2010.] Retrieved 2010-03-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Scottish Power Renewables appointed the joint venture of John Sisk and Son Limited and Roadbridge, as the main contractor for an extension to Whitelee. Located to the east of the existing Whitelee Windfarm, the 75 turbine extension was planned to increase the generating capacity of the windfarm to 539MW. Turbine deliveries were planned for July 2011, with the windfarm expected to be complete in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;SPR awards Whitelee Extension Contract [http://www.whiteleewindfarm.co.uk/news/spr_awards_whitelee_extension_contract] Retrieved 2014-01-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access and visitor centre==
{{See also|Wind turbines on public display}}
Whitelee has become an eco-tourist attraction aided by an on site visitor centre. The visitor centre is host to an interactive exhibition room, cafe, shop and education hub. It was officially opened to the public in September 2009.&lt;ref name=CentreOpening&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8263541.stm BBC News "Wind farm education centre opens"] Retrieved 2009-09-21&lt;/ref&gt; The visitor centre also gives access to a network of over 90&amp;nbsp;km of paths for cyclists, ramblers and horse riders.&lt;ref name=VisitorCentre&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8220793.stm BBC News "Visitor centre showcases windfarm"] Retrieved 2009-08-26&lt;/ref&gt;  The visitor centre is managed by [[Glasgow Science Centre]] and offers activities for education and community groups.&lt;ref name=CentreOpening/&gt;
There is also a dedicated - free - electric vehicle [[charging station]].

Whitelee wind farm has a Countryside Ranger Service operated jointly by East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire councils that works to promote and develop access opportunities for the public within the wind farm and wider area, as well as operating an annual program of free activities and events open to the public. The [http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/whitelee Whitelee Countryside Ranger Service] also works to encourage and assist community and charity organisations to use of access opportunities within the wind farm for fundraising and charity events. The Ranger Service forms part of the [http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2246 Whitelee Access Planning Group] which is made up of the wind farm operators, land owners, the three local authorities the wind farm comes within, local community groups and other interested parties to the site.

In January 2014 work began on a purpose built single track mountain bike course at the windfarm, within a hollow created by a former borrow pit  that was used to supply stone during construction of the windfarm. This development is being led by East Renfrewshire Council on behalf of the Whitelee Access Planning Group. The track has been designed by Phil Saxena of Architrail Ltd – designer of the 2008 Beijing Olympic and 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games XC courses.

The project has followed strong public demand for more technical MTB facilities at Whitelee. Its setting within the UK’s largest onshore windfarm will make it unique amongst trail centres. The plans will provide graded trails to suit a wide range of users, from beginners to more experienced riders. The course will offer a mix of route options, technical sections and challenges, as well as a large picnic and viewing area, with wet weather shelters for use by families, clubs, schools etc. The facilities will extend across an area of approximately 12 hectares and will be free to use, 7 days a week.

In June 2012, Whitelee wind farm became the first wind energy project in Scotland to join the [[Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions]]. The management took the decision after nearly 250,000 people had visited the site since its opening since July 2009. [[ScottishPower]] Renewables said that nearly 10,000 pupils had so far visited Whitelee on school trips. In addition, at least "another 100,000 people had accessed the wind farm's 90km (56 miles) of trails for recreational purposes such as jogging and cycling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-18525763 |title= Whitelee Wind Farm joins major tourist attractions body |author= |date=20 June 2012  |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lochgoin Farm and Monument===
[[File:Lochgoin Monument - geograph.org.uk - 1499979.jpg|thumb|right|Lochgoin monument and farmhouse]]
The wind farm area includes Lochgoin Farm, the home of the Howie family which in the 17th century  was a noted refuge for [[Covenanter]]s, and was searched multiple times by government soldiers. In the 18th century [[John Howie (biographer)|John Howie]] became a biographer who recorded the lives of Covenanting martyrs in books published from 1775 onwards. In 1896 a stone [[obelisk]] was erected nearby as a monument "in memory of John Howie, author of the ''Scots Worthies''"; this is accessible by the tracks leading from the visitor centre. A small museum at the farm holds relics of Covenanters, check for opening arrangements.&lt;ref name="Canmore 1956"&gt;{{cite web | title=Lochgoin Farmhouse And Monument To John Howie | website=Canmore | date=1956-08-23 | url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43786/lochgoin-farmhouse-and-monument-to-john-howie | accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="East Renfrewshire Council"&gt;{{cite web | title=Covenanters | website=East Renfrewshire Council | url=http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/whitelee-covenanters | accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==
Whitelee Windfarm currently has a 75 turbine extension under construction. This will add an additional 217 MW of capacity, enough to power the equivalent of over 124,000 homes. This will bring the total generating capacity of the wind farm up to 539 MW. Work on this new development commenced in November 2010, with the completion date extended from December 2012 to March 2013. Additionally, the new extension will add a further 44&amp;nbsp;km of trails to the site. 
John Sisk and Son Limited and Roadbridge were jointly appointed as Principal Contractors for the site during construction with Alstom Limited erecting and commissioning the wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPR Awards Whitelee Extension Contract|url=http://www.whiteleewindfarm.com/news/spr_awards_whitelee_extension_contract|work=Whitelee Wind Farm|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 Scottish Power announced that it was applying for a further small extension of five turbines on the west of the existing site, adding 12 MW of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19211207 BBC News "Scottish Power wants Whitelee wind farm third extension"] Retrieved 2012-09-17&lt;/ref&gt; This was refused by the DPEA on 19 Oct 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpea.scotland.gov.uk/CaseDetails.aspx?id=115381|title=Scottish Government - DPEA - Case Details|website=www.dpea.scotland.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==
On 19 March 2010 a blade snapped off a turbine which led to Whitelee wind farm being temporarily shut down while safety checks were completed on all other turbines on the site. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8582554.stm|title=BBC News - Blade snaps off huge wind turbine|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 a turbine lost its nose cone, the entire site was closed until such time as the remaining turbines could be checked and tested. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra.co.uk/news/environment/wind-turbine-at-whiteleehill-farm-loses-a-nose-cone-1-4391662|title=Wind turbine at Whiteleehill farm loses a nose cone|website=www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2017 a worker fell from a turbine while it was undergoing maintenance, though that was not linked to his death. The Police are not treating his death as suspicious. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1384484-wind-farm-worker-dies-after-falling-from-360ft-turbine/|title=Wind farm worker dies after falling from turbine|website=STV News|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/windfarm-worker-plunges-death-turbine-10134003|title=Windfarm worker falls to his death from turbine near Glasgow|last=Ward|first=Paul|date=2017-03-31|work=dailyrecord|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoomusicology''' is a field of [[musicology]] and [[zoology]] or more specifically, [[Animal communication|zoosemiotics]]. Zoomusicology is the study of the [[music]] of [[animal]]s, or rather the [[musical aspect]]s of [[sound]] or [[communication]] produced and received by animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=Emily|last2=Gingras|first2=Bruno|date=October 2015|title=Zoomusicology|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=19|pages=R819–R820|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.039|pmid=26439331|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoomusicology is a separate field from [[ethnomusicology]], the study of human music.

Composers have evoked or imitated animal sounds in compositions including [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''The Hen'' (1728), [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s ''Carnival of the Animals'' (1886), [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s ''Catalogue of the Birds'' (1956–58) and [[Pauline Oliveros]]'s ''El Relicario de los Animales'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Von Gunden, Heidi|year=1983|title=The Music of Pauline Oliveros|isbn=978-0-8108-1600-8|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[Alan Hovhaness]]'s ''And God Created Great Whales'' (1970), [[George Crumb]]'s ''Vox Balaenae'' (Voice of the Whale) (1971) and [[Gabriel Pareyon]]'s ''Invention over the song of the [[Vireo atricapilla|Vireo atriccapillus]]'' (1999) and ''Kha Pijpichtli Kuikatl'' (2003). The Indian zoomusicologist, A. J. Mithra has composed music using bird, animal and [[frog sound]]s since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.indiasendangered.com/interview-a-j-mithra-making-music-with-animal-calls Interview: a j mithra, Making Music with Animal Calls]", ''IndiasEndangered.com''. "The only known zoo musicologist in India and the second in the world after [[Jim Fassett]] who was known to create similar music from animal sounds way back in 1955."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions and effects of music on animals ==

=== Mammals ===
[[File:Saguinus_oedipus_(Linnaeus,_1758).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saguinus_oedipus_(Linnaeus,_1758).jpg|thumb|Saguinus oedipus (Linnaeus, 1758)]]
Snowden and Teie performed an experiment on [[Cotton-top tamarin|Cotton-top tamarins, ''Saguinus oedipus'']], to determine if music would lead to behavioural changes, and whether music made by other species would elicit similar behavioural responses as the music of one’s own species. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Teie|first2=David|date=2010-02-23|title=Affective responses in tamarins elicited by species-specific music|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/30|journal=Biology Letters|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=30–32|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0593|issn=1744-9561|pmc=2817256|pmid=19726444}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment involved two separate categories of music - one was affiliation-based, the other was fear/threat-based music. Within the two categories, the experimenter varied whether the music was produced by [[Human|humans]] or tamarins.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During the experiment, a baseline behaviour measurement was established, proceeded by the experimental condition, which was a piece of music that was played for 30 seconds. Following this, behaviour was analyzed for a total of 5 minutes. This analysis was made by an observer who was unaware of the true hypothesis of the experiment, and simply noted different behaviours which they had witnessed.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The experimenters found that the Tamarins altered their behaviour specifically when listening to Tamarin music. For example, when music from the affiliation condition was played, the behavioural response of the tamarins involved a decrease in overall movement and an increase in both social and foraging behaviour.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This contrasted the behaviour observed when the fear/threat based music was played. During this condition, the Tamarins were more likely to move around and show anxiety-based behaviour, as well as, an increase in social behaviour similar to that seen in the affiliation condition. It should also be noted that while the Tamarins did not show behavioural changes to human music as clearly as they did to their species-specific music, there was some behavioural change.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Tamarins showed decreased movement when listening to human fear/threat based music and a decrease in anxious behaviour when listening to human affiliation music. This experiment, demonstrates that music is capable of eliciting changes in the behaviour of animals, most especially when the music is species-specific.

[[Humpback whale|Humpback whales, ''Megaptera novaeangliae'']], are capable of the production of complex songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sibetrans.com/trans/articulo/97/to-wail-with-a-whale-anatomy-of-an-interspecies-duet|title=TRANS - Revista Transcultural de Música - Transcultural Music Review|website=www.sibetrans.com|language=es|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These songs are amongst some of the longest measured in animals.  Only male humpback whales perform these vocalizations; it was initially hypothesized that these songs may be a part of the [[sexual selection]] process. This point however, is unclear. It has been found that males only began their song after joining a group where pairs of mother and calf were present.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Joshua N.|last2=Goldizen|first2=Anne W.|last3=Dunlop|first3=Rebecca A.|last4=Noad|first4=Michael J.|date=2008-08|title=Songs of male humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, are involved in intersexual interactions|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=76|issue=2|pages=467–477|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.02.013|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the reason behind this behaviour is uncertain, some have hypothesized that the songs produced by male humpback whales may be a part of escorting, or accompanying females. It should also be noted that singing can be a costly behaviour, because it can lead to more attention being drawn. In the humpback whales’ situation, their singing can attract other competing males.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Yet, the singing behaviour continues and therefore, it is assumed that the songs are critical to the [[Courtship behavior|courtship behaviour]] of the humpback whales.

=== Birds ===
[[File:Song_Sparrow.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Song_Sparrow.jpg|thumb|Song Sparrow]]
Perhaps the most well-known form of music found in non-human animals is [[birdsong]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothenberg|first=David|last2=Roeske|first2=Tina C.|last3=Voss|first3=Henning U.|last4=Naguib|first4=Marc|last5=Tchernichovski|first5=Ofer|date=2014-02|title=Investigation of musicality in birdsong|journal=Hearing Research|volume=308|pages=71–83|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2013.08.016|issn=0378-5955|pmc=3947120|pmid=24036130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birdsong is different from normal calls. For example, a call will usually simply function to communicate a direct message.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; For instance, a bird call could be used to direct attention that a predator is near. Meanwhile a song contains more repetition and usually will have distinct structure to it, with a specific beginning, middle, and end.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In many species of [[Songbird|songbirds]], songs seem to be used both as a way to attract potential mates, as well as to mark and defend one's territory. It has been observed that young songbirds acquire their ability to produce song from imitation of adult birds.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Interestingly enough, there seems to be a critical period for song learning. In one experiment, they compared birds raised in isolation, (this involved isolation from other birds as well as the vocalizations of other birds), with those raised in a colony, without these forms of isolation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Using an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] scan and the [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent imaging|blood oxygen level dependent]] (BOLD) as a measurement of brain activity, it was found that birds raised in the isolation condition did not appear to show a preference between their own songs and a repetitive song. Meanwhile colony-raised birds showed a stronger reaction to their own song being played back.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== '''Insects''' ===
[[File:Imago_O_furnacalis.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Imago_O_furnacalis.jpg|thumb|Imago O furnacalis]]
One potential barrier in the study of zoomusicology is that there are some forms of music produced by various animals which humans are incapable of hearing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balenger|first=Susan L.|date=2015-07|title=Stridulated soft song by singing insects|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347215001244|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=105|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.03.024|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; This music is very low in amplitude and is known as quiet song, whisper communication, or soft song.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This low amplitude music has been shown in birds, as well as insects and is linked to behaviour. Moth species have been shown to have developed the ability to communicate using ultrasonic sounds, and this ability has transferred over to their production of soft songs. In the [[Ostrinia furnacalis|Asian corn borer moth, ''Ostrinia furnacalis'']], males produce an ultrasonic soft song to initiate courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The song that the male produces is so quiet that the female must be within a range of three centimeters in order to hear the song. In hearing the song, the female stays in one place and is completely still, this allows the male to initiate mating behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reason that the female remains still, is because this song sounds very similar to sounds that a bat would produce. The female therefore remains still in order to avoid potential [[predation]]. There is of course another added benefit to this soft song produced by the male Asian corn borer moth, and that is that the song is so quiet that it decreases the males’ predation risk.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although these soft songs are far less well-known to the general public, they are an important aspect of zoomusicology and the further understanding of [[animal behaviour]].    

== Auditory enrichment and therapeutic effects of music on animals ==

=== Cows ===
In a study at the [[University of Leicester]], Liam MacKenzie and Adrian North found that playing music for [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] had an effect on the amount of milk that they produced.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.le.ac.uk/press/press/moosicstudy.html|title=Administration: 'Moosic Study' Reveals Way of Increasing Milk Yields  [Psychology; Agriculture; Industry]|website=www.le.ac.uk|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a nine-week period, dairy cows were exposed to fast (&gt; 120 BPM), slow (&lt; 100 BPM), and no music. Music was played for the cows 12 hours a day from 5 AM to 5 PM.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study found that cows exposed to slow music, like [[R.E.M.|REM]]'s '[[Everybody Hurts]]' or [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s '[[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]],' produced 3% more milk than cows that were exposed to fast music, like [[Pumping on Your Stereo|Pumping on your Stereo]] by [[Supergrass]] and 'Size of a Cow' by [[The Wonder Stuff|Wonderstuff]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bovine milk production has long been thought to be affected by exposure to music. Some farmers already expose their cows to music to aid in milk production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themilkingparlourblog.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/do-cows-like-music/|title=Do cows like music?|date=2015-05-26|work=the  milking  parlour  blog|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Dogs ===
Decreased stress levels have been observed in kennelled dogs that were exposed to Classical music, but rapid [[habituation]] was also observed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=A.|last2=Dowell|first2=F.J.|last3=Evans|first3=N.P.|date=2017-03|title=‘The effect of different genres of music on the stress levels of kennelled dogs’|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.01.024|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=171|pages=207–215|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.01.024|issn=0031-9384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 follow up study, kennelled dogs were exposed to five different genres of music including [[Soft rock|Soft Rock]], [[Motown]], [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Reggae]], and [[Classical music|Classical]] in order to determine whether or not increased variety of music could reduce habituation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The study found the Heart Rate Variability, which indicates a decreased stress level, was significantly higher when the dogs were played Reggae and Soft Rock, but the other three genres had a similar but less pronounced effect. In addition, the dogs were much more likely to lie down rather than stand while the music was being played.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The study suggested that the increased variety of music decreased habituation that was present when playing exclusively classical music, though the dogs responded best when exposed to Reggae and Soft Rock.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Zoomusicologists==
Researchers in a wide range of fields including [[music]], [[semiotics]], [[philosophy]] and [[biology]] conduct zoomusicology research. This is due to the fact that the field of zoomusicology is so broad and reaches many disciplines. Musician and zoomusicologist Hollis Taylor has conducted an extensive study of the Pied Butcherbird, [[Pied butcherbird|Cracticus nigrogularis]] over the past 15 years, including interdisciplinary research with philosophers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TAYLOR|first=HOLLIS|date=March 2014|title=Whose Bird Is It?
