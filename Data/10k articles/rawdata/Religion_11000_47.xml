'''Alfredo Ormando''' (15 December 1958 in [[San Cataldo, Sicily|San Cataldo]] &amp;ndash; 23 January 1998 in [[Rome]]) was a gay writer from [[Palermo]] who died as a result of setting himself on fire outside [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. His [[self-immolation]] was an act of [[protest]] against the [[Homosexuality and the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church's ongoing condemnation of homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Man sets himself on fire in Vatican | publisher=BBC News | date=December 19, 2013 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25453307 | access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ormando's only published book was the novel ''Il Fratacchione'' (''"The Overweight Monk"''), which recounted his two years at a monastery attempting to get closer to God and to purify himself of "unclean" desires. The narrator in the book states, "It isn't true that gay is beautiful. On the contrary, it is a continual death on the inside. Either you accept being gay, or you kill yourself."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnmanuel-andriote/alfredos-fire-sure-to-spa_b_2879533.html|title='Alfredo's Fire' Sure to Spark Discussion About Religion, Homosexuality and the Deadliness of Intolerance|first=John-Manuel|last=Andriote|date=15 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January 1998, Ormando set himself on fire in [[St. Peter's Square]] close to where [[Pope John Paul II]] was addressing the crowds. Two policemen tried to extinguish the flames, and he was taken to [[Sant'Eugenio Hospital]] with [[third degree burn|third-degree burns]] over 90 percent of his body. He died 11 days later. Ormando was 39 years old.&lt;ref name="ilmessaggero.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/RUBRICHE/ACCADDE_OGGI/13_gennaio_1998_scrittore_gay_alfredo_ormando_fuoco_san_pietro_protesta_chiesa/notizie/1114032.shtml|title=13 gennaio 1998 Lo scrittore gay Alfredo Ormando si dà fuoco a San Pietro per protesta contro la Chiesa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to a friend he wrote: "I hope they will understand the message I want to give - it is a form of protest against a Church that demonises homosexuality, demonising nature at the same time; despite the fact that homosexuality is a child of nature".&lt;ref name="ilmessaggero.it"/&gt;

Authorities in the Roman Catholic Church downplayed the event, arguing that he was psychologically disturbed, had family problems and had not been making a protest against the Church.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ormando's actions are commemorated in St Peter's Square by [[human rights activists]]&lt;ref name="ilmessaggero.it"/&gt;

In 2014, the filmmaker Andy Abrahams Wilson, produced a 40-minute documentary film called ''[[Alfredo's Fire]]'' for the San Francisco-based Open Eye Pictures. Wilson argued that, "Fire was the perfect allegory for the experiences of LGBT people. Fire is at once a self-annihilation, and harkens back to the Middle Ages when homosexuals were burned at the stake".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Ancient Teachings of the Masters''' (also called '''ATOM''') is the name  [[Darwin Gross]] used to carry on the original teachings of [[Paul Twitchell]] after his termination from [[Eckankar]].

Darwin Gross became the new Living Eck Master upon the death of Paul Twitchell in 1971. In 1981, he named [[Harold Klemp]] to take that position, continuing to function as the president of the Eckankar Corporation himself. In 1983, his relationship with Eckankar was formally terminated by Klemp, who formally terminated all of his agreements with the corporation and his status as an Eck Master, amid a cloud of charges of misappropriation of funds that were later sustained in court. (Source untrustworthy)

At that time, Darwin Gross began teaching independently, clearly stating that he was not creating a separate teaching, but that he was maintaining the original teachings of Paul Twichell.

Having retained copyright for all of his own books and music, Gross began publishing these works, and the works of his students, independently, under the SOS ("Sounds of Soul") Publishing label through 1989.  Darwin Gross continued the original teachings of Paul Twitchell until his death on March 8, 2008.

[[Muhammad]], according to the usually told Islamic historiography, sent ambassadors with such letters to [[Heraclius]] the emperor of [[Eastern Roman Empire]], [[Chosroes II]] the emperor of [[Persia]], the [[Negus]] of [[Ethiopia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lettre de Mohammad, au Négus Al Asham, Roi d’Abyssinie.|publisher = [[aslim-taslam]]|accessdate=March 3, 2009|url=http://www.aslim-taslam.net/article.php3?id_article=742}}by Sajida M&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muqawqis]] the ruler of [[Egypt]], [[Harith Gassani]] the governor of [[Syria]] and [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi|Munzir ibn Sawa]] the ruler of [[Bahrain]]. 

Muhammad's Letter to the King of Oman, Jaifer, and his Brother Abd Al-Jalandi - 

In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful:

From Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah to Jaifer and ‘Abd Al-Jalandi - Peace be upon him who follows true guidance; thereafter I invite both of you to the Call of Islam. Embrace Islam. Allah has sent me as a Prophet to all His creatures in order that I may instill fear of Allah in the hearts of His disobedient creatures so that there may be left no excuse for those who deny Allah. If you two accept Islam, you will remain in command of your country; but if you refuse my Call, then all your possessions are perishable. My horsemen will appropriate your land, and my Prophethood will assume control over your kingship. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.kalamullah.com/Books/The%20letters%20of%20the%20Prophet%20Muhammad%20to%20the%20Kings%20beyond%20Arabia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], President of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], sent a similar letter to former US President [[George W. Bush]] saying '''''aslim taslam'''''. 
&lt;ref name="Henryk M. Broder 2006, pp. 71-90"&gt;Henryk M. Broder, Hurra, wir kapitulieren! Von der Lust am Einknicken (“Hurray, we are capitulating! About the lust to bend over backwards”,) Berlin 2006, pp. 71-90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Osama bin Laden]] sent a handful of such letters both to USA and Europe saying '''''aslim taslam'''''

A '''Buddhist chant''' is a form of musical verse or incantation, in some ways analogous to [[Hindu]], [[Christian]] or [[Jewish]] religious recitations.

==Traditional chanting==

In Buddhism, chanting is the traditional means of preparing the mind for [[Buddhist Meditation|meditation]], especially as part of formal practice (in either a [[laity|lay]] or [[monastic]] context). Some forms of Buddhism also use chanting for ritualistic purposes.

While the basis for most [[Theravada]] chants is the [[Pali Canon]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] chants draw from a wider range of sources.

===Theravada chants===

[[File:11 Monks Chanting.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buddhist monks chanting]]
In the Theravada tradition, chanting is usually done in [[Pali]], sometimes with [[vernacular]] translations interspersed.&lt;ref name="Khantipalo 1982, 1995"&gt;Khantipalo (1982, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the most popular Theravada chants&lt;ref name="Khantipalo 1982, 1995"/&gt; are:
:*Buddhabhivadana (Preliminary Reverence for the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]])&lt;ref&gt;For an example of Pali text and an English translation of this chant, see {{harvp|Indaratana Maha Thera|2002|pp=1–2}}.

===Mahayana sutra chants===
[[File:Bodhi Mandala Zen Center 7.jpg|thumbnail|right|Chanting in the sutra hall]]
Since Japanese Buddhism is divided in thirteen doctrinal schools, and since [[Chan Buddhism]], [[Zen]] and [[Buddhism in Vietnam]] – although sharing a common historical origin and a common doctrinal content – are divided according to geographical borders, there are several different forms of arrangements of scriptures to chant within Mahayana Buddhism.:

:*Daily practice in [[Nichiren buddhism]] is chanting the five character of [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]] (homage to the true [[dharma]] of the Lotus [[Sutra]]). A Mahayana sutra that reveals the true identity of Shakyamuni as a Buddha who attained enlightenment numberless kalpas ago. Kumarajiva's translation, which is widely honoured, is entitled the Lotus Sutra of the wonderful law (Myoho Renge Kyo). The mystic relationship between the law and the lives of the people courses eternally through past, present, and future, unbroken in any lifetime. In terms of space, the Nichiren proclaims that the heritage of the ultimate law flows within lives of his disciples and lay supporters who work in perfect unity for the realization of a peaceful world and happiness for all humanity. Nichiren practitioners will chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo - the true aspect of all the phenomena and recite certain chapters from the [[Lotus Sutra]], in particular the 2nd and 16th chapters. 

:*[[Pure Land]] Buddhists chant [[nianfo]], ''Namu Amida Butsu'' or ''Namo Amituofo'' (Homage to [[Amitabha]] Buddha).  In more formal services, practitioners will also chant excerpts from the [[Larger Sutra|Larger Sutra of Immeasurable Life]] or occasionally the entire [[Amitabha Sutra|Smaller Sutra of Immeasurable Life]] (a sutra not unique for Pure Land Buddhism, but chanted in the evening by [[Chan Buddhism|Chan-buddhists]] and [[Tendai]]-buddhists as well).
:*Popular with [[Zen]], [[Shingon]] or other [[Mahayana]] practitioners is chanting the Prajñāpāramitā Hridaya Sūtra ([[Heart Sutra]]), especially during morning offices. In more formal settings, larger discourses of the Buddha (such as the [[Diamond Sutra]] in Zen temples and the [[Lotus Sutra]] in Tendai temples) may be chanted as well. 
:*Particularly in the Chinese, Vietnamese and the Japanese traditions, ''repentance ceremonies'', involving paying deep reverence to the buddhas and [[bodhisattva]]s, as well as executing ''rituals to rescue and feed [[hungry ghosts]]'', are also occasionally practiced. There is no universally used form for these two practices, but several different forms, the use of which follows doctrinal and geographical borders. Within Chan, it is common to chant [[Sanskrit]] ''formulae'', known as [[dhāraṇī]]s, especially in the morning.

===Vajrayana chants===
In the [[Vajrayana]] tradition, chanting is also used as an invocative ritual in order to set one's mind on a [[Ishta-deva (Buddhism)|deity]], [[Tantra|Tantric]] ceremony, [[mandala]], or particular concept one wishes to further in themselves.

For Vajrayana practitioners, the chant [[Om Mani Padme Hum]] is very popular around the world as both a praise of peace and the primary mantra of [[Avalokitesvara]]. Other popular chants include those of [[Tara (Buddhist)|Tara]], [[Bhaisajyaguru]], and [[Amitabha]].

Tibetan monks are noted for their skill at [[Overtone singing|throat-singing]], a specialized form of chanting in which, by amplifying the voice's upper partials, the chanter can produce multiple distinct pitches simultaneously. Japanese esoteric practitioners also practice a form of chanting called ''[[shomyo]]''.

==Critique of melodious chanting==

===Ghitassara Sutta===
In the ''Ghitassara Sutta'' ([[Anguttara Nikaya]] 5.209), the Buddha teaches:
:Bhikkhus, there are five dangers of reciting the Dhamma with a musical intonation. What five?
:Oneself gets attached to the sound, others get attached to the sound, householders are annoyed, saying, “Just as we sing, these sons of the Sakyan sing”, the concentration of those who do not like the sound is destroyed, and  later generations copy it.
:These, monks, are the five dangers of reciting the Dhamma with a musical intonation.&lt;ref&gt;''Gītassara Sutta'' (A.iii.250) from "Association for Insight Meditation" at {{cite web |url=http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Suttas/Ghitassara/ghitassara.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121222240/http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Suttas/Ghitassara/ghitassara.html |archivedate=2007-11-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense of chanting===
[[John Daido Loori]] justified the use of chanting sutras by referring to Zen master [[Dōgen]].&lt;ref name="loorisymbol"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Symbol and Symbolized |last=Loori |first=John Daido |journal=Mountain Record: the Zen Practitioner's Journal |volume=XXV |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=http://www.mro.org/zmm/teachings/daido/teisho50.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115070237/http://www.mro.org/zmm/teachings/daido/teisho50.php |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dōgen is known to have refuted the statement "Painted rice cakes will not satisfy hunger". This statement means that sutras, which are just symbols like painted rice cakes, cannot truly satisfy one's spiritual hunger. Dōgen, however, saw that there is no separation between metaphor and reality. "There is no difference between paintings, rice cakes, or any thing at all".&lt;ref name="yasuda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwzc.org/translations/gabyo.htm |title=Gabyo: Painted Rice Cakes by Eihei Dogen Zenji |last=Yasuda |first=Joshu |author2=Anzan, Hoshin |accessdate=2008-03-26 |publisher=White Wind Zen Community |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307224649/http://www.wwzc.org/translations/gabyo.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol and the symbolized were inherently the same, and thus only the sutras could truly satisfy one's spiritual needs.

To understand this non-dual relationship experientially, one is told to practice liturgy intimately.&lt;ref name="loorizen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loori |first=John Daido |journal=Mountain Record: the Zen Practitioner's Journal |title=Zen Mountain Monastery Dharma Talk |url=http://www.mro.org/zmm/teachings/daido/teisho08.php |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133249/http://www.mro.org/zmm/teachings/daido/teisho08.php |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In distinguishing between ceremony and liturgy, [[Dōgen]] states, "In ceremony there are forms and there are sounds, there is understanding and there is believing. In liturgy there is only intimacy." The practitioner is instructed to listen to and speak liturgy not just with one sense, but with one's "whole body-and-mind". By listening with one's entire being, one eliminates the space between the self and the liturgy. Thus, Dōgen's instructions are to "listen with the eye and see with the ear". By focusing all of one's being on one specific practice, duality is transcended. Dōgen says, "Let go of the eye, and the whole body-and-mind are nothing but the eye; let go of the ear, and the whole universe is nothing but the ear." Chanting intimately thus allows one to experience a non-dual reality. The liturgy used is a tool to allow the practitioner to transcend the old conceptions of self and other. In this way, intimate liturgy practice allows one to realize emptiness ([[sunyata]]), which is at the heart of Zen Buddhist teachings.

==Non-canonical uses of Buddhist chanting==
There are also a number of [[New Age]] and experimental schools related to Buddhist thought which practise chanting, some with understanding of the words, others merely based on repetition. A large number of these schools tend to be [[syncretic]] and incorporate Hindu [[japa]] and other such traditions alongside the Buddhist influences.

While not strictly a variation of Buddhist chanting in itself, Japanese ''[[Shigin]]'' (詩吟) is a form of chanted poetry that reflects several principles of [[Zen Buddhism]].  It is sung in the ''[[seiza]]'' position, and participants are encouraged to sing from the [[Dantian|gut]] - the Zen locus of power.  ''Shigin'' and related practices are often sung at Buddhist ceremonies and quasi-religious gatherings in [[Japan]].

The '''Caesareum of Alexandria''' is an ancient [[Egyptian temples|temple]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. It was conceived by [[Cleopatra VII]] of the [[Ptolemaic kingdom]], the last [[pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt]], to honour her first known lover [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fletcher |first=Joann |author-link=Joann Fletcher |title=Cleopatra the Great: The Woman Behind the Legend |year=2008 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-058558-7 |url= |postscript=.|pages=216–217}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The edifice was finished by the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]], after he defeated [[Mark Antony]] and Cleopatra in Egypt. He destroyed all traces of Antony in Alexandria, and apparently dedicated the temple to his own cult.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Alexandria and Egypt, c. 300BC to AD 700, Volume 63|last=McKenzie |first=Judith |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] (via [[Google Books]]) |year= 2007|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFNCaZEZKYAC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=caesareum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7xu2YvAy4n&amp;sig=roiU-WMbtGv9ivO1VWwsd6VpWkE&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converted to a [[Christian]] church in the late 4th century, the Caesareum was the headquarters of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] from 412 to 444.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | date= 2012 | url=http://cosmographica.com/alexandria/caesarium.html |title= The Caesarium of Alexandria – Scene of the Crime|publisher = cosmographica.com | accessdate= 23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chalukya dynasty''' ({{IPA-kn|tʃaːɭukjə|}}) was an [[India]]n royal dynasty that ruled large parts of [[south India|southern]] and [[central India]] between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the "Badami Chalukyas", ruled from Vatapi (modern [[Badami]]) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] kingdom of [[Banavasi]] and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of [[Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II]]. After the death of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II, the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] became an independent kingdom in the eastern [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. They ruled from [[Vengi]] until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the [[Rashtrakutas]] in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the [[Western Chalukyas]], in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern [[Basavakalyan]]) until the end of the 12th century.

The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of [[South India]] and a [[Golden Age|golden age]] in the history of [[Karnataka]]. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the [[Kaveri]] and the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called "Chalukyan architecture". [[Kannada literature]], which had enjoyed royal support in the 9th century Rashtrakuta court found eager patronage from the Western Chalukyas in the [[Jain]] and [[Veerashaiva]] traditions. The 11th century saw the birth of [[Telugu literature]] under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas.

=== Natives of Karnataka ===

While opinions vary regarding the early origins of the Chalukyas, the consensus among noted historians such as [[John Keay]], [[Dineshchandra Sircar|D.C. Sircar]], Hans Raj, S. Sen, [[Suryanath U. Kamath|Kamath]], [[K. V. Ramesh (archaeologist)|K. V. Ramesh]] and Karmarkar is the founders of the empire at Badami were native to the modern [[Karnataka]] region.&lt;ref name="historians"&gt;N. Laxminarayana Rao and Dr. S. C. Nandinath have claimed the Chalukyas were ''[[Kannadigas]]'' (Kannada speakers) and very much the natives of Karnataka (Kamath 2001, p. 57)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sir"&gt;The Chalukyas were Kannadigas (D.C. Sircar in Mahajan V.D., 1960, Reprint 2007, Ancient India, Chand and Company, New Delhi, p. 690, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hans"&gt;Natives of Karnataka (Hans Raj, 2007, Advanced history of India: From earliest times to present times, Part-1, Surgeet publications, New Delhi, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historians1"&gt;The Chalukyas hailed from Karnataka (John Keay, 2000, p. 168)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karna"&gt;Quote:"They belonged to Karnataka country and their mother tongue was Kannada" (Sen 1999, 360)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historians20"&gt;The Chalukyas of Badami seem to be of indigenous origin (Kamath 2001, p. 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historians2"&gt;Jayasimha and Ranaraga, the first members of the Chalukya family were possibly employees of the Kadambas in the northern part of the Kadamba Kingdom (Fleet [in ''Kanarese Dynasties'', p. 343] in Moraes, 1931, pp. 51–52)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;I must have been an administrative official of the northern Kadamba territory centered in Badami (Moraes 1931, pp. 51–52)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historians3"&gt;The Chalukya base was Badami and Aihole (Thapar 2003, p. 328)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="field"&gt;Inscriptional evidence proves the Chalukyas were native Kannadigas (Karmarkar, 1947, p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="identity"/&gt;

A theory that they were descendants of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the [[Andhra Ikshvaku]] (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves ''Vashisthiputras'' of the ''Hiranyakagotra''. The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as ''Harithiputras'' of ''Manavyasagotra'' in their inscriptions, which is the same lineage as their early overlords, the [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadambas]] of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.&lt;ref name="kadamba"&gt;Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;I of Badami who was a feudatory of the Kadamba king Krishna Varman&amp;nbsp;II, overpowered his overlord in c.&amp;nbsp;540 and took control of the Kadamba Kingdom (Kamath 2001, p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later record of Eastern Chalukyas mentions the northern origin theory and claims one ruler of [[Ayodhya]] came south, defeated the Pallavas and married a Pallava princess. She had a child called Vijayaditya who is claimed to be the [[Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;I]]'s father. However, according to the historians K. V. Ramesh, Chopra and Sastri, there are Badami Chalukya inscriptions that confirm [[Jayasimha (Vatapi Chalukya dynasty)|Jayasimha]] was Pulakeshin I's grandfather and [[Ranaraga]], his father.&lt;ref name="sapta"&gt;Jayasimha (Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;I's grandfather) is known from the Kaira inscription of 472–473&amp;nbsp;CE. Both Jayasimha and Ranaraga (Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;I's father) are known from Mahakuta inscription of 599&amp;nbsp;CE and Aihole record of 634&amp;nbsp;CE (Ramesh 1984, pp. 26–27, p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gotra"&gt;From the Badami Cliff inscription of Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;I and from the Hyderabad record of Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;II which states their family ancestry (Kamath 2001, pp. 56–58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gotra1"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="father"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 73, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; Kamath and Moraes claim it was a popular practice in the 11th century to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom. The Badami Chalukya records themselves are silent with regards to the Ayodhya origin.&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="silent"&gt;Moraes (1931). pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

While the northern origin theory has been dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs examination.&lt;ref name="migration"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity may have been due to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin of their ancestors may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region.&lt;ref name="identity"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The writing of 12th century [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] poet [[Bilhana]] suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the [[Shudra]] caste while other sources claim they were [[Kshatriya]]s.&lt;ref name="Sudra-Kshatriya"&gt;Bilhana, in his Sanskrit work ''Vikramanakadevacharitam'' claims the Early Chalukya family were born from the feet of Hindu God [[Brahma]], implying they were Shudras by caste, while other sources claim they were born in the arms of Brahma, and hence were Kshatriyas (Ramesh 1984, p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt;

The historians Jan Houben and Kamath, and the epigraphist D.C. Sircar note the Badami Chalukya [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] are in [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="south"&gt;Sircar D.C. (1965), p. 48, ''Indian Epigraphy'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, {{ISBN|81-208-1166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="south1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="south2"&gt;Houben (1996), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian N. L. Rao, their inscriptions call them ''Karnatas'' and their names use indigenous Kannada titles such as ''Priyagallam'' and ''Noduttagelvom''. The names of some Chalukya princes end with the pure Kannada term ''arasa'' (meaning "king" or "chief").&lt;ref name="arasa"&gt;Professor N.L. Rao has pointed out that some of their family records in Sanskrit have also named the princes with "arasa", such as Kattiyarasa ([[Kirtivarman&amp;nbsp;I]]), Bittarasa ([[Kubja Vishnuvardhana]]) and Mangalarasa ([[Mangalesha]], Kamath 2001, pp. 57–60)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arasa_1"&gt;Historians Shafaat Ahmad Khan and S. Krishnasvami Aiyangar clarify that '''Arasa''' is Kannada word, equivalent to Sanskrit word '''Raja'''&amp;nbsp;– ''Journal of Indian History'' p. 102, Published by Department of Modern Indian History, University of Allahabad&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rashtrakuta]] inscriptions call the Chalukyas of Badami ''Karnatabala'' ("Power of Karnata"). It has been proposed by the historian S. C. Nandinath that the word "Chalukya" originated from ''Salki'' or ''Chalki'' which is a Kannada word for an agricultural implement.&lt;ref name="Chalki"&gt;Dr. Hoernle suggests a non-Sanskrit origin of the dynastic name. Dr. S.C. Nandinath feels the Chalukyas were of agricultural background and of Kannada origin who later took up a martial career. He feels the word ''Chalki'' found in some of their records must have originated from ''salki'', an agricultural implement (Kamath 2001, p. 57)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="root"&gt;The word ''Chalukya'' is derived from a Dravidian root (Kittel in Karmarkar 1947, p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical sources ===
Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main source of information about Badami Chalukya history. Among them, the [[Badami]] cave inscriptions of [[Mangalesha]] (578), [[Kappe Arabhatta]] record of c.&amp;nbsp;700, Peddavaduguru inscription of [[Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II]], the [[Kanchi]] Kailasanatha Temple inscription and [[Pattadakal]] Virupaksha Temple inscription of [[Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;II]] (all in Kannada language) provide more evidence of the Chalukya language.&lt;ref name="chalukyalangauge"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 6, p. 10, p. 57, p. 59, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chalukyalanguage1"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p. 76, p. 159, pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; The Badami cliff inscription of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;I (543), the [[Mahakuta Pillar]] inscription of [[Mangalesha]] (595) and the [[Aihole inscriptions|Aihole inscription]] of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old [[Kannada script]].&lt;ref name="language"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="language1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Badami Chalukyans' magical transformation|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jul262005/spectrum1422512005725.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210222449/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jul262005/spectrum1422512005725.asp|archivedate=2007-02-10 |author= Azmathulla Shariff |work= Deccan Herald, Spectrum, July 26, 2005|accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="language2"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3249519|title=The Mahākuṭa Pillar and Its Temples|first=Carol Radcliffe|last=Bolon|date=1 January 1979|publisher=|volume=41|issue=2/3|pages=253–268|doi=10.2307/3249519}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reign of the Chalukyas saw the arrival of Kannada as the predominant language of inscriptions along with Sanskrit, in areas of the Indian peninsula outside what is known as [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilaham]] (Tamil country).&lt;ref name="Peninsula"&gt;Thapar, (2003), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Several coins of the Badami Chalukyas with Kannada legends have been found. All this indicates that Kannada language flourished during this period.&lt;ref name="coins"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 12, 57, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelogues of contemporary foreign travellers have provided useful information about the Chalukyan empire. The Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] had visited the court of [[Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II]]. At the time of this visit, as mentioned in the [[Aihole]] record, Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II had divided his empire into three ''Maharashtrakas'' or great provinces comprising 99,000 villages each. This empire possibly covered present day [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Konkan|coastal Konkan]].&lt;ref name="rastra"&gt;Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;II's ''Maharashtra'' extended from [[Nerbudda]] ([[Narmada River|Narmada]] river) in the north to [[Tungabhadra]] in the south (Vaidya 1924, p. 171)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="actions"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang, impressed with the governance of the empire observed that the benefits of the king's efficient administration was felt far and wide. Later, Persian emperor [[Khosrau&amp;nbsp;II]] exchanged ambassadors with Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name="Persia"&gt;From the notes of Arab traveller Tabari (Kamath 2001, p. 60)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="persia1"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 75, part 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion, Pia Brancaccio, BRILL, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA82 p.82]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legends ===
Court poets of the Western Chalukya dynasty of Kalyani narrate:
:"Once when Brahma, the creator, was engaged in the performance of the ''sandhya'' (twilight) rituals, Indra approached and beseeched him to create a hero who could put to an end the increasing evil on earth. On being thus requested, Brahma looked steadily into the ''Chuluka-jala'' (the water of oblation in his palm) and out sprang thence a great warrior, the progenitor of the Chalukyas".&lt;ref name="palm"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Chalukyas claimed to have been nursed by the ''[[Matrika|Sapta Matrikas]]'' ("seven divine mothers") and were worshippers of many gods including Siva, Vishnu, Chamundi, Surya, Kubera, Parvati, Vinayaka and Kartikeya.

Some scholars connect the Chalukyas with the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukyas]] (Solankis) of [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="sen28"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-93-80607-34-4 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a myth mentioned in latter manuscripts of [[Prithviraj Raso]], Chaulukyas were born out of fire-pit (Agnikund) at [[Mount Abu]]. However it has been reported that the story of [[Agnivansha|Agnikula]] is not mentioned at all in the original version of the [[Prithviraj Raso]] preserved in the Fort Library at [[Bikaner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ldo1QtQigosC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq |title=Early Aryans to Swaraj |last=S.R. Bakshi |last2=S.G |year=2005 |isbn=978-81-7625-537-0 |page=325 |quote=It has been reported that the story of agnikula is mot mentioned at all in the original version of the Raso preserved in the Fort Library at Bikaner.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Nilagunda inscription of King Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;VI (11th century or later), the Chalukyas originally hailed from [[Ayodhya]] where fifty-nine kings ruled, and later, sixteen more of this family ruled from South India where they had migrated. This is repeated by his court poet Bilhana, who claims that the first member of the family, "Chalukya", was so named as he was born in the "hollow of the hands" of God [[Brahma]].&lt;ref name="ayodhya"&gt;Kamath 2001, pp. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ayodhya1"&gt;Quote:"Another unhistorical trend met with in the epigraphical records of the 11th and subsequent centuries is the attempt, on the part of the court poets, no doubt, again, with the consent of their masters, to invent mythical genealogies which seek to carry back the antiquity of the royal families not merely to the periods of the epics and the Vedas but to the very moment of their creation in the heavens. As far as the Chalukyas of Vatapi are concerned, the blame of engineering such travesties attaches, once again, to the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani and their Eastern Chalukya contemporaries. The Eastern Chalukyas, for instance, have concocted the following long list of fifty-two names commencing with no less a personage than the divine preserver"(Ramesh 1984, p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a theory put forward by Lewis, the Chalukya were descendants of the "[[Seleucid Empire|Seleukia]]" tribe of [[Iraq]] and that their conflict with the [[Pallava]] of Kanchi was, but a continuation of the conflict between ancient Seleukia and "[[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]", the proposed ancestors of [[Pallavas]]. However, this theory has been rejected by Kamath as it seeks to build lineages based simply on similar-sounding clan names.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Dr. Lewis's theory has not found acceptance because the Pallavas were in constant conflict with the Kadambas, prior to the rise of Chalukyas (Kamath 2001, p. 57)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Periods in Chalukya history ==
{{Chalukyas|Badami}}
The Chalukyas ruled over the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] plateau in India for over 600 years. During this period, they ruled as three closely related, but individual dynasties. These are the "Chalukyas of Badami" (also called "Early Chalukyas"), who ruled between the 6th and the 8th century, and the two sibling dynasties, the "Chalukyas of Kalyani" (also called [[Western Chalukyas]] or "Later Chalukyas") and the "Chalukyas of Vengi" (also called [[Eastern Chalukyas]]).

=== Chalukyas of Badami ===
[[File:Bhutanatha temple in Badami, Karnataka, India.jpg|thumb|300px|Bhutanatha temple complex, at [[Badami]]]]
In the 6th century, with the decline of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] and their immediate successors in northern India, major changes began to happen in the area south of the [[Vindhyas]]&amp;nbsp;– the Deccan and [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilaham]]. The age of small kingdoms had given way to large empires in this region.&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;Thapar (2003), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The Chalukya dynasty was established by [[Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;I]] in 543.&lt;ref name="puli"&gt;Popular theories regarding the name are: ''Puli''&amp;nbsp;– "tiger" in Kannada and ''Kesin''&amp;nbsp;– "haried" in Sanskrit; ''Pole''&amp;nbsp;– "lustrous" in Kannada, from his earliest Badami cliff inscription that literally spells ''Polekesi''; ''Pole''&amp;nbsp;– from Tamil word ''Punai'' (to tie a knot; Ramesh 1984, pp. 31–32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulikesi"&gt;The name probably meant "the great lion" (Sastri 1955, p. 134)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strength"&gt;The name probably meant "One endowed with the strength of a great lion" (Chopra 2003, p. 73, part 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;I took Vatapi (modern [[Badami]] in [[Bagalkot]] district, [[Karnataka]]) under his control and made it his capital. Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;I and his descendants are referred to as "Chalukyas of Badami". They ruled over an empire that comprised the entire state of Karnataka and most of [[Andhra Pradesh]] in the Deccan.

Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II, whose pre-coronation name was Ereya,&lt;ref name="coronate"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; commanded control over the entire Deccan and is perhaps the most well-known emperor of the Badami dynasty.&lt;ref name="ereya"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greatest"&gt;Chopra 2003, p. 74, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the notable kings in Indian history.&lt;ref name="fame"&gt;Quote:"His fame spread far and wide even beyond India" (Chopra 2003, p. 75 part 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Immadi"&gt;Quote:"One of the great kings of India". He successfully defied the expansion of king Harshavardhana of Northern India into the deccan. The Aihole inscription by Ravikirti describes how King Harsha lost his ''Harsha'' or cheerful disposition after his defeat. The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang also confirms Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;II's victory over King Harsha in his travelogue. Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;II took titles such as ''Prithvivallabha'' and ''Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy'' (Kamath 2001, pp. 58–60)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Immadi1"&gt;Quote:"Thus began one of the most colourful careers in Indian History" (Ramesh 1984, p. 76)&lt;/ref&gt; His queens were princess from the [[Alupas|Alupa Dynasty]] of [[South Canara]] and the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] of [[Talakad]], clans with whom the Chalukyas maintained close family and marital relationships.&lt;ref name="son"&gt;Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;I, who later revived the Chalukya fortunes was born to Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;II and the daughter of Western Ganga monarch [[Durvinita]] (Chopra 2003, p. 74, part 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kadam"&gt;His other queen, an Alupa princess called Kadamba was the daughter of Aluka Maharaja (G.S.

The Badami Chalukya dynasty went into a brief decline following the death of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II due to internal feuds when Badami was occupied by the Pallavas for a period of thirteen years.&lt;ref name="occupy"&gt;This is attested to by an inscription behind the Mallikarjuna temple in Badami (Sastri 1955, p. 136)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="decline"&gt;Chopra (2003), pp. 75–76, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; It recovered during the reign of [[Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;I]], who succeeded in pushing the Pallavas out of Badami and restoring order to the empire. Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;I took the title "Rajamalla" (''lit'' "Sovereign of the ''Mallas''" or Pallavas).&lt;ref name="pushout"&gt;From the Gadval plates dated c. 674 of Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;I (Chopra 2003, p. 76, part 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The thirty-seven year rule of [[Vijayaditya]] (696–733) was a prosperous one and is known for prolific temple building activity.&lt;ref name="activity"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 76, part 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire was its peak again during the rule of the illustrious [[Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;II]] (733–744) who is known not only for his repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava [[Nandivarman&amp;nbsp;II]], but also for his benevolence towards the people and the monuments of Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital.&lt;ref name="activity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="capital1"&gt;From the Kannada inscription at the Kailasanatha temple in Kanchipuram (Sastri 1955, p. 140)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="behave"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a [[Kannada]] inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple.&lt;ref name="capital1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi"&gt;Thapar (2003), p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi2"&gt;Ramesh (1984), pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign Arab intruders of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] invaded southern Gujarat which was under Chalukya rule but the Arabs were defeated and driven out by Pulakesi, a Chalukya governor of Navsari.&lt;ref&gt;Dikshit, Durga Prasad (1980), p. 166–167, ''Political History of the Chālukyas of Badami'', Abhinav Publications, New Delhi, OCLC 831387906&lt;/ref&gt; He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the [[Pandya]]s, the [[Chola]]s and the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] in addition to subduing a [[Kalabhra]] ruler.&lt;ref name="kanchi3"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The last Chalukya king, [[Kirtivarman&amp;nbsp;II]], was overthrown by the [[Rashtrakuta]] King [[Dantidurga]] in 753.&lt;ref name="overthrow"&gt;Ramesh (1984), pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; At their peak, the Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the [[Kaveri]] in the south to the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] in the north.

=== Chalukyas of Kalyani ===
{{Main|Western Chalukya Empire}}
The Chalukyas revived their fortunes in 973 after over 200 years of dormancy when much of the Deccan was under the rule of the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami [[Chalukya]] dynasty of the 6th century&lt;ref name="related"&gt;Poet [[Bilhana]]s 12th century Sanskrit work '' Vikramadeva Charitam'' and [[Ranna (Kannada poet)|Ranna]]'s Kannada work ''Gadayuddha'' (982) and inscriptions from Nilagunda, Yevvur, Kauthem and Miraj claim Tailapa&amp;nbsp;II was son of Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;IV, seventh in descent from Bhima, brother of Badami Chalukya [[Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;II]] (Kamath 2001, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malla"&gt;Kings of the Chalukya line of [[Vemulwada, Karimnagar District|Vemulavada]], who were certainly from the Badami Chalukya family line used the title "Malla" which is often used by the Western Chalukyas. Names such as "Satyashraya" which were used by the Badami Chalukya are also names of a Western Chalukya king, (Gopal B.R. in Kamath 2001, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt; while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas.&lt;ref name="unrelated"&gt;Unlike the Badami Chalukyas, the Kalyani Chalukyas did not claim to be ''Harithiputhras'' of ''Manavysya gotra'' in lineage. The use of titles like ''Tribhuvanamalla'' marked them as of a distinct line (Fleet, Bhandarkar and Altekar in Kamath 2001, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tailapa II]], a Rashtrakuta feudatory ruling from Tardavadi&amp;nbsp;– 1000 ([[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur district]]) overthrew [[Karka&amp;nbsp;II]], re-established the Chalukya rule in the western Deccan and recovered most of the Chalukya empire.&lt;ref name="Tailapa"&gt;Later legends and tradition hailed Tailapa as an incarnation of the God [[Krishna]] who fought 108 battles against the race of Ratta ([[Rashtrakuta]]) and captured 88 fortresses from them (Sastri 1955, p. 162)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indi"&gt;From his c. 957 and c.965 records (Kamath 2001, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Chalukyas ruled for over 200 years and were in constant conflict with the [[Cholas]], and with their cousins, the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] of Vengi. [[Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;VI]] is widely considered the most notable ruler of the dynasty.&lt;ref name="Vijnyan"&gt;Vijnyaneshavara, the Sanskrit scholar in his court, eulogised him as "a king like none other" (Kamath 2001, p. 106)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="era2"&gt;The writing ''Vikramankadevacharita'' by Bilhana is a eulogy of the achievements of the king in 18 cantos (Sastri, 1955 p. 315)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from the very beginning of his reign, which lasted fifty years, he abolished the original ''Saka'' era and established the ''Vikrama Era''. Most subsequent Chalukya inscriptions are dated in this new era.&lt;ref name="Era"&gt;Cousens 1926, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="era1"&gt;Vikrama–Chalukya era of 1075&amp;nbsp;CE (Thapar 2003, p. 469)&lt;/ref&gt; Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;VI was an ambitious and skilled military leader. Under his leadership the Western Chalukyas were able to end the Chola influence over Vengi (coastal Andhra) and become the dominant power in the Deccan.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 139, part 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dominant"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Chalukya period was an important age in the development of [[Kannada literature]] and [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="golden"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="golden1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; They went into their final dissolution towards the end of the 12th century with the rise of the [[Hoysala Empire]], the [[Pandyas]], the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]] and the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]].&lt;ref name="disappear"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chalukyas of Vengi ===
{{Main|Eastern Chalukyas}}
Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern [[Andhra Pradesh]] in 616, defeating the remnants of the [[Vishnukundina]] kingdom. He appointed his brother [[Kubja Vishnuvardhana]] as Viceroy in 621.&lt;ref name="kubja"&gt;Pulakesi&amp;nbsp;II made Vishnuvardhana the ''Yuvaraja'' or crown prince. Later Vishnuvardhana become the founder of the Eastern Chalukya empire (Sastri 1955, pp. 134–136, p. 312)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yuva"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 132, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock.&lt;ref name="stock10"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between [[Nellore]] and [[Visakhapatnam]].&lt;ref name="yuva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vengi"&gt;Kamath 2001, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas.&lt;ref name="subordinate"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya&amp;nbsp;II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima&amp;nbsp;I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima&amp;nbsp;I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.&lt;ref name="subordinate" /&gt;

The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the [[Chola]] kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman&amp;nbsp;I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king [[Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="rajaraja"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="subordinate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brook"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and literature, though, after a period of time, local factors took over and they gave importance to [[Telugu language]].&lt;ref name="stock"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stock1"&gt;The Eastern Chalukya inscriptions show a gradual shift towards Telugu with the appearance of Telugu stanzas from the time of king Gunaga Vijayaditya (Vijayaditya&amp;nbsp;III) in the middle of the 9th century, {{cite web|title=APOnline-History of Andhra Pradesh-ancient period-Eastern Chalukyas|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/history_ancient.html#ChalukyasPart|author=Dr. K.S.S.

[[File:Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal.jpg|thumb|right|Virupaksha temple in ''Dravidian'' style at [[Pattadakal]], built 740 CE]]
The Badami Chalukya era was an important period in the development of South Indian architecture. The kings of this dynasty were called ''Umapati Varlabdh'' and built many temples for the Hindu god Shiva.&lt;ref name="Tartakov"&gt;by Tartakov, Gary Michael (1997), ''The Durga Temple at Aihole: A Historiographical Study'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-563372-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their style of architecture is called "Chalukyan architecture" or "Karnata Dravida architecture".&lt;ref name="dravida"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monuments1"&gt;Quote"The Badami Chalukyas had introduced a glorious chapter, alike in heroism in battle and cultural magnificence in peace, in the western Deccan" (K.V. Sounder Rajan in Kamath 2001, p. 68)&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a hundred monuments built by them, rock cut (cave) and structural, are found in the [[Malaprabha]] river basin in modern [[Bagalkot district]] of northern Karnataka.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;Kamath 2001, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The building material they used was a reddish-golden [[Sandstone]] found locally. These cave temples are basically excavations, cut out of the living rock sites they occupy. They were not built as their structural counterparts were, rather created by a special technique known as "subtraction" and are basically sculptural.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr, Gary (1970), p.156, ''Chronology and Development of the Chāḷukya Cave Temples'', Ars Orientalis, Vol. 8, pp. 155–184&lt;/ref&gt; Though they ruled a vast empire, the Chalukyan workshops concentrated most of their temple building activity in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland&amp;nbsp;– [[Aihole]], [[Badami Cave Temples|Badami]], [[Pattadakal]] and [[Mahakuta group of temples|Mahakuta]] in modern Karnataka state.&lt;ref name="mahakuta"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Their temple building activity can be categorised into three phases. The early phase began in the last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one [[Veda|Vedic]], one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE).&lt;ref name="alam" /&gt; These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, each has a plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a pillared [[verandah]], a columned hall (''[[mandapa|mantapa]]'') and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship.&lt;ref name="motif"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of [[Harihara]], [[Durga|Mahishasuramardhini]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], Trivikrama, [[Vishnu]] seated on [[Shesha|Anantha]] (the snake) and [[Nataraja]] (dancing [[Shiva]]).&lt;ref name="trivikrama"&gt;Quote:"The Chalukyas cut rock like titans but finished like jewellers"(Sheshadri in Kamath 2001, pp. 68–69)&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of temple building was at Aihole (where some seventy structures exist and has been called "one of the cradles of Indian temple architecture"&lt;ref name="cradle"&gt;[[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] in Kamath (2001), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;) and Badami. Though the exact dating of these temples has been debated, there is consensus that the beginnings of these constructions are from c.&amp;nbsp;600.&lt;ref name="struct"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="victory"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;Foekema (2003), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; These are the [[Lad Khan Temple]] (dated by some to c.&amp;nbsp;450 but more accurately to 620) with its interesting perforated stone windows and sculptures of river goddesses; the Meguti Jain Temple (634) which shows progress in structural design; the Durga Temple with its northern Indian style tower (8th century) and experiments to adapt a Buddhist ''Chaitya'' design to a brahminical one (its stylistic framework is overall a hybrid of north and south Indian styles.&lt;ref name="Tartakov" /&gt;); the Huccimalli Gudi Temple with a new inclusion, a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], connecting the sanctum to the hall.&lt;ref name="hucci"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp. 407–408&lt;/ref&gt; Other ''dravida'' style temples from this period are the Naganatha Temple at Nagaral; the Banantigudi Temple, the Mahakutesvara Temple and the Mallikarjuna Temple at Mahakuta; and the Lower Sivalaya Temple, the Malegitti Sivalaya Temple (upper) and the Jambulingesvara Temple at Badami.&lt;ref name="victory" /&gt; Located outside the Chalukyan architectural heartland, 140&amp;nbsp;km south-east of Badami, with a structure related to the Early Chalukya style is the unusual Parvati Temple at [[Sanduru]] which dates to the late 7th century. It is medium-sized, 48&amp;nbsp;ft long and 37&amp;nbsp;ft wide. It has a ''nagara'' (north Indian) style ''vimana'' (tower) and ''dravida'' (south Indian) style parts, has no [[mantapa]] (hall) and consists of an ''[[antarala]]'' ([[Antechamber|vestibule]]) crowned with a barrel-vaulted tower (''sukhanasi''). The "staggered" base plan of the temple became popular much later, in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="parvati"&gt;Carol Radcliffe Bolon, (1980) pp. 303–326, ''The Pārvatī Temple, Sandur and Early Images of Agastya'',  Artibus Asiae Vol. 42, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sand"&gt;Hardy (1995), p.342, p.278&lt;/ref&gt;

The structural temples at Pattadakal, built in the 8th century and now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], marks the culmination and mature phase of Badami Chalukyan architecture. The Bhutanatha group of temples at Badami are also from this period. There are ten temples at Pattadakal, six in southern ''dravida'' style and four in the northern ''nagara'' style. Well known among these are the Sangamesvara Temple (725), the Virupaksha Temple (740–745) and the Mallikarjuna Temple (740–745) in the southern style. The Papanatha temple (680) and Galaganatha Temple (740) are early attempts in the ''nagara''&amp;nbsp;– ''dravida'' fusion style.&lt;ref name="fuse"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptional evidence suggests that the Virupaksha and the Mallikarjuna Temples were commissioned by the two queens of King Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;II after his military success over the Pallavas of Kanchipuram.&lt;ref name="victory" /&gt; Some well known names of Chalukyan architects are Revadi Ovajja, Narasobba and [[Gundan Anivaritachari|Anivarita Gunda]].&lt;ref name="artist"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of Western Chalukyas was an important period in the development of Deccan architecture. Their architecture served as a conceptual link between the Badami Chalukya architecture of the 8th century and the [[Hoysala architecture]] popularised in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="indianart"&gt;Quote:"Their creations have the pride of place in Indian art tradition" (Kamath 2001, p. 115)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indianart1"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of their cultural and temple-building activity lay in the [[Tungabhadra]] region of modern Karnataka state, encompassing the present-day [[Dharwad district]]; it included areas of present-day [[Haveri district|Haveri]] and [[Gadag district|Gadag]] districts.&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;Cousens (1926, p 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gad"&gt;Foekema (1996), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Here, large medieval workshops built numerous monuments.&lt;ref name="workshop"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing [[Dravidian architecture|dravida]] temples, defined the ''Karnata dravida'' tradition.&lt;ref name="kardra"&gt;Hardy (1995), pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)|Mahadeva Temple]] at Itagi in the [[Koppal district]],&lt;ref name="maha"&gt;Cousens (1926), pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy10"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; the Kasivisvesvara Temple at [[Lakkundi]] in the [[Gadag district]],&lt;ref name="kasi"&gt;Cousens (1926), pp. 79–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy11"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti,&lt;ref name="hardy11" /&gt; and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali,&lt;ref name="hardy13"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; both in the [[Davangere district]].&lt;ref name="kal"&gt;The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi has been called the finest in Kannada country after the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] at Halebidu (Cousens in Kamath 2001, p 117)&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable constructions are the [[Dodda Basappa Temple]] at [[Dambal]] (Gadag district),&lt;ref name="dam1"&gt;Cousens (1926), pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy14"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Siddhesvara Temple]] at [[Haveri]] ([[Haveri district]]),&lt;ref name="sidd"&gt;Cousens (1926), pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy15"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri ([[Dharwad district]]).&lt;ref name="amrtesh"&gt;Foekema (2003), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy16"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Chalukyas built some fine temples at Alampur, in modern eastern Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref name="alam"&gt;Hardy (1995), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alampur"&gt;The Badami Chalukyas influenced the art of the rulers of Vengi and those of Gujarat (Kamath 2001, pp. 68, 69)&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier inscription in Mahakuta, in prose is comparable to the works of Bana (Sastri, 1955, p. 312)&lt;/ref&gt; A few verses of a poet named Vijayanaka who describes herself as the "dark [[Sarasvati]]" have been preserved.

From the period of the Badami Chalukyas, references are made to the existence of Kannada literature, though not much has survived.&lt;ref name="survive10"&gt;Sen (1999), p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions however refer to Kannada as the "natural language".&lt;ref name="survive"&gt;Thapar (2003), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kappe Arabhatta]] record of c. 700 in ''[[tripadi]]'' (three line) metre is the earliest available work in Kannada poetics.&lt;ref name="tri"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1717&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karnateshwara" /&gt; ''Karnateshwara Katha'', which was quoted later by Jayakirti, is believed to be a eulogy of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II and to have belonged to this period.&lt;ref name="karnateshwara"&gt;Chidananda Murthy in Kamath (2001), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Other probable Kannada writers, whose works are not extant now but titles of which are known from independent references&lt;ref name="inde"&gt;Such as Indranandi's ''Srutavatara'', Devachandra's ''Rajavalikathe'' (Narasimhacharya, 1934, pp. 4–5); Bhattakalanka's ''Sabdanusasana'' of 1604 (Sastri 1955, p. 355)&lt;/ref&gt; are Syamakundacharya (650), who is said to have authored the ''Prabhrita'', and Srivaradhadeva (also called Tumubuluracharya, 650 or earlier), the possible author of the ''Chudamani'' ("Crest Jewel"), a lengthy commentary on [[logic]].&lt;ref name="survive10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tumbu"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srivarada"&gt;Mugali (1975), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extinct1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of the Western and Eastern Chalukyas, however, is a major event in the history of Kannada and Telugu literatures respectively. By the 9th–10th centuries, Kannada language had already seen some of its most notable writers. The "three gems" of [[Kannada literature]], [[Adikavi Pampa]], [[Sri Ponna]] and [[Ranna (Kannada poet)|Ranna]] belonged to this period.&lt;ref name="gems"&gt;Sastri 1955, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gems1"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 196, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[Telugu literature]] was born under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas with Nannaya Bhatta as its first writer.&lt;ref name="gems1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="begin"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

== Badami Chalukya country ==

=== Army ===
The army was well organised and this was the reason for Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II's success beyond the Vindyas.&lt;ref name="vindya"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 77, part1&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller [[Hiuen-Tsiang]] wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle.&lt;ref name="persia1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elephant"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; It was with their navy that they conquered ''Revatidvipa'' ([[Goa]]), and [[Puri]] on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term ''Karnatabala'' when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies.&lt;ref name="bala"&gt;Kamath 2001, pp. 57, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land governance ===
The government, at higher levels, was closely modelled after the [[Magadha]]n and [[Satavahana]] administrative machinery.&lt;ref name="persia1" /&gt; The empire was divided into ''Maharashtrakas'' (provinces), then into smaller ''Rashtrakas'' (''Mandala''), ''Vishaya'' (district), ''Bhoga'' (group of 10 villages) which is similar to the ''Dasagrama'' unit used by the [[Kadambas]]. At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;I even mentions a land unit called ''Dasagrama''.&lt;ref name="grama"&gt;The breakup of land into ''mandalas'', ''vishaya'' existed in the Kadamba administrative machinery (Kamath 2001, pp. 36, 65, 66)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Gangas]], the [[Bana Kingdom|Banas]] and the Sendrakas.&lt;ref name="bana"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of ''[[mahajan]]as'' (learned [[brahmin]]s) looked after ''agraharas'' (called ''ghatika'' or "place of higher learning") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 ''mahajans'' and Aihole which was served by 500 ''mahajanas''. Taxes were levied and were called the ''herjunka''&amp;nbsp;– tax on loads, the ''kirukula''&amp;nbsp;– tax on retail goods in transit, the ''bilkode''&amp;nbsp;– sales tax, the ''pannaya''&amp;nbsp;– betel tax, ''siddaya''&amp;nbsp;– land tax and the ''vaddaravula''&amp;nbsp;– tax levied to support royalty.&lt;ref name="bana" /&gt;

=== Coinage ===
The Badami Chalukyas minted coins that were of a different standard compared to the coins of the northern kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Varaha"&gt;However, they issued gold coins that weighed 120 grams, in imitation of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] (A.V. Narasimha Murthy in Kamath 2001, p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt; The coins had ''[[Devanagari|Nagari]]'' and Kannada legends.&lt;ref name="south1" /&gt; The coins of Mangalesha had the symbol of a temple on the obverse and a 'sceptre between lamps' or a temple on the reverse. Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II's coins had a caparisoned lion facing right on the obverse and a temple on the reverse. The coins weighed 4&amp;nbsp;grams and were called, in old-Kannada, ''hun'' (or ''honnu'') and had fractions such as ''fana'' (or ''fanam'') and the ''quarter fana'' (the modern day Kannada equivalent being ''hana''&amp;nbsp;– which literally means "money").&lt;ref name="hana"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Southern India: Coinage of the Chalukyas|url=http://prabhu.50g.com/southind/chalukya/south_chalcoin.html |author=Govindaraya Prabhu, S|publisher=Prabhu's Web Page On Indian Coinage|date=November 1, 2001|accessdate=2008-08-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201142248/http://prabhu.50g.com/southind/chalukya/south_chalcoin.html|archivedate=2008-12-01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gold coin called ''gadyana'' is mentioned in a record at the Vijayeshwara Temple at [[Pattadakal]], which later came to be known as ''[[varaha]]'' (their royal emblem).&lt;ref name="Varaha" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Cave temple number 3 at Badami.jpg|thumb|Vaishnava Cave temple No. 3 at Badami, 578 CE]]
{{Karnataka History}}
Both [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] flourished during the Badami Chalukya period, though it seems the former was more popular.&lt;ref name="popular"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 191, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; Famous temples were built in places such as Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests (''archakas'') were invited from northern India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows (''vrata'') and the giving of gifts (''dana'') was important.&lt;ref name="dana"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; The Badami kings were followers of [[Śrauta|Vedic]] Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Kartikeya]], [[Ganapathi]], [[Shakti]], [[Surya]] and ''[[Matrikas|Sapta Matrikas]]'' ("seven mothers"). The Badami kings also performed the [[Ashwamedha]] ("horse sacrifice").&lt;ref name="deity"&gt;Kamath 2001, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of [[Lajja Gauri]], a [[fertility goddess]] is known. [[Jainism]] too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged [[Jainism]]. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example.&lt;ref name="maguti"&gt;Chopra (2003), p. 78, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; Ravikirti, the court poet of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the [[Trimurti]] ("Hindu trinity") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, [[Harihara]] (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and ''Ardhanarishwara'' (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample evidence of their tolerance.&lt;ref name="deity" /&gt; Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This is confirmed by the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern [[Lakshmeshwar]] in the [[Gadag district]]) were primary places of learning.

=== Society ===
The [[Hindu caste system]] was present and devadasis were recognised by the government. Some kings had concubines (''ganikas'') who were given much respect,&lt;ref name="ganikas"&gt;Vinopoti, a concubine of King Vijayaditya is mentioned with due respect in an inscription (Kamath 2001, p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] was perhaps absent since widows like Vinayavathi and Vijayanka are mentioned in records. [[Devadasi]]s were however present in temples. Sage [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]]'s ''Natyashastra'', the precursor to [[Bharatanatyam]], the classical dance of South India, was popular and is seen in many sculptures and is mentioned in inscriptions.&lt;ref name="natyasastra"&gt;One record mentions an artist called Achala who was well versed in ''Natyashastra'' (Kamath 2001, p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt; Some women from the royal family enjoyed political power in administration. Queen Vijayanka was a noted Sanskrit poet,&lt;ref name="jayakirti" /&gt; Kumkumadevi, the younger sister of Vijayaditya (and queen of Alupa King Chitravahana) made several grants and had a Jain [[basadi]] called Anesajjebasadi constructed at Puligere,&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;From the Shiggaon plates of c. 707 and Gudigeri inscription dated 1076 (Ramesh 1984, pp. 142, 144)&lt;/ref&gt; and the queens of Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;II, Lokamahadevi and Trailokyamahadevi made grants and possibly consecrated the Lokesvara Temple (now called Virupaksha temple) but also and the Mallikarjuna temple respectively at Pattadakal.&lt;ref name="sanga"&gt;Cousens (1926), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The Chalukya era may be seen as the beginning of the fusion of cultures of northern and southern India, making way for the transmission of ideas between the two regions. This is seen clearly in the field of architecture. The Chalukyas spawned the ''Vesara'' style of architecture which includes elements of the northern ''nagara'' and southern ''dravida'' styles. During this period, the expanding Sanskritic culture mingled with local [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] vernaculars which were already popular.&lt;ref name="politics" /&gt; [[Dravidian languages]] maintain these influences even today. This influence helped to enrich literature in these languages.&lt;ref name="enrich"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu legal system owes much to the Sanskrit work ''Mitakshara'' by Vijnaneshwara in the court of Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;VI. Perhaps the greatest work in legal literature, ''Mitakshara'' is a commentary on ''Yajnavalkya'' and is a treatise on law based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of India. Englishman [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] later translated into English the section on inheritance, giving it currency in the British Indian court system.&lt;ref name="legal"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Western Chalukya rule that the [[Bhakti]] movement gained momentum in South India, in the form of [[Ramanujacharya]] and [[Basavanna]], later spreading into northern India.

A celebration called ''Chalukya utsava'', a three-day festival of music and dance, organised by the [[Government of Karnataka]], is held every year at Pattadakal, Badami and Aihole.&lt;ref name="utsav"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chalukya Utsava: Depiction of grandeur and glory|url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEK20060226013433&amp;Topic=0&amp;Title=Southern%20News%20-%20Karnataka&amp;Page=K|author=Staff correspondent|publisher=NewIndia Press|work=NewIndia Press, Sunday February 26, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092610/http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEK20060226013433&amp;Topic=0&amp;Title=Southern%20News%20-%20Karnataka&amp;Page=K|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is a celebration of the achievements of the Chalukyas in the realm of art, craft, music and dance. The program, which starts at Pattadakal and ends in Aihole, is inaugurated by the [[Chief Minister of Karnataka]]. Singers, dancers, poets and other artists from all over the country take part in this event. In the {{Nowrap|26 February}} 2006 celebration, 400 art troupes took part in the festivities. Colorful cutouts of the ''[[Varaha]]'' the Chalukya emblem, ''Satyashraya'' Pulakeshin (Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II), famous sculptural masterpieces such as [[Durga]], [[Durga|Mahishasuramardhini]] (Durga killing demon [[Mahishasura]]) were present everywhere. The program at Pattadakal is named ''Anivaritacharigund vedike'' after the famous architect of the Virupaksha temple, [[Gundan Anivaritachari]]. At Badami it is called ''Chalukya Vijayambika Vedike'' and at Aihole, ''Ravikirti Vedike'' after the famous poet and minister (Ravikirti) in the court of Pulakeshin&amp;nbsp;II. ''Immadi Pulakeshi'', a [[Kannada]] movie of the 1960s starring [[Rajkumar (actor)|Dr. Rajkumar]] celebrates the life and times of the great king.&lt;ref name="utsav" /&gt;

[[Image:Geniocracy.gif|178px|thumb|The book cover of [[Claude Vorilhon|Rael]]'s book ''Geniocracy'' (republished in 2004 by the [[Raelian Foundation]].]]
{{Raëlism}}
'''Economic humanitarianism''' is a collection of economic ideas which according to its creator [[Raël]] is designed to complement [[Geniocracy]].

==Relation with capitalism==
{{See also|Automation|Basic income|Capitalism|Technocracy movement}}
Economic humanitarianism accepts the [[capitalism|capitalist]] notion that through [[competition]] and technological [[innovation]], some companies may install [[automation]] in an attempt to reduce costs, which replaces jobs and reduces the ''aggregate'' consumer base.  ''As long as'' there are industries which have not reached maturity, the employment will return to a natural level, as will the consumer base.  In the framework of Economic Humanitarianism, capitalism is considered to be the best way for industries to mature in the long run.

In place once maturity of all industries is close at hand, automation is seen to ''eliminate'' jobs at a rate faster than new industries can introduce.  If the economic system is not reformed around this time, this not only reduces aggregate consumer base, but also the total consumer base, resulting in poverty despite normal levels of output.  Reflecting on history, the author of Economic Humanitarianism, [[Raël|Claude Vorilhon]], suggested that all employees whose labor was replaced by automation should have received supplemental income and that all individuals should receive minimal existence revenue (their fair share of what automation has to offer). Economic humanitarianism supports the implementation of a [[basic income]].

In [[Raël|Claude Vorilhon]]'s book ''Geniocracy'', he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously this system is not viable in a capitalist society, since once the owners automate their factories, they just sack all their workers without pay and let them starve while the machines do all the work, filling their own pockets with gold from the profit. This is unjust and should not be tolerated. The boss who builds a machine that replaces one hundred workers should continue to pay these workers who now have nothing to do. Thus the machine should allow them to enter and benefit from the age of leisure.

People often say that machines enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, but they are wrong! It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It is to the manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still have to work with the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In book 1 of 3 in [[Raël|Claude Vorilhon]]'s ''Intelligent Design'' was a text allegedly narrated by Yahweh, who according to him, is a humanoid extraterrestrial responsible for the creation of life on earth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;YOU could very soon live in a genuine terrestrial paradise if only the technology that you have at your disposal today were made to serve human well-being, instead of serving violence, armies, or the personal profit of a few.

Science and technology can totally liberate humanity not only from the problem of hunger in the world, but also from the obligation to work to live, since machines can quite easily look after the daily chores by themselves thanks to automation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economic rent==
{{See also|Economic rent|Georgism}}
One way to aid such an effort, Raelians believe, is by changing how property is exploited.  According to the Raelian Messages, the following was another official message from Yahweh:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are all born equal and this is also written in the Bible. Your governments should ensure that people are born with approximately the same level of financial means. It is unacceptable that  unintelligent children should live in luxury thanks to the fortunes amassed by their parents, while geniuses die of hunger and do any menial chore just to eat.
This way they forsake occupations where they could have made discoveries benefiting the whole of humanity. To avoid this, property ownership must be abolished without establishing Communism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under most capitalistic systems, money is created by issuing [[debt]] and is not necessarily introduced at birth.  Instead of property ownership, the humanitarianism described in the Raelian Messages involves of long-duration rent, an idea held by many proponents of [[Georgism]].  In the Raelian idea of humanitarianism, this should even apply in the case of businesses (as well as land):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits, but not for their children. To each their own merits. The same should apply to commercial and industrial enterprises.
If someone creates a business, it is theirs for their entire life, and they can rent it out, but never for more than forty-nine years. The same goes for farmers. They can rent land and cultivate it for forty-nine years but after that it all goes back to the State which will be able to rent it out again for another forty-nine years. Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.
This method must be adopted for all goods that remain exploitable...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under economic humanitarianism, the only legal inheritance is the family home.&lt;ref name="He wasn't born again -- he saw little green men / Founder of Raelian religion seeks secret to immortality"&gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-12-28/news/17575718_1_extraterrestrial-creators-raelian-form-of-social-justice He wasn't born again -- he saw little green men / Founder of Raelian religion seeks secret to immortality] ''[[SF Gate]]''. 28 December 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16296">[[Image:Methodistcommunion9.jpg|right|thumb|A United Methodist elder and [[deaconess]] at a [[service of worship]].]]
An '''Elder''', in many [[Methodist]] Churches, is ordained [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] that has the responsibilities to preach and teach, preside at the celebration of the [[sacraments]], administer the Church through pastoral guidance, and lead the congregations under their care in service ministry to the world.  

The office of ''elder'', then, is what most people tend to think of as the [[pastor]]al, [[priest]]ly, [[clergy]] office within the church.  In some of the [[List of Methodist denominations|denominations]] within Methodism that use the title, [[ordination]] to this office is open to both men and women, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Free Methodist Church]], [[Bible Methodist Connection of Churches]], and [[Evangelical Methodist Church]]. In other denominations such as the [[Primitive Methodist Church]], [[Evangelical Methodist Church of America]], [[Fundamental Methodist Conference, Inc.|Fundamental Methodist Conference]], [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]], and [[Southern Methodist Church]], only men are ordained as elders.&lt;ref name="PMC2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivemethodistchurch.org/Discipline-2013.pdf|title=Discipline of the Primitive Methodist Church in the United States of America|publisher=[[Primitive Methodist Church]]|language=English|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMC2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivemethodistchurch.org/Discipline-2013.pdf|title=Discipline of the Primitive Methodist Church in the United States of America|publisher=[[Primitive Methodist Church]]|language=English|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EWC2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church |year=2015|publisher=[[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]]|language=English|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodist denominations that have "a threefold ministry of deacons, elders, and bishops" include the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]], Free Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church, among other denominations represented in the [[World Methodist Council]].&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity|year=1999|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English |isbn=9789004116955|page=111|quote=Methodist Churches of the North American pattern that goes back to the Methodist Episcopal Church (founded in 1784) have historically maintained a threefold ministry of deacons, elders, and bishops, although such early American Methodist leaders as Francis Asbury maintained that the episcopacy was not a distinct order of ministry but a higher status of elders. The African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and the United Methodist Church all follow this pattern of episcopal leadership.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and origin ==
{{Further|Elder (Christianity)}}
"Elder" is an English translation of the Greek word ''Presbuteros'' ({{lang-gr|πρεσβύτερος}}), found in the [[New Testament]]. The word is also commonly transliterated as "[[presbyter]]". The office or "order" of presbyter is one of three orders of the traditional Christian priesthood, along with [[deacon]] and [[bishop]]. The founder of Methodism, [[John Wesley]], in the [[ordination]] rite, supplanted the ''[[Book of Common Prayer|Book of Common Prayer's]]'' term "[[Anglican ministry|priest]]" for "elder", although the rest of the liturgy remained the same.&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Karen B. Westerfield|title=American Methodist Worship|date=27 April 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780199774159|page=259}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denominational statements==
===Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection===
The ''Discipline'' of the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] states that:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|An elder is a preacher of the gospel, fully invested with all the functions of the Christian ministry. An elder is constituted such by election of the Connection, and by the laying on of the hands of some of the elders, and prayer. The president of the Connection shall lead the service unless the Connection orders otherwise and appoints some other person in his stead. ...  It is the duty of an elder to preach the gospel, to administer baptism and the Lord’s Supper, to perform all parts of divine worship, and to solemnize the rite of matrimony.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;}}

===Free Methodist Church===
The ''Book of Discipline'' of the [[Free Methodist Church]] states that:

{{quote|Election to elder’s orders constitutes the acknowledgement of the annual conference that the person so elected has met all the biblical (1 Timothy 3, Titus 1) and ecclesiastical requirements to serve as an overseer in the church. Only an ordained elder may serve as a ministerial delegate to General Conference, a conference superintendent or a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmcsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FMC_Book-of-Discipline1.pdf|title=The Book of Discipline of the Free Methodist Church|year=2007|publisher=Free Methodist Church|language=English|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Primitive Methodist Church===
The ''Discipline'' of the [[Primitive Methodist Church]] states that:

{{quote|An Elder shall have met all the requirements of the School of Theology and the Conference, and shall have received the rite of ordination. He shall have the full rights and privileges of the Conference and shall be entitled to participate in the system of itinerancy.&lt;ref name="PMC2013"/&gt;}}

===United Methodist Church===
The ''[[Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'' states that:

{{quote|Elders are ministers who have completed their formal preparation for the ministry of Word, Sacrament, and Order; have been elected itinerant members in full connection with an [[Annual Conference]]; and have been [[Ordination|ordained]] elders in accordance with the Order and Discipline of The United Methodist Church.}}
&lt;!--

 == Ordination and Apostolic Ministry ==
{{Methodism}}
{{cquote|
# The whole Church receives and accepts the call of God to embody and carry forth Christ's ministry in the world. Ordination originates in God's will and purpose for the Church.  There are persons within the Church community whose gifts, graces, and promise of future usefulness are observable to the community, who respond to God's call and offer themselves in leadership as ordained ministers.&lt;ref name="Discipline 1"&gt;''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 428 – Ordination and Apostolic Ministry'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The pattern for this response to the call is provided in the development of the early Church. The apostles led in prayer and preaching, organized the Christian community to extend Christ's ministry of love and reconciliation, and provided for guardianship and transmission of the gospel, as entrusted to the early Church, to later generations. Their ministry, though distinct, was never separate from the ministry of the whole people of God.&lt;ref name="Discipline 1" /&gt;}}

== The Purpose of Ordination ==
{{cquote|
# Ordination for such ministry is a gift from God to the Church. In ordination, the Church affirms and continues the apostolic ministry which it authorizes and authenticates through persons empowered by the Holy Spirit. As such, those who are ordained are committed to become conscious representatives of the whole gospel and are responsible for transmission of that gospel to the end that all the world may be saved. Their ordination is fulfilled in the ministry of Word, Sacrament, and Order.&lt;ref name="Discipline 2"&gt; ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 429 - Ordination and Apostolic Ministry'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Ordained persons are authorized to preach and teach the Word of God, administer the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, equip the laity for ministry, exercise pastoral oversight, and administer the Discipline of the Church.&lt;ref name="Discipline 2"&gt; ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 429 - Ordination and Apostolic Ministry'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The efficacy of the mission of the Church is dependent on the viable interaction of the general ministry and the ordained ministry of the Church. Without creative use of the diverse gifts of the entire [[Body of Christ]], the ministry of the Church is not effective. Without responsible leadership, there is no focus and definition of such ministry.&lt;ref name="Discipline 2"&gt; ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 429 - Ordination and Apostolic Ministry'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== The Act of Ordination ==
{{further|[[Apostolic_Succession#Methodist_Church|Apostolic Succession in the Methodist Church]]}}
{{cquote|Ordination is a public act of the Church which indicates acceptance by an individual of God's call to the upbuilding of the Church through the ministry of Word, Sacrament, and Order and acknowledgement and authentication of this call by the Christian community through prayers and the [[laying on of hands]]. 

It is a [[Christian worship|rite]] of the Church following [[New Testament]] usage as appears in the words of [[Second Epistle to Timothy|Paul to Timothy]]: "I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands" (II Timothy 1:6).

United Methodist tradition has entrusted persons in the ordained ministry with the responsibility for maintaining standards: for education and training and for examination and granting credentials to those who seek ordination. By the authorization of the ministerial members of the Annual Conference, candidates are elected into the Annual Conference and are ordained by a [[bishop]].

Ordination, thus, is that act by which the Church symobolizes a shared relationship between those ordained for sacramental and functional leadership and the Church community from which the person ordained has come. The community is initiated by God, is given meaning and direction by [[Christ]], and is sustained by the [[Holy Spirit]]. This relationship is a gift which comes through the [[Divine grace|grace of God]] in assurance of the ministry of Christ throughout the world. — ''[[Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]] ¶ 431''&lt;ref name="Discipline 6"&gt; ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 431 - The Act of Ordination'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Standards ==
According to the ''[[Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'', {{cquote|1. There are persons within the ministry of the baptized who are called of God and set apart by the Church for the specialized ministry of Word, Sacrament, and Order.&lt;ref name="Discipline 5"&gt; ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 402'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
2. While such persons set apart by the Church for the ministry of Word, Sacrament, and Order are subject to all the frailties of the human condition and pressures of society, they are required to maintain the highest standards represented by the practice of fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleless. Since the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching, self-awowed practicing homosexuals are not to be accepted as candidates, ordained as ministers, or appointed to serve in The United Methodist Church.&lt;ref name="Discipline 5"&gt; ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 402'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Marriage of Elders ==
Article XXI of the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] state that: {{cquote|The ministers of Christ are not commanded by God's law either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage; therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Christians, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve best to godliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1652 | publisher = The United Methodist Church | title = The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church | chapter = Article XXI—Of the Marriage of Ministers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} --&gt;

== Vestments and clericals ==
[[Image:GregoryNeal2004.jpg|thumb|right|115px|A Methodist Elder ready to preside at a Worship Service, wearing the ''[[clerical collar]]'', ''[[stole (vestment)|stole]]'', and ''[[pulpit robe]]''.]]

While not presiding at a [[service of worship]], Methodist elders are sometimes seen wearing the [[clerical collar]] and clergy shirt in public. [[Bands (neckwear)|Preaching tabs]] can also be worn around the neck in lieu of the clerical collar. Many Methodist elders choose not to wear [[clerical clothing]] in their daily activities.

When presiding at a service of worship, Methodist elders are often seen wearing [[Vestment|church vestments]], namely the [[pulpit robe]] or [[alb]], and to a lesser extent, the [[chasuble]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbod.org/worship/default_body.asp?act=reader&amp;item_id=1768 General Board of Discipleship of The United Methodist Church: Some Frequently Asked Questions About Clergy Attire and Proper Ways of Addressing Clergy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184628/http://www.gbod.org/worship/default_body.asp?act=reader&amp;item_id=1768 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stole (vestment)|Stoles]] that reflect the season of the [[Christian year]] are worn over the vestment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revneal.org/Writings/catholic.htm Grace Incarnate: Vestments in the Methodist Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt; Other elders choose not to wear vestments and are often seen in [[Suit (clothing)|suits]], [[dress clothes]] or casual clothing. However, stoles which represent the "yoke" of responsibility to the Church and to God are not to be worn unless the person has gone through the process of ordination which extends past education to a provisionary period culminating with a formal ordination service where the Bishop presides.

== Educational requirements ==
In most cases, Methodist elders must have graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in liberal education or equivalent degree in a college or university listed by the ''University Senate of the United Methodist Church'' and must have a [[Master of Divinity]] or equivalent degree in a [[Seminary|school of theology (seminary)]].&lt;ref name="Discipline 3"&gt;''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: ¶ 415 - Educational Requirements'' (retrieved 22 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, individual Annual Conferences may require that a [[Master of Divinity]] or equivalent first professional degree be the minimum standard for entrance into the [[Annual Conference|Annual Conference's]] Order of Elders, or [[presbyterate]]. Changes were made by the 1992 and 1996 General Conferences which revamped many aspects of the ordained offices in the [[United Methodist Church]]'s polity and doctrine and made the Order of Deacon a permanent, rather than transitional, office. These reforms also elevated the previously ''un''ordained office of Diaconal Minister, who were lay persons performing specialized tasks within a congregational or ministry staff setting (such as music, education, youth ministry, etc.) to ordained status as permanent Deacons as well.

He believes a qabalah is specifically related to three factors: a language, a 'holy' text or texts, and mathematical laws at work in these two.&lt;ref&gt;Stratton-Kent, Jake (May 1988). "What is a Qabalah?" in ''The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema'', Vol. VII, No. 2, pp. 59–61. ISSN 0953-7015.&lt;/ref&gt; Cath Thompson writes that the English Qaballa is the tool given by its Holy Book for the interpretation thereof and that it is itself a complete magickal system in theory and in practice, with a consistent philosophy, a coherently stable Mandala, and infinite correspondences.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Cath 2016 ''The Magickal Language of the Book of the Law'', Hadean Press {{ISBN|978 1 907881 68 8}} &lt;/ref&gt; Emery More further suggests that the Roman script and Arabic Numerals (the glyph set of the English Alphabet) being the standardized scripting of the Aeon, reveals new truths and natural orders hitherto unknown and should effectively replace those keys of past systems whose truth is already subsumed. &lt;ref&gt;More, Emery (2014) The English Qabalah, pg 249-252, {{ISBN|978-1-926716-27-5}}, 8th House Publishing, Montreal, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

[[Gematria]], on the other hand, is a system in which letters are equated to number values. The letters comprising the word or name of person or object are then summed together. The number of this sum is termed the key of that particular word. Words sharing the same key are said to share properties. The letters are often tabulated along with their numerical equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Stratton-Kent. "The Book of the Law and Its Qaballah." Kiblah, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;Vincent, Samuel K. (2007) Symposium IV, The English Qabalah&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jake Stratton-Kent, "The Serpent Tongue: Liber 187". UK: Hadean Press, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-907881-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the simplest 'serial gematria' for English letters would be the following: 

 A=1  B=2  C=3  D=4  E=5  F=6  G=7  H=8  I=9  J=10 K=11 L=12  M=13 N=14  
 O=15  P=16  Q=17  R=18  S=19  T=20  U=21  V=22  W=23  X=24  Y=25  Z=26

==Systems of English Qabalah==
===Willis. F Whitehead===
The first reference to an "English Qabalah" found in the literature was made by Willis F. Whitehead in 1898 in his book, "The Mystic Thesaurus" in which he describes a system he called ''English Cabala''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Willis F. ''The Mystic Thesaurus, Or Initiation in the Theoretical and Practical Secrets of Astral Truth, and Occult Art: The Symbol of the Cross''. Original from Harvard University, Digitized November 17, 2005, online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8MkCYYvSQxQC&amp;dq=%22english+cabala%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Aleister Crowley===
In 1904, Aleister Crowley wrote out the text of the foundational document of his world-view, known as Liber AL vel legis, or [[The Book of the Law]]. In this text was the injunction found at verse 2:55; "Thou shalt obtain the order &amp; value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto" which was understood by Crowley as referring to an English Qabalah yet to be developed or revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. (1974) Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law, 93 Publishing, Montreal, Quebec, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one of the [[Holy Books of Thelema]] written by Aleister Crowley in 1907, called ''Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang''&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; are 27 three-line diagrams known as 'trigrams', which are composed of a solid line for the Yang, a broken line for the Yin, and a point for the Tao. By attributing 26 Roman script letters to the trigrams of this work, Crowley felt that he had fulfilled the injunction to "obtain the order &amp; value of the English Alphabet", as noted in his 'Old Comment' to [[The Book of the Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. (1974) Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law 93 Publishing, Montreal, Quebec, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley did not go on to develop a full qabalah from this work, but many subsequent qabalists have been inspired by the injunction in verse 2:55 to develop a more complete system of English Qabalah, using various methods of exegesis.

===William Gray===
[[William G. Gray]] proposes another system in his 1984 book ''Concepts of Qabalah'',&lt;ref&gt;Gray, William G. ''Concepts of Qabalah''. Red Wheel Weiser, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87728-561-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; more recently republished as ''Qabalistic Concepts''.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, William G. ''Qabalistic Concepts: Living the Tree''. Weiser Books, 1997. {{ISBN|1-57863-000-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system has been summarized by Joan Schraith Cole&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;Summarized in Cole, Joan Schraith (2005). [http://www.lelandra.com/tarotbook/englishqabalah.htm The English Qabalah of WG Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; and includes correspondence attributions of the English letters to the positions on the [[Tree of Life]].

===William Eisen===
A system related to the [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[Agasha Temple of Wisdom]] was described by William Eisen in his two volume ''The English Cabalah'' (1980–82).&lt;ref&gt;Eisen, William. ''The English Cabala''. 2 vols. Marina del Rey, Calif.: DeVorss, 1980-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/inc-agasha-temple-of-wisdom Agasha Temple of Wisdom, Inc: Information from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Trigrammaton Qabalah (TQ)===
One system of English Qabalah with a strong English gematria component was proposed by R. L. Gillis in 1996, and published on his website since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Gillis, R.L.. [http://www.trigrammaton.com/ The Book of Mutations]&lt;/ref&gt; Known as Trigrammaton Qabalah, or TQ, this system is based on one of the [[Holy Books of Thelema]] written by [[Aleister Crowley]] in 1907, called ''Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang''. 
Liber Trigrammaton (aka Liber XXVII) was called by Crowley "the ultimate foundation of the highest theoretical qabalah".&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister (1983), ''The Holy Books of Thelema'', York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser&lt;/ref&gt;  In Liber XXVII are 27 three-line diagrams known as 'trigrams', which are composed of a solid line representing the Yang, a broken line representing the Yin, and a point representing the Tao. Crowley later attributed the 26 letters of the English alphabet to these trigrams, in an attempt to fulfill an injunction found in his earlier work [[The Book of the Law]], or [[Liber AL vel Legis]]. 

In Liber AL, verse 2:55 states: "Thou shalt obtain the order &amp; value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto". By attributing the English alphabet to the trigrams of his later work, Crowley considered this verse to be fulfilled, as noted in his "Old Comment" to [[The Book of the Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. (1974) ''Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law'', 93 Publishing, Montreal, Quebec, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; 
The TQ is an extension of Crowley's work with Liber Trigrammaton. By considering the numerical value of the 27 trigrams as expressions in Base 3, (or ternary), and then transferring those values to the letters attributed by Crowley to the trigrams, a system of English gematria is created. Further use is made of the trigrams to create a true qabalah in the sense of the definition provided by Jake Stratton-Kent above. In the TQ, correspondences are created with all the major forms of divination such as I Ching, tarot and runes, as well as Greek and Hebrew alphabets, the qabalistic Tree of Life, Western and Vedic astrology, magic squares, and the Platonic solids of geometry. A primary feature of this qabalah is a new understanding of the Cube of Space and its 26 components of edges, faces and vertices, which equal the number of Roman script letters used in the English alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Gillis, R. Leo. (2013). "Trigrammaton Qabalah". In Kaczynski, Richard and Thiebes, Joseph. ''Manifest Thy Glory.'' Ordo Templi Orientis, Riverside, CA. pp. 73-80. {{ISBN|978-1-490-36534-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trigrammaton English Gematria values are as follows:

 A=5  B=20  C=2  D=23  E=13  F=12  G=11  H=3  I=0  J=7 K=17 L=1  M=21
 N=24 O=10  P=4  Q=16  R=14  S=15  T=9   U=25 V=22 W=8 X=6  Y=18 Z=19

==Systems of English Gematria==
{{main|Arithmancy}}
The first appearance of a system of gematria using the natural order of the English alphabet was developed in 1532 by [[Michael Stifel]], who also proposed a system called the ''trigonal alphabet'', using successive [[triangular number]]s.&lt;ref name=Dudley&gt;Dudley, Underwood. ''Numerology, Or, What Pythagoras Wrought''. Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-88385-524-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|50}} Another early system of English gematria was used by poet [[John Skelton]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Julia. M. Medusa's Mirrors: ''Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and the metamorphosis of the female self'', pp. 33&amp;ndash;42 University of Delaware Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-87413-625-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogue of the Greek system of [[isopsephy]] using the Latin alphabet appeared in 1583.&lt;ref name=Dudley/&gt;{{Rp|49}} Other variations appeared in 1683 (simply referred to as the ''1683 alphabet'', this system was used by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in ''[[War and Peace]]'' to identify [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] with the [[number of the Beast]]) and 1707 (''Alphabetum Cabbalisticum Vulgare''). These and other variations are detailed in Underwood Dudley's ''Numerology, Or, What Pythagoras Wrought''.&lt;ref name=Dudley/&gt;{{Rp|49–51}}

More recently, [[Michael Bertiaux]] described a system called ''Angelic Gematria'' in his ''The Voudon Gnostic Workbook'' (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Bertiaux, Michael. ''The Voudon Gnostic Workbook''. Magickal Childe, 1989. {{ISBN|0-939708-12-4}}. Republished as ''The Voudon Gnostic Workbook: Expanded Edition'', p. 82. Weiser, 2007. {{ISBN|1-57863-339-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Rankine described a system of English gematria&lt;ref name="Drury, Nevill 2006"&gt;Drury, Nevill (2006). ''The Watkins Dictionary of Magic''. Sterling Publishing Company. {{ISBN|1-84293-152-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|244}} using [[prime number]]s which he calls ''Prime Qabalah'' in his book ''Becoming Magick'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Rankine, David. ''Becoming Magick: New &amp; Revised Magicks for the New Aeon''. Mandrake, 2004. {{ISBN|1-869928-81-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ALW Cipher===
According to [[Allen Greenfield]], Carol Smith discovered the ALW Cipher, which she later called "English Qaballa", in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, ''Secret cipher of the UFO-nauts'', 2005, p 4, 21 &amp; 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a popular error which Smith attempted to persuade Greenfield to correct, but to no avail. James Lees discovered the Key on November 26 1976 and he named the new order &amp; value of the English Alphabet "English Qaballa". He chose that spelling deliberately because it was not in popular use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Cath 2016 ''The Magickal Language of the Book of the Law'', Hadean Press {{ISBN|978 1 907881 68 8}} &lt;/ref&gt;  The cipher and the reasoning behind it, and other details of the system were published in five issues of ''The New Equinox / British Journal of Magick'' in a number of essays written by Lees and edited by Smith and given different bylines, which led to the aforementioned inaccuracy .&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Carol (1981). "The Key to the English Qaballa" in ''The New Equinox / British Journal of Magick'', Vol. 5, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this original material was later summarized by Jake Stratton-Kent in ''The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema''.&lt;ref&gt;Stratton-Kent, Jake (March 1988). "The English Qaballa" in ''The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema'', Vol. VII, No. 1, pp. 17–25. ISSN 0953-7015.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then other self-published authors have discussed the system, referring to it as ''New Aeon English Qabala''.&lt;ref&gt;Del Campo, Gerald (2003). ''New Aeon English Qabalah Revealed''. Luxor Press. {{ISBN|1-891948-06-7}} (reviewed in Adams, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L. Crow. "The New Aeon English Qabalah Dictionary". Marietta, GA: The Luxor Press, 2002. {{ISBN|1-891948-07-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''order &amp; value'' of the letters in the ALW Cipher can be derived from the grid superimposed on one of the pages of manuscript of [[Liber AL]] on which this verse appears (sheet 16 of Chapter III). Also appearing on this page are a diagonal line and a circled cross. Thelemites believe the book of the law should ideally only be printed in Crowley's hand-written version, because the books says there are messages in the chance shapes Crowley's handwriting made, or any shapes he adds to the pages.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith (1980) quoted in Frater D.T. (1996) and Greenfield (1994), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It is plain to see that whichever top-left to bottom-right diagonal is read the magickal order of the letters is obtained.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;

As there are ten squares per column, this method is equivalent to taking every eleventh letter of the alphabet as the ''order'' and then assigning them sequential ''values'':

 A=1  L=2  W=3  H=4  S=5  D=6  O=7  Z=8  K=9  V=10 G=11 R=12 C=13
 N=14 Y=15 J=16 U=17 F=18 Q=19 B=20 M=21 X=22 I=23 T=24 E=25 P=26
The proof given by the grid was noted some time after the order and value was originally worked out by James Lees. Lees had seen that the number 286 is the sum of 13x22 (a reference to the Hebrew alphabet of 22 letters) and of 11x26, the latter indicating the 26 letters of the English alphabet and the Key number 11 which unlocks the magical cipher.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Cath 2016 ''The Magickal Language of the Book of the Law'', Hadean Press {{ISBN|978 1 907881 68 8}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In the original handwritten text, the string of letters and numbers in the 76th verse of the second chapter is divided into two lines, the first ending with "Y" and the second beginning with "X". Stratton-Kent thought that in the manuscript the 'X' at the beginning of line two looked like a multiplication symbol, so he added each line's values together and multiplied them; 17x11=187, the numerical value of the phrase "English alphabet", which he felt confirmed the correctness of the system.&lt;ref name=p18&gt;Stratton-Kent (March 1988), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Also notable in this period of development was the contributions of Tina Coutu, Coutu was also a member of the OBLH, and had worked with the Head of that order at the time, William Wallace Webb (aka 'Frater Damon'). Coutu was a computer programmer and network engineer, who, in the late 1980s, developed the second text analysis software for Qaballists, called LEXICON. (The first text analysis software was written in 1984-5 for James Lees by Trevor Langford. Langford subsequently worked with Stratton Kent on ''The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema''.&lt;ref&gt;Stratton-Kent, Jake ''The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema'', Vol. VII, No. 1, ISSN 0953-7015.&lt;/ref&gt; ) The Lexicon software enabled large scale analysis of entire texts, which enabled an almost exponential expansion in the available research. LEXICON allowed a user to input any type of cipher key, and it was here that ALW began to be colloquially referred to by LEXICON users as 'Cipher 6'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webring.org/l/rd?ring=gnosis;id=1;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebspace%2Ewebring%2Ecom%2Fpeople%2Ffu%2Fum_8381%2Flexicon%2Ehtml&lt;/ref&gt; Coutu, or 'Soror Ishtaria', was a close colleague of Allen Greenfield.

===ALW and Cipher X===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In 1994, E. Joel Love, a student of the ALW Cipher (who was both a colleague of Greenfield and Coutu), and a member of the Hermetic Alchemical Order of the QBLH, proposed another English cipher that he would call 'Cipher X'. Love possessed a high mathematical aptitude and formal training in Cryptography in the U.S Coast Guard. A lifelong Thelemite, Love considered the ALW cipher to be incomplete to the task of answering many of the cosmological and deep structure questions proposed by Gillis' system. Both Gillis and Stratton-Kent met with Joel Love in 2004 and were mutually surprised to find that both Love's and Gillis' work contained many striking parallels. Love considered the ALW cipher to be representative of an authentic epistle, and interpreted verses in Liber XXVII to hint at a process of inversion. By taking the obvious base three trigrams system of Liber XXVII, and by comparing them to the cipher key of ALW, these inversions resulted in 'Cipher X' which, technically speaking, is the base three inversion of the ALW Cipher. Love always maintained that Cipher X was a complement to ALW, and himself being an advanced user of LEXICON, was a vocal proponent of comparing the results of many ciphers, a study he called 'cross cipher correlation'. Love would go on to compile over 20 years of notes and research. Love had several students, the first of which was longtime friend and colleague H. Thomas Chaudoin. Chaudoin maintains that he was present during the years that the bulk of this research was 'transmitted' to Love. Chaudoin would go on to found the NOT (New Order of Thelema), using many of Love's innovations as a foundation. Love was also a colleague and acquaintance of the late [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and a close friend of the late [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]], co-founder of Discordianism. Love passed in June 2015.

Base 3 inversion of the ALW Cipher values results in the following values:
 A=9  L=18  W=3  H=12  S=21  D=6  O=15  Z=24  K=1  V=10 G=19 R=4 C=13
 N=22 Y=7 J=16 U=25 F=2 Q=11 B=20 M=5 X=14 I=23 T=8 E=17 P=26

'''Esoteric Nazism''' is an [[umbrella term]] used to describe various [[mystical]] interpretations and adaptations of [[Nazism]] in the post–World War II period. After 1945, esoteric elements of the [[Third Reich]] were adapted into new ''[[völkisch]]'' religions of [[white nationalism]] and [[Neo-Nazism]].

==Notable adherents==

===Savitri Devi===
{{main|Savitri Devi}}
French-born Greek-English writer [[Savitri Devi]] was the first major post-war exponent of what has since become known as Esoteric Hitlerism.&lt;ref&gt;See her "Hitlerian Esotericism and the Tradition".&lt;/ref&gt; According to that ideology, subsequent to the fall of the Third Reich and Hitler's suicide at the end of the war, Hitler himself could be [[Imperial cult|deified]]. Devi connected Hitler's [[Aryanism|Aryanist]] ideology to that of the pan-[[Hindu]] part of the [[Indian independence movement]],&lt;ref&gt;See her "Hitlerism and Hindudom", originally published as "Hitlerism and the Hindu World" in ''[[The National Socialist]]'', no. 2 (Fall 1980): 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt; and activists such as [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. For her, the [[swastika]] was an especially important symbol, as she felt it symbolized Aryan unity of Hindus and Germans.

Savitri Devi, above all, was interested in the [[Indian caste system]], which she regarded as the archetype of racial laws intended to govern the segregation of different races and to maintain the pure blood of the fair-complexioned Aryans. She regarded the survival of the light-skinned minority of [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] among an enormous population of many different Indian races after sixty centuries as a living tribute to the value of the Aryan caste system (Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun'', p.&amp;nbsp;92).

Savitri Devi integrated Nazism into a broader [[Social cycle theory|cyclical]] framework of Hindu history.  She considered Hitler to be the ninth [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], and called him "the god-like Individual of our times; the Man against Time; the greatest European of all times",&lt;ref&gt;From the dedication to her book, ''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; having an ideal vision of returning his Aryan people to an earlier, more perfect time, and also having the practical wherewithal to fight the destructive forces "in Time". She saw his defeat—and the forestalling of his vision from coming to fruition—as a result of him being "too magnanimous, too trusting, too good", of not being merciless enough, of having in his "psychological make-up, too much 'sun' [beneficence] and not enough 'lightning.' [practical ruthlessness]",&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'', unabridged edition, p. 53 (http://www.savitridevi.org/lightning-03.html).&lt;/ref&gt; unlike his coming incarnation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Kalki]]" ''will act with unprecedented ruthlessness''. Contrarily to Adolf Hitler, He will spare not a single one of the enemies of the divine Cause: not a single one of its outspoken opponents but also not a single one of the lukewarm, of the [[opportunist]]s, of the ideologically [[heresy|heretical]], of the racially bastardised, of the unhealthy, of the hesitating, of the all-too-human; not a single one of those who, in body or in character or mind, bear the stamp of the fallen Ages.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'', unabridged edition, p. 430 (http://www.savitridevi.org/lightning-16.html).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Robert Charroux===
{{main|Robert Charroux}}
Unlike most [[ancient astronaut]] writers, [[Robert Charroux]] took a large interest in [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]]. According to Charroux [[Hyperborea]] was situated between [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]] and was the home of a [[Scandinavia|Nordic]] [[White people|white race]] with [[blonde hair]] and [[Eye color#Blue|blue eyes]]. Charroux claimed that this race was [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in origin and had originally come from a cold planet situated far from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Robbert Charroux, The Mysterious Past, Futura Publications Ltd., 1974  pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Charroux also claimed that the white race of the Hyperboreans and their ancestors, the [[Celts]], had dominated the whole world in the ancient past. Some of these claims of Charroux have influenced the beliefs of Esoteric Nazism such as the work of [[Miguel Serrano]].&lt;ref&gt;Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, 2003 pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atlantis and the Cycles of Time: Prophecies, Traditions, and Occult Revelations, Joscelyn Godwin, 2010, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miguel Serrano===
{{main|Miguel Serrano}}
The next major figure in Esoteric Hitlerism is [[Miguel Serrano]], a former [[Chile]]an diplomat. Author of numerous books including ''The Golden Ribbon: Esoteric Hitlerism'' (1978) and ''Adolf Hitler, the Last Avatar'' (1984), Serrano is one of a number of Nazi esotericists who regard the "Aryan blood" as originally [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Serrano finds mythological evidence for the extraterrestrial origins of man in the [[Nephilim]] [fallen angels] of the [[Book of Genesis]]... Serrano suggests that the sudden appearance of [[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon Man]] with his high artistic and cultural achievements in prehistoric Europe records the passage of one such ''divya''-descended race alongside the abysmal inferiority of [[Neanderthal Man]], an abomination and manifest creation of the [[demiurge]]... Of all the races on earth, the Aryans alone preserve the memory of their divine ancestors in their noble blood, which is still mingled with the light of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]. All other races are the progeny of the demiurge's beast-men, native to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Serrano supports this idea from various myths which assign divine ancestry to 'Aryan' peoples, and even the [[Aztec]] myth of [[Quetzalcoatl]] descending from Venus. He also cites the hypothesis of [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] on the Arctic homeland of the Indo-Aryans, as his authority for identifying the earthly centre of the Aryan migrations with the 'lost' Arctic continent of [[Hyperborea]]. Thus, Serrano's extraterrestrial gods are also identified as Hyperboreans.&lt;ref&gt;Serrano finds supporting evidence in, for example, the Irish legends (recorded in the [[Book of Invasions]]) which tell of divine ancestors, [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], arriving from the northern islands; and the Greek tradition according to which [[Apollo]] returned every 19 years to Hyperborea in the far north in order to rejuvenate his body and wisdom (Goodrick-Clarke, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempting to raise the spiritual development of the earthbound races, the Hyperborean ''divyas'' (a [[Sanskrit]] term for god-men) suffered a tragic setback. Expanding on a story from the ''[[Book of Enoch]]'', Serrano laments that a renegade group among the gods committed [[miscegenation]] with the terrestrial races, thus diluting the light-bearing blood of their benefactors and diminishing the level of divine awareness on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Hyperborea has a simultaneously racial and mystical meaning for Serrano.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Jason. ''Hyperborea &amp; the Quest for Mystical Enlightenment'', published in New Dawn No. 58 (January–February 2000). Online: [http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/Articles/hyperborea.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that Hitler was in [[Shambhala]], an underground centre in [[Antarctica]] (formerly at the North Pole and Tibet), where he was in contact with the [[Hyperborea]]n gods and from whence he would someday emerge with a fleet of [[Unidentified flying objects|UFOs]] to lead the forces of light (the Hyperboreans, sometimes associated with [[Vril]]) over the forces of darkness (inevitably including, for Serrano, the [[Jew]]s who follow Jehovah) in a last battle and thus inaugurating a [[Fourth Reich]].

[[File:Black_Sun_2.svg|thumb|right|The "[[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]" emblem, representing the celestial homeland of the [[Hyperborea]]ns and the invisible source of their energy, according to Serrano. Serrano, however, has not identified the Black Sun with the above ornament in the [[Wewelsburg]].
According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]:&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 182.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Serrano follows the [[Gnostic]] tradition of the [[Cathars]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1025–1244) by identifying the evil demiurge as Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament. As medieval dualists, these eleventh-century heretics had repudiated Jehovah as a false god and mere artificer opposed to the real God far beyond our earthly realm. This Gnostic doctrine clearly carried dangerous implications for the Jews. As Jehovah was the tribal deity of the Jews, it followed that they were devil worshipers. By casting the Jews in the role of the children of Satan, the Cathar heresy can elevate anti-Semitism to the status of a theological doctrine backed by a vast cosmology. If the Hyperborean Aryans are the archetype and blood descendents of Serrano's ''divyas'' from the Black Sun, then the archetype of the Lord of Darkness needed a counter-race. The demiurge sought and found the most fitting agent for its archetype in the Jews.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As religious scholars Frederick C. Grant and [[Hyam Maccoby]] emphasize, in the view of the dualist Gnostics, "Jews were regarded as the special people of the Demiurge and as having the special historical role of obstructing the redemptive work of the High God's emissaries".&lt;ref&gt;[[Collier's Encyclopedia]] Vol. 11, 1997: 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Serrano thus considered Hitler as one of the greatest emissaries of this High God, rejected and crucified by the tyranny of the Judaicized rabble like previous revolutionary light-bringers. Serrano had a special place in his ideology for the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], who, in their quest to recreate the ancient race of Aryan god-men, he thought were above morality and therefore justified, after the example of the anti-humanitarian "detached violence" taught in the Aryo-Hindu

===Collective Aryan unconscious===
In the book ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]'', [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] reports how [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]] described "Hitler as possessed by the archetype of the collective Aryan unconscious and could not help obeying the commands of an inner voice". In a series of interviews between 1936 and 1939, Jung characterized Hitler as an archetype, often manifesting itself to the complete exclusion of his own personality. {{"'}}Hitler is a spiritual vessel, a demi-divinity; even better, a myth. [[Benito Mussolini]] is a man'&amp;nbsp;... the [[messiah]] of Germany who teaches the virtue of the sword. 'The voice he hears is that of the collective unconscious of his race{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's suggestion that Hitler personified the collective Aryan unconscious deeply interested and influenced [[Miguel Serrano]], who later concluded that Jung was merely psychologizing the ancient, sacred mystery of archetypal possession by the gods, independent metaphysical powers that rule over their respective races and occasionally possess their members.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 179&lt;/ref&gt; A similar esoteric thesis is also put forward by [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] in his book ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]''.

==Conspiracy theories and pseudoscience==
The writings of [[Miguel Serrano]], [[Savitri Devi]], and other proponents of Esoteric Nazism have spawned numerous later works connecting Aryan master race beliefs and Nazi escape scenarios with enduring conspiracy theories about [[Hollow Earth|hollow earth]] civilizations and shadowy [[New World Order (conspiracy)|new world orders]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Since 1945, neo-Nazi writers have also proposed [[Shambhala]] and the star [[Aldebaran]] as the original homeland of the Aryans. The book ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', by [[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]] scholar [[Joscelyn Godwin]], discusses [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] theories about surviving Nazi elements in [[Antarctica]]. ''Arktos'' is noted for its scholarly approach and examination of many sources currently unavailable elsewhere in English-language translations. Godwin and other authors such as [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] have discussed the connections between Esoteric Nazism and [[Vril]] energy, the hidden Shambhala and [[Agartha]] civilizations, and underground [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] bases, as well as Hitler's and the [[SS]]'s supposed survival in underground Antarctic oases in [[New Swabia]] or in alliance with [[Hyperborean]]s from the subterranean world.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin 1996, ch. 5–6, 10; Goodrick-Clarke 2002, especially ch. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to neopaganism==
{{further|Germanic mysticism|Nordic racial paganism}}
Organisations such as the [[Armanen-Orden]] represent significant developments of neo-pagan esotericism and [[Ariosophy]] after [[World War II]], but they do not all constitute forms of Nazi esotericism. Some [[northern Europe]]an [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups, such as [[Theods]], [[Ásatrúarfélagið]] and [[Viðartrúar]], have explicitly stated that [[neo-Nazism]] is not common among their members. On the other hand, there are neopagan organisations with close ties to neo-Nazism, such as the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'' or the [[Heathen Front]], and the attraction of many neo-Nazis to Germanic paganism remains an issue particularly in Germany (see [[Nornirs Ætt]]).

==Neo-völkisch movements==
{{main|Neo-völkisch movements}}
There is a contemporary loose network of small musical groups that combine [[Neo-fascism and paganism|neo-fascism and satanism]]. These groups can be found in Britain, France, and New Zealand, under names such as "Black Order" or "Infernal Alliance", and draw their inspiration from the Esoteric Hitlerism of [[Miguel Serrano]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 106, 213–231.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups advocate the [[anti-modern]] [[neo-tribalism]] and "[[Integral Traditionalism|Traditionalism]]" found in the "[[pagan]]" mysticist ideals of [[Alain de Benoist]]'s ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' inspired by [[Julius Evola]].

Esoteric themes, including references to artifacts such as the [[Holy Lance]], are also often alluded to in [[Neo-Nazi music (disambiguation)|neo-Nazi music]] (e.g. [[Rock Against Communism]]) and above all in [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/hate_music_in_the_21st_century.htm?Multi_page_sections=sHeading_4 Neo-Nazi Hate Music: A Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607202229/http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/hate_music_in_the_21st_century.htm?Multi_page_sections=sHeading_4 |date=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10141">A '''Eucharistic minister''', also known as a '''communion steward''', is an individual that assists in the distribution of [[Holy Communion]] to the congregation of a [[Christian]] church.

==Anglican and Episcopalian Churches==
'''Eucharistic Minister''', or more properly "Lay Eucharistic Minister LEM", is used to denote a lay person who assists the priest in administering the sacraments of holy communion, the consecrated bread and wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/lay-eucharistic-minister-lem|title = The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society The Episcopal Church|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also take the sacraments to those who are ill, or otherwise unable to attend Mass.  LEMs usually vest in cassock and surplice rather than Alb.

Although the practice varies from Diocese to Diocese in general LEMs are recommended by the parish priest to the Bishop of the Diocese, who grants them a three-year license to practice the ministry.  This license is often renewed at the priest's discretion for subsequent three year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dioceseny.org/pages/387-lay-licensing|title = The Episcopal Diocese of New York|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodist Churches==
In many [[Methodist Church]]es, communion stewards assist the minister in the distribution of Holy Communion to the congregation during the Liturgy of the Eucharist. These individuals also aid the minister in consuming any remaining Eucharistic elements after the distribution has been completed, although some of it is reserved to be taken to the sick in hospitals and in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpumcmd.org/pages/page.asp?page_id=341388|title=Communion Stewards|year=2017|publisher=St. Paul UMC at Oxon Hill|language=English|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholic Church==
{{main|Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion}}
Only a validly ordained priest may consecrate the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=Vatican|location=can. 900 § 1|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P38.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated in Canon Law, "The ordinary minister of holy communion is a bishop, presbyter, or deacon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=Vatican|location=can. 910 § 11|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P38.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The extraordinary minister of holy communion is an acolyte or another member of the Christian faithful designated according to the norm of ⇒ can. 230, §3." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=Vatican|location=can. 910 § 2|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P38.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[T]he name “minister of the Eucharist” belongs properly to the Priest alone." That is also specified in the Vatican document "Instruction Redemptionis Sacramentum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacrament|title=Redemptionis Sacramentum|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Vatican|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html#_ftnref260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RS Section [154] states:  "the only minister who can confect the Sacrament of the Eucharist in persona Christi is a validly ordained Priest.  Hence the name “minister of the Eucharist” belongs properly to the Priest alone." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacrament|title=Redemptionis Sacramentum|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Vatican|location=§ 154|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html#_ftnref260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Eucharist", in the Catholic Church, refers to both the celebration of the Mass, that is, the Eucharist liturgy, and to the bread and wine which are transubstantiated (changed in substance) into the body and blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ.  The term "Holy Communion" refers only to the latter.  Thus, the terms "Eucharist" and "Holy Communion" are not interchangeable.

The distribution of Holy Communion is done by the priest, often with one or more ministers, depending on the size of the service.  There are two types of assistants:  ordained (ordinary) ministers, and extraordinary ministers.  An "Ordinary Minister of Holy Communion" is an ordained Bishop, Priest, or Deacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=Vatican|location=can. 910 § 1|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P38.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pope John Paul II|title=Dominicae Cenae|date=1980|publisher=Vatican|location=n. 11: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 72|page=142|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/letters/1980/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19800224_dominicae-cenae.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for the Clergy et al.|title=Ecclesiae de mysterio|date=1997|publisher=Vatican|location=Practical Provisions, art. 8 § 1: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89|pages=870–871|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_con_interdic_doc_15081997_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See also Section [154] of "Redemptionis Sacramentum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacrament|title=Redemptionis Sacramentum|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Vatican|location=§ 154|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html#_ftnref260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "Ordinary" refers to the fact that ordained ministers are the ones who would ordinarily assist in the distribution of Holy Communion.  However, the shortage of ordained ministers has led to the need to sometimes enlist lay persons in this ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=Vatican|location=can. 230 § 3|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PV.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments|title=Immensae caritatis, prooemium|date=1973|publisher=Vatican|location=Acta Apostolicae Sedis 65|page=264|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_con_interdic_doc_15081997_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pope Paul VI|title=Apostolic Letter (Motu Proprio), Ministeria quaedam|date=15 August 1972|publisher=Vatican|location=972: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 64|page=532|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for the Clergy et al.|title=Instruction, Ecclesiae de mysterio|date=1997|publisher=Vatican|location=Practical Provisions, art. 8 § 1: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89|page=871|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_con_interdic_doc_15081997_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An "Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion" is a Catholic lay person who assists in the distribution of Holy Communion, either during the Mass, or afterwards, such as to housebound persons.  Section [156] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacrament|title=Redemptionis Sacramentum|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Vatican|location=§ 156|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html#_ftnref260}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the use of other titles for these lay persons.  The term "Eucharist" does not appear in their title, because it would imply a broader function, which is reserved for the priest alone.  Despite these instruction, a very common error is the use of the terms "Eucharistic Ministers", or "Extraordinary Ministers of Eucharist."  These improper titles have appeared on several book titles, instructional handbooks, and in many articles.  Likewise, erroneous abbreviations, such as "EM", "EME", or "EEM", are commonly used instead of the proper abbreviation "EMHC".

Section [158] provides instructions on the proper use of EMHC:  "the extraordinary minister of Holy Communion may administer Communion only when the Priest and Deacon are lacking, when the Priest is prevented by weakness or advanced age or some other genuine reason, or when the number of faithful coming to Communion is so great that the very celebration of Mass would be unduly prolonged." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacrament|title=Redemptionis Sacramentum|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Vatican|location=§ 158|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html#_ftnref260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many parishes do not follow these instructions.  This is contrary to Canon Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law|title=Responsio ad propositum dubium|date=1 June 1988|publisher=Vatican|location=AAS 80|page=1373|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19951028_dubium-ordinatio-sac_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for the Clergy et al|title=Instruction, Ecclesiae de mysterio|date=1997|publisher=Vatican|location=Practical Provisions, art. 8 § 2: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89|page=871|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_con_interdic_doc_15081997_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments|title=Instruction, Immensae caritatis|date=1973|publisher=Vatican|location=n. 1: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 65|pages=264–271|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_con_interdic_doc_15081997_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some routinely use EMHCs when there is no lacking of Priests and Deacons, or they employ a large number of EMHCs, reducing the Communion distribution to a few minutes.  One factor is lack of knowledge of the Vatican instructions.  Another is the popularity of participating in this service.

'''Eugene Abeshaus''' (also spelled ''Evgeny Abezgauz'', ''Евгений Абезгауз'' in Russian; 1939–2008) was a Jewish artist who worked in Russia (then USSR) and Israel.  

Born in Leningrad to a typical intelligentsia family, Abeshaus was educated as an electrical engineer but soon abandoned this career and enrolled in the Mukhina School for Applied Art. By the time of his graduation from the famous “Mukha” (''Fly'' in Russian), he had already developed a critical stance towards the official Soviet art dominated by the Communist ideology and began exhibiting at semi-underground exhibitions. This was culminated by his taking part in a famous 1975 exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture. Abeshaus was fired from his job and censured by the official press – which however admitted his "artistic taste, a good sense of color and form". 

Soon afterwards, Abeshaus set up, together with several Jewish artists, the Alef Group and became its leader. The group’s first exhibition in November 1975 was held at Abeshauses’ small apartment. According to the Alef Manifesto written by Alec Rappoport, “We are trying to conquer the influence of small-town Jewish art and find sources for our work in deeper, wiser, and more spiritual European culture, and from it build a bridge to today and tomorrow". 

In May 1976, some of Abeshaus’s works, clandestinely sneaked out of the country, were exhibited at the [[Berkeley Art Museum]] to much critical acclaim. Later in the same year, following some political bargain between Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Abeshaus and his family were finally permitted to leave the USSR for Israel.   

Since then Abeshaus lived and worked in [[Ein Hod]], a picturesque artists’ village near Haifa founded by [[Marcel Janco]]. His works were exhibited at numerous exhibitions, including dozens one-artist shows, in Israel, USA, Europe and, after the collapse of the USSR, in Russia. His ultimate acceptance and recognition there was culminated in a sensational memorial one-artist exhibition staged in 2009 at the famous [[Russian Museum]] in St.Petersburg - an exceptional honor for a modern artist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1049">The '''Gentiluomo of the Archbishop of Westminster''' in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] of the [[United Kingdom]] was a bodyguard (compare the royal [[Gentleman at arms]]) and personal attendant to the [[Archbishop of Westminster|Archbishop]]. 

The title originates from the Latin ''gentilis homo'' ([[gentleman]]) by way of Italian, ''gentile uomo''. When the Archbishop was created a Cardinal, his bodyguard could accordingly be called '''Gentiluomo of the ''Cardinal'' Archbishop of Westminster'''.

The Gentiluomo's job was to guard his master, as the Archbishop was not permitted to carry a weapon (in accordance with his role as a cleric). 

The position of Gentiluomo was effectively hereditary. 

The appointment is now, however, in [[desuetude]], following the death of the last Gentiluomo, [[Anthony Bartlett]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 2001. No new Gentiluomo has been appointed by either of [[Cardinal Hume]]'s successors as archbishop.

The '''Hall of Records''' is an ancient library claimed by [[Edgar Cayce]] to have been deposited at the time of [[Imhotep]] at [[Saqqara]] in [[Egypt]]. It has been suggested{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that the Hall of Records is under the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], which is in the [[Giza pyramid complex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catchpenny.org/chamber.html Is There a Chamber Beneath the Sphinx?] catchpenny.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence to indicate that the Hall of Records ever existed. In 1998, [[Zahi Hawass]], Chief Director of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], undertook excavations beneath the main body of the Sphinx at Giza and rediscovered access tunnels to several large, apparently natural, caves directly under the Sphinx. No artifacts were found and a survey was undertaken to assess any potential threats in the substrate that might affect the ancient monument above. There was evidence of earlier ancient excavations. Hawass commented in a documentary about the 1998 excavations that he suspected that there could be other cavities beneath the structure, based on the evidence of the small watercourse that had caused some minor structural damage to stonework on the flank of the Sphinx.

==Overview==
The story of the Hall of Records is popular among those who hold [[Fringe science|alternative theories]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The phrase "Hall of Records" originated with [[Edgar Cayce]] although [[Lynn Picknett]] and [[Clive Prince]] suggest that the idea of the existence of lost Egyptian records "has a long pedigree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Sally|first2=Michael | last2=Rice| title=Consuming Ancient Egypt|year=2003|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=978-1-84472-003-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=&amp;id=3RAK5pL-m0IC&amp;q=%22hall+of+records%22+cayce#v=snippet&amp;q=%22hall%20of%20records%22%20cayce&amp;f=false |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graham Hancock]] and [[Robert Bauval]], in ''[[Message of the Sphinx]]'', stated that American archaeologists and the Egyptian government had blocked investigations around the Sphinx, including attempts to locate any underground cavities.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval, ''The Message of the Sphinx''. Three Rivers Press; 1 edition (May 27, 1997). page 59, 71. {{ISBN|0-517-88852-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauval later wrote ''Secret Chamber'' in 1999. According to Bauval, Egyptian authorities granted an American team a license to search for the Hall of Records under the Sphinx.  It has been postulated that there may be three passages around the Sphinx; two with unknown origin and one is supposedly a small dead-end shaft behind the head of nineteenth-century origins.

Various alternate theories on the origin of the Hall have been proposed, including that the Hall was not the work of Ancient Egyptians at all but another society such as advanced prehistoric societies or a superior race of intelligent beings. Accordingly, this original society sealed the Hall away with scrolls of their accumulated knowledge at about [[10,000 BC|10,500 BC]]—the last period of time when the [[constellation]] of [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] was located between the Sphinx's paws when it rose in the night sky.

The "Sleeping Prophet" Edgar Cayce also stated in 1939, that the Hall of Records had a twin counterpart library that was anciently deposited on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] somewhere by the eastern coastal temple complex sites. He mentioned that the Yucatán Depository was currently under water.

The study of and the search for the Hall is considered by many academics to be [[pseudo-archaeology]]. These academics make clear distinctions between precise methodological scientific hypothesis and the rest of possible subsequent implications and speculations.

==In fiction==
The myth of the Hall of Records is featured in many creative works.

'''Hinduism in Azerbaijan''' has been tied to [[cultural diffusion]] on the [[Silk Road]].  One of the remnants of once-dominant [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] culture in the [[Caucasus]] is [[Suraxanı raion|Surakhani]], the site of the [[Ateshgah of Baku]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040219010934/http://sify.com/news/international/fullstory.php?id=13267652 Rare Hindu temple in Muslim Azerbaijan] - Sify.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the [[Middle Ages]], Hindu traders visited present-day [[Azerbaijan]] for [[Silk Road]] trade.  The area was traversed by Hindu traders coming mostly from [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]] (in present-day Pakistan).  The [[Ateshgah of Baku|Atasghah]] in [[Suraxanı raion|Surakhani]] was used by those traders to worship while in the area.  Most of the traders left around the advent of the [[British Raj]].  The ceremonies were officiated by a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[pandit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311003705/http://www.nchtuk.org/content.php?id=218 Pre – Islamic Vedic Culture in Afghanistan] - NHCTUK&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical sources indicate that locals worshipped at Surakhani even before the construction of the Atashgah, drawn by the "seven holes with burning flame" from which Surakhani takes its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azeri.org/Azeri/az_latin/manuscripts/land_of_fire/english/112_observations_farid.html Observations from the Ancients] Farid Bakharov - Azerbaijan International&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s, the Czar [[Alexander III of Russia]] went to Azerbaijan to witness one of the last Hindu ceremonies performed there.  After the 1890s, nearly all of the original Hindu merchants in Azerbaijan had died or left for The Indian Subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avesta.org/modi/baku.htm My Travels Outside Bombay] - Ervad Shams-Ul-Ulama Dr. Sir Jivanji Jamshedji Modi

Members of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishnas, are registered in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/azerbaijan/hypermail/200204/0018.shtml Azerbaijan Daily Digest]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2002, authorities returned 20,000 of the 35,000 books seized in 1996 from the Baku Society of Krishna Consciousness &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24344.htm Azerbaijan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Azerbaijan Daily Digest'' states that very few [[Azeri people]] have become Hare Krishna&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/azerbaijan/hypermail/200108/0101.html Azerbaijan moves to impose tighter control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716222114/http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/azerbaijan/hypermail/200108/0101.html |date=16 July 2007 }} - Eurasian net&lt;/ref&gt; and they are mostly represented by members of [[ISKCON]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71368.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006, Azerbaijan] - U.S. State Department&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irreligion in Mexico''' refers to [[atheism]], [[deism]], [[religious skepticism]], [[secularism]], and [[secular humanism]] in Mexican society, which was a [[confessional state]] after independence from [[Imperial Spain]]. The first political [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|constitution of the Mexican United States]] enacted in 1824, stipulated that [[Roman Catholicism]] was the [[State religion|national religion]] in perpetuity, and prohibited any other religion.&lt;ref name="const.1824"&gt;[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States (1824)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318225631/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html |date=2012-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since 1857, by law, Mexico has had [[State secularism|no official religion]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html Article 130 of Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303014932/http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html |date=2007-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, [[anti-clerical]] laws meant to promote a secular society, contained in the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]] and in the [[Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution of Mexico]] limited the participation in civil life of Roman Catholic organizations, and allowed government intervention to religious participation in politics.

In 1992, the Mexican constitution was amended to eliminate the restrictions, and granted legal status to religious organizations, limited property rights, voting rights to ministers, and allowing a greater number of priests in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico|work=International Religious Report|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Department of State|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24499.htm|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the principles of the [[Separation of Church and State]] remain; members of religious orders (priests, nuns, ministers, ''et al.'') cannot hold elected office, the federal government cannot subsidize any religious organization, and religious orders, and their officers, cannot teach in the public school system.

Historically, the Roman Catholic Church dominated the religious, political, and cultural landscapes of the nation; yet, the [[Catholic News Agency]] said that there exists a great, secular community of atheists, [[intellectual]]s and irreligious people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12159 Catholic News Agency Rise of atheism in Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aciprensa.com/noticia.php?n=20574 Aciprensa - Mexico still Catholic... but atheism is on the rise]&lt;/ref&gt; reaching 10% according to recent polls by religious agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2013/12/02/el-90-de-los-mexicanos-cree-en-dios-encuesta-8448.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and politics==
{{Synthesis|date=September 2009|1=section}} 
[[File:Ramirez nigromante.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In his time, the writer and intellectual [[Ignacio Ramirez Calzada|Ignacio Ramírez Calzada]] ''El Nigromante'' was hailed as the '''Voltaire of Mexico''' for criticizing the earthly, political power of the Roman Catholic Church]]
[[File:Vicente Fox WEF 2003 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The assumption of the Mexican presidency (2000–06) by the Roman Catholic politician [[Vicente Fox]] raised speculation, among liberals, intellectuals, and educated people, that Mexican society might lose the [[secularism]] of public life.&lt;ref&gt;Candidate Vicente Fox contributed to that perception with a letter (May 2000) to the religious authorities of the Protestant and Catholic churches, in which he made ten promises, ranging from defending the right-to-life, from the moment of conception until natural death (condemnation of abortion and euthanasia) to granting access to the mass communications media to religious organizations. Fox's promises proved expedient, because no political party held a majority in the Mexican Congress, elected on 6 July 2000. The Ten Promises appeared to be proof of an undemocratic the alliance between Protestant and Catholic religious authorities and presidential candidate Vicente Fox. [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0765614057 Laura Randall (2006) Page 433]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Since the [[Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]] (1519–21), the [[Roman Catholic Church]] has held prominent social and political positions concerning the moral education of Mexicans; the ways that [[virtues]] and [[morals]] are to be socially implemented; and thus contributed to the Mexican [[cultural identity]]. Such cultural immanence was confirmed in the nation's first [[political constitution]], which formally protected [[Catholicism]]; thus, Article 3 of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]] established that:

{{Quotation|The [[Official religion|Religion]] of the Mexican Nation, is, and will be perpetually, the Roman Catholic Apostolic. The Nation will protect it by wise and just laws, and prohibit the exercise of any other whatever".
(Article 3 of the Federal Constitution of the Mexican United States, 1824)&lt;ref name="const.1824"/&gt;}}

For most of Mexico's 300 years as the Imperial [[Spanish colony]] of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1519–1821), the Roman Catholic Church was an active political actor in colonial politics. In the early period of the Mexican nation, the vast wealth and great political influence of the Church spurred a powerful [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] movement, which found political expression in the [[Liberal Party (Mexico)|Liberal party]]. Yet, during the middle of the 19th century, there were reforms limiting the political power of the Mexican Catholic Church. In response, the Church supported [[Sedition|seditious]] Conservative rebels to overthrow the anti-clerical Liberal government of President [[Benito Juárez]]; and so welcomed the anti-Juárez [[French intervention in Mexico]] (1861), which established the [[military occupation]] of Mexico by the [[Second French Empire]], of Emperor [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/library/irf/irf99/blirf_mexico99.htm Mexico - Religious Freedom Report 1999 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

About the Mexican perspective of the actions of the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Laborist Party (Mexico)|Mexican Labour Party]] activist [[Robert Haberman]] said:

{{Quotation|
By the year 1854, The Church gained possession of about two-thirds of all the lands of Mexico, almost every bank, and every large business. The rest of the country was mortgaged to the Church. Then came the revolution of 1854, led by [[Benito Juárez]]. It culminated in the Constitution of 1857, which [[Secularism|secularised]] the schools and confiscated Church property. All the churches were nationalised, many of them were turned into schools, hospitals, and orphan asylums. Civil marriages were obligatory. [[Pope Pius IX]] immediately issued a mandate against the Constitution, and called upon all Catholics of Mexico to disobey it. Ever since then, the clergy has been fighting to regain its lost temporal power and wealth. (''The Necessity of Atheism'', p. 154)&lt;ref&gt;David Marshall Brooks, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3hC8_i3MFh4C&amp;q=1854+two-thirds#v=snippet&amp;q=1854%20two-thirds&amp;f=false ''The Necessity of Atheism''], Plain Label Books, 1933, {{ISBN|1-60303-138-3}} p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the turn of the 19th century, the collaboration of the Mexican Catholic Church with the ''[[Porfiriato]]'', the 35-year dictatorship of General [[Porfirio Díaz]], earned the Mexican clregy the ideological enmity of the revolutionary victors of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20); thus, the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]] legislated severe social and political, economic and cultural restrictions upon the Catholic Church in the Republic of Mexico. Historically, the 1917 Mexican Constitution was the first political constitution to expilicity legislate the social and civil rights of the people; and served as constitutional model for the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Constitution of 1919]] and the Russian Constitution of 1918.&lt;ref name="social1"&gt;{{cite book

The Constitution of 1917 proscribed the Catholic clergy from working as teachers and as instructors in public and private schools; established State control over the internal matters of the Mexican Catholic Church; nationalized all Church property; proscribed religious orders; forbade the presence in Mexico of foreign-born priests; granted each state of the Mexican republic the power to limit the number of, and to eliminate, priests in its territory; disenfranchised priests of the civil rights to vote, and to hold elected office; banned Catholic organizations that advocated public policy; forbade religious publications from editorial commentary about public policy; proscribed the clergy from wearing clerical garb in public; and voided the right to trial of any Mexican citizen who violated anti-clerical laws.&lt;ref&gt;Ehler, Sidney Z.

During the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20), the national rancour provoked by the history of the Catholic Church's mistreatment of Mexicans was aggravated by the [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] of the Mexican High Clergy with the pro–U.S. dictatorship (1913–14) of General [[Victoriano Huerta]], "The Usurper" of the Mexican Presidency; thus, anti-clerical laws were integral to the Mexican Constitution of 1917, in order to establish a secular society.&lt;ref name="Huerta1"&gt;{{cite book

The social and political tensions between the Catholic Church and the Mexican State lessened after 1940, but the Constitutional restrictions remained the law of the land, although their enforcement became progressively lax. The Government established diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]] during the administration of President [[Carlos Salinas|Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] (1988–94), and the Government lifted almost all restrictions on the Catholic Church in 1992. That year the Government ratified its informal policy of not enforcing most legal controls on religious groups by, among other things, granting religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property rights, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country. However, the law continues to mandate strict restrictions on the church and bars the clergy from holding public office, advocating partisan political views, supporting political candidates, or opposing the laws or institutions of the State. The Church's ability to own and operate [[mass media]] is also limited. Indeed, after the creation of the Constitution the Catholic Church has been acutely hostile towards the Mexican government. As Laura Randall in his book ''Changing Structure of Mexico'' points out, most of the conflicts between citizens and religious leaders lie in the Church's overwhelming lack of understanding of the role of the state's laicism. "The inability of the Mexican Catholic [[Episcopate]] to understand the modern world translates into a distorted conception of the secular world and the lay state. Evidently, perceiving the state as [[anti-religious]] (or rather, [[anti-clerical]]) is the result of 19th-century struggles that imbued the state with anti-religious and anti-clerical tinges in [[Latin American]] countries, much to the Catholic Church's chagrin. Defining laicist education as a 'secular religion' that is also 'imposed and intolerant' is the clearest evidence of episcopal intransigence."&lt;ref&gt;Laura Randall, ''Changing structure of Mexico: political, social, and economic prospects'', (M.E. Sharpe, 2006) {{ISBN|0-7656-1404-9}} Page 435&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, however see the Mexican state's anticlericalism differently.  Recent President [[Vicente Fox]] stated, "After 1917, Mexico was led by [[Catholicism and Freemasonry|anti-Catholic Freemasons]] who tried to evoke the anticlerical spirit of popular indigenous President Benito Juárez of the 1880s. But the military dictators of the 1920s were a more savage lot than Juarez."&lt;ref name="Revolution of Hope"&gt;Fox, Vicente and Rob Allyn [https://books.google.com/books?id=bLDDf9vi-esC&amp;dq Revolution of Hope] p. 17, Viking, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Fox goes on to recount how priests were killed for trying to perform the [[sacraments]], altars were desecrated by soldiers and freedom of religion outlawed by generals.&lt;ref name="Revolution of Hope"/&gt;

==Demographics==
As many students of [[Latin American]] religion have pointed out, there is a substantial difference between describing oneself as religious or culturally religious and practicing one's [[faith]] literally. In the case of Mexico the decline of the church's religious influence is specially mirrored by the decline of church attendance among its citizens. Church attendance itself is a complex, multi-layered phenomenon that is subject to political and [[socio-economic]] factors. From 1940 to 1960 about 70% of Mexican Catholics attended church weekly while in 1982 only 54 percent partook of Mass once a week or more, and 21 percent claimed monthly attendance. Recent surveys have shown that only around 3% of Catholics attend church daily; however, 47% percent of them attend church services weekly &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195107845]&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[INEGI]], the number of atheists grows annually by 5.2%, while the number of Catholics grows by 1.7%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aciprensa.com/noticia.php?n=20574 Aciprensa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12159 Catholic News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1906''' - [[Flores Magón]] published his ''Manifesto to the Nation, The Plan of the Mexican Liberal Party'' declaring: "The [[clergy]], this unrepentant traitor, this subject of Rome, this irreconcilable enemy of native liberties, in place of finding tyrants to serve and from whom to receive protection, will find instead inflexible laws which will put a limit on their excesses and which will confine them to the religious sphere."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Flores Magón, Chaz Bufe, Charles Bufe, Mitchell Cowen Verter, ''Dreams of freedom: a Ricardo Flores Magón reader'' (AK Press, 2006) {{ISBN|1-904859-24-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope criticized the state's interference in matters of worship, outlawing of religious orders and the [[Confiscation|expropriation]] of Church property. Alluding to the deprivation of the right to vote and of free speech, among other things, he noted that, "Priests are ... deprived of all civil and political rights.

*'''1940''' - By 1940 the Church had "legally had no corporate existence, no real estate, no schools, no monasteries or convents, no foreign priests, no right to defend itself publicly or in the courts, and no hope that its legal and actual situations would improve. Its clergy were forbidden to wear clerical garb, to vote, to celebrate public religious ceremonies, and to engage in politics", but the restrictions were not always enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Mabry, Donald J.

*'''1940''' - By 1940 open hostility toward the Church began to cease with the election of President Ávila (1940–46), who agreed, in exchange for the Church's efforts to maintain peace, to nonenforcement of most of the anticlerical provisions, an exception being Article 130, Section 9, which deprived the Church of the [[freedom of speech|right of political speech]], priests of the [[right to vote]], and the [[freedom of association|right of free political association]].&lt;ref name="Mexico: Church State Relations"&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-8728.html Mexico: Church State Relations]  Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress June 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1948''' - In June 1948, [[Diego Rivera]] painted the mural ''Dreams of a Sunday in the Alameda'' at the Del Prado Hotel depicting Ignacio Ramírez holding a sign reading, "God does not exist". Rivera would not remove the inscription, so the mural was not shown for 9 years – after Rivera agreed to remove the words. He stated: "To affirm 'God does not exist', I do not have to hide behind Don Ignacio Ramírez; I am an atheist and I consider religions to be a form of collective [[neurosis]]. I am not an enemy of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s, as I am not an enemy of the tuberculars, the [[myopic]] or the paralytics; you cannot be an enemy of the sick, only their good friend in order to help them cure themselves." The Publicity in the newspapers had been riot-provoking, and Rivera's stand - "I will not remove one letter from it" - brought forth a [[Ochlocracy|mob]] of some thirty persons who vandalised everything in their path. They further violated the mural by defacing the [[self-portrait]] of Rivera as a young boy. On that very night, not far from the Hotel, Rivera, along with Mexico's leading artists and intellectuals, was attending a dinner honouring the director of the Museum of Fine Art. When the word arrived about the attack on Rivera's mural, it caused a stir in the audience. [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] exhorted the guests to go to the Del Prado Hotel and, arm-in-arm with [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Dr. Atl]], marched at the head of 100 people. Among them were [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Juan O'Gorman]], [[Raul Anguiano]] y [[José Revueltas]]. When they arrived Rivera climbed on a chair, asked for a pencil and calmly began to restore the destroyed inscription: "God does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Stein, ''Siqueiros: his life and works'' (International Publishers Co, 1994), {{ISBN|0-7178-0706-1}}, pp176&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''2008''' - On 28 September 2008, the '''First Global Atheist March for a Secular Society''' was held in [[Mexico City]] and [[Guadalajara]] as a part of a series of global [[protests]] that call for the [[civil rights]] of atheists and non-religious people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humaniststudies.org/enews/?id=368&amp;article=0 Humanist Studies - Atheists To Hold Global March in Mexico, Spain and Peru]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atheists.meetup.com/215/messages/boards/thread/5509280 Atheists take to the streets in Mexico - Philadelphia Atheists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-156764640.html High Beam - Atheist take their views and issues to the streets]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2009''' - On Saturday 26 June 2009, during a meeting celebrating the [[International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking]], president [[Felipe Calderón]] stated that [[atheism]] and [[irreligion]] render the youth criminals and leave them at the mercy of [[drug trafficking|drug traffickers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://trueslant.com/marycuddehe/2009/06/26/calderon-blames-mjs-death-on-drugs-calls-non-believers-likely-to-become-addicts/ Calderon calls non believers likely to become addicts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/06/27/index.php?section La Jornada: No creer en Dios hace a la juventud esclava de narcos - Felipe Calderón]&lt;/ref&gt; His statement was prompted by a previous opinion on the [[death of Michael Jackson]]. Before the results of the singer's autopsy, Calderón claimed that Jackson's death was due to his purported abuse of drugs and his lack of [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/607673.html Lamenta Felipe Calderón muerte de Jackson por 'consumo de drogas']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com.mx/.../michael-jackson-calderon-narco-drogas-dios-juventud-adiccion.htm La juventud no cree en Dios porque no lo conoce: Calderón]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/.../After_Intense_Attention__Coverage_Of_Michael_Jackson_s_Death_Begins_Receding.html ABC New York]&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the lack of [[religion]] and union with [[God]] fosters [[Substance dependence|addictions]] and [[crime]] among young people. A letter from a community of Mexican atheists was submitted to [[La Jornada]] newspaper as a counter-attack to the allegations against non-religious people, claiming that the president's position was a crystal-clear example of discrimination against minorities in the country.&lt;ref name="ateos.responden"&gt;[http://ateismodesdemexico.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=3256 Ateos responden a Calderón]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ateismodesdemexico"&gt;[http://ateismodesdemexico.org/ Ateísmo desde México] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604185226/http://ateismodesdemexico.org/ |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2009''' - Mexico City played host to international symposium on religious freedom in Latin America sponsored by the [[Knights of Columbus]], the first time such an event has occurred in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt; Sociologist Jorge Trasloheros noted that many powerful Mexicans see religion not as "the opium of the masses", but as "the tobacco of the masses"—a bad habit to be banned from the public arena.&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt;  Supreme Knight Carl Anderson denounced this idea still commonly held in Mexico that "religious beliefs are not welcome in the public square, or worse are not allowed in the public square".&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt;
*'''2010''' - In March 2010, the lower house of the Mexican legislature introduced legislation to amend the Constitution to make the Mexican government formally [[laicite|"laico"]]—meaning "lay" or "secular".&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt; Critics of the move say the "context surrounding the amendment suggests that it might be a step backwards for religious liberty and true separation of church and state".&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt; Coming on the heels of the Church's vocal objection to legalization of abortion as well as same sex unions and adoptions in Mexico City, "together with some statements of its supporters, suggests that it might be an attempt to suppress the Catholic Church's ability to engage in public policy debates".&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt; Critics of the amendment reject the idea that "Utilitarians, Nihilists, Capitalists, and Socialists can all bring their philosophy to bear on public life, but Catholics (or other religious minorities) must check their religion at the door" in a sort of "second-class citizenship" which they consider nothing more than religious discrimination.&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt;

The presence of '''Islam in [[Guam]]''' is quite small, centered on the island's only [[mosque]], the Masjid Al-Noor in [[Mangilao]]. Muslims in Guam are from a wide variety of backgrounds, both originating in traditionally [[Muslim countries]], as well as [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] converts and mainland [[American people|American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Babauta, ' Muslim Association of Guam', referenced June 27, 2010, © 2009 Guampedia, URL: http://guampedia.com/muslim-association-of-guam/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic radio''' is a category of [[radio format]]s that focus on [[Religious broadcasting|transmitting programming]] with a [[Islam]]ic message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=Magnus|title=Articulating Islam: Anthropological Approaches to Muslim Worlds|date=2012|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio stations can be [[Public broadcasting|public]], [[Commercial broadcasting|private]] and [[non-profit]] (or some form of [[Community radio]]).

These radio stations typically focus on [[Islam]]ic [[religious programming]], such as reading of the [[Quran]], [[talk radio]]-style programming (sometimes including live radio call-in shows) and/or long-form "preaching and teaching" programs with [[news radio|news]] programming with associated topics that can have an economic or a political angle to [[Muslim community]]. In recent years during Ramadan, many UK cities with Muslim populations have set up [[Radio Ramadan]] stations that operate exclusively during Ramadan. These stations feature a variety of broadcasts including [[Qira'at|Quran recitation]] and Islamic music known as [[Nasheeds]] 

Many secular radio stations devote some of their weekend programming to religious programming; for example, during [[Friday prayers]] or [[Eid Mubarak]], [[Ramadan]].

'''Kankai''' is a Hindu's holy place situated in the middle of [[Gir Forest National Park]] in Junagadh district of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region in the state of Gujarat, India.

==Location==
Located inside [[Gir Forest National Park|Gir forest]], Gujarat, India.

==History==
The Indian mega-epic Mahabharata's famous character Arjuna comes alive here so this place is famous because of him. Once traveling through this forest, Pandavas gets thirsty and Arjuna uses his bow to discover water from the earth. There is a Mahadev temple here called 'Banej'.

==Temple and Surroundings==

'''Leon Atkin''' (1902–1976) was a Welsh [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] minister,  human rights activist, and politician.&lt;ref name="DWB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leon Atkin|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s7-ATKI-LEO-1902.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|author=D. Ben Rees|year=2010|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Atkin was born on 26 July 1902 in [[Spalding, Lincolnshire]]. His father was a gas manager and his family were [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]]. He had six siblings. As a boy, he participated in activities at the Methodist chapel that was next door to the family home. In 1914, the family moved to [[Biddulph]]. Having become a Methodist, he began preaching as a boy. At 16, he joined the [[Welsh Labour|Labour Party]]. He attended the [[Handsworth Methodist College]], Birmingham.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1930, he accepted a position in [[Risca]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] at St John's Church of Probationer Minister. Like [[Donald Soper, Baron Soper|Donald Soper]], he held open-air meetings on a weekly basis and he drew people to his services, including unbelievers. Atkin embraced the [[Social Gospel]] and was an active voice concerning political and social issues affecting the community.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; He became increasingly involved in social issues two years later when he was moved to [[Bargoed]]. At the Methodist Central Hall, he provided a programs to assist unemployed men, including offering free meals, barber and shoe repair services, and lodging, the latter of which circumvented the governmental [[means test|Means Test]] of the men's parent's income and angered authorities. He was critical of the church and the Labour Party. Synod leaders then made arrangements for transfer to Cornwall, which Atkin would not accept.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;

He accepted one of three offers from Congregationalist denominations in Cardiff to lead St Paul's in [[Swansea]]. The church was £2,000 in debt and had  only 12 members. He began holding open-air ministry meetings, drawing up to 500 people, more so during the summer months.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; He was not popular within the leadership of the [[Congregational Union of England and Wales]] due to his anti-Fascism positions in the Labour Party and reluctance to take direction from church leaders.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; 

He became a representative for [[Brynmelyn]] Ward of the [[City and County of Swansea Council|Swansea Borough Council]] in November 1936.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Closed Church" /&gt; He joined the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1940, but became an Army Chaplain upon the intervention of the United Chaplains Board.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; He served in Holland, North Africa, France, and Italy and became a captain.&lt;ref name="Closed Church"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/259424412/?terms=Leon%2BAtkin%2BSwansea |title=Closed Church Reopened |date=7 August 1945 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London|page=2|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=newspapers.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|He was a hero of the poor, and did many great things; He would baptise the children of unmarried mothers, and opened up the church’s crypt during the cold winter of 1946, to let hundreds of people shelter there.|—[[Ian Bone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/man-once-described-most-dangerous-13185785|title=The man once described as the 'most dangerous in Britain' is visiting Swansea|website=WalesOnline|date=23 June 2017|author=Nino Williams|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Atkin returned to Swansea, where the chapel had been locked and he had lost his ministry. He was able to settle back at St Paul's, without the Congregational Union's formal support, due to the allegiance of members of the community and former soldiers.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Closed Church" /&gt; He formed The People's Party in 1947 to keep his seat on the Council, due to complaints he made against the Labour Party. He sat on the Council until 1964.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married with two children. Until [[World War II]], he was a pacifist. While living in Swansea, he visited public houses on Fridays to collect donations for entertainment of poor children. [[Dylan Thomas]] was a friend. He died on 27 November 1976 in Swansea.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;

Subsequently, she was appointed Professor of [[Contextual Theology]] at [[New College, Edinburgh|New College]], University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Althaus-Reid died on 20 February 2009, in Edinburgh, Scotland, where she had lived since 1986. At the time of her death she was Director of the International Association for Queer Theology, Director of the Queer Theology Project at the University of Edinburgh, and a member of the [[Metropolitan Community Church]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the last years of her life, she worked with the Argentine theologian [[Ivan Petrella]] to publicize liberation theology in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="Ruether" /&gt; She was also associate editor of the journal ''[[Studies in World Christianity]]'' and a member of the editorial board of the journal ''[[Concilium (journal)|Concilium]]''.

== Thoughts ==
Althaus-Reid is perhaps most well-known for her 2002 work in ''Indecent Theology,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8DE2QI2QdIC|title=Indecent Theology|first=|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-134-56255-8|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Marcella Althaus-Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she challenged feminists in her use of sexual and explicit language. She argued sex has been constructed by a patriarchal worldview which underpins many of the great atrocities of the world. Hence, the virginity of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] needs to be "indecented" as it hides the lives of many poor women who, she describes, as rarely being virgins.&lt;ref name="Isherwood"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUdLVfTMYU4C|title=Dancing Theology in Fetish Boots: Essays in Honour of Marcella Althaus-Reid|last=Isherwood|first=Lisa|publisher=SCM Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-334-04361-4|location=London|pages=68-78|chapter=Indecent Theology: What F-ing Difference Does it Make?|quote=|editor-last2=Jordan|editor-first2=Mark D.|via=|editor-first1=Lisa|editor-last1=Isherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also speaks about an "indecent Christ," whereby a [[Kenosis|kenotic]] Christology speaks of God self-emptying and being embodied in Christ and human sexuality. She explains that "[Jesus] has been dressed theologically as a heterosexually oriented (celibate) man. Jesus with erased genitalia; Jesus minus erotic body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indecent Theology|last=Althaus-Reid|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=114|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she speaks about the bi-sexuality of Christ as an inclusive understanding of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. She wants to argue for a larger Christology which recasts Jesus in postmodern sexualities, genders, and economic locations. This is a critique she had against Latin American liberation theology, which she understood as failing to address questions of gender and sexuality alongside the question of conquest and colonization of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Shore-Goss"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUdLVfTMYU4C|title=Dancing Theology in Fetish Boots: Essays in Honour of Marcella Althaus-Reid|last=Shore-Goss|first=Robert|publisher=SCM Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-334-04361-4|location=London|pages=1-16|chapter=Dis/Grace-full Incarnation and the Dis/Grace-full Church|quote=|editor-last2=Jordan|editor-first2=Mark D.|via=|editor-first1=Lisa|editor-last1=Isherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Mnemosyne|Juno (mythology)}}

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Moneta''' ([[Latin]] '''Monēta''') was a title given to two separate goddesses: the goddess of memory (identified with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess [[Mnemosyne]]) and an epithet of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], called '''Juno Moneta''' (Latin '''Iūno Monēta'''). The latter's name is source of numerous words in [[English language|English]] and the [[Romance language]]s, including the words "[[wiktionary:money|money]]" and "[[wikt:mint|mint]]".

[[File:CSA-T14-$50-1861–62.jpg|thumb|Moneta depicted with treasure chests on the front of an 1861 Confederate States of America [[Confederate States dollar|$50 banknote]].]]

The cult of the goddess Moneta was established largely under the influence of [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek religion]] that featured the cult of [[Mnemosyne]] ("Μνημοσύνη"), the goddess of memory and the mother of the [[Muse]]s. The goddess's name is derived from Latin ''monēre'' (which means to remind, warn, or instruct). She is mentioned in a fragment of [[Livius Andronicus]]' Latin Odyssey: ''Nam diva Monetas filia docuit'' ("since the divine daughter of Moneta has taught...", frg. 21 Büchner), which may be the equivalent of either Od. 8,480-1 or 488.

The epithet Moneta given to [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] more likely derives from the Greek word "moneres" ("μονήρης") and means "alone, unique". By Andronicus' age, the folk-etymology deduction from ''monēre'' prevailed, and so he could transform this epithet into a separate goddess, the literary (but not religious) counterpart of Greek [[Mnemosyne]].

== Juno Moneta ==
{{see also|Temple of Juno Moneta}}
[[File:Juno Moneta denarius 46BC.JPG|thumb|right|A bust of Juno Moneta on a denarius]]
Juno Moneta, an epithet of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], was the protectress of funds. As such, money in ancient [[Rome]] was coined in her temple. The word "moneta" is where we get the words "money", or "monetize", used by writers such as [[Ovid]], [[Martial]], [[Juvenal]], and [[Cicero]]. In several modern languages including Russian and Italian, ''moneta'' (Spanish ''moneda'') is the word for "coin".

As with the goddess Moneta, Juno Moneta's name is derived either from the Latin ''monēre'', since, as protectress of funds, she "warned" of instability or more likely from the Greek "moneres" meaning "alone, unique".

== Coinage==
"Moneta" retained the meanings of "money" and "die" well into the Middle Ages and appeared often on minted coins. For example, the phrase ''moneta nova'' is regular on coins of the [[low countries]] and the [[rhineland]] in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, with the "nova", Latin for "new", not necessarily signifying a new type or variety of coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =B.H.I.H Stewart | authorlink= | date = | year =1962 | month = | title =Moneta and Mot on Anglo-Saxon Coins | journal =British Numismatic Journal | volume =31 | issue = | pages =27–30 | publisher = | location = | issn = | pmid = | doi = | bibcode = | oclc = | id = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=RkQaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA27 | language = | format = | accessdate =27 December 2017 | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In culture ==
Moneta is a central figure in [[John Keats]]' poem "[[The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream]]".

{{Shinto}}
{{nihongo|'''O-fuda'''|[[wiktionary:御札|御札]] or [[wiktionary:お札|お札]]|o-fuda}} is a type of household [[amulet]] or [[talisman]], issued by a [[Shinto shrine]], hung in the house for protection, a  {{nihongo|'''[[wiktionary:護符|gofu]]'''|護符}}. It may also be called {{nihongo|'''shinpu'''|神符}}. It is made by inscribing the name of a ''[[kami]]'' and the name of the Shinto shrine or of a representative of the ''kami'' on a strip of paper, wood, cloth, or metal.

==Usage==
The Ofuda is customarily renewed annually before the end of a year, and then attached to a door, pillar, or ceiling. It may also be placed inside a private shrine (''[[kamidana]]''). It is believed to protect the family in residence from general harm, such as a disease. A more specific ''o-fuda'' may be placed near particular objects such as one for kitchen to protect from accidental fire. A popular ''o-fuda'' called ''jingū-taima'' (神宮大麻) or simply ''taima'' (大麻) is issued by [[Ise Shrine]]. It used to be made from [[hemp]] cloth (''taima'') but nowadays it is made of [[IseWashi]] ([[Washi]] (Japanese paper) made in [[Ise, Mie|Ise]]) that is blessed and replaced every year — as the use of hemp as a material was common in antiquity.

A portable form of ''o-fuda'', commonly called ''[[omamori]]'' (お守り or 御守, o-mamori) is typically given out wrapped in a small bag made of decorated cloth. This originates from [[Onmyōdō]] and [[Buddhism]], but was subsequently adopted by Shintoism. Both Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines give out these ''o-mamori''. While an ''o-fuda'' is said to protect a whole family, an ''o-mamori'' offers support for personal benefits.

The '''Ottaviani Intervention''' or '''Short Critical Study on the New Order of Mass''' was a study of 5 June 1969 written by twelve Roman Catholic theologians, who worked under the direction of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Lefebvre gathered together a group of 12 theologians who wrote under his direction, A Short Critical Study of the Novus Ordo Missae often called the Ottaviani Intervention." [http://www.holycrossseminary.com/Most_Asked_Questions_Appendix_III_page2.htm A Short History of the SSPX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031048/http://www.holycrossseminary.com/Most_Asked_Questions_Appendix_III_page2.htm |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinals [[Alfredo Ottaviani]] and [[Antonio Bacci]] sent it to [[Pope Paul VI]] with a cover letter dated 25 September 1969.  The study cast doubt on the orthodoxy of the [[Mass of Paul VI]], which had been promulgated by the [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Missale Romanum'' of 3 April 1969, though the definitive text, which took account of some of the criticisms of the Short Critical Study, had not yet appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/reformof.htm Text of the Intervention] [http://sspx.org/en/ottaviani-intervention - And another version has been slightly edited and corrected from the original by the Society of St. Pius X’s United States of America District Headquarters.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Likoudis]] and Kenneth Whitehead, The Pope, The Council and The Mass, The Christopher publishing house, w. Hanover, Massachusetts, 1981, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Paul VI asked the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], the department of the [[Roman Curia]] that Ottaviani had earlier headed, to examine the Short Critical Study. It responded on 12 November 1969 that the document contained many affirmations that were "superficial, exaggerated, inexact, emotional and false".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2000-12/07-999999/Ch1.pdf Christophe Geffroy and Philippe Maxence, Enquête sur la messe traditionnelle (with preface by Cardinal Alfons Maria Stickler)], p. 21).&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter of 17 February 1970 signed by Cardinal Ottaviani and addressed to Gerard Lafond, was published by ''{{ill|La Documentation catholique|fr}}''.&lt;ref&gt;''La Documentation catholique'', vol. 67 (1970), pp.&amp;nbsp;215–216 and 343&lt;/ref&gt; It stated:

{{quote|I have rejoiced profoundly to read the Discourse by the Holy Father on the question of the new Ordo Missae, and especially the doctrinal precisions contained in his discourses at the public Audiences of November 19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Paolo VI: Udienza Generale | language = it |  accessdate = 14 January 2017 | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/audiences/1969/documents/hf_p-vi_aud_19691119_it.html |date= 19 November 1969 | website = Holy See  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/audiences/1969/documents/hf_p-vi_aud_19691126_it.html | title = Paolo VI: Udienza Generale | language = it | accessdate= 14 January 2017| date=26 November 1969| website = Holy See }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6691126.HTM English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; after which I believe, no one can any longer be genuinely scandalized. As for the rest, a prudent and intelligent catechesis must be undertaken to solve some legitimate perplexities which the text is capable of arousing.  In this sense I wish your "Doctrinal Note" [on the Pauline Rite Mass] and the activity of the Militia Sanctae Mariae&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.theotokos.org.uk/pages/knights/knights.html Militia Sanctae Mariae]&lt;/ref&gt; wide diffusion and success.&lt;ref&gt;English translation as given in Likoudis and Whitehead, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The letter also expressed regret on the part of the cardinal that his letter of 25 September 1969 had been published:
{{quote|I regret only that my name has been misused in a way I did not wish, by publishing a letter that I wrote to the Holy Father without authorizing anyone to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;"Je regrette seulement que l’on ait abusé de mon nom dans un sens que je ne désirais pas, par la publication d’une lettre que j’avais adressée au Saint-Père sans autoriser personne à la publier" ([http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2000-12/07-999999/Ch1.pdf Christophe Geffroy and Philippe Maxence, Enquête sur la messe traditionnelle (with preface by Cardinal Alfons Maria Stickler)], p. 22).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jean Madiran]], a traditionalist Catholic who was then founder-director of the review ''Itinéraires'', which was condemned by the French episcopate in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Martin Morin, Éditoriaux et chroniques, tome I : De la fondation d’"Itinéraires" à sa condamnation par l’épiscopat (1956-1966)&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that ''Itinéraires'' had received the cardinal's authorization to publish his letter to the Pope and suggested that Ottaviani had signed the letter to Dom Gerard-Marie Lafond, prepared by his secretary, without knowing its contents, since he was blind,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2000-12/07-999999/Ch1.pdf Christophe Geffroy and Philippe Maxence, Enquête sur la messe traditionnelle (with preface by Cardinal Alfons Maria Stickler)], p. 22).&lt;/ref&gt; as he had been already when he signed his letter to the Pope.

Cardinal Bacci, who also signed the covering letter, and the twelve authors of the intervention did not retract their statements. Also, Archbishop Lefebvre did not disown his connection with it. On the other hand, Cardinal Ottaviani failed to deny authorship of the letter to Dom Gerard-Marie Lafond.

{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}
Persecutions against the [[Catholic Church]]  took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.

The Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions - notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]],  [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).

==Summary ==
The pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.

According to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive or resist, or confront and risk annihilation.&lt;ref name="Cornwell 333"&gt;Cornwell 333&lt;/ref&gt; To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.

In [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]],  persecution continued to the point that the Church faced [[extinction]]. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.

==Fascist persecutions==
===Nazi persecutions===

====Germany====


The Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]], as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a "man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock wrote that Hitler had some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism, but utter contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, "would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock wrote that "once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect":&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church. For Protestant clergy he felt only contempt... It was the 'great position' of the [Catholic] Church that he respected; towards its teaching he showed only the sharpest hostility. In Hitler's eyes, Christianity was a religion fit only for slaves; he detested its ethics in particular. Its teaching, he declared, was a rebellion against the natural law of selection  by struggle and the survival of the fittest.}}

[[Alfred Rosenberg]] was the original draftsman and spokesman of the Nazi Party program and  official ideologist of the Nazi Party. He was a rabid anti-Semite and anti-Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005206&lt;/ref&gt; In his "[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]", published in 1930, Rosenberg proposed to replace traditional Christianity with the [[neo-pagan]] "myth of the blood":&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Rosenberg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We now realize that the central supreme values of the Roman and the Protestant Churches, being a negative Christianity, do not respond to our soul, that they hinder the organic powers of the peoples determined by their Nordic race, that they must give way to them, that they will have to be remodeled to conform to a Germanic Christendom. Therein lies the meaning of the present religious search.|''[[The Myth of the 20th Century]]'', [[Alfred Rosenberg]], 1930.}}

Rosenberg and Hitler's senior lieutenant [[Martin Bormann]] actively collaborated in the Nazi program to eliminate Church influence - a program which included the abolition of religious services in schools; the confiscation of religious property;  circulating anti-religious material to soldiers; and the closing of theological faculties.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;

The Nazi Government closed down Catholic publications, dissolved the Catholic Youth League and charged thousands of priests, nuns and lay leaders on trumped up charges. The Gestapo violated the sanctity of the confessional to obtain information.&lt;ref&gt;http://hsc.csu.edu.au/modern_history/national_studies/germany/2432/page77.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Klausener]], the President of Catholic Action in Germany, delivered a speech to the Catholic Congress in June 1934, criticizing the government. He was shot dead in his office on the [[Night of the Long Knives]] of 30 June. His entire staff was sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref name="catholiceducation.org"&gt;http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/persecution/pch0229.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Church kindergartens were closed, crucifixes were removed from schools, the Catholic press was closed down and Catholic welfare programs were restricted on the basis they assisted the "racially unfit".

Many German clergy were sent to the concentration camps for voicing opposition to the Nazi authorities, or in some regions simply because of their faith.  Many Catholic laypeople also paid for their opposition with their lives. Over 300 monasteries and other institutions were expropriated by the SS.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/world/europe/08iht-germany.4.11787437.html?_r=1&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vatican issued two encyclicals opposing the policies of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]: ''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]'' in 1931 and ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' in 1937, respectively. The Catholic Church officially condemned the Nazi theory of racism in Germany in 1937 with the [[encyclical]] "[[Mit brennender Sorge]]", signed by [[Pope Pius XI]].  Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology &lt;ref&gt;Frattini, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; as "insane and arrogant".  It denounced the Nazi myth of "blood and soil", decried neopaganism of Nazism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the Führer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance.' It was written partially in response to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] and as response to the persecution of the church.

Following the outbreak of [[World War Two]], the Vatican, under [[Pope Pius XII]] pursued a policy of neutrality. The [[Holy See]] advocated for peace and spoke against racism, selfish nationalism,  atrocities in Poland, the bombardment of civilians and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://catholiceducation.org/articles/facts/fm0020.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236597 Encyclopædia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust: Pius XII - World War II and the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope allowed national hierarchies to assess and respond to their local situations, but established the [[Vatican Information Service]] to provide aid to thousands of war refugees, and saved further thousands of lives by instructing the church to provide discreet aid to Jews.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

====Poland====
{{Main article|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland}}

[[File:Plum Edith Stein und Maximilian Kolbe.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Edith Stein]] and [[Maximilian Kolbe]], stained glass by [[Alois Plum]] in [[Kassel]]. The two saints died as prisoners of the Nazis at [[Auschwitz]].]]

According to [[Norman Davies]], the Nazi terror was "much fiercer and more protracted in Poland than anywhere in Europe."&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"&gt;http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&amp;bgcolor=CD9544&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi ideology viewed ethnic "Poles" - the mainly Catholic ethnic majority of Poland - as "sub-humans". Following their 1939 invasion of West Poland, the Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority and of murdering or suppressing the ethnic Polish elites: including religious leaders. In 1940, Hitler proclaimed: "Poles may have only one master – a German. Two masters cannot exist side by side, and this is why all members of the Polish intelligentsia must be killed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&amp;bgcolor=CD9544 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church was brutally suppressed in Poland. Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members (18%) of the Polish clergy, were murdered; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Craughwell"&gt;Craughwell, Thomas J., [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=472 The Gentile Holocaust] Catholic Culture, Accessed July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1939 invasion, special death squads of SS and police arrested or executed those considered capable of resisting the occupation: including professionals, clergymen and government officials. The following summer, the [[A-B Aktion]] (''Extraordinary Pacification Operation'') further round up of several thousand Polish intelligentsia by the SS saw many priests shot in the General Government sector.&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"/&gt;

Historically, the church had been a leading force in Polish nationalism against foreign domination, thus the Nazis targeted clergy, monks and nuns in their terror campaigns. Treatment was at its most severe in the annexed regions, where churches were systematically closed and the majority of priests were either murdered, imprisoned or deported. Seminaries and convents were closed.&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"/&gt;

1,992 Polish clergy died in concentration camps.&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"/&gt; Eighty per cent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939; 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs.&lt;ref name="Craughwell"/&gt; Around 1.5 million Poles were transported to work as forced labor in Germany. Treated as racially inferior, they had to wear purple P's sewn into their clothing - sexual relations with Poles was punishable by death. Beyond the genocide of the Polish Jews, it is estimated that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians were killed during the German Occupation and the war.&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"/&gt;

====Elsewhere====
During the [[Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]], the Dutch Bishops condemned the Nazi abduction of Jews. The Nazis retaliated with a series of repressive measures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many Catholics were involved in strikes and protests against the treatment of Jews, and the Nazis offered to exempt converts and Jews married to non-Jews if protests ceased. The [[Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands#Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics. Some 40,000 Jews were hidden by the Dutch church and 49 priests killed in the process.&lt;ref name="catholiceducation.org"/&gt;  Among the Catholics of the Netherlands abducted in this way was  Saint [[Edith Stein]], who died at Auschwitz.

===Japanese persecutions===
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}

The expansion of Imperial Japan across the Asia Pacific from 1941 was accompanied by [[Japanese war crimes|many atrocities]] against Catholic missionaries, clerics, nuns, and lay people. Imperial Japan had developed [[State Shinto]] as the Imperial religion and promoted the notion of the [[Arahitogami|divinity of the Emperor]]. Japanese propaganda identified Catholics with European dominance - especially among Japan's own small Catholic community but also larger Asian communities in [[East Timor]], [[Korea]], [[French Indo-China]] the [[Dutch East Indies]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australian Papua and New Guinea]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/column.php?n=1672&lt;/ref&gt;

In the majority Catholic Philippines, priests and seminarians were interned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jesuit.org/blog/index.php/tag/world-war-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The five Columban priests killed at Malate are remembered as the [[Malate Martyrs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columban.org.au/publications/the-far-east/2008/july/how-ouR-priests-died/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Territory of New Guinea|Australian New Guinea]], priests and religious were imprisoned in concentration camps.&lt;ref name="asianews.it"&gt;http://www.asianews.it/news-en/The-Japanese-Church-apologizes-to-Papua:-Peter-To-Rot%E2%80%99s-death-is-our-fault-25276.html&lt;/ref&gt; From 1943, Japanese toleration of Christianity had shifted to confrontation.&lt;ref name="Peter To Rot"&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/to-rot-peter-11873 Peter To Rot]; Australian Dictionary of Biography; online 17 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Troops interfered with Catholic religious practices and destroyed church buildings.&lt;ref name="asianews.it"/&gt; Some 100 Catholics were killed for continuing to catechise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kwl.com.au/httpdocs/Articals/Timeline%20of%20The%20Catholic%20Church%20in%20Australia.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The martyr [[Peter To Rot]] took up duties as a [[catechist]] after Japanese invaders imprisoned the local missionaries.

==Communist persecutions==
=== Church diplomacy ===
Pius XII was a diplomat who valued diplomatic relations in order to keep contact with the local Church. As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:

* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447&lt;/ref&gt;  In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,&lt;ref&gt;Czechoslovakia AAS 1948  33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223&lt;/ref&gt; the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.  He excommunicated all those who [[imprison]]ed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] and [[bishop]]s as in the case of  Stepinac, Mindszenty, Grösz, Beran, Wyszinski and Pacha.&lt;ref&gt;Stepinac 10.14.1946, Mindszenty 12 28,1948, and 2 12, 1949,  Gosz 6 29, 1951, Beran 3 17, 1951, Wyszinski 9 30, 1953 and Pacha 9 17, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to prevent governmental usurpation of ecclsastical offices, The Vatican threatened to [[excommunicate]] anyone who do so, or, illegally grant or receive episcopal [[ordination]]. Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however.  In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis]] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1958  601&lt;/ref&gt; Questions were raised as to why  the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;see Stehle, Ostpolitik&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.

=== Persecutions and Church policies ===
==== China====
[[File:Sacré-Cœur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]
{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}

For centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]], to the Vatican, it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at  the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Smit 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval.  The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]]  situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.&lt;ref&gt;Smit 188&lt;/ref&gt; As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy, and, received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;Smit 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed
	* 20 archdioceses,
	* 85 dioceses
	* 39 apostolic prefectures
	* 3080 foreign missionaries
	* 2557 Chinese priests &lt;ref&gt;Giovanetti 230&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic  Chinese Church was formed.  Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds.&lt;ref&gt;Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanetti 232&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soviet Union====
{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] --&gt;

Relations between Soviet authorities  and the Vatican were always difficult. On 23 January 1918 the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana'' &lt;ref&gt;AAS 12, 1020, 313–317&lt;/ref&gt; in which he condemned the [[philosophy]] and practices of Communism. [[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements &lt;ref&gt;AAS 29, 1937, 67&lt;/ref&gt; and the encyclicals [[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],&lt;ref&gt;AAS 20 1928 165–178&lt;/ref&gt; Caritate Christi,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 24 1932 177–194&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Divini Redemptoris]] &lt;ref&gt;AAS 29, 1937 65–106&lt;/ref&gt;
The pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced  problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]] and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.

==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====
Soviet attempts to separate  the United Churches from Rome, reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the Papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII&lt;/ref&gt;  He also was aware, that in months preceding the  [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian  Church had been arrested.  [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]] Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka perished in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannetti, 131&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.

After the  Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a "spontaneous movement" for separation  from Rome, and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945 &lt;ref&gt;Giovannetti, 90&lt;/ref&gt; or sent to a Gulag, officially called, "an unknown destination because of political reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Smit, 174&lt;/ref&gt; Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi, 517&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]], after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi, 518&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].

After Joseph Stalin died in 1953, "[[peaceful coexistence]]" became subject of numerous discussions.  In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for  peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]], whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce major results, aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow, to have formal relations with the Vatican in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position, which he claimed was identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannetti,  88&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====
The small Catholic Churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi, 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. Catholic Lithuania suffered especially in the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population  was deported.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi, 515&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Poland ====
{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}
[[File:Wyszyński.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]

With the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war, in spite of massive persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannetti, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947,  and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.
Pope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',&lt;ref&gt;January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324&lt;/ref&gt; in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church  increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations.  Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]].  He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. [[Cum Jam Lustri]] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland.  In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Saint Stanisław]], Pope Pius XII issues [[Poloniae Annalibus]], giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests are incarcerated, all seminaries of [[religious institute]]s closed &lt;ref&gt;Giovannetti, 150&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 November 1953 the pontiff  addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1953, 755&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrest of the Cardinal, Communist authorities support patriotic priests, who desire a separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna Góra]], Pope Pius XII writes again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith  in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam]]  salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory of the queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.

In 1957, Pope Pius addressed  with ''[[Invicti athletae]]'' in strong words the Polish episcopate, which celebrated the 300th. Anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] through the Russians.  "The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church"  The Pope asks for endurance and bravery. The  people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, and even sacrifices in time and money, but they must never give in.&lt;ref&gt;''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]:
{{quote|Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul, which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom. Keep Catholic faith and unity.&lt;ref&gt;''Invicti athletae'', 34,  in AAS 1957, 321&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Czechoslovakia ====
''They can take away your freedom, but they cannot tear  the Catholic faith from your hearts. They can turn you into  martyrs, but they can never turn you into traitors''.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, XXXVII, 1945, 252&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the [[Czechoslovakian]] government expelled its  [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Germans|German]] populations from  Czechoslovakian territories, thus greatly reducing the percentage of [[Catholics]] in the country. After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed  the Catholic press.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi, 525&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts were made, to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refusing to participate were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental "Church Office" assumed  all functions of the Catholic Church.

==== Hungary ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] --&gt;
After the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gaind only gradually  ground in the country.  But in the following five years, the Church lost three thousand and three-hundred [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]] and [[newspapers]]. 11.500 [[Religious]] were asked to leave their convents and monasteries and institutes.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi, 528.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreements with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten  Catholic schools  was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism were  the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]]. They resulted in a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi 529&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Jozsef Mindszenty=====
[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944.   After coup of the communist party in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted &lt;ref name="Cornwell 333"/&gt;
Pope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and received him in the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946.  "After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d, mentally and physically, beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]].  His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]]... The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over." &lt;ref name="Cornwell 333"/&gt; The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956, when, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] he was freed. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.

After World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary  including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.&lt;ref&gt;Adryani 530&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1930, 381&lt;/ref&gt; It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi,531&lt;/ref&gt; The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi,532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi, 536&lt;/ref&gt;  many of them in Siberia.

In Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled.  Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi,536&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yugoslavia ====
After defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,   [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935  between Yugoslavia and the Vatican.  After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians  involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi,533&lt;/ref&gt;  The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.

After  the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan monks, 50% of the clergy was jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianyi,534&lt;/ref&gt; As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy.  A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito "a provocation",  this  represented to Pope Pius "a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times.  The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII  Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  Stepinac  was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him.  After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted  15500 priests, religious and nuns&lt;ref&gt;HK 1977,318–324&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persecution of religious institutes ===
[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents  or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Dammertz 375&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that "all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy." &lt;ref&gt;Dammertz 376&lt;/ref&gt;  The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman "Untermenschen", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan monk [[Maximilian Kolbe]].
[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]
In the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.&lt;ref name="HK 1960, 27"&gt;HK 1960, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: "What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.&lt;ref name="HK 1960, 27"/&gt; Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.&lt;ref&gt;Dammertz  378&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.&lt;ref&gt;Dammertz  379&lt;/ref&gt;

In all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well.  In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Dammertz 377&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.&lt;ref&gt;Dammertz 378&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools &lt;ref&gt;Galter, 345–353,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Dammertz 379&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5506">'''Popular piety''' is a notion defined in the Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy issued by the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline]] of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Value ==

The Catholic Church has declared popular piety "a true treasure of the People of God"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1987/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19870405_celebraz-la-serena_sp.html Pope John Paul II, Homily at La Serena, Chile, 5 April 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; and decried the attitude of "certain persons concerned with the care of souls who scorn, a priori, devotions of piety which, in their correct forms, have been recommended by the magisterium, who leave them aside and in this way create a vacuum which they do not fill."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_p-vi_exh_19740202_marialis-cultus_en.html Pope Paul VI, Apostolic Exhortation ''Marialis cultus'', 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to the liturgy ==

The [[Second Vatican Council]] asked that popular [[Catholic devotions]] "should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html Second Vatican Council, Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'', 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] the public functions of the Church and the popular devotions of the people were intimately connected. The [[laity]] assisted at the daily [[Liturgy of the Hours]] psalmody, the sacrifice of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], the numerous processions, and were quite familiar with the liturgy. Those few religious practices outside of official services, e.g. the [[Rosary]] (a substitute for the 150 [[Psalms]]) originated in the liturgy.&lt;ref name=CathEnc&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Special Devotions for Months}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the modern period, "the primacy accorded to contemplation, the importance attributed to subjectivity and a certain ascetical pragmatism exalting human endeavour ensured that Liturgy no longer appeared as the primary source of the Christian life in the eyes of men and women advanced in the spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, 34]&lt;/ref&gt; The reform of the Roman liturgy after the [[Council of Trent]] brought advantages such as ensuring that the doctrinal content reflected the faith in its purity, but its new fixity made it seem the reserve of the clergy and reinforced a division between liturgy and popular piety.&lt;ref&gt;Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

Popular devotion then followed its own channels, especially since the 16th century. Non-liturgical practices like the [[Stations of the Cross]], the [[Forty Hours' Devotion]], various [[litany|litanies]] and [[rosary-based prayers]] and [[chaplet (prayer)|chaplets]] prevailed everywhere; [[novena]]s and series of Sundays and weekdays in honour of particular saints or mysteries were instituted.&lt;ref name=CathEnc/&gt;

Entire months of the year were given over to special devotions, the most widespread being: January ([[Holy Name of Jesus]]); March ([[Saint Joseph]]); May ([[Virgin Mary]]); June ([[Sacred Heart]]); July ([[Precious Blood]]); September ([[Our Lady of Sorrows]]); October ([[Rosary]]); November ([[Souls in Purgatory]]).&lt;ref name=CathEnc/&gt;

A renaissance of liturgical worship began in the late 19th century and was advanced by the reforms of [[Pope Pius X]] and his 20th-century successors.&lt;ref&gt;Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, 44-46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices of popular piety ==

The Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy devotes separate chapters to consideration of practices associated with the liturgical year, veneration of the Mother of God, veneration of the other saints and the beatified, praying for the dead, and shrines and pilgrimages.

Under the heading "The language of popular piety", it speaks of gestures, texts and formulae, song and music, sacred music, sacred places and sacred times.

For an overview of some practices that form part of Catholic popular piety, see [[Catholic devotions]].

== Regulation ==
The Directory declares:
{{quote|Manifestations of popular piety are subject to the jurisdiction of the local [[ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]]. It is for him to regulate such manifestations, to encourage them as a means of assisting the faithful in living the Christian life, and to purify and evangelize them where necessary.}}

In application of this principle, members of the Church, clergy or laity, individuals or groups, must obtain the local ordinary's permission to promote prayers, formulas or private initiatives in this field. On a level beyond the confines of single dioceses, competence belongs to the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rahimahullah''' ({{lang-en|'''Allah have mercy upon him'''}}, {{lang-ar|''' رحمه الله'''}}) is a phrase often used after mentioning the [[Righteousness|righteous]] [[Islam]]ic personalities who came after the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]].  The mention of a late [[teacher]], [[Scholarly method|scholar]], [[Leadership|leader]], or even a dear [[Kinship|relative]] who was known for his goodness can be followed by the [[Prayer|praying]] of [[mercy]] upon him.

The '''redcap''' (or '''Redcap''') is a type of malevolent, murderous [[goblin]] found in [[English Folklore#Folklore of Yorkshire and the North East|Border folklore]]. He is said to inhabit ruined castles along the [[Anglo-Scottish border]], especially those places that were once the scenes of tyranny or wicked deeds, and is known for soaking his cap in the blood of his victims.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;Henderson, William (1879). ''Folklore of the Northern Counties of England and the Borders'' (2nd ed.) W. Satchell, Peyton &amp; Co. p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. p. 339. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as '''Redcomb''' and '''Bloody Cap'''.&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt;

==Description and behaviour==
Redcap is depicted as "a short, thickset old man with long prominent teeth, skinny fingers armed with talons like eagles, large eyes of a fiery red colour, grisly hair streaming down his shoulders, [[sabaton|iron boots]], a [[pikestaff]] in his left hand, and a red cap on his head.&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt; When travellers take refuge in his lair he will fling huge stones at them, and if he kills them he will soak his cap in their blood, giving it a crimson hue. However, he may be driven away by repeating words of [[Scripture]] or holding up the [[Christian cross|cross]]. He will then utter a dismal yell and vanish in flames, leaving behind him a large tooth on the spot where he was last seen.&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt; Other than these measures, human strength will do very little in overcoming him.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

According to the 19th-century folklorist William Henderson, the '''dunter''' or '''powrie''' is distinct from the redcap. Like the redcap he inhabits old Border forts, castles and [[peel tower]]s, but their main activity is to make a noise like the beating of flax or the grinding of barley in a hollow stone [[Quern-stone|quern]]. If this sound goes on longer or louder than usual then it is considered an omen of death or misfortune. Popular tradition states that these Border castles were built by the [[Picts]] who bathed the foundation stones in human blood which often resulted in such hauntings.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 1879, pp. 255–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs115&gt;Briggs 1976, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion is that dunters and redcaps may be the spirits of the original [[foundation sacrifice]]s.&lt;ref name=Briggs115/&gt;

==Variants==
The tale of a redcap in [[Perthshire]] depicts him as a more benign little man living in a room high up in Grantully Castle. He bestows good fortune on those who see or hear him.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

The [[Kabouter]] (Kaboutermannekins), or redcaps of [[Dutch folklore]], are also very different and more akin to [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 1879, pp. 250, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs 1976, pp. 247, 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruin of Blackett Tower, a border fortress that was owned by the Bell family in the [[Civil parishes in Scotland|parish]] of [[Kirkpatrick-Fleming]] in [[Dumfriesshire]], was haunted by a more traditional [[ghost]] known as '''Old Red Cap''' or '''Bloody Bell'''. A description of the tower and ghost was given by William Scott Irving in the poem "Fair Helen" in which the "ghastly phantom" holds a bloody dagger beneath a red eastern moon.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. Maxwell (1911). ''Witchcraft and Superstitious Record in the South-Western District of Scotland''. Dumfries: J. Maxwell &amp; Son. pp. 294-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westwood, Jennifer and Kingshill, Sophia (2009). ''The Lore of Scotland: A Guide to Scottish Legends''. Random House Books. p. 126. {{ISBN|9781905211623}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term redcap is also used in a more general sense. For example, in the village of [[Zennor]] in [[Cornwall]] fairies were often referred to as "red-caps" (including the more benevolent [[trooping fairies]]) because of their fondness for wearing green clothing and scarlet caps.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Bottrell|Bottrell, William]] (1880). ''Stories and Folk-Lore of West Cornwall, Third Series''. F. Rodda, Penzance. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic is demonstrated by an excerpt from the poem "The Fairies" by the Irish poet [[William Allingham]]: ''Wee folk, good folk/trooping all together/Green jacket, red cap/and white owl's feather''.&lt;ref&gt;Allingham, William (1862). ''Nightingale Valley: A Collection of Choice Lyrics and Short Poems.'' London: Bell and Daldy. pp. 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robin Redcap and William de Soulis==
[[File:Hermitagecastle1.jpg|thumb|Hermitage Castle, home of Robin Redcap]]

The redcap [[familiar]] of Lord [[William de Soulis]], called '''Robin Redcap''', is said to have wrought much harm and ruin in the lands of his master's dwelling, [[Hermitage Castle]]. Ultimately, William was (according to legend) taken to the [[Ninestane Rig]], a [[stone circle]] near the castle, then wrapped in lead and boiled to death.&lt;ref name="Mack146"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). ''The Border Line''. Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, William de Soulis was imprisoned in [[Dumbarton Castle]] and died there, following his confessed complicity in the conspiracy against [[Robert the Bruce]] in 1320.

[[Sir Walter Scott]] in ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' records a [[ballad]] written by [[John Leyden]] entitled "Lord Soulis" in which Redcap has granted his master safety against weapons and lives in a chest secured by three strong padlocks.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Walter (1849). ''The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border'' (Vol. 4). Robert Cadell, Edinburgh. pp. 235–257.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott states that the Redcap is a class of spirits that haunts old castles, and that every ruined tower in the south of Scotland was supposed to have one of these spirits residing within.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1849, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Redcap should not be confused with the mischievous [[hobgoblin]] known as Robin Roundcap of [[East Yorkshire]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliza Gutch|Gutch, Eliza]] (1912). ''County Folklore (Vol. 6)''. David Nutt. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, John (1890). ''Folk Lore of East Yorkshire''. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co. pp. 80–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] is the most widely professed religion in [[Benin]], with 48.5% of the nation's total population being members of various [[Christian denomination]]s. As a result, it plays an important role in shaping the country's social and cultural life. 

According to the 2013 estimate by the government of [[Benin]], the population of Benin is 27.7% Muslim, 25.5% Roman Catholic, 13.5% Protestant (which includes [[Celestial Church of Christ|Celestial]] 6.7%, Methodist 3.4%, and other Protestant 3.4%), 11.6% Vodun, 9.5% of other Christian denominations, and 12.2% of others or none.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bn.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Christians, Muslims, and adherents of [[African Traditional Religion]] throughout the country.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90082.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Benin]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (September 14, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; However, most adherents of the traditional [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] religious group are in the south, while other African Traditional Religion beliefs are followed in the north.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Muslims are represented most heavily in the north and southeast.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Christians are prevalent in the south, particularly in [[Cotonou]], the economic capital.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; It is not unusual for members of the same family to practice Christianity, Islam, African Traditional Religion, or a combination of all of these.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Faiths==

{{Empty section|date=February 2014}}

===African Traditional Religion===
Among the most practiced African Traditional Religions in Benin is the [[Vodun]] system of belief which originated in this area of Africa.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Other African Traditional Religions are practiced in the [[Atakora Department|Atakora]] (Atakora and Donga provinces) and [[Vodun]] and [[Orisha]] or [[Orisa]] veneration among the Yoruba and Tado peoples is prevalent in the center and south of the country. The town of [[Ouidah]] on the central coast is the spiritual center of Beninese Vodun.

The Tado and the Yoruba [[Orisha]] pantheons correspond closely:
* The [[God|supreme deity]] [[Mawu]] (in the Fon language) or [[Olodumare]] (also known as [[Olorun]], Eledumare, Olofin-Orun and Eledaa among other names)(in Yoruba)
* The deity of the earth and smallpox, known as Sakpana (or Sopono, Sakpata), can also be spelt as 'Shakpata, Shopono, Shakpana, and also known as Babalu Aye or Obalu Aye.
* The deity of thunder and lightning, known as [[Shango]]; can also be spelt as Sango, also known as Jakuta, Chango, Xevioso and Hevioso.
* The deity of war and iron, known as [[Ogoun|Ogun]], also known as Ogoun or Gu.

===Christianity===
[[Image:Cotonoucathedral.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Cotonou Cathedral|cathedral of Notre Dame des Apotres]] in [[Cotonou]]]]
{{main|Christianity in Benin}}  
[[Christianity]] first reached Benin in 1680, gaining more permanent footing in the 19th century. [[England|English]] [[Methodists]] arrived in 1843, operating amongst the coastal [[Gun (African tribe)|Gun]] people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} More than half of all Christians in Benin are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The Catholic hierarchy in Benin consists of the [[Archdiocese of Cotonou]] (including the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Abomey|Abomey]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dassa-Zoumé|Dassa-Zoumé]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lokossa|Lokossa]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Porto Novo|Porto Novo]]) and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Parakou|Parakou]] (including the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Djougou|Djougou]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kandi|Kandi]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Natitingou|Natitingou]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of N'Dali|N'Dali]]). There are 440 [[priest]]s and 900 men and women in religious orders.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Other Christian groups include [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Celestial Church of Christ|Celestial Christians]], [[Rosicrucians]], the [[Unification Church]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Many nominal Christians also practice traditional local religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Islam===
Islam, which accounts for more than 27.7% of the country's population, was brought to Benin from the north by [[Hausa people|Hausa]], and Songhai-Dendi traders. Nearly all Muslims adhere to the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] branch of Islam.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The few [[Shi'a]] Muslims are primarily Middle Eastern expatriates.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] is also present, who recently inaugurated a [[mosque]] in Benin, the Al Mahdi Mosque in 2006. Many nominal Muslims also practice traditional local religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten deurpaneel TMnr 4416-6.jpg|Islamic art in Benin
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Three out of twelve [[Departments of Benin | departments]] have a Muslim majority: [[Alibori Department |Alibori]] (81.3%), [[Donga Department|Donga]] (77.9%) and [[Borgou Department | Borgou]] (69.8%). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insae-bj.org/images/docs/insae-statistiques/demographiques/population/Principaux%20Indicateurs%20avec%20projections%20RGPH4/Principaux%20indicateurs%20socio%20démographiques%20et%20économiques%20RGPH-4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Couffo Department | Couffo]] has the lowest share of Muslims in Benin as Muslims comprise less than 1% of the total population.  
===Other groups===
Other religious groups in Benin include [[Eckankar]] and [[Baha'is]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Freedom of religion==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Benin}}

The [[Constitution of Benin]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the government generally respects this right in practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The United States government recorded no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice during 2007, and prominent societal leaders have taken positive steps to promote religious freedom.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The '''Sacred Name Movement (SNM)''' began within the [[Church of God (Seventh-Day)]] in [[Christianity in the United States|Christianity]], propagated by [[Clarence Orvil Dodd]] in the 1930s, which claims that it seeks to conform Christianity to its "[[Hebrew Roots]]" in practice, belief and worship. The best known distinction of the SNM is its advocacy of the use of the "sacred name"   [[:wikt:Yahweh|Yahweh]] (Hebrew: יַהְוֶה), i.e., the [[Yahweh (name)|reconstructed proper name]] of the God of Israel,  and the use of the original  Hebrew name of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], often transliterated as  [[Yahshua]].&lt;ref&gt;Semitic philology reconstructs the [[Old Aramaic|Aramaic]] name of Jesus as [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]], [[Joshua (name)|Yehoshua]] or [[Yahshua]] (cf. English "[[Joshua]]" Heb 4:8).&lt;/ref&gt; SNM believers also generally keep many of the [[Old Testament]] laws and ceremonies such as the [[Seventh-day Sabbath]], [[Torah]] festivals, and [[kashrut]] food laws.

==History==
The Sacred Name Movement arose in the early 20th century out of the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]] movement. This movement was influenced by [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] who changed the name of the main branch of the [[Bible Student movement]] to ''[[Jehovah's Witnesses]]''&lt;!--not capitalised until 1970s--&gt; in 1931, based on his belief in the importance of the Hebrew name of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Dodd]], a member of the Church of God (Seventh Day), began keeping the [[Jewish festivals]] (including [[Passover]]) in 1928, adopting sacred name doctrines in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="reformedreader"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hughey|first1=Sam|title=A History of the True Church|url=http://www.reformedreader.org/history/dugger/authors.htm|volume=|pages=|df=dmy-all|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5de9BJRER?url=http://www.reformedreader.org/history/dugger/authors.htm|dead-url=no|publisher=The Reformed Reader|accessdate=2009-01-07|archive-date=7 January 2009|authorlink1=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assembly of Yahweh]] was the first religious organization in the Sacred Name Movement. It was formed in [[Holt, Michigan]], in the 1930s. The Assembly of Yahweh believes the name of the Almighty [[Yahweh]] should be used along with his son's name, [[Yahshua]]. They keep the [[seventh day Sabbath]] (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) along with all the scriptural feast days. They believe the [[Torah]] (law) was not done away with.  They believe Yahshua is the son of Yahweh and that his life, death, burial, and resurrection give us salvation.  They believe after a person repents of sin, they should be baptized in the name of Yahshua. They first met in private homes near [[Lansing, Michigan]]. Later the assembly was located at The Camp of Yah outside of [[Eaton Rapids, Michigan]]. The land was owned by the Smith family, and Pearl Smith was the first pastor of the assembly. For a time after her leadership, the assembly was governed by a group of male elders.  Sometime in the late 1960s, Samuel Graham was made pastor. The congregation purchased a one-room school house and an additional {{convert|79|acre|km2}} a few miles from the original Camp of Yah.  They later put a small addition on the original building.  In 2008, the group received an anonymous donation to be used for a larger building. The main meeting room now allows up to 200 to meet for worship.

Dodd began publishing ''The Faith'' magazine starting in 1937 to promote his views.&lt;ref name="reformedreader"/&gt; It is currently freely distributed by the Assembly of Yahweh. American religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] wrote, "No single force in spreading the Sacred Name movement was as important as ''The Faith'' magazine."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Activities==
The Assembly of Yahweh publishes the ''Faith Magazine'' and the ''Word of Yahweh Bible''. They have services every Sabbath at 10:30 am and host all Feast days. During the [[Feast of Tabernacles]], people come from different states and other countries to observe the feast.

==Beliefs==
The Sacred Name Movement consists of several small and contrasting groups (such as Yahweh's Assembly in Messiah, and Yahweh's Assembly in Yahshua, etc), unified by the use of the name [[Yahweh]] and for the most part, a Hebraic-based form [[Yahshua]] for the name of [[Son of God#Christianity|God's Son]]. [[Angelo Traina]], a disciple of Dodd, undertook the translation of a Sacred Name edition of the [[Bible]], publishing the ''Holy Name New Testament'' in 1950 (see [[Tetragrammaton in the New Testament]]) and the ''Holy Name Bible'' in 1962, both based upon the [[King James Version]], but changing some names and words in the text to Hebrew-based forms, such as "[[God]]" to "[[Elohim]]", "LORD" to "[[Yahweh]]" and "[[Jesus]]" to "[[Yahshua]]". Most groups within the Sacred Name Movement use a [[Sacred Name Bibles|Sacred Name Bible]], others having been produced since Traina's.

The SNM rejects [[Ēostre|Easter]] and [[Christmas controversy#Historical controversy|Christmas]] as [[Paganism|pagan]] in origin and instead observes the holy days of [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0323.htm Leviticus 23] such as [[Passover]] and the [[Feast of Weeks]]. The movement is also [[non-Trinitarian]] because it rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] as unbiblical.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|last1=Clarke|first1=Peter
|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements
|page=543
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, groups within the movement have differed on doctrinal points, such as the [[Shaving in Judaism|wearing of beards]] and what constitutes a [[Sabbath]] rest. The [[Assemblies of Yahweh]] (headquartered in [[Bethel, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Bethel, Pennsylvania]]) distanced itself from the movement because of its refusal to become doctrinally united with it, calling the movement a "disorganisation" and "confusion".

==SNM Bibles==
{{Main|Sacred Name Bibles}}
Individuals and groups within the Movement will use other forms of Yahshua, including "[[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]]", "[[Yehoshua (surname)|Yehoshua]]", "Yahushua", "Yahoshua", "Yaohushua", "Y'shua" or "[[Yahshuah]]". This use of the sacred names has led to the SNM production of Bibles. These include:

* The Word of Yahweh [http://assemblyofyahweh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bible-Read-More.pdf]
* The Scriptures

'''Strala yoga''' is a modern form of [[yoga]] that was founded in 2008 by [[Tara Stiles]].

==History==
The New York City Strala studio was founded by Tara Stiles and her husband Michael Taylor in 2008. The name stems from the Swedish word "stråla" meaning radiate light. The yoga style was first introduced on the YouTube channel belonging to Stiles. Strala has partner studios in Seattle, Singapore and Barcelona, and classes are offered in 20 countries around the world. Partner Gyms that offer Strala are CMG in Paris (30 clubs) and SCLA in the US. Strala has a few thousand Guides leading classes in various studios and clubs globally. Strala is now offered in 20 other countries.

== About ==   
Strala focuses on an overall concept of moving with ease. Natural movement, eastern influences of tai chi and shiatsu, and a positive, easy-going atmosphere are elements in Strala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strala is the movement system that ignites freedom.|url=http://stralayoga.com/about/|website=Stralayoga|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strala teachers are called "guides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A with Strala Founder Tara Stiles|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/lifestyle/life-stiles/|website=Yoga Journal|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Supernatural''''' is an American dark fantasy television series created by [[Eric Kripke]]. It was first broadcast on September 13, 2005, on [[The WB]], and subsequently became part of successor [[The CW]]'s lineup. Starring [[Jared Padalecki]] as [[Sam Winchester]] and [[Jensen Ackles]] as [[Dean Winchester]], the series follows the two brothers as they hunt [[demons]], [[ghost]]s, [[monster]]s, and other supernatural beings. The series is produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]], in association with [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]]. Along with Kripke, [[executive producers]] have been [[McG]], [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robert Singer]], [[Phil Sgriccia]], [[Sera Gamble]], [[Jeremy Carver]], [[John Shiban]], [[Ben Edlund]] and [[Adam Glass]]. Former executive producer and director [[Kim Manners]] died of lung cancer during production of the [[Supernatural (season 4)|fourth season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/01/27/supernatural-an/ |title='Supernatural' and 'X Files' producer-director Kim Manners has died |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] and surrounding areas and was in development for nearly ten years, as creator Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it. The [[Pilot (Supernatural)|pilot]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69&amp;nbsp;million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=092005_04 |title=Weekly Program Rankings |date=September 20, 2005 |publisher=ABC Medianet |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ratings of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the series for a full season. Originally, Kripke planned the series for three seasons but later expanded it to five. The [[Supernatural (season 5)|fifth season]] concluded the series' main storyline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/show-creator-eric-kripke-deter-30939.aspx |title=Show Creator Eric Kripke Determined to End 'Supernatural' at Season 5 |publisher=BuddyTV |accessdate=February 28, 2010 |date=September 1, 2009 |first=Kris |last=De Leon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kripke departed the series as [[showrunner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/07/15/supernatural-season-6-spoilers/ |title=Exclusive: 'Supernatural' boss on why he stepped down and what's coming up (hint: monsters!) |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |date=July 15, 2010 |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has continued on for several more seasons with new showrunners, including Sera Gamble, Jeremy Carver, Robert Singer and Andrew Dabb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/07/18/supernatural-end/ |title='Supernatural' stars answer: When will the show end? |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=July 19, 2014 |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/08/new-supernatural-showrunner-on-his-plans-for-season-8 |title=New Supernatural Showrunner on His Plans for Season 8 |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2016/05/13/supernatural-season-12-jeremy-carver-leaving-showrunner/ |title=Supernatural Names New Showrunners as Jeremy Carver Moves to Frequency |publisher=TVLine |first1=Michael |last=Ausiello |first2=Vlada |last2=Gelman |date=May 13, 2016 |accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its [[Supernatural (season 11)|eleventh season]], ''Supernatural'' became the longest-running American live-action [[fantasy]] TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoversd.com/news/2015/jul/12/comic-con-2015-supernatural-panel/ |title='Supernatural' now longest running sci-fi show in U.S. |last=Rocha |first=Michael |publisher=DiscoverSD.com |date=July 12, 2015 |accessdate=October 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119232222/http://www.discoversd.com/news/2015/jul/12/comic-con-2015-supernatural-panel/ |archivedate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a [[Supernatural (season 14)|fourteenth season]], which premiered on October 11, 2018, and will consist of 20 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |title='Riverdale,' 'Flash,' 'Supernatural' Among 10 CW Renewals |last=Goldberg |first=Leslie |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=April 2, 2018 |accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/06/20/the-cw-fall-2018-premiere-dates/ |title=The CW reveals fall 2018 premiere dates: Arrow swaps with Legends of Tomorrow |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 20, 2018 |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/06/22/supernatural-season-14-episodes-20-shorter/ |title=Supernatural's Season 14 Episode Order Is CW Series' Shortest in a Decade |last=Ausiello |first=Michael |work=TVLine |date=June 22, 2018 |accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conception and creation ===
[[File:Eric Kripke 2010 (cropped).png|thumb|alt=|Creator Eric Kripke feels that America's urban legends are "every bit as fleshed out as any world mythologies".&lt;ref name="scarierfiction" /&gt;]]
Before bringing ''Supernatural'' to television, creator Eric Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-08-17-supernatural_x.htm |title='Supernatural' is an eerie natural for WB |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=USA Today |first=Bill |last=Keveney |date=August 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been fascinated with [[urban legend]]s since he was a child.&lt;ref name="theage2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/on-the-road-trip-from-hell/2006/01/03/1136050443994.html?page=2 |title=On the road trip from hell |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=The Age |first=Maria Elena |last=Fernandez |date=January 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had originally envisioned ''Supernatural'' as a movie.&lt;ref name="chills"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201091121/http://www.toledofreepress.com/2005/09/07/kripke-goes-for-supernatural-chills |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |url=http://www.toledofreepress.com/2005/09/07/kripke-goes-for-supernatural-chills |title=Kripke goes for ‘Supernatural' chills |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=Toledo Free Press |first=Lauri |last=Donahue |date=September 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later developed it as a TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was picked up by [[The WB]].&lt;ref name="children"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/children-of-the-damned/2006/01/15/1137259939649.html |title=Children of the damned |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van "fighting the demons in search of the truth".&lt;ref name="theage2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories."&lt;ref name="theage2" /&gt;

As he had previously written for [[The WB]] series ''[[Tarzan (2003 TV series)|Tarzan]]'', Kripke was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network and used the opportunity for ''Supernatural''.&lt;ref name="chills" /&gt; However, the network disliked his tabloid reporter idea, so Kripke successfully pitched his last-minute idea of the characters being brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to have the brothers be from [[Lawrence, Kansas]], because of its closeness to [[Stull Cemetery]], a location famous for its urban legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kripke, Eric |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/supernatural-burning-questions-38374.aspx |title=''Supernatural'': Your Burning Questions Answered! |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=October 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it came time to name the two lead characters, Kripke decided on "Sal" and "Dean" as an homage to [[Jack Kerouac]]'s road-trip novel ''[[On the Road]]''. However, he felt that "Sal" was inappropriate for a main character and changed the name to "Sam".&lt;ref name="scarierfiction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/fact-scarier-than-fiction/story-e6frexlr-1111113119827 |title=Fact scarier than fiction |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally intended for the brothers' last name to be "Harrison" as a nod to actor [[Harrison Ford]], as Kripke wanted Dean to have the "devil-may-care swagger of Han Solo". However, there was a Sam Harrison living in Kansas, so the name had to be changed for legal reasons.&lt;ref name="lastname" /&gt; Combining his interest in the [[Winchester Mystery House]] and his desire to give the series the feel of "a modern-day Western", Kripke settled on the surname of "Winchester". However, this also presented a problem. The first name of Sam and Dean's father was originally "Jack", and there was a Jack Winchester residing in Kansas, so Kripke was forced to change the character's name to "John".&lt;ref name="lastname"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/02/14/a_supernatural_spin_off_death_by_bad_tac |title=A 'Supernatural' Spin-Off?

[[File:Chevrolet Impala 1967 (11695634105).jpg|thumb|Black '67 Impala, similar to the car in the series]]
Growing up, Kripke connected to television shows that had signature cars, such as ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. This prompted him to include one in ''Supernatural''.&lt;ref name="impala"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appeal-democrat.com/supernatural-impala/article_052d3db8-efcf-543e-9415-ac878d13a4d0.html |title=Supernatural Impala |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |publisher=Appeal-Democrat |date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We say it's a modern American Western&amp;nbsp;– two gunslingers who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking from the very beginning that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse."&lt;ref name="impala" /&gt; He originally intended for the car to be a [[First-generation Ford Mustang|'65 Mustang]], but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a [[Chevrolet Impala#Fourth generation (1965–1970)|'67 Impala]], since "you can put a body in the trunk" and because "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors."&lt;ref name="scarierfiction" /&gt; Kripke has commented, "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show."&lt;ref name="impala" /&gt;

Kripke had previously pitched the series to Fox executive Peter Johnson, and when Johnson moved to [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] as president of TV, he contacted Kripke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122763978.html |title=Chasing new haunts: McG drives spooky road series to the WB |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=Variety |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=September 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson soon signed on as co-executive producer, as did Wonderland owner [[McG]] as executive producer, with the production company set to make the pilot episode. Before it could be filmed, however, script issues needed to be dealt with. Originally, the brothers were not raised by their father, but rather by their aunt and uncle. Thus, when Dean comes to Sam for assistance in the pilot episode, he has to convince him that the supernatural exists. However, Kripke realized that this made the backstory too complicated and reworked it with Peter Johnson so that their father raised them to be hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), pp.8–10&lt;/ref&gt; The script went through many additional revisions. One of the original ideas was for Sam's girlfriend Jessica to be revealed as a demon, which prompts him to join Dean on the road; however, Kripke felt it was more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be Jessica's death, so he had her killed in the same manner as Sam's mother, making them the "right bookends".&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Other revised concepts include Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer who murders their father&lt;ref name="Knight, Nicholas p.14"&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; and their father dying in Jessica's place.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Filming for the pilot episode was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on ''Tarzan'', signed on.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.21&lt;/ref&gt; When the series was eventually picked up, the studio brought in [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robert Singer]] as executive producer, as it wanted Kripke to work with someone with production experience. Due to his previous work on ''[[The X-Files]], ''co-executive producer [[John Shiban]] was also hired to help design the series mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Kripke had the series planned out for three seasons but later expanded it to five&lt;ref name="threeseason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/eric-kripke-fields-35627.aspx |title=Eric Kripke Fields Your Questions About Supernatural |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=TV Guide |date=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hoped to end it there on a high note.&lt;ref name="highnote"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/supernatural-creator-eric-kripke-answers-fan%E2%80%99s-questions-%E2%80%93-part-iii/ |title=Supernatural Creator Eric Kripke Answers Fan's Questions&amp;nbsp;– Part III |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |work=Eclipse Magazine |first=Liana |last=Bekakos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing ===
{{double image|right|Sera Gamble by Gage Skidmore.jpg|167|Jeremy Carver by Gage Skidmore.jpg|175|After the departure of series creator Eric Kripke, the role of showrunner was assumed by [[Sera Gamble]] (left) for seasons six and seven, and [[Jeremy Carver]] (right) for seasons eight to eleven.}}
The staff for the first season consisted of Kripke and five other writers, with assistants to help with researching urban legends.&lt;ref name="chills" /&gt; Most of the work done in writing the series is very collaborative, with the writers often breaking up into groups. At the beginning of each season, the writers are brought together and pitch their ideas, which are then assigned to a specific writer to be developed. Each story idea is outlined on a dry-erase board, with Kripke and Bob Singer making necessary changes. Afterward, the script is written,&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 2 Companion), p.150&lt;/ref&gt; and Kripke goes through it to make sure it has the same tone as other episodes.&lt;ref name="chills" /&gt; Kripke found this task very difficult to do in the first season,&lt;ref name="burningquestions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/supernatural-eric-kripke-38662.aspx |title=As Supernatural Returns, Your Burning Questions Are Answered! |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=TV Guide |date=October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he felt it became easier by the third season, as the staff came to "really understand the show's style".&lt;ref name="burningquestions" /&gt; Following the fifth season, Kripke stepped down as showrunner but maintained his connection with the series as an executive consultant. In a 2006 interview with ''Collider'', he responded to the question as to how involved he still is with the show with the answer, "I would define myself as a proud parent who has sent their child off to college."&lt;ref name=kripkeinvolved /&gt; He elaborated on this analogy, explaining, "I'm there if they need me, I'm happy to help, but I also stay out of their way if they don't need me."&lt;ref name=kripkeinvolved&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weintraub |first1=Steve |title=Eric Kripke on 'Supernatural's Success and His New NBC Show 'Timeless' |url=http://collider.com/eric-kripke-supernatural-timeless-interview/ |website=Collider |accessdate=September 25, 2017 |date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone of ''Supernatural'' was heavily influenced by films such as ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''—having the horror happen in a family setting rather than remote location—and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]''—having bits of comedy mixed in. Commenting on the former, Kripke said, "It's the idea that horror can happen in your own backyard. How many viewers have to worry about the vampire in the gothic castle?"&lt;ref name="scarierfiction" /&gt; "It's always been a show about ''family''."&lt;ref name="threeseason" /&gt; Other influences include ''[[The Two Sisters (film)|The Two Sisters]]'' and Asian horror films ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'', ''[[Ju-on]]'', and ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''.&lt;ref name="ccreport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2008/07/29/the-supernatural-panel-comic-con-report/ |title=The Supernatural Panel – Comic-Con Report |date=July 29, 2008 |first=Richard |last=Keller |publisher=AOL TV |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to creator Eric Kripke, the show originally was intended to focus on the weekly monsters, with Sam and Dean Winchester merely being "an engine to get us in and out of different horror movies every week".&lt;ref name="funapoc" /&gt; His sole desire was to merely "scare the crap out of people".&lt;ref name="teamspirit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Story/?file=/2007/5/27/tvnradio/17780155&amp;sec= |title=Team spirit |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |date=May 27, 2007 |work=The Star |author=Mumtaj, Begum}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few episodes in, Kripke and executive producer Bob Singer noticed the onscreen chemistry between [[Jared Padalecki]] and [[Jensen Ackles]]. This revelation caused them to change the series to focus more on the brothers than the monsters, basing the weekly monster around the storyline they wanted for the Winchesters. According to Kripke, "... sometimes we don't even have the monster until way late in the break, once we get all the angst and the drama done first."&lt;ref name="funapoc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/08/supernatural-season-5-eric-kripke-cw.html |title='It's the fun Apocalypse': Creator Eric Kripke talks 'Supernatural' |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Maureen |last=Ryan |date=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects ===
Though companies were hired for work on the pilot episode—such as Entity FX for the visual effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entityfx.com/who.html |title=Who |publisher=EntityFX |accessdate=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;—effects departments now work exclusively for the series.&lt;ref name="effectsdvd"&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |title=Supernatural Season 3 – "From Legends to Reality" featurette |medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivan Hayden is the visual effects supervisor, and works with many levels of the production staff. During pre-production, Hayden must go through the scripts, looking for possible visual effects. He then has a concept meeting with the writers, and after settling on the effect designs to use, coordinates with the special effects and stunt departments. Hayden is also present during filming to help the director make sure that the scenes are being filmed in the best way for the visual effects, such as by ensuring that the actors are looking at the correct location where an effect will later be added. Afterward, he then meets with the editors.&lt;ref name="p144"&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 2 Companion), p.144&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect of the visual effects department is coming up with rules and physics for each supernatural creature,&lt;ref name="p144" /&gt; though the rules are often bent if it benefits the story.&lt;ref name="effectsdvd" /&gt; In 2012, it was announced that Hayden will be working at the new Vancouver location of Encore for its VFX division.&lt;ref name="encore"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/952591/encore-adds-vancouver-location |title=Encore Adds Vancouver Location |publisher=Canada Newswire |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
''Supernatural'' features a synthesized orchestral score, although traditional acoustic instruments such as guitars and cellos are used at times. Special instruments have also been used in specific episodes, such as "bluesy gospel music" played on a broken-down piano in the faith-healing episode "Faith". Unlike other television shows, the series features two composers: [[Christopher Lennertz]] and [[Jay Gruska]].&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; Each composer scores every other episode, giving them extra time to write the scores, which usually end up being around 30&amp;nbsp;minutes per episode. They write themes for their own episodes and characters and work with one another if there is overlap between episodes. They try to base the music on the visuals of the episode, such as in the episode "Dead in the Water", in which off-angle shots are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes, and spoken words such as "water" and "die" are followed by a lower pitch to create a "gurgly" sound.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.147&lt;/ref&gt; While there are similarities in the scores for situations such as the brothers and their father, about a third of each episode's score is newly written for the series.&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Supernatural Music of Christopher Lennertz |publisher=Mania |first=Randall D. |last=Larson |date=July 27, 2006 |url=http://www.mania.com/supernatural-music-christopher-lennertz_article_51827.html |accessdate=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While original scores are used throughout episodes, another important aspect of the series' music is the use of classic rock, over which creator Eric Kripke threatened to quit when the network would not allow its inclusion. Most of the songs are from Kripke's private collection, although one of his favorite bands—[[Led Zeppelin]]—is too expensive to use. Some episode titles are references to Led Zeppelin songs.&lt;ref name="eclipsemagazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/supernatural-creator-eric-kripke-answers-fan-questions-%E2%80%93-part-i/ |title=Supernatural Creator Eric Kripke Answers Fan Questions&amp;nbsp;– Part I |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |work=Eclipse Magazine |first=Liana |last=Bekakos |date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has featured such bands as [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Bad Company]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Triumph (band)|Triumph]] and [[AC/DC]] on more than one occasion. Multiple songs are usually used throughout each episode, and accompany "[[Previously (television)|The Road So Far]]" sequences before select episodes that highlight a montage of past events. Although Kripke prefers to keep a fine line between the score and songs used, sometimes Lennertz and Gruska are required to write short sections of rock-like music to fill 15-to-20-second gaps, as it would be too costly to acquire song rights. On the last episode of every season except the first, the song "[[Carry On Wayward Son]]" by [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] is played at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming locations ===
Though the pilot was filmed in [[Los Angeles]], principal filming takes place in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Knight, Nicholas p.14" /&gt; Thus, on-location filming usually takes place in the area. "Dead in the Water" was filmed at [[Buntzen Lake]],&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and the final scenes of "Simon Said" were filmed at [[Cleveland Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 2 Companion), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Other locations used on the show are often reused two or three times, with the art department making variations to conceal this.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 3 Companion), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Heritage Park in [[Burnaby]] has been used as a cemetery in "Red Sky at Morning", and as the location of the gingerbread-house cottage in "Bedtime Stories".&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 3 Companion), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]] in [[Coquitlam]] has served many functions for the series, including an asylum in "Asylum",&lt;ref name="p60"&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.60&lt;/ref&gt; a hospital in "In My Time of Dying",&lt;ref name="p101"&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 2 Companion), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and a prison in "Folsom Prison Blues".&lt;ref name="p101" /&gt; The episode "Houses of the Holy" was filmed on location in Vancouver at St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church. Because episodes usually take place in the middle of nowhere, filming often takes place at an old military base. Having been shut down for years, the buildings have been removed, leaving just roads on which sets are erected, such as for crossroads scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 3 Companion), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online distribution ===
Rather than having the series debut on television, The WB instead made the pilot episode available for online streaming through [[Yahoo!]] a week before it was set to premiere on the network as part of a promotional scheme.&lt;ref name="promotion"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-09-06-supernatural_x.htm |title=New drama 'Supernatural' gets online jump |date=September 6, 2005 |work=USA Today |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the transition to The CW, ''Supernatural'' episodes were added to [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Store]] starting in December 2006, being one of the first CW series to be made available for sale online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2006/digital/news/cw-goes-digital-with-itunes-1117955946/ |title=CW goes digital with iTunes |date=December 17, 2006 |work=Variety |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |first1=Ben |last1=Fritz |first2=Josef |last2=Adalian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the network began streaming episodes of the series on its website with limited commercial interruption, available for up to four weeks after the initial airings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2007/01/19/the-cw-expands-its-online-offerings-by-streaming-several-primetime-series-for-free-on-cwtvcom--23401/20070119cw02/ |title=The CW Expands Its Online Offerings by Streaming Several Primetime Series for Free on CWTV.com |date=January 19, 2007 |publisher=The Futon Critic |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning January 11, 2007, Australia's [[Network Ten]] also began offering full episodes for download via their website, through a deal with Warner Bros. Television. To combat piracy, Ten debuted the second-season premiere five days before its initial broadcast in the country, making ''Supernatural'' the first major network show available for free download in Australia before being aired. Subsequent episodes became available online just hours after being televised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/supernatural-is-first-online/story-e6frewz0-1111112810068 |title=Supernatural is first online |date=January 10, 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, episodes were also made available for download on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/292651 |title=Gamers turn to XBox Live for movies |work=The New York Times |first=Joanne |last=Kaufman |accessdate=October 8, 2009 |date=July 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, [[Amazon.com]] launched its new on-demand TV service, with ''Supernatural'' being one of the many television shows available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/09/17/ap5436492.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001401/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/09/17/ap5436492.html |title=Amazon.com launches new TV store |work=Forbes |accessdate=February 22, 2013 |date=September 17, 2008 |archivedate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series originally focuses primarily on the brothers [[Dean Winchester]] and [[Sam Winchester]], played by [[Jensen Ackles]] and [[Jared Padalecki]], as they travel throughout the country hunting down evil supernatural creatures. Padalecki became interested in the role because he liked horror series, including both ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', which he found similar to the proposed plot of ''Supernatural''. He was also excited to play "the reluctant hero", comparing Sam to ''[[The Matrix]]''{{'}}s [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] of ''[[Star Wars]]''. Padalecki had previous experience working with executive producers [[McG]] and David Nutter,&lt;ref name="newz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newzline.com/2007/02/07/supernatural-interview-with-jared-padalecki-sam-winchester |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214205150/http://www.newzline.com/2007/02/07/supernatural-interview-with-jared-padalecki-sam-winchester |archivedate=February 14, 2008 |title=Supernatural interview with Jared Padalecki (Sam Winchester) |date=February 7, 2007 |publisher=Newzline |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former convincing him to audition for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Ackles was originally asked by Nutter to audition for the role of Sam&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; but preferred the character of Dean after reading the script.&lt;ref name="starc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Story/?file=/2008/9/12/tvnradio/1985443&amp;sec= |title=Jensen Ackles enjoys doing Supernatural |date=September 12, 2008 |work=The Star |first=Mumtaj |last=Begum |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his audition, he was already a series regular on fellow WB series ''[[Smallville]]''.

{{quote|When I read the script, Dean just jumped out at me. With that character there was always a bit more comedy, and a bit more recklessness, and it just appealed to me more. So when I asked to read for that, they were like, "That's what we're looking for." So it was great. I found a character that I really enjoy playing.|source=Jensen Ackles on what drew him to the character of Dean Winchester&lt;ref name="starc" /&gt;}}

While the series does not have many lead characters, there are many recurring characters. [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] portrays [[John Winchester (Supernatural)|John Winchester]], father of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale. Later in the series, it is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father "split the show". Shiban noted that "... the boys were looking for Dad, and they were looking for a monster of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses their path. It became difficult, because we thought it was like – 'what is Dad doing? Is he doing more interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'"&lt;ref name="shiban"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/interviews/a42692/supernatural-writer-john-shiban.html |title='Supernatural' writer John Shiban |date=February 15, 2007 |work=Digital Spy |first=Neil |last=Wilkes |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to ''Supernatural'' for the second season because of his recurring role on the series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.&lt;ref name="morganfate"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-04-20-morgan_x.htm |title=Jeffrey Dean Morgan awaits his fate |date=April 20, 2006 |work=USA Today |first=William |last=Keck |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future appearances of the character have been hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.&lt;ref name="askaus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/08/19/ask-ausiello-spoilers-on-greys-house-ncis-more/ |title=Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's', 'House', 'NCIS', 'Bones', 'Gossip Girl', 'Supernatural', and more! |date=August 19, 2009 |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also introduced in the first season are the demon [[Azazel (Supernatural)|Azazel]] and his [[Meg Masters demon|unnamed daughter]]. While Azazel mainly appears merely as shadows or silhouettes in the first season, only taking physical form when he possesses John Winchester, Azazel's daughter uses a girl named [[Meg Masters]]—portrayed by [[Nicki Lynn Aycox]]—as a host.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In the second-season premiere, Azazel's host is portrayed by [[Fredric Lehne]]; originally brought on only for one episode, Lehne impressed the showrunners so much that he was asked to return for the [[All Hell Breaks Loose (Supernatural)|season's two-part finale]].&lt;ref name="allhellDVD"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Eric Kripke, Sera Gamble, Robert Singer |title=Supernatural Season 2 – Audio commentary for the episode "All Hell Breaks Loose" |medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the character's death, Azazel makes appearances in subsequent seasons, being portrayed by different actors. Lehne also reprises the role in the first episode of season six when Dean is poisoned and begins to see Azazel again. Likewise, after Azazel's daughter is exorcised from Meg towards the end of the first season, the demon and her host continued to appear in the series, although now as two separate characters. Aycox continued her role in the fourth season when the angry spirit of Meg tries to kill the Winchesters. The demon returns for an episode in the second season played by Padalecki, temporarily taking Sam as a host. She appears once again in the fifth season, her newest host being portrayed by [[Rachel Miner]], in a recurring role.

The writers eventually wanted to flesh out the concept of hunters, resulting in the introduction of many new characters.&lt;ref name="hunterflesh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/supernaturals-creator-shares-38379.aspx |title=Supernatural's Creator Shares More Season 2 Secrets |date=October 19, 2006 |work=TV Guide |first=Angel |last=Cohn |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Jim Beaver]] makes his first appearance as [[Bobby Singer]], an old family friend of the Winchesters, at the end of the first season. Becoming a sort of surrogate father to Sam and Dean after their father's death,&lt;ref name="burningquestions" /&gt; the character acts as their mentor and foremost point of contact before his departure in the seventh season. Other hunters appear in the second season with the introduction of Harvelle's Roadhouse, a saloon frequented by hunters. It is owned by [[Ellen Harvelle]] (played by [[Samantha Ferris]]), whose late husband was a friend of John Winchester. Working alongside her mother is [[Jo Harvelle]] (played by [[Alona Tal]]). Also present is the computer guy [[Ash (Supernatural)|Ash]] (played by [[Chad Lindberg]]), who uses his vast computer skills to track the paranormal. Tal was eventually written out of the series, and believes the reason to be that the producers felt she looked like Sam and Dean's "14-year-old sister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/3776/cbs-news-barney-v-dwight-smackdown-xoxo-at-csi-ny-ghost-gossip-more |title=CBS News: Barney v.

For the third season, the writers decided to introduce [[Ruby (Supernatural)|Ruby]], a demonic former witch who claims to be an ally to the Winchesters. However, The CW requested that another female be added, so the character [[Bela Talbot]], a self-centered thief who sells occult objects to wealthy clients and who was already intended to appear in multiple episodes, was upgraded to a series regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/supernatural-exec-we-8522.aspx |title=Supernatural Exec: "We Won't Be One Tree Hill with Monsters!" |date=July 21, 2007 |work=TV Guide |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katie Cassidy]] and [[Lauren Cohan]] were eventually cast as Ruby and Bela, respectively, though they originally auditioned for the others' role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=42554 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114073550/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=42554 |archivedate=January 14, 2008 |title=''Supernatural'' Welcomes New Girls |date=July 23, 2007 |publisher=SCI FI Wire |first=Cindy |last=White |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though only making six appearances each in the third season, both actresses were credited as co-stars for their episodes.

Wanting to bring in [[Christian mythology]] to the series, the writers created the angel [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/misha_collins_is_supernaturals_dark_angel-2008-11 |title=Misha Collins Is 'Supernatural's' Dark Angel |last=O'Hare |first=Kate |date=November 18, 2008 |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Kripke wanting to keep the introduction of an angel a secret, the character was instead described as a demon during auditions.&lt;ref name="buddy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/exclusive-interview-misha-coll-23092.aspx |first=Don |last=Williams |title=Exclusive Interview: Misha Collins of 'Supernatural' |date=September 25, 2008 |publisher=[[BuddyTV]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Misha Collins]] was cast as the character. Making his debut in the fourth-season premiere, Castiel resurrects Dean from Hell after his death in the third season, and comes to be an ally of the Winchesters. The character was originally intended for only a six-episode story arc, but the role was later expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/three-questions-with-supernaturals-misha-collins.html |title=Three Questions With Supernatural's Misha Collins |publisher=UGO.com |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins was promoted to a series regular for the fifth and sixth season, something Collins believes to be mainly due to fan support.&lt;ref name="eagle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=117537 |title='Supernatural' actor Misha Collins is the new angel on the block |last=Spelling |first=Ian |date=December 14, 2008 |publisher=ReadingEagle.com |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins was downgraded to recurring status for the seventh and eighth seasons, but returned to series regular status for seasons nine and ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2014/05/09/supernatural-season-10-misha-collins-series-regular/ |title=Supernatural: Misha Collins to Return as Series Regular for Season 10 |publisher=TVLine |first=Vlada |last=Gelman |date=May 9, 2014 |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Castiel came other angelic characters, with [[Robert Wisdom]] portraying the "militant" and "dogmatic"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=117537 |title='Supernatural' actor Misha Collins is the new angel on the block |date=December 14, 2008 |work=The New York Times Syndicate |first=Ian |last=Spelling |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uriel (Supernatural)|Uriel]], who secretly supports Lucifer; [[Julie McNiven]] playing the fallen angel [[Anna Milton]], who eventually regains her angelic form but remains an outcast of Heaven; and [[Kurt Fuller]] as Castiel's boss [[Zachariah (Supernatural)|Zachariah]], who wishes to start the Apocalypse in order to bring Paradise to Earth. Though Wisdom's character is eventually killed, McNiven and Fuller continue their roles into the fifth season and are joined by [[Mark Pellegrino]] as the recently released but fallen archangel [[Lucifer (Supernatural)|Lucifer]]. Pellegrino also appears as Lucifer as a hallucination in Sam's head in season 7. Pellegrino had been the second choice for the role of Castiel&lt;ref name="luciferpell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/comic-con-2009-the-apocalypse-30303.aspx |title=Comic-Con 2009: The Apocalypse of 'Supernatural' Season 5 |date=July 27, 2009 |publisher=BuddyTV |first=Christi |last=Kassity |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was offered the role of Lucifer without an audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/supernatural-returns-to-haunt-comic-con |title='Supernatural' returns to haunt Comic-Con |date=July 26, 2009 |publisher=HitFix |first=Tamara |last=Brooks |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further on, Fuller's and McNiven's characters were also killed along with both Harvelle characters.

Season 5 introduces the demon Crowley, played by [[Mark Sheppard]], who would become the Winchester's longest-recurring antagonist and occasional anti-hero in the series. Crowley appears in three episodes of season 5 to help the Winchesters seal Lucifer back in the Cage, believing that once he destroys humanity he will target all demonkind next. In season 6, Crowley becomes the King of Hell and one of the main antagonists working with Castiel to stop Archangel Raphael, the other main antagonist of season 6, from restarting the Apocalypse by harnessing the souls of Purgatory and splitting the power with Castiel. In season 7, Crowley becomes an anti-hero who helps the Winchesters against the threat of Leviathans led by Dick Roman, after they are released from Purgatory by Castiel. Crowley becomes the main antagonist of season 8, attempting to harness the Words of God and their powers and stop the Winchesters from sealing Hell forever. In season 9, Crowley becomes an unwilling prisoner of the Winchesters but is forced to deal with Abaddon trying to steal his position as King of Hell. Sheppard was promoted to series regular status for season 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/supernatural-season-10-mark-sheppard-series-regular-1201190067 |title=Supernatural’ Season 10: Mark Sheppard Promoted to Series Regular |date=May 23, 2014 |work=Variety |first=Laura |last=Prudom |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 7 introduces Kevin Tran the prophet (played by [[Osric Chau]]), who translates the word of God to help the Winchesters stop the Leviathans which leads to their destruction. In season 8, Kevin works to translate another word of God to find the means of sealing Hell forever. In season 9, Kevin instead tries to find the means of returning the fallen angels to Heaven but is killed by a Gadreel-possessed Sam.

Also introduced in Season 7 is [[Charlie Bradbury]], a tech-savvy geek (played by [[Felicia Day]]) who works at Richard Roman Enterprises. After hacking into Frank's hard drive and learning about the existence of monsters, Charlie becomes an ally of the Winchesters and occasionally helps them out with technical problems and hunts.

Season 9 introduces the angel Gadreel, who originally poses as Ezekiel, played by [[Tahmoh Penikett]] and Padalecki. After Sam is seriously injured when he decides not to seal Hell, Gadreel comes to Dean in response to his prayer for help, possesses Sam to heal him, and becomes Dean's ally. However, Gadreel's true identity is later revealed by Metatron to be the guardian who had allowed Lucifer into the Garden of Eden and was imprisoned until the fall. Gadreel then allies with Metatron in an attempt to redeem himself and lead the angels back to Heaven. He kills Kevin Tran and is later expelled from Sam and possesses his original vessel again. However, after Metatron begins sacrificing angels for his plans, Gadreel becomes regretful and joins Sam, Dean and Castiel.

Because the show focuses mainly on the two Winchester brothers, the writers realized that viewers would know that the characters are not in danger of being permanently killed. To fix this, the staff often writes in guest characters to give tension to the episode, occasionally having them die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/arts/television/22aurt.html |title=Things That Go Bump in Prime Time |date=January 22, 2006 |work=The New York Times |first=Kate |last=Aurthur |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season 1 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 1)}}

The first season consists of 22 episodes that premiered on September 13, 2005, and concluded on May 4, 2006. The first 16 episodes aired on Tuesdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/tv/supernatural/1 |title=Supernatural: Season 1 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their mother's death in a suspicious fire that burns down their house 22 years prior, Sam and Dean Winchester's father goes missing during a "hunting trip". As a result, Dean tracks down Sam at [[Stanford University]] and they begin to live a life on the road, in Dean's black, [[Chevrolet Impala (fourth generation)|1967 Chevrolet Impala]] with [[Kansas]] license plates. However, their father is not a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like [[ghost]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[spirit]]s, and has trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They also find another man with abilities similar to Sam's, whose mother died the same way. They reach out to the young man, Max Miller, offering help and seeking answers. But Max has experienced years of physical abuse and neglect and his life ends in a [[murder suicide]] which Dean and Sam are unable to stop. They eventually find and reunite with their father, who reveals that the creature that killed their mother years earlier is the demon Azazel (aka "Yellow Eyes") and the only thing that can kill him is a [[The Colt (Supernatural)#The Colt|legendary gun]] created by [[Samuel Colt]]. It is revealed that Azazel, on a baby's six-month birthday, would bleed into their mouth and kill the moms when they walk in. This is what gave Sam and Max their powers. The season ends with the brothers and their father involved in a car crash when a truck hits the side of the Impala. They lie inside the car, covered in blood and unconscious.

=== Season 2 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 2)}}

The second season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning September 28, 2006, and ending May 17, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/tv/supernatural/2 |title=Supernatural: Season 2 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season follows Sam and Dean as they deal with their father's death, who, after the car crash, traded Azazel his life for Dean's. Sam and Dean continue to hunt Azazel, who caused the fires that led to the deaths of their mother, and later, Sam's girlfriend, Jessica. They receive assistance from new allies Bobby, Ellen, Jo, and Ash. Part of Azazel's master plan is eventually revealed as he gathers Sam and others with similar psychic abilities to fight each other, leading to Sam's death. Dean makes a deal with a [[Crossroads (mythology)|crossroads]] demon to bring Sam back in exchange for his soul, which will be collected in one year and taken to Hell. Azazel opens a portal to Hell, and as hundreds of demons and souls escape, has a final confrontation with the Winchesters. With the help of the spirit of John Winchester, who escaped Hell through the portal, Dean finally kills Azazel and the portal is closed. The Winchester brothers and their allies are left to deal with the demon army that has been unleashed and the one-year contract Dean has before he goes to Hell.

=== Season 3 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 3)}}
The third season consists of 16 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning October 4, 2007, and ending May 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/tv/supernatural/3 |title=Supernatural: Season 3 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally 22 episodes were ordered for the third season, but production was halted on December 5, 2007, upon completion of the twelfth episode by the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]]. The season number was shortened to sixteen episodes, with four new episodes airing in April and May 2008.&lt;ref name="EW4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20185232_13,00.html |title=Spring TV preview: Inside 26 shows |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=March 27, 2008 |last=Stack |first=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season focuses on trying to save Dean from his deal and tracking down the demons that were released from hell. Along the way, the brothers meet [[Ruby (Supernatural)|Ruby]], a "good" demon, who has an interest in Sam and claims to be able to help save Dean. Also, they meet [[Bela Talbot]], an acquirer and seller of occult objects, who becomes a thorn in their side. The brothers learn from Bela which demon holds Dean's contract: a powerful demon named [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]]. Lilith is the very first demon ever made, with her soul being twisted by Lucifer himself in a spite against God for kicking him out. Lilith takes Bela's soul after her contract expires, but not before she warns Sam and Dean. The brothers, along with Ruby, track Lilith down and attempt to kill her. Lilith is unable to stop Sam on account of his mysterious abilities; however, Dean's contract expires and his soul is taken to Hell.

=== Season 4 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 4)}}
The fourth season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning September 18, 2008, and ending May 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/tv/supernatural/4 |title=Supernatural: Season 4 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean is rescued from Hell and brought back by an angel of the Lord named [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]]. The rest of the season follows the brothers as they work with Castiel to stop Lilith's plan of breaking the [[Seven Seals|66 seals]], which would allow the fallen archangel Lucifer, AKA "the Devil" or "Satan himself", to walk the Earth free once again. Sam and Dean's relationshing is strained and Sam starts siding with Ruby over Dean. He begins to give into his demonic side by drinking demon blood to become strong enough to defeat Lilith. He and Dean have a falling-out. Sam sides with Ruby in his obsessive quest to kill Lilith. Dean makes a deal with the angels to save Sam, and learns that the angels want the Apocalypse to occur in order to rebuild Paradise on Earth. With aid from Castiel, Dean escapes and tries to stop Sam after learning that Lilith is, in fact, the last seal, but Sam kills her anyway, breaking open Lucifer's prison. Ruby reveals her true colors as a demon loyal to Lucifer and Dean kills her. As the season ends, Lucifer's cage opens and he escapes from Hell.

=== Season 5 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 5)}}
The fifth season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning September 10, 2009, and ending May 13, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/tv/supernatural/5 |title=Supernatural: Season 5 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This season was rumored to be the last season, because Eric Kripke had said previously that he planned the show to run for only five seasons.&lt;ref name="highnote" /&gt; Despite this, Padalecki and Ackles had contracts for a sixth season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/jensen-and-jared-definitely-in-29055.aspx |title=Jensen and Jared Definitely in for a Likely 'Supernatural' Season 6 |date=June 1, 2009 |publisher=BuddyTV |first=John |last=Kubicek |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The CW renewed it for season six on February 16, 2010.&lt;ref name="renew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/the_cw_renews_top_model_vampire_diaries_supernatural_gossip_girl_90210-2010-02 |title=The CW renews 'Top Model,' 'Vampire Diaries,' 'Supernatural,' 'Gossip Girl,' '90210' |publisher=Zap2it |first=Korbi |last=Ghosh |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth season revolves around the fight to stop Lucifer and save the world from the Apocalypse, inspired by events in the Book of Revelation. Throughout the season, while Castiel searches for God, Sam and Dean battle both angels and demons as they fight their destiny to become the vessels of Lucifer and Michael, respectively. They attempt to stop Lucifer by retrieving the Colt from the demon [[Crowley (Supernatural)|Crowley]] and attempting to kill Lucifer with it. This fails as Lucifer can't be killed by the Colt, and they lose fellow hunters and friends Jo and Ellen in the process. Unable to defeat Lucifer, Sam and Dean, with information from the Trickster, revealed to be the archangel Gabriel, and with help from the demon Crowley, decided to collect the rings of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], including Death, which act as the key to Lucifer's prison. In the end, Sam allows Lucifer to possess him and he kills Bobby and Castiel, who is now human. Sam then manages to regain control, thanks to his bond with Dean, and throws himself (while possessed by Lucifer) and Adam (possessed by Michael) into the Cage to trap Lucifer once more. Castiel is resurrected by God and, more powerful than ever, resurrects Bobby and then returns to Heaven to restore order. Dean returns to his old girlfriend Lisa to live a normal life. Sam is next shown mysteriously free of the Cage, watching his brother eating dinner in the house with Lisa and her son Ben.

=== Season 6 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 6)}}
The sixth season consists of 22 episodes that aired on Fridays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning September 24, 2010, and ending May 20, 2011. Beginning with this season, Kripke did not return as showrunner, but still remained as a hands-on executive producer, leaving executive producer Sera Gamble to take over the reins.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/17/supernatural-renewed-for-season-6 |title=Supernatural Renewed for Season 6 |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth season begins a year after the conclusion of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind and work with his resurrected grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha monsters for Crowley. The brothers are unable to get much help from Castiel since his time is occupied by a civil war raging in heaven against the archangel [[Characters of Supernatural#Raphael|Raphael]]. Dean does not trust Samuel and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean discovers that Sam's soul is still in the Cage, so he implores the [[Pale horse (Bible)|Horseman Death]] to retrieve it. To ensure Sam does not remember his time in the Cage, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The season's second half revolves around the so-called Mother of All, which ultimately leads to events which prove that Castiel is behind the circumstances of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory and was working with Crowley the entire time. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of the Cage back and proceeds with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God, having ascended beyond a mere angel.

=== Season 7 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 7)}}
The seventh season consists of 23 episodes that aired on Fridays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning September 23, 2011, and ending May 18, 2012.

After absorbing souls from Purgatory and declaring himself God, Castiel begins to punish all the wrongdoers in the world. He discovers that he absorbed [[Leviathan in popular culture#Film and TV|the Leviathans]], who are attempting to break free of his vessel. Sam and Dean manage to return most of the souls to Purgatory but fail to return the Leviathans, who seemingly kill Castiel before vanishing and inhabiting the bodies of many different people around the world. Sam and Dean learn that their weakness is Sodium Borate (also known as [[Borax]]), though it has minimum effectiveness on the Leviathan leader Dick Roman. After Roman kills Bobby, Dean becomes obsessed with taking the Leviathans down and learns of a facility they are building, only to discover that it is a facility to cure cancer. The spirit of Bobby later confirms that while they are curing disease, they are doing it as part of their plan to turn humanity into the perfect food source. With Castiel and Kevin's help, the brothers learn that the only way to kill the Leviathans is with the "bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen" and set out to find the three bloods. Kevin can read the word of God and helps Sam and Dean decipher it to stop the Leviathans. Eventually, Dean and Castiel kill Dick but are dragged into Purgatory as a result, while Sam is left alone to deal with Crowley, who plans to rise to power now that the Leviathans are disorganized.

Key plot points presented in the season were Sam struggling with the constant hallucinations of Lucifer and the ghost of Bobby "haunting" Sam and Dean through his alcohol flask. Bobby's rage toward Dick Roman slowly causes him to become a [[vengeful spirit]], and Sam and Dean ultimately deal with this by burning the flask at his request, thus destroying Bobby.

=== Season 8 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 8)}}
The eighth season consists of 23 episodes that aired on Wednesdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning October 3, 2012, and ending May 15, 2013.

One year after being dragged to Purgatory, Dean returns to Earth without Castiel, carrying inside his body the soul of a vampire named Benny. The two brothers begin a fight against Crowley to find the Demon Tablet and lock the Gates of Hell, thereby trapping all demons in Hell. The brothers use Kevin Tran to help them read the tablet and accomplish this. Castiel is brought back by an angel named Naomi, and takes possession of the Angel Tablet to break her control of him when she tries to use him to kill Dean. While Kevin works on the tablet, Sam and Dean have an unexpected encounter with their paternal grandfather, Henry Winchester, who was a member of the Men of Letters, an organization dedicated to gathering supernatural knowledge; his disappearance in 1958 was actually him using a time-travel spell to go to the future and escape an attack by the demon Abaddon. Henry is killed protecting his grandsons, but he provides them with access to the Men of Letters bunker, a storehouse for several supernatural artefacts and books, which the Winchesters subsequently adopt as a new 'home'. Kevin translates three trials that must be completed in order to lock the Gates of Hell for good, but although Sam completed the first two, Dean ends the trials before the third can be finished as completing the trials would kill Sam. Unfortunately, Castiel is tricked by the Angel Metatron into completing a series of trials that would have allegedly locked all angels in Heaven, but actually banished every angel apart from Metatron to Earth, the season ending with millions of angels falling from the sky and Castiel stripped of his Grace.

=== Season 9 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 9)}}
The ninth season consists of 23 episodes that aired on Tuesdays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm beginning October 8, 2013, and ending May 20, 2014.

In the first half of the ninth season, the angels have fallen to Earth and two angel factions are warring against each other while hunting Castiel. Rogue angels roam the Earth causing trouble. Castiel is now human and has to adjust to his new life while Crowley is held prisoner by Sam and Dean who are trying to use an old blood ritual to turn demon Crowley back into a human. Sam is left near-death from the Trials of God and Dean is forced to let an angel, claiming to be Ezekiel, possess Sam to heal him from the inside. Dean must hide Ezekiel's presence from Sam so that he won't expel him and die while also keeping Castiel away at Ezekiel's demand. The brothers search for a way to return the angels to Heaven. Eventually it is revealed that Ezekiel is actually [[Gadreel]], the angel who let Lucifer into the Garden of Eden. Gadreel murders Kevin Tran and escapes, while Castiel regains his powers. With Crowley's help, Sam expels Gadreel, but the experience causes Sam and Dean to split up while letting Crowley go as part of the deal Dean made for him to save Sam.

In the second half, Dean begins searching for both Gadreel for revenge and the First Blade to kill Abaddon with the help of Crowley. Despite being warned of terrible repercussions, Dean takes on the Mark of Cain in order to be able to wield the First Blade. After healing Sam completely, Castiel begins a search of his own for Metatron, believing him to be the key to reversing the expulsion of the angels. Metatron begins trying to unite all the angels under his rule while Castiel leads other angels against him to retake Heaven. Eventually Dean kills Abaddon and Castiel defeats Metatron with the help of a repentant Gadreel, but Metatron kills Dean, causing Dean to become a demon due to the influence of the [[Curse and mark of Cain#Mark of Cain|Mark of Cain]].

=== Season 10 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 10)}}
In the tenth season, after being resurrected by the Mark of Cain, Dean is now a demon, working alongside Crowley. Meanwhile, Sam continues to search for Dean. After Dean refuses to follow Crowley's order and embarrasses him in front of his demon followers, Crowley gives Sam his brother's location. For giving up Dean, Sam gives Crowley the First Blade. Later, Sam, with the help of Castiel, cures Dean by using sanctified human blood. After being cured, Dean is reminded by Castiel that the Mark of Cain is still a problem. Dean and Sam help Castiel track down his vessel's (Jimmy's) daughter, Claire. Dean ends up slaughtering several men who are keeping her captive and loses control of the Mark, a nightmare he previously had.

Meanwhile, a mysterious new witch comes into play, being revealed to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the ''Book of the Damned''. Sam needs help in reading and using the tome, and turns to Rowena for help. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is for the good of the world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the ''Book of the Damned''.

=== Season 11 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 11)}}
In the eleventh season, Sam and Dean deal with the release of Amara/The Darkness, after Rowena's spell removed the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm. While Crowley's taking care of Amara, feeding her with souls, the brothers are, alongside Castiel, trying to find a way to kill The Darkness. In order to find out more about Amara, Castiel asks Metatron for help, and he says that in order to create the world, God had to sacrifice His sister, The Darkness. To face the most dangerous creature they've crossed paths with so far, the brothers ask for Lucifer's help. Lucifer claims he's the only one that can beat Amara, but in order to do so, he needs to possess Sam's body. When Sam refuses, Lucifer tries to kill Dean, Sam, and Castiel, but Rowena's spell seems to have sent him away. Later, it's revealed that Castiel said "yes" at the last second, and that Lucifer is now possessing his body. 

When nothing works to get rid of The Darkness, Amara claims that God must appear Himself to see her destroying everything He created and loves. Then, she decides to draw out God by torturing an archangel, making Lucifer/Castiel scream in agony. Meanwhile, Chuck returns and reveals himself to Metatron, telling him He is God. Then, He reveals Himself to The Winchesters and they all decide to seal Amara. Rowena, who had cast a spell that made her immortal, helps them with a spell, while Crowley and Lucifer use the demons and angels in a combined attack against Amara. When Chuck tried to seal Amara, she resisted, stopping the Winchesters, apparently killing Lucifer and gravely wounding Chuck. Amara warns that Chuck is not dead yet because he is going to watch her destroy everything ever created.

As a result of Chuck's injuries, the sun is now dying and the world along with it. Realizing that the only chance for the world to survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, the Winchesters begin gathering ghosts to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness. With the help of Billie the Reaper, they are able to get the needed souls which are inserted into Dean. Chuck sends Dean to Amara who has started to regret her actions and Dean convinces Amara that revenge is not worth it. Amara and Chuck reconcile and Amara heals Chuck of the damage she did to him. The two then leave the Earth, but not before Amara tells Dean she is going to give him what he wants most for helping her. At the bunker, Castiel is banished by a woman who identifies herself as Lady Antonia Bevell of the London chapter of the Men of Letters. Antonia tells Sam the Men of Letters have sent her to bring Sam in for punishment for his actions and fires her gun, apparently at Sam as he tries to talk her down. Making his way through the woods, Dean finds his resurrected mother.

=== Season 12 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 12)}}
The twelfth season premiered on October 13, 2016, and concluded on May 18, 2017, consisting of 23 episodes.

Dean meets his mother for the first time in 30 years after Amara sends him the gift which he wanted most. Sam has been captured by Lady Bevell and is being tortured as punishment for his past sins. Dean convinces Mary that he is her son and thereafter discovers that Sam has been captured. Dean, Mary and Castiel devise a plan to rescue Sam. Lucifer has been possessing numerous vessels in his quest to find one that is suitable for him. He finally possesses Vince Vincete, a veteran rock star, and kills Rowena in the process. After a concert where Lucifer plans to destroy all those who attend, his vessel disintegrates before he is able to make the President of the United States his vessel. Sam and Dean try to warn the president, but are presumed to be assassins who are trying to kill the president and are thereby detained at an unknown center. They both fake being dead in order to escape and are reunited with Castiel and Mary. Mary begins to work with Mr Arthur Ketch of the Men of Letters in order to get back into hunting. Mary tricks the brothers into stealing the Colt from one of the four princes of hell Ramiel.

After Mick Davies is killed the brothers acknowledge that the Men of Letters have gone rogue. Meanwhile, the president has made his assistant Kelly Kline pregnant and Castiel realizes that a [[Nephilim]] is to be born. Sam, Dean and Castiel try convince Kelly about the impending danger. While Lucifer has been captured and being tortured by Crowley. Sam and a few hunters gather to defeat the Men of Letters while Castiel retrieves Kelly after killing Dagon. Lucifer is released by Crowley's minion demon and heads on to find his son. In the finale Kelly gives birth to the Nephilim, while Crowley sacrifices himself to kill Lucifer. Crowley and Castiel die trying to kill Lucifer while Mary and Lucifer are pulled into the rift created by the Nephilim's birth. Dean kneels down in despair after witnessing Castiel being killed while Sam is shocked when he arrives to see Jack the Nephilim grown into a teenager.

=== Season 13 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 13)}}
The thirteenth season premiered on October 12, 2017, and concluded on May 17, 2018, consisting of 23 episodes.

Dean and Sam are left reeling from the loss of so many allies and family members and their new responsibility to 'raise' Jack, with Sam willing to give the boy a chance while Dean is immediately concerned due to his heritage. In the other world, Lucifer keeps Mary alive as a hostage to trade for his son when he returns home, but finds himself confronted by the alternate Michael, who has killed his Lucifer and won the war. Although Dean becomes increasingly bitter at their recent losses, he gains a new sense of hope when Jack unintentionally brings Castiel back to life. Things become complicated when Men of Letters Arthur Ketch is revealed to have escaped death through a spell he received from Rowena, Ketch taking Castiel and a weakened Lucifer prisoner after Lucifer escapes back into this world when Michael tries to use his grace to create a portal so that he can conquer the other reality.

While the Winchesters' efforts to return to the other world to rescue Mary fail, Ketch is revealed to be working with Asmodeus, who reveals in turn that the source of his power is Gabriel, who actually faked his death during his confrontation with Lucifer but was sold to Asmodeus by the children of the real Loki. After their first attempt to enter the other world traps Jack in that reality, the Winchesters retrieve the demon tablet, a translation of it reveals the ingredients needed to open a portal to the other world. As Jack sides with Mary and the humans against the angels, the Winchesters and Castiel gather the ingredients for the spell to open the portal while Lucifer tries to re-establish himself as king of Heaven in the absence of God and other archangels. After Ketch rescues Gabriel, allowing the Winchesters to use his grace as part of the spell, the initial raid on the other world fails to achieve more than Dean rescuing the alternate version of his deceased friend Charlie Bradbury, but Gabriel flees in fear after an attack on the bunker by Asmodeus. With Heaven in desperate straits after Lucifer fails to hold the angels together, Castiel is charged with finding Gabriel while the last ten angels try to keep Heaven in order, leaving the Winchesters to mount a new assault on the other world with Gabriel and Lucifer. They are able to rescue a range of human survivors from the other world, including the alternate versions of Bobby and Charlie, but Gabriel is killed in the process and Lucifer and the alternate Michael follow them through.

As Lucifer takes Jack's power for himself, Dean is forced to make a deal to act as the vessel for the alternate Michael to stop him. Dean is able to stay in control long enough to kill Lucifer, but the season ends with Michael taking control of Dean's body and departing.

=== Season 14 ===
{{Main|Supernatural (season 14)}}
The fourteenth season premiered on October 11, 2018, and will consist of 20 episodes.

== Recurring elements ==

=== Impala ===
Throughout the series, Dean drives a black 1967 [[Chevrolet Impala]] which he refers to as "Baby." Having been passed down to him by his father (John), it is Dean's most prized possession, with actor Jensen Ackles feeling it is Dean's "life" and "sanctuary".&lt;ref name="p142"&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.142&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers travel in it throughout the country as they hunt the supernatural, and the trunk holds various weaponry and their fake IDs. In the first two seasons, it has a Kansas license plate with the number KAZ 2Y5, a reference to the Winchesters' home state of Kansas, and the series premiere date of 2005.&lt;ref name="p142" /&gt; Towards the end of the second season, the car sports a new [[Ohio]] license plate (CNK 80Q3) to aid the brothers in hiding from the [[FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 2 Companion), p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the Impala were first depicted in the comic mini-series ''Supernatural: Origins'', in which John Winchester takes ownership of the car from Mary's uncle after accidentally getting him killed during a hunt. However, fans responded negatively to this, as John is shown with the Impala in the teaser for the pilot episode, which is chronologically set before the comic series. Because of this, the comic was altered for the trade paperback version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvoftheabsurd.com/2007/12/07/supernatural-revelations-an-exclusive-interview-with-peter-johnson/ |title=Supernatural Revelations: An Exclusive Interview with Peter Johnson |date=December 7, 2007 |publisher=TV of the Absurd |first=Cynthia |last=Boris |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Impala's true origins later being depicted in the series' fourth season. Having been sent back to 1973 by the angel [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]], Dean convinces his father to purchase the Impala over a 1964 VW Van. The car's origins were further explored during the season five finale, in which a [[frame story]] surrounded the plot of the episode tracking the Impala's history from its manufacture, through several previous owners, up until the present day. According to Chuck Shurley, the brothers have "made it their own", and they are shown as kids sticking an army man into an ash tray that remains there (Sam), putting blocks into the heating vents (Dean) and carving their initials into the car. The Impala later proves important when seeing the old army man allows Sam to overpower Lucifer during the final confrontation. According to Chuck, as they have the Impala, the Winchesters never consider themselves truly homeless. In the seventh season, after two Leviathans go on a killing spree in an identical Impala, Sam and Dean are forced to put the car into storage and use various other cars as they are too identifiable with the Impala. Dean later pulls it out of storage to confront Dick and has the demon Meg crash it into Sucrocorp to create a distraction. Starting in season 8, Sam and Dean are once again using the Impala as their car. The Impala was stolen by the angel Gadreel while possessing Sam, once again forcing Dean to use a stolen car, but it was quickly recovered and proved instrumental in tracking down the rogue angel.

All of the cars used in the show are stock 1967 Chevrolet Impala four door [[hardtop]]s. They feature Chevrolet small-block engines, recolored interiors, custom seats, and nonfunctioning radios. Other than the one used in the original, all of the Impalas had to be painted black for the series. One of the Impalas used features a detachable roof and doors for up-close shots, and is capable of being separated in half.&lt;ref name="impaladvd"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Jeff Budnick, John Lange, Darren Allan |title=Supernatural Season 3 – Impala Featurette |medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trouble with the law ===
Because Dean and Sam do not get paid for their hunting, the brothers earn their living and pay for their hunting equipment through [[credit card fraud]], poker winnings, and [[pool hustling]]. Furthermore, their investigations often put them on the wrong side of the law, as they have desecrated graves, impersonated various officials, and committed breaking and entering. Framed for murder and bank robbery by [[shapeshifter]]s, Dean has become a highly wanted man, and the brothers are occasionally pursued by various law enforcement officers, most notably FBI agent Victor Henricksen. Because of their wanted status, the brothers often use aliases, usually derived from hard rock musicians, film references, or a meta-reference. However, in the third season's mid-season finale episode "Jus in Bello", Sam and Dean are presumed dead in the explosion of the [[Monument, Colorado]] Sheriff's county jail, effectively ending the FBI's pursuit of them. By the seventh season, however, the FBI are in pursuit of the brothers again, believing them to be mass-murderers (while the murders were actually committed by Leviathans impersonating the Winchesters). However, with the help of a sheriff who learns the truth and the bodies of their doppelgangers, they are able to fake their deaths again, but have to lie low to prevent discovery, abandoning the Impala, taking on new aliases and using stolen cars to get around. By season 8, the threat of discovery seems to blow over as Sam and Dean return to using the Impala and their rock band aliases which they had been warned made them easy to find. Notably in "Ask Jeeves" in season 10, they use their real names and even though a detective is investigating a murder, he doesn't recognize them from "their" previous crime sprees.

=== The Colt ===
[[File:Supernatural TheColt.png|thumb|right|The Colt with thirteen original bullets]]
The 1836 [[Colt Paterson]] revolver,&lt;ref name="p137" /&gt; usually referred to simply as "the Colt", was made by [[Samuel Colt (Supernatural)|Samuel Colt]], a paranormal hunter. According to legend, anything shot by this gun, using one of its thirteen original bullets, will die, including creatures normally immune to any and all weapons.

John Winchester gives it to the demon Azazel in return for Dean's life being spared after a near-fatal car crash. At the end of the second season, Azazel uses the Colt as the key to open one of the Gates to Hell that Samuel Colt had sealed. The last bullet is then used to kill Azazel, though the gun is later altered to allow the use of more bullets. Towards the end of the third season, Lilith's right-hand demon, Crowley, acquires the gun and hides it. It is then featured in two time-travel episodes – Dean using a past version of it when he is sent back to 1973, and his future self discovering it when Dean is sent five years into the future – before Crowley returns it to the Winchesters so they can kill Lucifer. However, after Dean shoots Lucifer in the head at point-blank range, an unharmed Lucifer boasts there are five things in creation which the gun cannot kill, and he is one of them. The Colt is subsequently lost and absent for several years until Mary Winchester retrieves it back from a Prince of Hell, Ramiel.

It is later revealed due to a [[causal loop]], the Colt went in the possession of Daniel Elkins, the owner of the gun at the beginning of the series, due to the actions of the Winchesters. When the Winchesters travel to 1861, they meet Samuel Colt, from whom Sam gets the Colt, and Dean uses it to kill a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], as they need its ashes. Dean drops the Colt just before being transported back to the present day, where it is presumably retrieved by the saloon owner Elkins, the ancestor of Daniel Elkins.

The gun used in the series is actually a replica Paterson modified to fire [[cartridge (firearms)|metallic cartridges]].&lt;ref name="p137"&gt;Knight, Nicholas. Season 3 Companion, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The gun was described as being built in 1835, before Colt made firearms, and fires metallic cartridges which were never made to fire in a Colt revolver until 10&amp;nbsp;years after Samuel Colt's death. On the barrel of the gun is inscribed the Latin phrase ''non-timebo mala'', meaning "I will fear no evil".&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Nicholas. Season 1 Companion, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; On the grip is a carving of a [[pentagram]], with much of the finish removed to give it an aged appearance.&lt;ref name="p137" /&gt; The prop department also has a rubber version of the Colt to be used in fight scenes for [[pistol-whipping]].&lt;ref name="impaladvd" /&gt;

=== Ruby's knife ===
Ruby possesses a mysterious and presumably magical demon-killing knife, which Kripke refers to as "a hand-to-hand version of the Colt".&lt;ref name="p22"&gt;Knight, Nicholas, (Season 3 Companion), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Its handle is made of elk antlers, and the knife has engravings on both sides of the blade, although the symbols are all nonsensical.&lt;ref name="p22" /&gt; It has been seen and used many times following its introduction in the third season. Upon being stabbed in a vital area, the demon is almost immediately killed, usually taking the human host with it. The only known survivor is [[Bobby Singer]] who stabbed himself with it while fighting off a possession and was left paralyzed as a result. It is unknown if it is effective against other supernatural beings, although it is useless against angels. Furthermore, the higher-ranked demons are resistant or even immune to the effects of the knife. Creator Eric Kripke doubted that how the knife functions would ever be revealed, stating, "I like to leave some things mysterious. And that's likely to remain mysterious."&lt;ref name="askaus" /&gt; However, the eighth season reveals it to be "an ancient demon-killing knife of the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]]".

=== Word of God Tablets ===
Sometime in the distant past, God dictated the angel scribe Metatron to write a compendium of tablets known as the Word of God. They cover a variety of subjects, including demons, angels, and leviathans. God then sealed the tablets inside the "Vault of the Earth" and even if someone were to find them, only a few chosen humans, the prophets, are able to decipher them. The Leviathan Tablet, which was dug from somewhere in [[Iran]], has an instruction regarding how to kill a leviathan. The Demon Tablet, recovered by Crowley through unknown means, contains an instruction about locking all demons in Hell forever as well as techniques about disposing demons, such as devil's traps, holy water, and demon bombs. The Angel Tablet, stored in one of Lucifer's crypts, has the information on how to make all angels fall from Heaven as well as an incantation to imbue an angel with great power. The Demon Tablet is currently in the possession of Castiel, who has destroyed the Angel Tablet in the ninth season to prevent Metatron from using its powers.

=== Men of Letters ===
For centuries, supernatural activity on Earth was logged and observed by the Men of Letters, a secret society dedicated to gathering knowledge and artefacts, occasionally working with elite teams of hunters to eliminate particularly dangerous supernatural threats. This tradition came to an end when Henry Winchester, attending his final initiation rite in 1958, became the sole survivor of the organization when it was attacked by the demon Abaddon, forcing Henry to attempt a desperate escape by using a spell to take himself to 2013, where he met Dean and Sam. Although Henry is killed in the subsequent battle with Abaddon, he is able to pass on information about the Men of Letters to his grandsons, who track down the Men of Letters' secret bunker, which stores all the knowledge and artefacts that the society had gathered over the centuries. After this, Dean and Sam adopt the bunker as a 'home', residing in the bunker when between cases and using its books to carry out further research. They experience an unexpected challenge when the British Men of Letters come to America to try and take control of the local hunters, perceiving the Winchesters as too dangerous, but the Winchesters and a small army of hunters are able to force the British Men of Letters to withdraw after Dean and Sam confirm that the British branch are too brutal for their tastes, such as attempting to immediately kill new werewolf Claire Novak where the Winchesters would prefer to cure if possible, or killing hunter Eileen Leehy just because she accidentally killed a Man of Letters rather than accept that it was an accident.

=== Mark of Cain and the First Blade ===
After God and the archangels successfully battled the Darkness to submission at the beginning of creation, God sealed the latter inside a metaphysical cage, whose seal was handed over to Lucifer for safekeeping. However, the Darkness' influence was as such that Lucifer was corrupted by it, eventually becoming the first fallen angel after refusing to honor humans. Lucifer then offered the seal to Cain, which empowered a blade made from the jawbone of a donkey that he used to kill and send his brother, Abel, to Heaven. Whenceforth, the seal was known by the moniker of the Mark of Cain, while the blade was dubbed the First Blade. Wielders of the Mark are corrupted by the Darkness so they would have the lust for power and bloodbath. This power in turn activates the First Blade, otherwise useless when wielded by other people, to become an invincible weapon capable of killing everything, even angels and higher demons. If killed, wielders of the Mark are resurrected as demons, as shown by Dean in the finale of the ninth season. At the start of the series, Cain had thrown the First Blade to the bottom of the [[Marianas Trench]], only to take it back and give it as well as the Mark to Dean as part of the latter's quest to kill Abaddon. However, this gives Dean the attendant problems of the Mark, which slowly corrupts him, as releasing the Mark requires an arduous ritual, and if not transferred to someone else would release the Darkness from her cage.

=== Promotion and tie-ins ===
The advertisements The WB chose for the show went beyond just commercials and billboards. Before the series debuted, the network placed signs for the show at gas station pumps, and gave out rubber glow-in-the-dark bracelets at New York and Los Angeles movie theaters.&lt;ref name="promotion" /&gt; Also, coffee cup sleeves revealed the image of a "terrified woman seemingly pinned to a ceiling" when heated&lt;ref name="promotion2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/19/business/fi-tvbuzz19 |title=TV Networks Pursue the 'Super Fan' |date=September 19, 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Meg |last=James |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; were distributed to 500 cafes throughout New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="promotion" /&gt; The same image was used in special mirrors the network installed in almost 200 nightclubs throughout three cities in order to reach "young, hip horror fans".&lt;ref name="promotion2" /&gt; Additional advertisements were also placed in bars, movie theaters, and video game stores, with hundreds of the bars also receiving ''Supernatural'' napkins and coasters.&lt;ref name="promotion" /&gt;

The series also has many real-life tie-ins. The urban legend website [http://www.hellhoundslair.com/ ''Hellhounds Lair''] featured in the season one episode "Hell House" was a real website set up by the show's producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvfodder.com/supernatural/archives/2006/10/supernatural_hellhounds_lair_c.shtml |title=Supernatural: Hellhounds Lair Connections with Next Episode? |publisher=TV Fodder |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a tie-in to the sequel episode "Ghostfacers", in which the owners of ''Hellhounds Lair'' create their own ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]''-style reality show, The CW set up Ghostfacers.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernaturals-ghostfacers-get-18759.aspx |title=Supernatural: The Ghostfacers Get Their Own Website |date=April 21, 2008 |publisher=BuddyTV |first=Don |last=Williams |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Winchesters later visit this website in the fourth-season episode "It's a Terrible Life".

==== Secondary literature ====
An unofficial anthology titled ''In the Hunt: Unauthorized Essays on Supernatural'' ({{ISBN|1933771631}}) was released on February 10, 2009, by Smart Pop and featured essays covering different aspects of both the series and its fanbase. ''The Mythology of Supernatural: The Signs and Symbols Behind the Popular TV Show'' ({{ISBN|0425241378}}), published by Berkley Trade on August 2, 2011, sought to explore the religious and mythological roots of the show. And on October 1, 2011, ECW Press released the book ''TV Goes to Hell: An Unofficial Road Map of Supernatural'' ({{ISBN|1770410201}}) which explored topics such as folklore, religion, gender and sexuality, comedy, and music through essays from a number of contributors.

=== Spin-off series ===

==== ''Ghostfacers'' ====
The growing popularity of "amateur spook-hunters" Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spangler prompted Kripke to consider a spin-off series for the characters. He discussed the idea of an online venture with actors [[A. J. Buckley]] and [[Travis Wester]], and held a successful meeting with studio and network executives.&lt;ref name="ghostfacersm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/04/supernatural-ghostfacers.html |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Maureen |last=Ryan |date=April 15, 2010 |title='Supernatural's' Ghostfacers scare up their own Web series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Kripke announced their plans to produce "some new material, either webisodes, potentially cell phone content or basically an off-network ''Ghostfacers'' series" at the 2008 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]],&lt;ref name="ghostfacersk" /&gt; the economic downturn delayed production until 2009.&lt;ref name="ghostfacersm" /&gt;

Buckley and Wester, along with Patrick J. Doody and Chris Valenziano, penned the series.&lt;ref name="ghostfacersm" /&gt; They found the format—ten three-minute segments&lt;ref name="ghostfacersv" /&gt;—difficult to manage because each webisode has to work both individually and as part of the overall storyline.&lt;ref name="ghostfacersm" /&gt; However, Wester noted, "We couldn't get too indulgent, we couldn't delve into long conversations. That helps not only with the storytelling but with the comedy... With drama, it takes time to establish an emotional connection with the characters. With comedy, you can jump right in."&lt;ref name="ghostfacersm" /&gt;

Though an initial idea of Kripke's involved the cast searching real haunted houses,&lt;ref name="ghostfacersk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/20712/supernatural-boys-dish-on-new-season-possible-spinoff |title=Supernatural Boys Dish on New Season, Possible Spinoff |publisher=E! |first=Kristin |last=Dos Santos |date=July 28, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first season instead features the Ghostfacers investigating a haunted theater. The series also stars [[Brittany Ishibashi]] as Maggie and [[Austin Basis]] as Spruce.&lt;ref name="ghostfacersv"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2010/digital/news/supernatural-spawns-web-spinoff-1118014263/ |work=Variety |title='Supernatural' spawns Web spinoff |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, a webisode was released online in which the Ghostfacers meet Castiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/supernatural-ghostfacers-castiel/ |title=Unreleased 'Supernatural' Ghostfacers Webisode With Castiel Revealed [Updated] |publisher=Screen Rant |first=Michael |last=Crider |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Supernatural: The Anime Series'' ====
On June 9, 2010, the official Japanese Warner Bros. website announced an anime version of the series titled ''Supernatural: The Animation'' (スーパーナチュラル・ザ・アニメーション), which debuted in Japan in January 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-06-09/supernatural-the-animation-project-launched-in-japan |title=Supernatural The Animation Project Launched in Japan |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is produced by Japanese anime studio [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]].&lt;ref name="animenn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-06-10/madhouse-makes-anime-for-warners-supernatural-tv-show |title=Madhouse Makes Anime For Warners Supernatural TV Show |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shigeyuki Miya and [[Atsuko Ishizuka]] are co-directors for the series, with Kripke credited as the project creator.&lt;ref name="animenn" /&gt; Madhouse co-founder [[Masao Maruyama (film producer)|Masao Maruyama]] serves as executive producer, with Naoya Takayama supervising the scripts and Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters. [[Yūya Uchida (voice actor)|Yūya Uchida]] and [[Hiroki Touchi]], who voice Sam and Dean for the Japanese dub of the live-action series, reprise their roles.&lt;ref name="animenn" /&gt;

The anime's first season consists of 22 half-hour episodes; while the storyline covers the first two seasons of the live-action series, it also includes original content exploring the Winchesters' childhoods and expanding upon secondary characters.&lt;ref name="animenn" /&gt; [[Warner Home Video]] released the first two episodes on Blu-ray and DVD in Japan on January 12, 2011; episodes 3 through 12 shipped on February 2, and the rest on April 6.&lt;ref name="animenn" /&gt; Warner Home Video released the Blu-ray and DVD box sets of the anime series on July 26, 2011, in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-04/supernatural-the-anime-ships-in-north-america-in-july |title=Supernatural the Anime Ships in North America in July |publisher=Anime News Network |date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jared Padalecki voices Sam in the English-language version of the series, while Jensen Ackles voices Dean only in the last two episodes for scheduling reasons; Andrew Farrar voices Dean in English for the first 20 episodes.

The first season received a Metacritic score of 59 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/supernatural/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Supernatural Season 1 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 69% approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 6.8/10 based on 13 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "Despite some too-hip dialogue and familiar thematic elements, ''Supernatural'''s vigilante brothers manage to stir up some legitimate scares."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s01/ |title=Supernatural: Season 1 (2005–2006) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent seasons have also enjoyed positive reviews on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s02/ |title=Supernatural: Season 2 (2006–2007) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s04/ |title=Supernatural: Season 4 (2008–2009) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s05/ |title=Supernatural: Season 5 (2009–2010) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s06/ |title=Supernatural: Season 6 (2010–2011) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s07/ |title=Supernatural: Season 7 (2011–2012) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s08/ |title=Supernatural: Season 8 (2012–2013) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s09/ |title=Supernatural: Season 9 (2013–2014) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supernatural/s10/ |title=Supernatural: Season 10 (2014–2015) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner Stransky of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the first season a B, saying the show "comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series", but that "Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1531991,00.html |title=Supernatural: The Complete First Season (2006) |last=Stransky |first=Tanner |date=September 6, 2006 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Swindoll of ''[[Monsters and Critics]]'' "really liked" the first season&lt;ref name="mac2" /&gt; for its "horrific content and the brotherly chemistry between its two stars". He also noted that the season finished "with one bang of a cliffhanger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1198720.php |title=DVD Review: Supernatural&amp;nbsp;– The Complete First Season |last=Swindoll |first=Jeff |date=September 6, 2006 |publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]] |accessdate=September 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008003414/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1198720.php |archivedate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swindoll enjoyed the second season, too, saying that it "still works thanks to the brotherly chemistry between Padalecki and Ackles" and noted the second season focused more on the show's mythology.&lt;ref name="mac2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1354007.php/DVD_Review_Supernatural_-_The_Complete_Second_Season |title=DVD Review: Supernatural&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Second Season |last=Swindoll |first=Jeff |date=September 10, 2007 |publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]] |accessdate=September 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002142629/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1354007.php/DVD_Review_Supernatural_-_The_Complete_Second_Season |archivedate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swindoll also liked the third season, saying "Eric Kripke must've sold his soul to the devil so that the show wouldn't suffer a third season slump."  He also enjoyed the moments featuring Bobby Singer ([[Jim Beaver]]), likening him to the character Cooter from ''[[Dukes of Hazzard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1429895.php/Supernatural_-_The_Complete_Third_Season_%E2%80%93_DVD_Review |title=Supernatural: The Complete Third Season&amp;nbsp;– DVD Review |last=Swindoll |first=Jeff |date=September 10, 2008 |publisher=Monsters and Critics |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625024646/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1429895.php/Supernatural_-_The_Complete_Third_Season_%E2%80%93_DVD_Review |archivedate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daniel Bettridge of ''Den of Geek'' believed that the writer's strike hindered the season, with many issues being left unresolved and the finale feeling "a little rushed". He also felt that new characters Ruby ([[Katie Cassidy]]) and Bela ([[Lauren Cohan]]) were "disappointingly unexplored and ineffectively used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/7735/supernatural-season-3-dvd-review |title=Supernatural season 3 DVD review |publisher=Den of Geek |first=Daniel |last=Bettridge |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Diana Steenbergen of IGN liked that there was a season-long story arc with Dean's demonic deal, she believed that viewers would know that the pact would not be resolved until the finale, making the self-enclosed episodes feel like they are "treading water, waiting for the main storyline to resume".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Steenbergen |first=Diana |url=http://ign.com/articles/2008/05/24/supernatural-season-3-review |title=Supernatural: Season 3 Review |publisher=IGN |date=May 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[AOL TV]] placed the show on its list of TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2008/01/02/biggest-best-tv-guilty-pleasures/ |publisher=AOL TV |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |date=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ''Monsters and Critics'' reviewer, June L., gave the fourth season a positive review, saying the show "remains intriguing and entertaining, giving viewers much to ponder in terms of the philosophical analysis of the nature of good and evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1498683.php/Supernatural-The-Complete-Fourth-Season-%E2%80%93-DVD-Review |title=Supernatural: The Complete Fourth Season&amp;nbsp;– DVD Review |last=L. |first=June |date=September 2, 2009 |publisher=Monsters and Critics |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108022307/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1498683.php/Supernatural-The-Complete-Fourth-Season-%E2%80%93-DVD-Review |archivedate=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steenbergen felt that the series made a transition from a "pretty good show to being a pretty great show". She praised Misha Collins for his portrayal of the angel Castiel, and felt that the interactions between Dean and Castiel were "one of the highlights of the season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Steenbergen |first=Diana |url=http://ign.com/articles/2009/05/22/supernatural-season-4-review |title=Supernatural: Season 4 Review |publisher=IGN |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the premiere of the fifth season, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed the series as one of "The 50 Best Reasons to Watch TV", citing Sam and Dean Winchester as the "Bo and Luke Duke of demon hunting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Rolling Stone |title=The 50 Best Reasons to Watch TV |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s Maureen Ryan named ''Supernatural'' among the top ten shows of 2009, stating that the "thoughtfully crafted show got bolder and more creative in 2009, coming up with hilarious and innovative episodes and taking risks with its storytelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/12/sons-of-anarchy-modern-family-big-bang-theory-supernatural-chuck-dollhouse.html |title=Watch this: The Top TV shows of 2009 |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |date=December 14, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also named the series on his top ten list for the year: "''Supernatural'' is currently among the wildest and most entertaining series in prime time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/arts/television/20hale.html |title=A Top 10 List That Needs an Addendum |last=Hale |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, AOL TV ranked ''Supernatural'' fourth of the Top 20 Magic/Supernatural Shows of All Time, noting that the show had been compared to ''[[The X-Files]]'' early in its run before "distinguishing itself as a unique, unpredictable and addictive series that not only features monsters, magic and Lucifer himself, but also boasts a dynamic duo arguably better at the banter than [[Fox Mulder|Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully|Scully]] -- Sam and Dean Winchester".&lt;ref name="top20"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 20 Magic/Supernatural Shows of All Time |url=http://www.aoltv.com/best-shows-ever/magic-supernatural-shows/ |publisher=AOL TV |accessdate=March 7, 2015 |date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''Entertainment Weekly'' listed the show at No. 19 in the "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25&amp;nbsp;Years", saying, "''Supernatural'' began with a pretty straightforward premise – hot guys kill spooky things – but it didn't stay that way for long. The characters have literally been to [[hell]] and back, and along the way, they have woven a complicated and compelling mythology filled with friends (angel Castiel), recurring foes (demon Crowley), and inside jokes (Wincest!). ''Supernatural'' has also, however, dedicated episodes to mocking the sillier aspects of its own existence, like its hypercritical fandom. This self-referential approach has rewarded longtime viewers and helped build a community so passionate, it's almost scary."&lt;ref&gt;"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25&amp;nbsp;Years", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. August 3, 2012, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The show has a broad demographic base and is more popular in Russia than the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Ashley |title=TV's new longest-running fantasy show unites Democrats and Republicans—and Russians |url=https://qz.com/1100849/supernatural-the-tv-show-that-unites-democrats-and-republicans-and-russians/ |accessdate=October 12, 2017 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers have referenced this several times in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-slash-this-is-wro-31170.aspx |title='Supernatural' Slash: "This is Wrong" |publisher=BuddyTV |first=John |last=Kubicek |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the 200th episode, which makes references to Wincest, Destiel, and Sastiel (the romantic pairing of Sam Winchester and Castiel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sastry |first=Keertana |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/48816-supernatural-addresses-wincest-destiel-the-lack-of-female-characters-more-in-its-200th-episode |title='Supernatural' Addresses Wincest, Destiel, the Lack of Female Characters, &amp; More in Its 200th Episode |publisher=Bustle |date=November 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fan conventions dedicated to ''Supernatural'' took place in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in October 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/viewArticle/208/151 |title=Interview with Wincon organizer Ethrosdemon |editor=TWC Editor |journal=Transformative Works and Cultures |volume=4 |year=2010 |doi=10.3983/twc.v4i0.208 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230313/http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/viewArticle/208/151 |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[London]] in May 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/jensen-ackles-headed-to-firste-6330.aspx |title=Jensen Ackles Headed To First-ever Supernatural Convention |publisher=BuddyTV |first=Kris |last=De Leon |date=May 10, 2007 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conventions have since expanded through to Germany and throughout the United States. The series' stars and large guest cast make appearances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-stars-to-attend-c-10199.aspx |title='Supernatural' Stars to Attend Convention Saluting Various Genre Series |publisher=BuddyTV |first=Lisa |last=Claustro |date=September 2, 2007 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with fans from the United States, Europe, China, and Australia attending.&lt;ref name="eclipsemagazine" /&gt;

Before the debut of the series' [[Supernatural (season 5)|fifth season]], in which [[Lucifer (Supernatural)|Lucifer]] is finally freed from his imprisonment, fans attempted to promote the show through [[Twitter]]. Enough fans posted the [[Tag (metadata)#Hash tags|hash tag]] "#LuciferIsComing" that it made it into "[[trending topic]]s"&lt;ref name="twitter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twitter2" /&gt; – a list depicting words and phrases posted with the highest frequency on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.twitter.com/2009/twitter-search-everyone |title=Twitter Search for Everyone! |publisher=Twitter |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Twitter users who were unaware of the fans' intentions responded with numerous posts of "#GodIsHere", and the topic was blocked from Twitter's trending topics after complaints. Actor [[Misha Collins]], who portrays [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]] in the series, tried to continue the campaign by requesting that fans post "#PDiddyIsScaredOfHisTV", rapper [[P.

In honor of the series' season 14 renewal, [[Mayor of Austin|Mayor]] [[Steve Adler (lawyer)|Steve Adler]] of [[Austin, Texas]] declared June 23, 2018 as "''Supernatural'' Day" in the city, as the show's stars Ackles and Padalecki are both Austin residents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12069">The '''Tanacu exorcism''' was a case in which Maricica Irina Cornici, a mentally ill nun at the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] monastery of [[Tanacu]] in [[Vaslui County]], [[Romania]], was killed during an [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]] led by priest Daniel Petre Corogeanu and four Orthodox Christian nuns who were a part of the Order of the Holy Trinity.&lt;ref name="Connolly2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/1492445/Possessed-nun-crucified-after-row-with-priest.html|title='Possessed' nun crucified after row with priest|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=20 June 2005|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|language=English|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was widely publicized in the Romanian media and, following a lengthy trial, the priest was sentenced on appeal to 7 years, one nun to 6 years and the other three nuns to 5 years. They were all found guilty of deprivation of liberty resulting in the victim's death. They received a relatively lenient sentence, compared to the original desire of the [[prosecution]] who sought [[life imprisonment]] for the priest.

[[File:Vaslui_in_Romania.svg|thumb|200px|[[Vaslui County]] shown on the map of [[Romania]]]]
The victim, Maricica Irina Cornici, came from a disadvantaged background, and spent part of her childhood in a [[Romanian orphans|Romanian orphanage]]. In January 2005, the 23-year-old moved to the Tanacu monastery.&lt;ref name="casualty"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Craig S. |date=July 3, 2005 |title= A Casualty on Romania's Road Back From Atheism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/international/europe/03romania.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |location= |publisher= |accessdate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanacu monastery was in [[Vaslui County]], one of the poorest areas of Romania. Cornici was born into a broken family, and, following her father's suicide, she and her brother grew up in an [[orphanage]]. When she was 19, she worked as a [[nanny]] in Germany, and then for a family in Banat.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; A friend of hers from the orphanage became a nun at the Tanacu monastery and she encouraged her to also become a nun.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt;

Soon after, she began giggling during March and, by April, her mental state deteriorated and the doctors at the local [[psychiatric hospital]] diagnosed her disease as [[schizophrenia]]. After a two-week treatment, they released her into the care of the monastery.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; Cornici's friends also stated that she never exhibited any signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; Her brother testified that he was with her when he saw Satan go "into her" and also maintained that she suffered from [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt;

==Priest==
Daniel Petre Corogeanu was the 29-year-old priest of the monastery. A decade before the events, he was a football player in [[Vaslui]], his home town. He began following religious studies at the [[Iași University]] after he could not secure admission in [[Bucharest University]], where he wanted to study sports or law.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; A year later, a businessman from his home town recruited him to help build a monastery in the hills near the city. He was ordained by the local [[bishop]], who expected that he would continue his studies. Nevertheless, he gave up his university education in order to devote himself to running the monastery.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; 

In 2003, Father Corogeanu had some disputes with the [[diocese]]. When the bishop came to read him the [[canon law]], he argued that the rules were "19th century innovations" made by the [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; The original community of monks dissolved as they left to become priests and, instead, Corogeanu organized a community of nuns, who were, according to all accounts, "completely devout to him".&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt;

==The exorcism==

Father Corogeanu thought that it was not just a mental illness, but rather that Cornici was possessed by [[Satan]].&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; He would later claim that "you can't take the Devil out of people with pills" and that an exorcism was necessary.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt;

In order to restrain her from violent movements including those causing her to hit herself,&lt;ref name="Connolly2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom2014"/&gt; the nuns bound her hands and feet and locked her in her room as they participated in the liturgy commemorating the [[Ascension of Jesus]]. A few days later, they chained her to a cross with her arms stretched and carried her into the church so that they could anoint her.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; According to Sister Nicoleta Arcalianu, Cornici had been restrained in the same manner that others who were demonically possessed were; Sister Arcalianu stated that had Cornici not been restrained, she "could have either killed herself or killed someone else".&lt;ref name="Scotsman2018"/&gt; With regard to Cornici, Sister Arcalianu stated that "Irina knew that she was possessed by evil spirits because she was begging us to tie her up and help her."&lt;ref name="Scotsman2018"/&gt;

Her wrists and forehead were then anointed with [[Chrism|holy oil]] and she was kept in the church for three days.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; They put a towel into her mouth to stop her from cursing and [[Christian prayer|prayed]] to cast out the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] as they wet her lips with [[holy water]].&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; 

Cornici was then moved to her room and untied. She was, according to Father Corogeanu, "cured". She was later given bread and tea and fainted after eating. The nuns could not arouse her and sensed that her [[pulse]] was weak and as a result they called an [[ambulance]]. While in the ambulance, she was administered six doses of adrenaline.&lt;ref name="Laycock2015"/&gt; By the time she reached the hospital, she was dead.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The police were notified by the doctors at the hospital, who noticed the marks left on her wrists and ankles by the chains. The 2005 [[autopsy]] claimed that she had died of [[dehydration]], [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and a lack of oxygen.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; 

Father Corogeanu and the four nuns who helped him were charged with murder and depriving a person of liberty.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; Prosecutors sought a [[life sentence]] for Corogeanu, but he was sentenced in 2007 to 14 years in prison, while the nuns (Nicoleta Arcalianu, Adina Cepraga, Elena Otel and Simona Bardanas) were sentenced to between 5 and 8 years.&lt;ref name="FN2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prison"&gt;{{cite news |date=February 20, 2007 |title=  Romania: Prison for Priest and Nuns in Exorcism Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/world/europe/20briefs-exorcism.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |location= |publisher= |accessdate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals were present in the courtroom to support Father Corogeanu and were distraught at the pronouncement of the verdict.&lt;ref name="FN2007"/&gt; The Court of Appeals reduced his sentence to 7 years.&lt;ref name="procesul"&gt;{{cite news |date=January 15, 2008 |title=Procesul în cazul Tanacu, de la instanţa supremă, s-a încheiat |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/justitie/procesul-in-cazul-tanacu-de-la-instanta-suprema-s-a-incheiat-2335848 |newspaper=Mediafax |location= |publisher= |accessdate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuns also had their punishments reduced to 6 years (one nun) and 5 years (three nuns).&lt;ref&gt;https://romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/preotul-exorcist-de-la-tanacu-condamnat-la-7-ani-de-inchisoare-video-116709&lt;/ref&gt; The priests and the nuns were all found guilty of deprivation of liberty resulting in the victim's death.

Corogeanu was freed on [[parole]] in November 2011 after serving two-thirds of his punishment.&lt;ref name="exorcistul"&gt;{{cite news |date=November 30, 2011 |title=Exorcistul de la Tanacu a fost eliberat.

There is still controversy about the cause of death. Coroner Dan Gheorghiu, who was hired by Corogeanu's lawyer, argues that the cause of death was actually due to an overdose of adrenaline given in the ambulance: "'I was part of the team who handled the exhumation of the nun's body. ...It was concluded that the woman died of an overdose of adrenaline. Don't ask me, I don't know why the judges did not take that into account."&lt;ref name="Bloom2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Romanian priest jailed for killing nun who was CRUCIFIED during botched exorcism|last=Bloom|first=Dan|date=15 July 2014|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|language=English|accessdate=17 February 2018|quote=Coroner Dan Gheorghiu admitted recently that the was some credence to the theory, saying: 'I was part of the team who handled the exhumation of the nun's body.

She passed out after eating. The nuns appointed someone to get an ambulance, which arrived around 2:00 p.m. The ambulance doctor gave Cornici six doses of adrenaline and took her to the hospital.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fr. Corogeanu stated that "My biggest mistake was that I called the ambulance when I saw she was not moving. I think she died because the medics who came with the ambulance tried to resuscitate her by giving her too much adrenaline. Had I not called the ambulance, she would have been well now."&lt;ref name="Scotsman2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/exorcism-priest-is-jailed-for-nun-death-1-682819|title=Exorcism priest is jailed for nun death|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|language=English|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tanacu, many people continue to maintain that Cornici was indeed possessed, rather than mentally ill, and that Corogeanu did his best to help her.&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt; Veronica Tomulescu stated that "It's not as if they actually killed her. They didn't stab her or shoot her. They took her to the hospital alive."&lt;ref name="casualty"/&gt;

The 2012 movie ''[[Beyond the Hills]]'' directed by [[Cristian Mungiu]] was based on the novels written by [[Tatiana Niculescu Bran]] and inspired by the Tanacu case. ''[[The Crucifixion (film)|The Crucifixion]]'', released in 2017, is also based on Tanacu exorcism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturecrypt.com/movie-reviews/the-crucifixion-2017|title=The Crucifixion (2017)|publisher=Culture Crypt|language=English|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2905">'''Tonal''' (To nal) is a concept within the study of [[Mesoamerica]]n religion, myth, folklore and anthropology. It refers to the belief found in many indigenous Mesoamerican cultures that a person upon being born acquires a close spiritual link to an animal, a link that lasts throughout the lives of both creatures. The person shows signs of whatever the animals situation in signs include scratches and bruises if the animals get in fights of illness if the animal is ill.It is in this way similar to the concept of [[Totem]].

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''[[tonalli]]'' (to nal li), meaning "day" or "daysign". In the [[Aztec]] belief system the day of a person's birth calculated in the [[Tonalpohualli]] would determine the nature of the person – each day was associated with an animal which could have a strong or weak aspect. The person born on the day of for example "the dog" would then have the strong or weak aspect of the dog. In Nahuatl the word Tonalli was used to refer both to a day and to the animal related to that day. In Mayan belief the concept of an animal companion of a person was referred to as "Way". The modern [[Mixe people]] refer to it as ''Ts'ok'' (Lipp 1991). The [[Jakaltek people|Jakaltek]] Maya people of Concepcion Huista, Guatemala call it ''yixomal ispiẍan nax,'' meaning "soul bearer".

== Studies ==
The study of tonalism was initiated by noted [[archaeologist]], [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[ethnologist]] [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] who published a treatise called [https://web.archive.org/web/20070219214347/http://library.case.edu/ksl/ecoll/books/brinag00/brinag00.html "Nagualism: A Study in Native-American Folklore and History"] which chronicled historical interpretations of the word and those who practiced [[nagualism]] in Mexico in 1894. He identified the different beliefs associated with tonalism in some modern Mexican communities such as the [[Mixe]], the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]], the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] and [[Mixtec]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6662">{{Slavic Native Faith}}
The '''Union of Slavic Communities of the Slavic Native Belief''' ([[acronym]]: '''USC SNB'''; [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Союз Славянских Общин Славянской Родной Веры'', Russian acronym: '''ССО СРВ''') is one of the largest [[Russia]]n organisations of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery) groups, established in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rodnovery.ru/en/documents/who-we-are |title= Who we are |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2015-11-22 |website= Rodnovery.ru |access-date= 2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially recognised by the government in 2014 (becoming the first, and currently only, Rodnover organisation to be recognised by the Russian government).{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

==History==
The Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities was established in 1997 by initiative of three constituent communities from [[Moscow]], [[Kaluga]] and [[Obninsk]]. On 19 July 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ansobor.ru/articles.php?id=136 |title=Русское и украинское неоязычество |author=Геннадий Гоменюк |author2=Сергей Терещенко |website=Собор во имя святого благоверного великого князя Александра Невского |year=2003 |language=ru |access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vadim Stanislavovich Kazakov from Kaluga's community&lt;ref name="doroshenko"&gt;{{cite web |last=Дорошенко |first=Марианна |title=Славянское неоязычество |url=http://www.iriney.ru/sects/heathen/news009.htm |date=2004-03-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/5YDW |archive-date=2012-08-04 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; was elected as the leader of the USC SNB. On 21 July 2011 Kazakov resigned and Maksim Ionov became his successor through a vote held by the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly) on 23 July.

Annually, on [[Perun]]'s Day (20 July) the "All-Slavic Veche" takes place in Kaluga. The assembly deals with issues including the further widening of the organisation, the cooperation with other organisations, and also the nominations of the chief and of the high priesthood. Hundreds of representatives of many Slavic communities scattered throughout Russia come to the yearly ''veche''.

In April 2011, the USC SNB bought a 4,77-hectares plot of land just five kilometres away from the city of Kaluga, on the left bank of the river Kaluzhka, located in the village of Krasotinka, with the purpose of building a temple.

In 2014, the USC SNB was officially registered by the government of Russia as an interregional organisation for the development of Slavic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rodnovery.ru/dokumenty/moo-sso-srv |title=МОО ССО СРВ |date=2015-06-01 |website=Rodnovery.ru |language=ru |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606132902/http://www.rodnovery.ru/dokumenty/moo-sso-srv |archive-date=2017-06-06 |access-date=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2015, the day of summer solstice, the Temple of the Fire of Svarozich (Храм Огня Сварожича) was officially opened in the village of Krasotinka.

==Ideology==
The union claims to represent Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery), that is to say the revival of [[historical Slavic religion]], upon which indigenous Slavic customs and traditions rely. The organisation aims at the consolidation of Slavic Native Faith communities across the different Slavic states, as well as the cooperation with non-Slavic [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] organisations in [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The USC SNF requires believers in Slavic Native Faith to be genealogically Slavs.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

==Constituent groups==

* Moscow Slavic Community "Circle of the [[Vyatichi|Viatiches]]"

==Splinter organisations and cooperation==
Some organisations branched out of the Union of Slavic Native Faith Communities due to ideological differences. The original Obninsk and Moscow communities left the USC SNB in 2002, on the occasion of the Bittsa Accord,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170930132101/http://www.slavya.ru/docs/bitc_obr.htm Битцевское Обращение (Bittsa Accord)] proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the Circle of Pagan Tradition (CPT).{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

In 2009, the USC SNB, the CPT and the Circle of Veles issued a joint statement condemning [[Ynglism]].{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} In 2012 the same three organisations signed an "Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests", which defined common criteria for the ordination of Slavic Native Faith's priesthood.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

'''Western Ganga''' was an important ruling dynasty of ancient [[Karnataka]] in India which lasted from about 350 to 1000 CE. They are known as 'Western Gangas' to distinguish them from the [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Gangas]] who in later centuries ruled over [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Odisha]]). The general belief is that the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the [[Pallava]] empire in [[South India]], a geo-political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of [[Samudra Gupta]]. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from [[Kolar]] and later, moving their capital to [[Talakadu]] on the banks of the [[Kaveri River]] in modern [[Mysore district]].

After the rise of the imperial [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas of Badami]], the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the [[Pallavas]] of [[Kanchi]]. The Chalukyas were replaced by the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta]] in 753 CE as the dominant power in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the [[Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tanjavur]]. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the [[Kaveri]] river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.

Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to [[polity]], culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage toward [[Jainism]] resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]] flourished. [[Chavundaraya]]'s writing, ''Chavundaraya Purana'' of 978 CE, is an important work in Kannada prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from [[religion]] to [[elephant]] management.


==History==
{{See also|Origin of the Western Ganga Dynasty}}
Multiple theories have been proposed regarding the ancestry of the founders of the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century). Some mythical accounts point to a [[North India|northern]] origin,&lt;ref name="kanva"&gt;(Rice in Adiga 2006, p88)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kudd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gangas of Talkad |url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka11.htm |author=Jayaswal in Arthikaje, Mangalore |publisher=1998–2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc |work= |accessdate=2007-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215103823/http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka11.htm |archivedate=15 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while theories based on [[epigraphy]] suggest a [[South India|southern]] origin.

It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the [[North India|northern]] king [[Samudra Gupta]] prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of [[Mysore district|Mysore]], [[Hassan district|Hassan]] [[Chamarajanagar district|Chamarajanagar]], [[Tumkur district|Tumkur]], [[Kolar district|Kolar]], [[Mandya district|Mandya]] and [[Bangalore district|Bangalore]] in Karnataka state.&lt;ref name="bang"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp39–40&lt;/ref&gt; At times, they also controlled some areas in modern [[Tamil Nadu]] (Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita) and [[Andhra Pradesh]] (Ananthpur region starting from the middle of the 5th century).&lt;ref name="grow"/&gt; The founding king of the dynasty was Konganivarma Madhava who made [[Kolar]] his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years.

By the time of Harivarma in 390, the Gangas had consolidated their kingdom with [[Talakad]] as their capital. Their move from the early capital Kolar may have been a strategic one with the intention of containing the growing [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] power.&lt;ref name="grow"&gt;Sarma (1992), p4&lt;/ref&gt; By 430 they had consolidated their eastern territories comprising modern Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur districts and by 470 they had gained control over Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu, Sendraka (modern [[Chikkamagaluru]] and [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]]), Punnata and Pannada regions (comprising modern [[Heggadadevanakote]] and [[Nanjangud]]) in modern Karnataka.&lt;ref name="issue"&gt;Adiga 2006, p97, p100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="insc"&gt;From the Cakra-Kedara grant, Kodunjeruvu grant (Adiga 2006, p99&lt;/ref&gt; In 529, King [[Durvinita]] ascended the throne after waging a war with his younger brother who was favoured by his father, King [[Avinita]].&lt;ref name="crown"&gt;Kamath (2001), p40&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts suggest that in this power struggle, the Pallavas of Kanchi supported Avinita's choice of heir and the Badami Chalukya King Vijayaditya supported his father-in-law, Durvinita.&lt;ref name="sides"&gt;Sheik Ali and Ramesh in Adiga (2006), p100–101&lt;/ref&gt; From the inscriptions it is known that these battles were fought in Tondaimandalam and Kongu regions (northern Tamil Nadu) prompting historians to suggest that Durvinita fought the Pallavas successfully.&lt;ref name="tondai"&gt;Adiga (2006), p101&lt;/ref&gt; Considered the most successful of the Ganga kings, Durvinita was well versed in arts such as music, dance, [[ayurveda]] and taming wild elephants. Some inscriptions sing paeans to him by comparing him to [[Yudhishthira]] and [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] – figures from Hindu mythology known for their wisdom and fairness.&lt;ref name="Nal"&gt;from the Nallala grant (Kamath 2001, p41)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nal1"&gt;Adiga (2006), p109&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, the Gangas were feudatories and close allies who also shared matrimonial relations with the Chalukyas. This is attested by inscriptions which describe their joint campaigns against their arch enemy, the Pallavas of Kanchi.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;From the Aihole inscriptions and the Jangamarahalli inscription (Adiga 2006, 102)&lt;/ref&gt; From the year 725 onwards, the Gangavadi territories came to be called as the "Gangavadi-96000" (''Shannavati Sahasra Vishaya'') comprising the eastern and western provinces of modern south Karnataka.&lt;ref name="nintysix"&gt;(Adiga 2006, p103)&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Sripurusha]] fought the Pallava King Nandivarman Pallavamalla successfully, bringing Penkulikottai in north [[Arcot]] under his control temporarily for which he earned the title ''Permanadi''.&lt;ref name="Perm"&gt;From the Shimoga records (N.L. Rao in Kamath 2001, p41)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;The title was given to a later Ganga King Rachamalla I (Ramesh in Adiga p115), the Agali grant and Devarahalli inscription calls Sripurusha ''Maharajadhiraja Paramamahesvara Bhatara'' (Adiga 2006, pp115–116)&lt;/ref&gt; A contest with the Pandyas of [[Madurai]] over control of Kongu region ended in a Ganga defeat, but a matrimony between a Ganga princess and Rajasimha Pandya's son brought peace helping the Gangas retain control over the contested region.&lt;ref name="parama"&gt;Sastri in Adiga 2006, p115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salem"&gt;From Salem plates of Sripurusha dated 771 and the Koramangala grant (Ramesh in Adiga 2006, p116)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 753, when the Rashtrakutas replaced the Badami Chalukyas as the dominant force in the Deccan, the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century.&lt;ref name="strive"&gt;Kamath (2001), p42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fight"&gt;From several Tumkur inscriptions (Adiga 2006, p117)&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Shivamara II]] is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta [[Dhruva Dharavarsha]], his subsequent defeat and imprisonment, his release from prison and eventually his death on the battle field. The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta [[Govinda III]] and by 819, a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King Rachamalla.&lt;ref name="rach"&gt;Adiga 2006, p118&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga, Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter Chandrabbalabbe in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I, son of King Ereganga Neetimarga. The Gangas thereafter became staunch allies of the Rashtrakutas, a position they maintained till the end of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta.&lt;ref name="pave"&gt;from the Konnur inscriptions of 860 and Rajaramadu inscription (Adiga 2006, p119)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;From the Keregodi Rangapura plates and Chikka Sarangi inscription of 903 (Adiga 2006, p119)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plate"&gt;Kamath (2001), p43&lt;/ref&gt;

After an uneventful period, [[Butuga II]] ascended the throne in 938 with the help of Rashtrakuta [[Amoghavarsha III]] (whose daughter he married).&lt;ref name="north"&gt;Kamath (2001), p44&lt;/ref&gt; He helped the Rashtrakutas win decisive victories in [[Sangam period|Tamilakam]] in the [[battle of Takkolam]] against the [[Chola Dynasty]]. With this victory, the Rashtrakutas took control of modern northern Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="kanchi1"&gt;Tirukkalukkunram and Laksmeshwar inscriptions – Kanchi and Tanjore were annexed by [[Krishna III]] who was an incarnation of death for the Chola Dynasty (Reu 1933, p83)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi2"&gt;Thapar 2003, p334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi3"&gt;Sastri 1955, p162&lt;/ref&gt; In return for their valour, the Gangas were awarded extensive territories in the [[Tungabhadra]] river valley.&lt;ref name="north" /&gt;&lt;ref name="north1"&gt;From the Kudlur inscription of King Marasimha II (Adiga 2006, p120)&lt;/ref&gt; King Marasimha II who came to power in 963 aided the Rashtrakutas in victories against the Gurjara [[Pratihara]] King Lalla and the [[Paramara]] kings of [[Malwa]] in [[Central India]].&lt;ref name="central"&gt;From the [[Kukkanur]] inscription (Adiga 2006, p122)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malwa"&gt;These victories were recorded in a [[Kannada]] inscription of 964 near [[Jabalpur]] (Kamath 2001, p83)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chavundaraya]], a minister in the Western Ganga court was a valiant commander, able administrator and an accomplished poet in [[Kannada]] and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="ablest"&gt;Kamath (2001), p45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ablest1"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp356–357&lt;/ref&gt; He served King Marasimha II and his successors ably and helped King Rachamalla IV suppress a civil war in 975. Towards the end of the 10th century, the Rashtrakutas had been supplanted by the [[Western Chalukya Empire]] in [[Manyakheta]]. In the south, the [[Chola Dynasty]] who were seeing a resurgence of power under [[Rajaraja Chola I]] conquered Gangavadi around the year 1000, bringing the Western Ganga dynasty to an end. Thereafter, large areas of south Karnataka region came under Chola control for about a century.&lt;ref name="controlling"&gt;Kamath (2001), p118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
{{See also|Western Ganga administration}}
[[File:Bharatha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Saint Bharatha at [[Shravanabelagola]] temple complex]]
The Western Ganga administration was influenced by principles stated in the ancient text ''[[arthashastra]]''. The ''praje gavundas'' mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities similar to those of the village elders (''gramavriddhas'') mentioned by [[Kautilya]]. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked.&lt;ref name="admin1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p46&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was divided into ''Rashtra'' (district) and further into ''Visaya'' (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and ''Desa''. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term ''Visaya'' was replaced by the [[Kannada]] term ''Nadu''. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000,&lt;ref name="admin2"&gt;Adiga (2006), p10&lt;/ref&gt; with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms&lt;ref name="admin3"&gt;Rice in Adiga (2006), p15)&lt;/ref&gt; or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division&lt;ref name="admin5"&gt;Sharma in Adiga (2006), p16&lt;/ref&gt; or the number of villages included in that territory.&lt;ref name="admin3"/&gt;

[[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] have revealed several important administrative designations such as prime minister (''sarvadhikari''), treasurer (''shribhandari''), foreign minister (''sandhivirgrahi'') and chief minister (''mahapradhana''). All of these positions came with an additional title of commander (''dandanayaka''). Other designations were royal steward (''manevergade''), master of robes (''mahapasayita''), commander of elephant corps (''gajasahani''), commander of cavalry (''thuragasahani'') etc.&lt;ref name="admin7"&gt;Kamath (2001), p47&lt;/ref&gt; In the royal house, ''[[Niyogi]]s'' oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewellery etc. and the ''Padiyara'' were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.&lt;ref name="admin 29"&gt;Adiga (2006), p238&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials at the local level were the ''pergade'', ''nadabova'', ''nalagamiga'', ''prabhu'' and ''gavunda''.&lt;ref name="admin8"&gt;Adiga (2006), pp161–177&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pergades'' were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans, gold smiths, black smiths etc. The ''pergades'' dealing with the royal household were called ''manepergade'' (house superintendent) and those who collected tolls were called ''Sunka vergades''.&lt;ref name="admin9"&gt;From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p161)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nadabovas'' were accountants and tax collectors at the ''Nadu'' level and sometimes functioned as scribes.&lt;ref name="admin11"&gt;From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p164)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nalagamigas'' were officers who organized and maintained defence at the ''Nadu'' level.&lt;ref name="admin12"&gt;From the Mavali inscription of the 8th century and Indravalli inscription (Adiga 2006), p165&lt;/ref&gt; The ''prabhu'' constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries.&lt;ref name="admin13"&gt;Doddakunce inscription, the Karagada and Maruru inscription (Adiga 2006, p167–68)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gavundas'' who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region. They were landlords and local elite whom the state utilized their services to collect taxes, maintain records of landownership, bear witness to grants and transactions and even raise militia when required.&lt;ref name="admin17"&gt;Bedirur inscriptions of 635 (Adiga 2006, p168)&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions that specify land grants, rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (''kote'') if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included was the type of soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation.&lt;ref name="admin22"&gt;From the Kumsi inscription of 931 and Doddahomma inscription of 977 (Adiga 2006, pp21–22, p27, p29)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="admin23"&gt;From the Mavali inscription and Indivalli inscription (Adiga 2006, p31)&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land.&lt;ref name="admin24"&gt;From the Devarahalli and Hosur copper plates (Adiga 2006, p33)&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous references to hamlets (''palli'') belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (''bedapalli'').&lt;ref name="admin25"&gt;From inscriptions and literary writings such as ''Vaddaradhane'' (920) and ''Pampa Bharata'' (940) (Adiga 2006, p36–37)&lt;/ref&gt; From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title ''arasa''. The ''arasas'' were either [[brahmin]]s or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king.&lt;ref name="admin27"&gt;Adiga (2006), p208&lt;/ref&gt; The ''velavali'' who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (''vele''). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the ''velavali'' were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.&lt;ref name="admin28"&gt;Adiga (2006), pp233–234&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gangavadi region consisted of the [[malnad]] region, the plains ([[Bayaluseemae]]) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, [[betel]] leaves, [[cardamom]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced [[rice]], millets such as [[Finger millet|ragi]] and [[maize|corn]], pulses, [[oilseed]]s and it was also the base for cattle farming.&lt;ref name="eco1"&gt;Adiga (2006), p6&lt;/ref&gt; The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra]] and [[Vedavati]] rivers where cultivations of [[sugarcane]], paddy, [[coconut]], [[areca]] nut (''adeka totta''), betel leaves, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] and flowers (''vara vana'') were common.&lt;ref name="admin2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eco13"&gt;from the Melkote copper plates and Mamballi inscriptions, Medutambihalli inscription of the 9th century (Adiga 2006, p53)&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (''Katta'').&lt;ref name="eco5"&gt;Adiga (2006), p42&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.&lt;ref name="eco6"&gt;Adiga (2006), p45&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil types mentioned in records are black soil (''Karimaniya'') in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (''Kebbayya mannu'')&lt;ref name="eco7"&gt;from the Narasimhapura plates (Adiga 2006), p46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eco8"&gt;From the Doddahomma inscription of Rachaballa IV of 977 (Adiga 2006, p47)&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land and to a lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called ''kalani'', ''galde'', ''nir mannu'' or ''nir panya'' and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water.&lt;ref name="eco9"&gt;Kittel in Adiga (2006), p48&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms ''gosahasra'' (a thousand cows), ''gasara'' (owner of cows), ''gosasi'' (donor of cows), ''goyiti'' (cowherdess), ''gosasa'' (protector of cows) attest to this.&lt;ref name="eco14"&gt;Belagi inscription of 964, Sasarvalli inscription of 1001 (Krishna and Adiga 2006, p55/56)&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this.&lt;ref name="eco15"&gt;Adiga (2006), p57&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (''pendir-udeyulcal''), abduction of women by ''bedas'' (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.&lt;ref name="eco17"&gt;From the Kodagu inscription of the 11th century, Guduve inscription of 1032, Kambadahalli inscription of 979 (Adiga 2006, p59, p60, p63)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lands that were exempt from taxes were called ''manya'' and sometimes consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without any reference to the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished in the line of duty were called ''bilavritti'' or ''kalnad''.&lt;ref name="eco19"&gt;From the Narasimhapura inscription of the 9th century (Sircar and Ramesh in Adiga 2006, pp210–211)&lt;/ref&gt; When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called ''Talavritti''.&lt;ref name="eco21"&gt;Indian epigraphical glossary, Hecca inscription pF 939 for SriKanteshvara temple (Adiga 2006, p213)&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of taxes on income were ''kara'' or ''anthakara'' (internal taxes), ''utkota'' (gifts due to the king), ''hiranya'' (cash payments) and ''sulika'' (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.&lt;ref name="eco23"&gt;From Nonamangala copper plates of the 5th century of King Avinita (Adiga 2006, p216)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eco24"&gt;From the Kuppepalya inscription of the 8th century (Adiga 2006, p218)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Siddhaya'' was a local tax levied on agriculture and ''pottondi'' was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, ''pottondi'' also meant 1/10, ''aydalavi'' meant 1/5 and ''elalavi'' meant 1/7.&lt;ref name="eco25"&gt;Kotutu inscription of the 9th century, Rampura inscription of 905 (Adiga 2006, p219)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mannadare'' literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (''Kurimbadere'') payable to the chief of shepherds. ''Bhaga'' meant a portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as ''Kirudere'' (due to the landlords) and ''samathadere'' (raised by the army officers or ''samantha'') are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles.&lt;ref name="eco27"&gt;Varuna inscription, (Adiga 2006, p223–224)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bittuvatta'' or ''niravari'' taxes comprised usually of a percentage of the produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.&lt;ref name="eco229"&gt;Adiga (2006), p230&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Gangas gave patronage to all the major religions of the time; [[Jainism]] and the Hindu sects of [[Shaivism]], [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahminism]] and [[Vaishnavism]]. However scholars have argued that not all Gangas kings may have given equal priority to all the faiths.

Jainism became popular in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I constructed numerous Jain ''[[basadi]]s''.&lt;ref name="jain4"&gt;From the Kulaganga and Narasimhapura copper plates (Adiga 2006, p255)&lt;/ref&gt; King Butuga II and minister [[Chavundaraya]] were staunch Jains which is evident from the construction of the [[Gommateshwara]] monolith.&lt;ref name="jain5"&gt;From the Kudlur plates of Butuga II (Adiga 2006, p256)&lt;/ref&gt; Jains worshipped the twenty four ''[[tirthankar]]s'' (''Jinas'') whose images were consecrated in their temples. The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of [[Bhadrabahu]] in [[Shravanabelagola]] from the 10th century is considered a parallel to [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="jain17"&gt;P.B. Desai and Jaiswal in Adiga (2006), pp263–264&lt;/ref&gt; Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of [[Bahubali]], the son of ''[[Tirthankar]] Adinatha'' (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva).&lt;ref name="jain11"&gt;Adiga (2006), p264&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of subordinate deities such as ''yaksa'' and ''yaksi'', earlier considered as mere attendants of the ''tirthankars'' was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.&lt;ref name="jain12"&gt;Adiga (2006), pp264–265&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gomateswara.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Gommateshwara]] at Shravanabelagola (982–983) C.E.]]
Vedic Brahminism was popular in the 6th and 7th centuries when inscriptions refer to grants made to ''Srotriya'' Brahmins.&lt;ref name="vedic"&gt;Adiga (2006), p253&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions also describe the ''gotra'' (lineage) affiliation to royal families and their adherence of such Vedic rituals as ''asvamedha'' (horse sacrifice) and ''hiranyagarbha''.&lt;ref name="vedic1"&gt;From the Bendiganhalli and Bangalore copper plates, the Chaluvanahalli plates, Kutalur grant, Kadagattur and Nallala grants of King Durvinita, Kondunjeruvu grant of King Avinita (Adiga 2006, pp281–282)&lt;/ref&gt; Brahmins and kings enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship; rituals performed by the brahmins gave legitimacy to kings and the land grants made by kings to brahmins elevated them in society to the level of wealthy landowners.&lt;ref name="vedic2"&gt;Adiga (2006), p282&lt;/ref&gt; Vaishnavism however maintained a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause.&lt;ref name="vai"&gt;Adiga (2006), p313&lt;/ref&gt; Some Vaishnava temples were built by the Gangas such as the ''Narayanaswami'' temples at [[Nanjangud]], Sattur and Hangala in modern Mysore district.&lt;ref name="vai2"&gt;From the Kalkunda inscription (Adiga 2006, pp314–316)&lt;/ref&gt; The deity [[Vishnu]] was depicted with four arms holding a conch (''sanka''), discus (''cakra''), mace (''gada'') and lotus (''padma'').&lt;ref name="vai3"&gt;Adiga (2006), p317&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 8th century, patronage to Shaivism increased in every section of the society; the landed elite, landlords, assemblies (''samaya''), schools of learning (''aghraharas'')&lt;ref name="sai"&gt;Adiga (2006), p291&lt;/ref&gt; and minor ruling families such as the [[Bana Kingdom|Bana]], [[Nolamba]] and [[Chalukya]] clans.&lt;ref name="sai4"&gt;From the Nandi copper plates of Rashtrakuta [[Govinda III]] of 800, Koyattur-12000 grant of King Dodda Naradhipa Bana in 810, the Ganiganur inscription, [[Nolamba]] King Mahendradhirajas grant of his house towards a Shaiva temple in 878, Baragur inscription of 914 of King Ayappadeva [[Nolamba]], the Ninneshvaradeva temple built by King Dilipayya [[Nolamba]] in 942.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sai5"&gt;Among minor Chalukya kings, Narasinga Chalukya of Mysore constructed the Narasingeshwara temple and Kings Goggi and Durga build the Buteshvara temple at Varuna in modern Mysore region – From the Kukkarahalli, Manalevadi, Aragodupalli and Torevalli inscriptions, (Adiga 2006, 294)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shaiva temples contained a Shiva ''linga'' (phallus) in the [[sanctum sanctorum]] along with images of the mother goddess, [[Surya]] (Sun god)&lt;ref name="ling"&gt;This was popularised by the ''kalamukha'' monks (Adiga 2006, p292)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] (a bull and attendant of Shiva) which was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum.&lt;ref name="sai7"&gt;Adiga (2006), p301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sai77"&gt;H.V.

[[File:Old Kannada inscription Hero Stone from 9th century AD in Kalleshvara Temple at Aralaguppe.jpg|thumb|150px|Hero stone (870–906 A.D.) with old Kannada inscription at Kalleshvara temple in Aralaguppe]]
The Western Ganga society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur&lt;ref name="soci1"&gt;From the Kuntur inscription of the 10th century (Adiga 2006, p203)&lt;/ref&gt; and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi.&lt;ref name="soci12"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p66&lt;/ref&gt; Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of ''nalgavunda'' (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, the wife of a fallen hero are examples. When Jakkiabbe took to asceticism, her daughter inherited the position.&lt;ref name="soci2"&gt;from the Bandalike inscription of 919 (Adiga 2006, p203)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soci3"&gt;From the Shravanabelagola inscription (Adiga 2006, p204)&lt;/ref&gt;

The devadasi system (''sule'' or courtesan) in temples was prevalent and was modelled after the structures in the royal palace.&lt;ref name="soci5"&gt;Adiga (2006), p398&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaneous literature such a ''[[Vaddaradhane]]'' makes a mention of the chief queen (''Dharani Mahadevi'') accompanied by lower ranking queens (''arasiyargal'') and courtesans of the women's royal quarter (''pendarasada suleyargal'').&lt;ref name="soci5" /&gt; Some of the courtesans and concubines employed in the harem of the kings and chieftains were well respected, examples being Nandavva at whose instance a local chief made land grant to a Jain temple.&lt;ref name="soci6"&gt;From the Perur plates (Adiga 2006, p398)&lt;/ref&gt; Education in the royal family was closely supervised and included such subjects as political science, elephant and horse riding, archery, medicine, poetry, grammar, drama, literature, dance, singing and use of musical instruments.&lt;ref name="soci12"/&gt; Brahmins enjoyed an influential position in society and were exempt from certain taxes and customs due on land. In turn they managed public affairs such as teaching, local judiciary, functioned as trustees and bankers, managed schools, temples, irrigation tanks, rest houses, collected taxes due from villages and raised money from public subscriptions.&lt;ref name="soci14"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), pp. 72, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

By virtue of a Hindu belief that killing of a brahmin (''Bramhatya'') was a sin, capital punishment was not applicable to them.&lt;ref name="sin"&gt;Altekar (1934), p329&lt;/ref&gt; Upper caste [[kshatriya]]s (''satkshatriya'') were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand.&lt;ref name="soci15"&gt;From the notes of Alberuni and Bouchet (Karmarkar 1947, p103)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the [[Hindu caste system]]; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among [[vaishya]] and two among [[shudra]]s.&lt;ref name="soci16"&gt;From the notes of Yuan Chwang (Karmarkar 1947, p103)&lt;/ref&gt; Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. if there were no male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as ''Dharmadeya'' (charitable asset).&lt;ref name="soci17"&gt;From a modern Bijapur inscription of 1178 (Karmarkar, 1947, p104)&lt;/ref&gt; Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, ''Svayamvara'' marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue.&lt;ref name="soci19"&gt;The ''Svayamvara'' marriage of Chalukya King [[Vikramaditya VI]] to Chandaladevi in the 11th century being an example (Karmarkar, 1947 p105)&lt;/ref&gt; Memorials containing [[hero stone]]s (''virkal'') were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.&lt;ref name="soci21"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p109&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of numerous ''Mahasatikals'' (or ''Mastikal'' – hero stones for a woman who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] among royalty.&lt;ref name="Soci23"&gt;From the writings of Marco Polo, Ibn Batuta, Bernier and Tavernier (Karmarkar 1947, p110)&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual death by ''[[sallekhana]]'' and by ''jalasamadhi'' (drowning in water) were also practiced.&lt;ref name="soci24"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p110&lt;/ref&gt; Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a [[Dhoti]] as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore [[Sari]]s with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds.&lt;ref name="soci25"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p111&lt;/ref&gt; Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (''honnasara'' and ''honnagala sara''), bracelets (''Kaduga'') and wristlets (''Kaftkina''). Women wore a nose jewel (''bottu''), nose ring (''mugutti''), bangles (''bale'' or ''kankana'') and various types of necklaces (''honna gante sara'' and ''kati sutra'').&lt;ref name="soci25"/&gt; During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, [[cockfighting|cock fights]] and ram fights.&lt;ref name="soci26"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p112&lt;/ref&gt; There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as ''agraharas'', ''ghatikas'', ''brahmapura'' or ''matha''.&lt;ref name="soci27"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p113&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, [[Balligavi]], [[Talagunda]], [[Aihole]], [[Arasikere]] and other places.

[[File:Atakur memorial stone with inscription in old Kannada (949 C.E.).jpg|thumb|upright|The famous [[Atakur inscription]] (949 C.E.), a classical Kannada composition pertaining to the Western Ganga-Rashtrakuta victory over the Chola dynasty of Tanjore in the famous [[battle of Takkolam]]]]
The Western Ganga rule was a period of brisk literary activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them.&lt;ref name="durvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verse"/&gt; Chavundaraya's writing, ''Chavundaraya Purana'' (or ''Trishashtilakshana mahapurana'') of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, ''[[Adipurana]]'' and ''Uttarapurana'' which were written a century earlier by [[Jinasena]] and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta [[Amoghavarsha I]].&lt;ref name="verse"&gt;Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian 2003, p160&lt;/ref&gt; The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor [[Adikavi Pampa]] and contemporary [[Ranna (Kannada poet)|Ranna]]. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain ''Tirthankar'', twelve ''Chakravartis'', nine ''Balabhadras'', nine ''Narayanas'' and nine ''Pratinarayanas''.&lt;ref name="jain"&gt;Sastri (1955), p357&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prop"&gt;Kulkarni (1975) in Adiga (2006), p256&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest postulated Kannada writer from this dynasty is King Durvinita of the 6th century. [[Kavirajamarga]] of 850 CE, refers to a Durvinita as an early writer of Kannada [[prose]].&lt;ref name="crown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dur"&gt;Sastri (1955), p355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dur2"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p2&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900 CE, Gunavarma I authored the Kannada works, ''Shudraka'' and ''Harivamsha''. His writings are considered extinct but references to these writings are found in later years. He is known to have been patronised by King Ereganga Neetimarga II. In ''Shudraka'', he has favourably compared his patron to King Shudraka of ancient times.&lt;ref name="gun"&gt;kamath (2001), p50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nag1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p18&lt;/ref&gt; The great Kannada poet Ranna was patronised by Chavundaraya in his early literary days.&lt;ref name="gem"&gt;One among the three gems of Kannada literature (Sastri 1955, p356)&lt;/ref&gt; Ranna's classic ''Parashurama charite'' is considered a eulogy of his patron who held such titles as ''Samara Parashurama''.&lt;ref name="ablest" /&gt;

[[Nagavarma I]], a brahmin scholar who came from [[Vengi]] in modern Andhra Pradesh (late 10th century) was also patronised by Chavundaraya. He wrote ''Chandombudhi'' (ocean of prosody) addressed to his wife. This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]].&lt;ref name="jain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nag1"/&gt; He also wrote one of the earliest available [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] classics in Kannada called ''Karnataka Kadambari'' in sweet and flowing ''champu'' (mixed verse and prose) style. It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics.&lt;ref name="jain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nag1"/&gt; ''Gajashtaka'' (hundred verses on elephants), a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct.&lt;ref name="verse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiv"&gt;Kamath (2001), p50&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers such as Manasiga and Chandrabhatta were known to be popular in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p19&lt;/ref&gt;

In an age of classical Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise ''Dattaka Sutravritti'' which was based on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A Sanskrit version of ''Vaddakatha'', a commentary on [[Pāṇini]]'s grammar called ''Sabdavathara'' and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called ''Kiratarjunneya'' by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita.&lt;ref name="durvi"&gt;Kamath (2001), p49&lt;/ref&gt; King Shivamara II is known to have written ''Gajamata Kalpana''.&lt;ref name="durvi"/&gt; Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored ''Raghavapandaviya'', a narration of the stories of [[Rama]] and the [[Pandava]]s simultaneously through puns.&lt;ref name="pand"&gt;Venkatasubbiah in Kamath (2001), p50&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gayachintamani'' and ''Kshatrachudamini'' which were based on poet Bana's work ''Kadambari'' were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style.&lt;ref name="shiv" /&gt; and Chavundaraya wrote ''Charitarasara''.&lt;ref name="ablest" /&gt;

The Western Ganga style of architecture was influenced by the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features.&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;Reddy, Sharma and Krishna Rao in Kamath (2001), pp 50–52&lt;/ref&gt; The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped ''[[Sikhara|Vimana]]'' of the shrine with horizontal [[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]s and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and [[Nolambas]].&lt;ref name="shiv" /&gt;

The monolith of [[Gomateshwara]] commissioned by Chavundaraya is considered the high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is {{convert|60|ft|m}} tall with the face measuring {{convert|6.5|ft|m}}. With the serene expression on the face of the image, its curled hair with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka.&lt;ref name="arc1"&gt;Seshadri in Kamath (2001), p51&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest monolithic statue in the world.&lt;ref name="keay"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Relief of Jain tirthankara in the Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ceiling sculpture, [[Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli]]]]
Other important contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (''talas'') ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative [[Kirtimukha]] (demon faces) are used at the top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of [[Gomateshwara]] of 982 are the most important monuments at [[Shravanabelagola]].&lt;ref name="arc6"&gt;Some historians claim the Chavundaraya basadi was built by Chavundaraya himself while others argue it was the work of his on Jinadevana (Gopal et al. in Adiga 2006, p256). Another view holds that the original shrine was consecrated in the 11th century and built in memory of Chavundaraya (Settar in Adiga 2006, 256)&lt;/ref&gt; Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King [[Chandragupta Maurya]] are known to be his creation.&lt;ref name="arc11"&gt;Adiga 2006, p269&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli|Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli]] (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] art.&lt;ref name="kamba"&gt;Sarma (1992), pp153–167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc7"&gt;{{cite web|title=An ancient site connected with Jainism|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006020313510400.htm&amp;date=2006/02/03/&amp;prd=th&amp;|author=Khajane, Muralidhara|work=The Hindu|accessdate=2006-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509081551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006020313510400.htm&amp;date=2006%2F02%2F03%2F&amp;prd=th&amp;|archive-date=9 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall niches here are surmounted by ''torana'' ([[Post and lintel|lintel]]) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (''gandharva'') and imaginary monsters ([[Yalli (motif)|''makara'']]) ridden by [[Yaksha|''Yaksas'']] (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.&lt;ref name="arc10"&gt;Adiga 2006, p268&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gangas built many Hindu temples with impressive Dravidian [[Gopuram|gopuras]] containing stucco figures from the Hindu pantheon, decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the ''mantapa'' (hall) along with ''[[Matrika|saptamatrika]]'' carvings (seven heavenly mothers).&lt;ref name="arc4"&gt;Kamath (2001), p51&lt;/ref&gt; Some well known examples are the [[Arakeshvara Temple, Hole Alur|Arakeshvara Temple]] at Hole Alur,&lt;ref name="alur"&gt;Sarma (1992), pp.105–111&lt;/ref&gt; Kapileswara temple at Manne, Kolaramma temple at Kolar, [[Rameshvara Temple, Narasamangala|Rameshvara temple at Narasamangala]],&lt;ref name="rama"&gt;Sarma (1992), pp91–102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nageshvara Temple, Begur|Nagareshvara temple]] at Begur&lt;ref name="naga"&gt;Sarma (1992), pp78–83&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kalleshvara Temple, Aralaguppe|Kallesvara temple]] at Aralaguppe.&lt;ref name="begur"&gt;Sarma (1992), pp88–91&lt;/ref&gt; At Talakad they built the Maralesvara temple, the Arakesvara temple and the Patalesvara temple.

{{Karnataka History}}
The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit extensively as their language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language.&lt;ref name="bil"&gt;Thapar 2003, pp393–394&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350–725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were ''[[brahmadeya]]'' grants (grants to Brahmin temples).&lt;ref name="brahma"&gt;Adiga (2006), p110&lt;/ref&gt; In the second phase (725–1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith.&lt;ref name="admin2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;Thapar 2003, p396&lt;/ref&gt; Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate]] bilingual inscriptions dated 444.

Children have been accused of witchcraft, both historically and in contemporary times, in societies that harbour beliefs about the existence of witches and black magic.

== Historical ==

=== Witch finders and accusers ===
In sixteenth-century Europe, older children sometimes comprised a special category of witch hunters, bringing accusations of witchcraft against adults.&lt;ref name="GoldenEncyc"&gt;Golden, Richard M. ''Encyclopedia of Witchcraft: The Western Tradition'' s.v. Santa Barbara, CA: [[ABC-CLIO]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1525, the traveling judge in the [[Navarrese]] witch hunt utilized two "girl witches" whom he felt would be able to identify other witches. He hung about forty of these "witches" based on the testimony of the two girls.

Child witch hunters sometimes accused their family members of being witches.&lt;ref name="GoldenEncyc" /&gt;

The most renowned trials caused by child accusations [[Salem witch trials|occurred in Salem, Massachusetts]] in 1692.&lt;ref name="BaileyHistDic"&gt;Bailey, Michael D. ''Historical Dictionary of Witchcraft (Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies and Movements)''. [[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]], [[Maryland]]: [[The Scarecrow Press, Inc.]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Children were viewed as having an important role in convicting witches, due to their being able to identify people impulsively.&lt;ref name="GoldenEncyc" /&gt; Children who made such false allegations often directed them at adults with whom they had strained relationships such as teachers or [[puritanical]] neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. John Crewdson. ''By Silence Betrayed: Sexual Abuse of Children in America''. ([[Boston]]: Little, Brown, 1988), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child witches ===
By the start of the seventeenth century, many children were being punished and put in prison for taking part in witchcraft. This usually occurred because of their alleged participation in [[Sabbats]].&lt;ref name="GoldenEncyc" /&gt; It was a common belief that witches' children inherited witchcraft from their parents. It was often the practice to charge a whole family of witchcraft, even if only one individual was suspected. Witches who confessed often claimed that they learned witchcraft from a parent.

[[Pierre de Lancre]] and [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]] believed that it was enough proof of a witch's guilt if they had parents who were witches. They believed witch parents introduced the children to Satan, took the children to Sabbats, married children to demons, inspired the children to have sex with Satan(devil) or had sex with Satan with the child present. Many times the child accused of witchcraft, due to being shunned, threatened community members, thereby enforcing their beliefs that the child was a witch.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, William E. ''Witch Hunts in Europe and America: An Encyclopedia''. [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], [[Connecticut|CT]]: [[Greenwood Press]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several cases of witchcraft in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that involved children as witches. In [[Sweden]] in 1669 a large number of children were included in a witch hunt and in [[Würzburg witch trial|Würzburg]] as in Salem in 1692, children were the focus of witch hunts. In [[Augsberg]], beginning in 1723 an investigation into twenty children between the ages of six and sixteen resulted in them being arrested for witchcraft. They were held for a year in [[solitary confinement]] before being transferred to a hospital. The last child was freed in 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, Lyndal. ''"Evil Imaginings and Fantasies": Child-Witches and the End of the Witch Craze''. ''Past and Present'', No. 167 (May, 2000) 107, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a child-witch narrative in [[Germany]] is of a seven-year-old girl named Brigitta Horner. In 1639, Brigitta claimed to be a witch and that she had participated in witch's Sabbats where the Devil was present. Brigitta claimed to have been baptized in the name of the Devil instead of God. The pastor who baptized Brigitta was married to her grandmother who then taught her the arts of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, Alison. ''The 'Little Witch Girl' of Rothenburg''. History Review, 42(Mar 2002)27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary belief in child witchcraft==

=== UK ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], research by [[Leo Ruickbie|Dr Leo Ruickbie]] showed that the problem of child witchcraft accusations was spreading from Africa to countries with African immigrant populations. In some cases this has led to ritualized abuse and even murder. This was evident in the high-profile case of Kristy Bamu in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Ruickbie, Leo. ''Child Witches: From Imaginary Cannibalism to Ritual Abuse''. Paranthropology, 3.3 (July 2012), pp. 13-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
{{Main|Witchcraft accusations against children in Africa}}

In [[Nigeria]], some African [[Pentecostal]] pastors have incorporated African witchcraft beliefs into their brands of Christianity resulting in a campaign of violence against young Nigerians. Children and babies branded as evil are being mistreated, abandoned,
and even murdered. The preachers make money out of the fear providing costly exorcism services of their parents and their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Children are targets of Nigerian witch hunt. (''The Observer'', 9 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Angola]], many orphaned children are accused of witchcraft and demonic possession by relatives in order to justify not providing for them. Various methods are employed: starvation, beating, unknown substances rubbed into their eyes or being chained or tied up.&lt;ref&gt;Children accused of witchcraft tortured in '[[exorcism]]' rituals. (2005, July 12). ''Daily Mail'', p. 20. Retrieved December 1, 2008, from [[ProQuest NewsStand]] database. (Document ID: 866086551).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], it is estimated that there are 25,000 homeless children living on the streets of the capital city. Of these, 60% were expelled from their homes because of allegations of witchcraft. Accusations of witchcraft is the only justifiable reason for the refusal to house a family member, no matter how distant the relation.&lt;ref&gt;CONGO RELATIVES ACCUSING KIDS OF WITCHCRAFT :[ALL Edition]. (2006, August 30). ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'', p. A11. Retrieved December 1, 2008, from ProQuest NewsStand database. (Document ID: 1116345621).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gambia]], about 1,000 people accused of being witches were locked in detention centers in March 2009. They were forced to drink a dangerous [[hallucinogenic]] potion, according to [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref name="Abuse"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/05/18/nigeria.child.witchcraft/index.html|title=Abuse of child 'witches' on rise, aid group says|author= Faith Karimi|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Nigeria]]n states of [[Akwa Ibom]] and [[Cross River State|Cross River]] about 15,000 children were branded as witches and most of them end up abandoned and abused on the streets.&lt;ref name="Abuse" /&gt; A documentary aired on Channel 4 and [[BBC (TV channel)|BBC]], ''[[Saving Africa's Witch Children]]'', shows the work of Gary Foxcroft and Stepping Stones Nigeria in addressing these abuses.

According to a disputable empiric construction, in [[Sierra Leone]] sick infants tend to have better survival-rates due to witchhunts: "the effect of the witch cleansing probably lasts for years in the sense that mothers are predisposed to tend their babies with more hopefulness and real concern. Therefore many babies who, before the arrival of the witchfinder, might have been saved if the mothers had had the heart and will to stop at nothing to tend their babies, will now survive precisely because they will receive the best attention, as the mothers now believe that the remaining children are free of witchcraft. So there is a reduction in the infant mortality rate in the years immediately following the witchcleansing movement".&lt;ref&gt;''STUDIA INSTITUTI ANTHROPOS'', Vol. 41  Anthony J. Gittins : ''Mende Religion''. Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1987. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

While crisis is generally accepted as a factor in the DRC and Nigeria, its impact and ramifications are in discussion by African and European scholars. According to Riedel, two major [[Nollywood]] films depicting children as witches don't show any economic stress and play in a middle-class environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whrin.org/felix-riedel-children-in-african-witch-hunts-an-introduction-for-scientists-and-social-workers/|title=Felix Riedel: Children in African Witch-Hunts –  An introduction for Scientists and Social Workers|publisher=whrin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riedel|first=Felix|title=Children in African Witch-Hunts - An Introduction for Scientists and Social Workers|url=http://www.whrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/childreninafricanwitchhuntsfinalversion-1-Felix-Riedel-2.pdf|format=PDF|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yadnya Kasada''', also popularly known as ''Kesodo'' is a festival of [[Tenggerese people]], who are an ethnic group of [[Javanese people|Javanese]], live in Tengger mountains ([[Mount Bromo]]) in the [[Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park]] in eastern  part of [[Java]] island in [[Indonesia]].
[[File:Riding up the volcano Mount Bromo.jpg|thumb|right|Trail leads to [[Mount Bromo]]]]

==History==
The origin of this festival is a legend that dates back to the [[Majapahit]] kingdom, during the reign of King Brawijaya. At the fall of the Majapahit empire the princess of the kingdom and her husband Roro Anteng took refuge in the upper slopes of  [[Mount Bromo]]. The couple and their followers later settled in the Tengger mountains and ruled the region jointly under the title Purbawisesa Mangkurat Ing Tengger. Under their leadership Tenngerese people settled and began to flourish, but the couple were not happy as  they remained childless after many years of marriage. Therefore, they meditated atop Mount Bromo, beseeching the mountain gods for assistance. The gods granted them 24 children on the condition that the 25th child must be thrown into the volcano as human sacrifice. The gods’ request was observed, and so the tradition of offering sacrifices thrown into the volcano to appease the deities continues until today, but, of course, with no sacrifices of humans.  Instead, today chickens, goats and vegetables are thrown into the crater as sacrifice.

The gods’ request was observed, and so the tradition of offering sacrifices thrown into the volcano to appease the deities continues until today, but, of course, with no sacrifices of humans.  Instead, today chickens, goats and vegetables are thrown into the crater as sacrifice. According to another version of the legend the couple didn't follow the promise. God becomes angry with threatening to inflict catastrophe, then there is a tempestuous circumstances into a pitch black crater of Mount Bromo sprayed fire. Their  youngest son ''Kesuma'' vanished from the sight of the fire and into the crater of Bromo, along with Kesuma's disappearance came the unseen voice, "My dear friends, I have been sacrificed by our parents and Sang Hyang Widhi saved all of you.Live peace and serenity, worship the Sang Hyang Widhi, I remind you every month of Kasada on the 14th day to make offerings to Sang Hyang Widhi in the crater of Mount Bromo ".

==Poten==
Poten is a sacred area of land in the "[[Sand sea|Sea of Sand]]"  ({{lang-jv|Segara Wedi}} or {{lang-id|Lautan Pasir}}), which becomes place for Kasada festival. Poten consists of several buildings and enclosures arranged in a composition arrangement in the yard which is divided into three mandala / zone,  ''Mandala Utama '', ''Mandala Madya'' and ''Mandala Nista ''.

==Festival==
[[File:Suasana Kasada Di Gunung Bromo Taman Nasional Bromo, Tengger Semeru.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Devotees climbing trail towards [[Mount Bromo]]]]
Yadnya Kasada  is held every 14th day of the Kasada Month in the traditional Hindu lunar calendar. This ceremony is held to honor Sang Hyang Widhi, God Almighty, and is based on the ancient legend of Roro Anteng and Joko Seger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcnordic.com/shows/lands-of-the-monsoon/|title=Lands of the Monsoon {{!}} Shows {{!}} BBC Nordic {{!}} BBC Worldwide Nordic|website=BBC Worldwide Nordic|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the Yadnya Kasada, there's the Eksotika Bromo. Pendopo Agung Desa Ngadisari (Ngadisari village Grand Hall) became the starting point of the Yadnya Kasada procession. Offerings began to be distributed to the Luhur Poten temple at the sand grounds which is known as ''Poten'',  right at the bottom of Mount Bromo. Following the ritual, the Tengger tribe shamans, local public figures, and Tenggerese people gather and pray for their safety and prosperity.   

On the day of Yadnya Kasada, devotees who have journeyed up the mountain, pray together atop the mountain and then throw their offerings into the crater of the volcano.  On the 14th day of the Kasada, the Tenggerese go to Poten Bromo and ask for blessing from the main deity Hyang Widi Wasa and Mahadeva, the God of the Mountain (Mount Semeru), by offerings sacrifices, which include vegetables, fruit, livestock, flowers as well as money, and are offered in grateful thanks for an abundance of agricultural produce and livestock given to them. Sometimes locals clamber down into the crater despite obvious dangers, to retrieve the sacrificed goods, which are believed to bring them good luck.

The festival attracts huge numbers of tourists every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/07/12/thousands-of-tourists-witness-the-yadnya-kasada-ritual-in-mount-bromo.html|title=Thousands of tourists witness the Yadnya Kasada ritual in Mount Bromo|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
