'''Abram Combe''' (15 January 1785 – 11 August 1827) was a British [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]], an associate of [[Robert Owen]] and a major figure in the early co-operative movement, leading one of the earliest [[Owenism|Owenite]] communities, at Orbiston, Scotland.

==Life==
===Early Years===
Combe was born in Edinburgh on 15 January 1785, son of George Combe, a brewer and strict Calvinist. He attended Edinburgh High School but, unlike his brothers [[George Combe|George]] and [[Andrew Combe|Andrew]], he preferred practical pursuits to academic ones and became apprenticed to a local [[Tanning (leather)| tanner]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John, ''The Social System'' (London, 1831) pp. 354/5.&lt;/ref&gt; After his apprenticeship Combe worked as a [[currier]] in London and Glasgow, before returning to Edinburgh in 1807 to set up his own tannery business. He married Agnes Dawson in 1812 and started a family.

Combe was a hard-working and successful businessman, motivated by self-interest but honourable in his dealings with others. He strongly believed that every man was responsible for his own character and was scathing in his criticism of anyone whose standards of behaviour differed from his own. Such criticisms were often expressed satirically in verse and prose.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Alexander, ''Adventures in Socialism'' (Glasgow, 1810) pp. 199/200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Owenism and Divine Revelation===

In 1820, Combe met [[Robert Owen]] during a visit to his mill at New Lanark and was impressed by Owen's views on the formation of character, the defects in the principles and practices of society and the virtues of co-operation and universal benevolence. Following a period of reflection and study Combe radically altered his former views and habits. He ceased to be motivated by self-interest and where once he had criticised other people's weaknesses he now showed compassion. He even abandoned some of the social activities that he had previously enjoyed, such as eating meat, drinking alcohol and going to the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John, ''The Social System'' (London, 1831) pp. 354/61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821 Combe put his Owenism into practice by becoming a founder-member of the Edinburgh Practical Society, an Owenite group which opened its own co-operative store and founded its own school. Although the Society claimed 500 members, it fizzled out within a year. Combe then tried to set up a co-operative with his own employees at his tanyard, but this too was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, J. F. C., ''Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969) pp. 103/4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combe continued to proselytise on Owen's behalf by writing pamphlets and books. These included ''Metaphorical Sketches of the Old and New Systems'' (1823), in which he satirically attacked the prevailing capitalist economic theories by comparing the British economy to a cistern, which was capable of supplying the wants of the entire nation until the guardians of the stopcock cut off supply.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Max., ''A History of British Socialism'' (George Allen and Unwin, 1919) Vol. 1, pp. 206/11.&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to defend Owen's religious views. Owen had scandalised large sections of society by attacking all forms of organised religion and was widely believed to be an [[Atheism|atheist]] and [[infidel]]. Combe went to great lengths to present Owen's ideas as prophetic truths, wholly consistent with the laws of nature, which, he argued, were the laws of God. He referred to these beliefs as “Divine Revelation”, which he explained as “the facts and truths which the Great Governing Power of the Universe reveals to the senses and understanding”.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, J. F. C., ''Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969) pp. 104/5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiston===
During the early 1820s Owen had been trying to raise funds to set up a co-operative community in Lanarkshire, Scotland. One of his supporters was Archibald James Hamilton, whose father owned a large estate near Motherwell. On his father's behalf, Hamilton had sold part of the estate to Owen, but after much delay Owen abandoned the project and went to America to set up a community at New Harmony, Indiana. Hamilton had known Combe since the days of the Edinburgh Practical Society and together they decided to set up a community without Owen's help. They and others formed a [[joint-stock company]] to finance the operation, Hamilton bought back the land from Owen and sold a smaller part of it, at Orbiston, near Motherwell, to the company.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, R. G., ''Co-operation and the Owenite Communities in Britain, 1825 – 1845'' (Manchester University Press, 1972) pp. 68-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building works to house the new community commenced in March 1825, but it was several months before any tenants could be admitted. In the early days, Combe and Hamilton were assisted by [[George Mudie (social reformer)|George Mudie]], who had founded the Owenite community at [[Spa Fields]]. Mudie and Combe, however, could not work together and Mudie soon left after warning Hamilton that Combe lacked the management skills to lead the community.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, R. G., ''Co-operation and the Owenite Communities in Britain, 1825 – 1845'' (Manchester University Press, 1972) p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although building work was far from complete, the first tenants were admitted in October 1825. The community got off to a controversial start when Combe insisted that it be known as The First Society of Adherents to Divine Revelation. Many of the members objected but as Combe had been accepted as their leader his will prevailed. In order to chronicle the progress of the community he edited a weekly newspaper, ''The Register for the First Society of Adherents to Divine Revelation at Orbiston''. In spite of Combe's protestations of religious orthodoxy, the community was viewed with suspicion by local church ministers and their congregations. The situation was not helped by the unruly behaviour of the building workers, Orbiston became known locally as "Babylon" and some newsagents refused to stock ''The Register''.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Alexander, ''Adventures in Socialism'' (Glasgow, 1810) pp. 210/8.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Nevertheless, the community continued to grow and by the summer of 1826 it consisted of around 250 members, while its commercial activities included an iron foundry, a printing press, a dairy, a grain mill and several building trades.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Alexander, ''Adventures in Socialism'' (Glasgow, 1810) pp. 229/34.&lt;/ref&gt; Orbiston was visited by several English co-operators who were keen to see its progress. One visitor was the economic writer [[John Gray (socialist)|John Gray]], who published an address of advice and criticism of Combe's experiment: ''A Word of Advice to the Orbistonians, on the Principles Which Ought to Regulate their Present Proceedings'' (1826). Like George Mudie before him, Gray was alarmed by the lack of any management plan for the community. Combe had accepted all applicants for membership, without regard for what type of work they were capable of undertaking. As a result, Gray thought, the community was failing to perform the tasks necessary for its survival. While Gray was fulsome in his praise of Combe as a person he said that he was "too little of a theorist... his mind was very prematurely devoted to practical measures."&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John, ''The Social System'' (London, 1831) pp. 341/53.&lt;/ref&gt; Other visitors made similar criticisms, but Combe was not convinced that the survival of community was at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Alexander, ''Adventures in Socialism'' (Glasgow, 1810) pp. 227/9.&lt;/ref&gt;   

===Illness and death===
Combe's health now began to fail. In addition to editing ''The Register'' and addressing numerous meetings, he had also spent many hours helping to dig trenches. By mid-1826 he was coughing up blood and having trouble breathing. His doctor in Edinburgh told him that his lungs were inflamed and that he should cease all strenuous activity. After a two-week convalescence Combe seemed to recover and he returned to Orbiston.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John, ''The Social System'' (London, 1831) pp. 361/2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 1826 he had another attack, which left him too weak to continue leading the community. He gave up editing ''The Register'' and left Orbiston to live in Edinburgh. Combe remained the community's President and talisman. He gave advice through letters to ''The Register'', but played no part in its day-to-day activities and was unable to resolve the various internal disputes which were dividing the community.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Alexander, ''Adventures in Socialism'' (Glasgow, 1810) pp. 237/8.&lt;/ref&gt; Combe died on 11 August 1827 and by the end of that year the community had been wound up.

The '''Areni-1 winery''' is a 6100-year-old [[winery]] that was discovered in 2007 in the [[Areni-1 cave complex]] in the village of [[Areni]] in the [[Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]] by a team of Armenian and Irish archaeologists. The excavations were carried out by Boris Gasparyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]]  and Ron Pinhasi from [[University College Cork]] (Ireland), and were sponsored by the Gfoeller Foundation (USA) and University College Cork. In 2008 the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) also joined the project with Gregory Areshian as co-director of the Areni Project. Since then the excavations have been sponsored by UCLA and the [[National Geographic Society]] as well. The excavations of the winery were completed in 2010.

The winery consists of [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] [[Barrel|vats]], a [[wine press]], storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be at least a thousand years older than the winery unearthed in [[Judea and Samaria]] in 1963, which is the second oldest currently known.&lt;ref name= "LAT"&gt;Maugh II, Thomas H.

The [[Areni-1 shoe]] was found in the same cave in 2008.

==Discovery==
Excavations at the Areni-1 site began in 2007 and continued until September 2010. Armenian, American and Irish archaeologists fully unearthed a large, well-preserved 2-foot (60 centimeter) deep vat, along with a 3.5-foot (one meter) long basin made of clay and covered with [[malvidin]].&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In addition to these discoveries grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, prunes, walnuts, and desiccated vines were found. A number of drinking cups, found next to a set of ancient graves, were also excavated, suggesting that the site was used for funeral ceremonies and ritualistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Belluck, Pam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/science/11wine.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science Cave Drops Hints to Earliest Glass of Red]." ''[[New York Times]]''. January 11, 2011.

''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. January 11, 2011. Retrieved January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The cave was abandoned after its roof caved in, and the organic material was preserved thanks to sheep [[Feces|dung]], which prevented [[fungi]] from destroying the remains.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;

The team's full findings will be published in future.

[[File:Areni-1 cave panorama.jpg|900px|thumb|center|&lt;center&gt;Panorama of the Areni-1 site along the [[Arpa River]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Analysis==
The results of the biochemical analysis of the residues from the bottom of the wine-press and the storage jars carried out by Hans Barnard and his colleagues at UCLA were published in the ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Hans et al. "[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/science/YJASC_2685.pdf Chemical evidence for wine production around 4000 BCE in the Late Chalcolithic Near Eastern highlands]." ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', (2010), {{doi|10.1016/j.jas.2010.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical analysis and [[radiocarbon]] tests carried out by researchers at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and [[Oxford University]] have revealed the date of the Areni-1 winery to around 4100 BC and 4000 BC or the [[Copper Age|Late Chalcolithic Period]].&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt; According to Areshian, the vintners used their feet to press the wine in the clay basin, the juice of which would then drain into the vat, where it would remain to [[Fermentation (wine)|ferment]] until being stored in jars.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; The capacity of the vat has been estimated to be about 14–15 gallons (US or imperial??) {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

According to Areshian, the discovery of the winery has provided greater insight to the study of [[horticulture]]. Patrick E. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]], has likewise emphasized the importance of the discovery, describing it as "important and unique, because it indicates large-scale wine production, which would imply, I think, that the grape had already been domesticated."&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

The exact identity of the people who lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they may have belonged to the [[Kura-Araxes culture|Kura-Araxes]] people and added that they may have been very involved in trade.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

'''Bathtub gin''' refers to any style of homemade spirit made in amateur conditions. The term first appeared in 1920, in the [[Prohibition|prohibition-era]] [[United States]], in reference to the poor-quality alcohol that was being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bathtub%20gin |title=bathtub gin |work=Merriam-Webster OnLine |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, MA |accessdate=March 3, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100219094300/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bathtub%20gin| archivedate= 19 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[gin]] was the predominant drink in the 1920s, many variations were created by mixing cheap grain [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] with water and flavorings and other agents, such as juniper berry juice and glycerin. Because the preferred sort of bottle was too tall to be topped off with water from a sink, they were filled from a bathtub tap.  In addition, mixing grain alcohol, water and flavorings in vessels large enough to supply commercial users, had to be small enough for the operation to go undetected by the police. The common metal [[bathtub]] in use at the time would have been ideal as would have been a ceramic bathtub, hence the name, 'bathtub gin'. However, since [[distillation]] requires closed distillation apparatus and cannot be accomplished in an open vessel such as a bathtub, stories of distilled alcoholic products produced in an open bathtub are likely untrue. 

Many gin cocktails owe their existence to bathtub gin, as they were also created in order to mask the unpleasant taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandham|first=Tom|title=World's Best Cocktails: 500 Signature Drinks from the World's Best Bars and Bartenders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceCHTC1QstYC&amp;pg=PA72|date=1 October 2012|publisher=Fair Winds Press|isbn=978-1-61058-648-1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bathtub Gin is also the name for a gin brand produced by [[Ableforth's]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Although not made in a bathtub, it is [[Gin#Production_methodology|produced using compounding/infusing]] rather than using botanical distillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ginfoundry.com/gin/bathtub-gin/|title = Bathtub Gin|date = |accessdate = 2015-07-29|website = |publisher = Gin Foundry|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140522072524/http://www.ginfoundry.com/gin/bathtub-gin/|archivedate = 2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

'''''Begotten''''' is a 1990 American [[Experimental film|experimental]] [[dark fantasy]] [[horror film]] written, produced, edited and directed by [[E. Elias Merhige]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Begotten|date=1991-06-05|first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E0D7123AF936A35755C0A967958260&amp;gwh=7512F6E9DFE5D18D41F42A0D46AA4206}}&lt;/ref&gt; It narrates the story of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] while re-imagining it.

Merhige considers ''Begotten'' the start of an unofficial trilogy. There is a prologue to the intended second installment in the trilogy, the 14-minute [[short film|short]] ''Din of Celestial Birds'', which deals with [[evolution]] and was shot in a similar visual style as ''Begotten''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/144228%7C0/Din-of-Celestial-Birds.html Din of Celestial Birds - Friday, September 15 at 8 &amp; 11 P.M. E.T. and an additional showing at 4 A.M. E.T.] [[Turner Classic Movies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story opens with a robed, profusely bleeding "God" disemboweling itself, with the act ultimately ending in its death. A woman, Mother Earth, emerges from its remains, sexually arouses the dead body, and inseminates herself with its semen. Pregnant, she wanders off into a vast, barren landscape. The pregnancy manifests in a fully grown convulsing man whom she leaves to his own devices.

The "Son of Earth" meets a group of faceless nomads who seize him with what is either a very long umbilical cord or a rope. The Son of Earth vomits organic pieces that the nomads excitedly accept as gifts. The nomads finally bring the man to a fire and burn him. Mother Earth encounters the resurrected man and comforts him. She seizes him with a similar umbilical cord. The nomads appear and proceed to rape her. Son of Earth is left to mourn over the lifeless body.

A group of characters appear and carry Mother Earth to another place, where they dismember her, later returning for Son of Earth. After he, too, is dismembered, the group buries the remains, planting the parts into the crust of the earth. The burial site becomes lush with flowers. Grainy photographs of God Killing Himself are shown. In a final scene, Mother Earth and Son of Earth are seen again in a flashback, wandering through a forest.

==Cast==
* Brian Salzberg as God Killing Himself
* Donna Dempsey as Mother Earth
* Stephen Charles Barry as Son of Earth

==Production==
===Development===
''Begotten'' was written, produced, and directed by [[E. Elias Merhige|Edmund Elias Merhige]]. Development for the film began in 1984.&lt;ref name=chicagoreader&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Begotten|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/begotten/Film?oid=1070839|website=Chicago Reader|publisher=Jonathan Rosenbaum|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merhige, who owned a small [[Theatre production|theatre production company]] in [[New York City]] at the time, had worked on several different [[Experimental theatre|experimental theatre productions]] up to that point and was working on developing his next project. He had originally intended for the film to be a theatre production, and later recalled: "I originally thought of it as a dance theatre with live music piece that we would do at [[Lincoln Center]]." It was only after discovering that it would cost a quarter of a million dollars to produce that Merhige decided to make the script into a motion picture. Merhige, who was 20 when he wrote the script, was inspired by the theories and ideas of [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], which in his opinion had not been developed on film to the fullest extent.&lt;ref name=merhigeint&gt;{{cite web|last1=Essman|first1=Scott|title=Interview: Elias Merhige (Begotten)|url=http://horrornews.net/13347/interview-elias-merhige-begotten/|website=HorrorNews.net|publisher=Scott Essman|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film critic]] Eric D. Snider pointed out that [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Eraserhead]]'' might also have influenced the film's visual style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snider|first1=Eric|title=What’s the Big Deal?: Eraserhead (1977)|url=http://www.film.com/movies/whats-the-big-deal-eraserhead-1977|website=Film.com|publisher=Eric D. Snider|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film incorporates religious themes and events from Christian and Slavic mythology, including [[Creation Accounts in Genesis|Creation]], [[Earth goddess|Mother Earth]], and various other themes on which the events in the film are loosely based.&lt;ref name="chicagoreader"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janet Maslin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=Begotten - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - NYTimes.net|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/180363/Begotten/overview|website=New York Times.com|publisher=Janet Maslin|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Filming took place over a period of three and a half years in several different locations, with Merhige filling multiple roles in the film's production including working on the film's [[cinematography]], and [[special effects]]. The film was shot using a [[Arri|16mm Arriflex camera]] on black and white reversal film. While filming, Merhige experimented with the film reel to give it an old, withered look. This included running the unshot negative through sandpaper to scratch it up before shooting. Still unsatisfied with the overall effect, Merhige decided to use an [[optical printer]] but was unable to find one within the film's budget. He then constructed one himself using old, spare parts he acquired from camera stores and special effects houses.&lt;ref name="merhigeint"/&gt; The majority of the film was shot on a construction site on the northern end of [[New Jersey]], at the [[New York (state)|New York]] border, for a period of 20 days.&lt;ref name="merhigeint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janet Maslin"/&gt;

===Home media===
The film was released on [[DVD]] in 2001 by World Artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Begotten (1991) - Releases - AllMovie|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/begotten-v180363/releases|website=Allmovie.com|publisher=Allmovie|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
''Begotten'' has received mostly positive reviews from critics.
Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of 67%, based on {{nowrap|9 reviews}}, with a [[rating average]] of 6.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rotten Tomatoes – Begotten |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/begotten/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' included the film on its list of ''50 Most Disturbing Movies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/08/the-50-most-disturbing-movies/ |title=The 50 Most Disturbing Movies |last1=Barone |first=Matt |last2=Serafino |first2=Jason |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Savlov from the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' called the film "Experimental, haunting, dreamlike, and intentionally confounding".  "Merhige's stylized nightmare/dreamscape is a calculatedly misbegotten travelogue through Hell, accompanied by a jittery, muffled soundtrack of caterwauling crickets, doomed souls and worse."&lt;ref name="achroniclelist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savlov|first1=Marc|title="Jane!

''Horror News.net'' gave the film a positive review, stating, "Begotten is hard to consume on many levels. Though in that consumption is also a smattering of brilliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: Begotten (1990)|url=http://horrornews.net/2386/film-review-begotten-1990/|website=Horror News.net|publisher=Horror News|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] from the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' praised the film calling it "a remarkable if not extremely upsetting and gory black-and-white experimental feature", further stating: "If you're squeamish you should avoid this like the plague; others may find it hard to shake off the artistry and originality of this visionary effort. And if you're looking to be freaked out you shouldn't pass it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Begotten {{!}} Chicago Reader|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/begotten/Film?oid=1070839|website=Chicago Reader|publisher=Jonathan Rosenbaum|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Sontag]] called it "one of the 10 most important films of modern times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allmovie – Begotten|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/begotten-180363}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Angelo from ''BloodyGoodHorror.com'' gave the film a positive review; stating in his review of the film, "In a way, it inspires so much emotion on such a deep and raw level, it’s a moving and poignant film. However, the message it makes is not pretty. You will see the horrors that man is capable of in shockingly graphic detail. But if you’re like me, and wondering if you’ve been desensitized after years of horror flicks, it’ll show you whether you can still feel or not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Begotten (Movie Review)|url=http://www.bloodygoodhorror.com/bgh/reviews/begotten|website=BloodyGoodHorror.com|publisher=Angelo|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Author and independent filmmaker [[John Kenneth Muir]] awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it "an experimental, one-of-a-kind cinematic experience". In his review, Muir praised the film's originality and powerful imagery, while criticizing the running time as being too long.&lt;ref name="muir90s"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John|title=Horror Films of the 1990s|date=2011|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7864-4012-2|pages=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muirreflections"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muir|first1=John|title=John Kenneth Muir's Reflections on Cult Movies and Classic TV: CULT MOVIE REVIEW: Begotten (1991)|url=http://reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com/2010/03/cult-movie-review-begotten-1991.html|website=Reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com|publisher=John Kenneth Muir|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Din of Celestial Birds''==
'''''Din of Celestial Birds''''' is a 2006 American [[experimental]] [[short film]] written, produced and directed by [[E. Elias Merhige]] on an estimated budget of $15,000 in cooperation with the Q6 production group, a collective of [[philosopher]]s and artists. The film begins with the phrase "hello and welcome ... do not be afraid ... be comforted ... remember ... our origin..." and proceeds to depict the first violent formation of matter from nothingness. Then, after a hyper-accelerated trip through the evolution of life and the earth, the film culminates in the birth of an embryonic pseudo-humanoid called the Son of Light (Stephen Charles Barry) that reaches to some unknown source. It was distributed by [[Turner Classic Movies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/144228%7C0/Din-of-Celestial-Birds.html Din of Celestial Birds - Friday, September 15 at 8 &amp; 11 P.M.

The '''Breakthrough Prize''' is a set of international awards bestowed in three categories by Breakthrough Prize Board in recognition of scientific advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34766069|title=$22m science prize winners announced|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2015-11-09|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences]]

These prizes were founded by [[Sergey Brin]], [[Anne Wojcicki]], [[Mark Zuckerberg]], [[Priscilla Chan (philanthropist)|Priscilla Chan]], [[Yuri Milner]], Julia Milner, [[Jack Ma]], and [[Ma Huateng|Pony Ma]]. Committees of previous laureates choose the winners from candidates nominated in a process that’s online and open to the public.&lt;ref name=BTP&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakthrough Prize: About|url=https://breakthroughprize.org/?controller=Page&amp;action=page&amp;page_id=4|website=Breakthrough Prize|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laureates receive $3 million each in prize money. They attend a televised award ceremony designed to celebrate their achievements and inspire the next generation of scientists. As part of the ceremony schedule, they also engage in a program of lectures and discussions. Those that go on to make fresh discoveries remain eligible for future Breakthrough Prizes.&lt;ref name=BTP/&gt;

==Trophy==
The trophy was created by artist [[Olafur Eliasson]]. Like much of Eliasson's work, the sculpture explores the common ground between art and science. It is molded into the shape of a [[toroid]], recalling natural forms found from black holes and galaxies to seashells and coils of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakthrough Prize: Trophy|url=https://breakthroughprize.org/?controller=Page&amp;action=page&amp;page_id=5|website=Breakthrough Prize|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek mythology character [[Circe]] has appeared many times in the 20th and 21st century [[popular culture]], either under her own name or as a sorceress with similar powers under others. Post-Classical amplifications and reinterpretations of that story and others involving her are dealt with in the article on [[Circe in the arts]]. The instances mentioned here are more recent allusions and adaptations.

==Literature==
*In [[John Myers Myers]]'s 1949 novel ''[[Silverlock]]'', Circe turns the main character into a pig due to his proclivity for food and fornication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_myers_silverlock.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124193135/http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_myers_silverlock.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 24, 2013 |author=Eller, Eric |date= |title=John Myers Myers, ''Silverlock'' (Ace Books, 2005) |publisher=Green Man Review |accessdate=October 30, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although [[Julio Cortazar]] titled one of his short stories "Circe" (1951), its main theme is about perverse sexual gratification in a repressed Catholic environment. Delia Mañara is notorious in her quarter of [[Buenos Aires]] for the mysterious deaths of two of her fiancés. She lives in a twilight world and gains most satisfaction through the exercise of power over others. It emerges that she killed the two men by poisoning them with the sweets she makes; when this fails with her third fiancé, he is freed from her fatal attraction by the knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;The mythical correspondences are explored by Sophie Dufays in ''Circé de Cortázar : au carrefour du mythe et du fantastique'', Folia Electronica Classica, B Louvain-la-Neuve 2007, [http://bcs.fltr.ucl.ac.be/fe/13/circe.html Numéro 13]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 it was made into a film in Argentina with [[Graciela Borges]] as Delia.
*In [[Rick Riordan]]'s novel ''[[The Sea of Monsters]]'' Circe runs an island health spa and turns [[Perseus Jackson (character)|Percy Jackson]] into a [[guinea pig]] (she says that they are "much more convenient" than real pigs), and his friend [[Annabeth Chase]] uses magical multivitamins (the equivalent of moly) to restore Percy to his true form. It is revealed she turned [[Blackbeard]] and some of his crew into Guinea pigs, and once they turn back they wreck the place.
*In the Greek mythological series ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'', Circe appears in the graphic novel titled ''[[God of War: Ascension#Rise of the Warrior|Rise of the Warrior]]'', which is a prequel story to the 2013 video game, ''[[God of War: Ascension]]''.
*Circe appears in [[Dan Simmons]]' science-fiction novel ''[[Ilium/Olympos|Olympos]]'', whose plot draws upon ''[[The Odyssey]]''.
*[[Madeline Miller]]'s 2018 novel ''Circe'' follows the character through her life, focusing on Circe's own interpretation of events.

== Comics ==

*In the [[DC Universe]], [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] is a constant and deadly foe of [[Wonder Woman]] and is in league with the witchcraft goddess [[Hecate]].
*In the [[Marvel Universe]], the immortal [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] superheroine [[Sersi]], created by [[Jack Kirby]], is based on Circe, transforming Odysseus's men into pigs not out of malice, but because they were misbehaving at one of her parties.

==Film and television==

*Circe appeared in the cartoon ''[[Ulysses 31]]'' where she attempted to build a tower that would house all the knowledge of the universe, thus making her more powerful than the gods.
*Circe is depicted in one episode of ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' (voiced by [[Idina Menzel]]) as a beautiful voluptuous woman with long black hair, wearing a red mermaid style chiton dress and holding a dragon-headed magic staff in her hand, searching for "one good man" and picks Hercules' best friend Icarus. When she tires of his foolish behavior she turns him into a [[platypus]], later, Hercules into a [[lemur]] and then Prince Adonis into a [[peacock]].
* In an episode of the Disney cartoon series ''[[DuckTales]]'', titled "Home, Sweet Homer", Circe (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) appears as an anthropomorphic pig with a pet black cat. She attempts to send Homer forward in time, but her cat interrupts the spell, and instead Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie are brought back in time to ancient Greece. She eventually succeeds in turning Queen Ariel, Homer, and Scrooge into pigs, but is later foiled when Huey shatters her medallion; this not only reverses all the spells she has cast—causing everyone she has transformed to revert to their normal selves—but she herself is turned into an ordinary (i.e., non-anthropomorphic) pig.
*In the animated show ''[[Generator Rex]],'' Circe is a minor [[supporting character]], who is the [[Romance (love)|romantic interest]] and girlfriend of the titular character, Rex Salazar. Like her lover, she is one of the few E.V.O.s who appear fully human, and has full control over her strong sound-controlling abilities.

A '''drum circle''' is any group of people playing (usually) [[Hand drum|hand-drums]] and [[percussion instrument|percussion]] in a [[circle]]. They are distinct from a drumming group or troupe in that the drum circle is an end in itself rather than preparation for a performance. They can range in size from a handful of players to circles with thousands of participants.
Drum circles are related to other community-based music gatherings such as [[flute circle]]s or vocal improvisation groups. Largely, drum circles originated in Native and Indigenous communities. 

In 1991, during testimony before the [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging]], [[Grateful Dead]] drummer [[Mickey Hart]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Typically, people gather to drum in drum "circles" with others from the surrounding community. The drum circle offers equality because there is no
head or tail. It includes people of all ages. The main objective is to share rhythm and get in tune with each other and themselves. To form a group consciousness. To entrain and resonate. By entrainment, I mean that a new voice, a collective voice, emerges from the group as they drum together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mickeyhart.net/Pages/senspeech.html Rhythm As A Tool For Healing and Health in The Aging process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210230/http://mickeyhart.net/Pages/senspeech.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of group drumming and drum circles==
The term "Drum Circle" originated in the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s for any group of people, particularly [[counterculture]] groups, who gather (informally) to play music together. The terms "drum jam" or "jam session" could be substituted.  Settings include beaches, parks, concert parking lots, festivals, and retreats.  The determining criteria for a drum circle is that the music is improvised and co-created by the participants. Drum circles may or may not be open to the public, but the music is always a group expression, not constrained by genre, instrumentation, or directed by one person or sub-group.

In [[Western countries]], drum circles have developed into two main types: 

'''Community''' – free-form drumming, often open to the public and entirely improvised in-the-moment.
 
'''Facilitated''' or '''Conducted''' – group drumming that is musically directed by a specific person, often called a facilitator or conductor .

All forms of drum circles are used in a variety of settings and applications including; team building, recreational music making, wellness, education, celebrations, spirituality, personal growth, etc.

===The community drum circle===
Community drum circles are informal gatherings of people who meet for the purpose of playing drums together. They often take place in public settings such as parks or at the beach, but may also be organized via a community center or similar body. Instrumentation centers around drums and percussion, but may include other instruments, such as flutes, didgeridoos, and other non-percussion instruments.  Practically anything that can be banged on to make noise can be used as a percussion instrument such as cans, buckets, pipes, etc.  One need not possess or purchase a drum to participate. Community drum circles differ from facilitated or conducted drum circles in that the music is entirely improvised through a process of group interaction. There may be a facilitator or moderator who acts to shape the experience through discrete actions, such as helping to maintain a steady beat, helping those who need it, and generally managing the environment to see that everyone is able to participate fully. The participants make up the music as they go along, using their listening and playing skills to make musical connections and express themselves in any and all ways that feel right. Participation is voluntary and often includes drumming, singing or chanting, dancing, and listening. Community drum circles often attract both regular and drop-in participants of all ages and can take place just about anywhere. Community drum circles are the original and most popular form of improvised community drumming.

===The facilitated or conducted drum circle===
[[Image:Djembes.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Facilitated drum circle]]
A "facilitated" drum circle is a form of group drumming in which a person seeks to focus the intent and improve the quality and effect of the activity, making it easier for people to effectively participate by taking a more directive approach. The facilitator (leader) takes responsibility for the physical space, arranging chairs and instruments to optimise communication and connection in the group. He or she may provide a range of instruments to create a full and balanced percussion orchestra. In this way, the experience can be thought of as a "standardized drumming circle," as opposed to the more free-flowing and open community drum circle. The facilitator is constantly monitoring the music in the group, and generally being encouraging and accepting of participant ideas. In this way, the facilitator takes on a role similar to that of a music teacher or drumming instructor whose goal it is to empower the participants and encourage them to share their ideas. At the beginning the facilitator directs the music through verbal and non-verbal cuing. Cues, which often mirror the movements of an orchestral conductor, are directed at the participants, who respond to the leader. This creates a leader/follower dynamic between the facilitator and participants. Actions such as rolling (rumbling), starting, stopping, raising/lowering the volume, accents, and when to play/not play are often given by the facilitator. Conducting is not normally part of a traditional (community) drum circle, and therefore makes this type of circle a unique experience and very different from a community circle. Facilitators with training and experience in other areas and professions, such as music education, [[music therapy]], and corporate training, may use a  range of tools and approaches that enable them to work with diverse populations. These types of experiences are more accurately referred to as 'drumming programs,' rather than drum circles, in the traditional sense.

== Other forms of drumming ==
Other forms of drumming that are related to drum circles include:
* "Guided Interactive Drumming" &amp;ndash; highly structured drumming-based programs that are led by an individual or group to reach non-musical goals.
* "Drum Classes" &amp;ndash; education-based drumming for the purposes of building musical skills and knowledge.
* "Drum Ensembles" &amp;ndash; performance-oriented drumming groups who practice and perform music on drums, often for dance.
* "Clinical Improvisation" &amp;ndash; a drumming group within a Music Therapy session, led by a certified Music Therapist.

==Group drumming with a spiritual focus==
===Neotribalism===
Is an inclusive way of life that is focused on creating a positive enhancement of self of identity while enforcing a no harm to the collective group attitude.  Neotribalism belief system is evident in the music of Neotribalism; the postmodern drum circle where the only leader is the preservation of the groove or music consciousness this development of musical consciousness takes the participation of individual to create a collective more powerful and beautiful display of sight and sound. "In beat life begins and it is only the maintenance and sacred keeping of the beat that life will endure".

===Neopaganism===
[[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] have created another type of drum circle.  At [[Neopagan]] festivals, people gather around a large [[bonfire]], the drummers generally sitting on one side to encourage better listening.  The musicians sit together and play while dancers dance and circle around the fire. Often, those present will stay and play throughout the night until dawn, treating the evening as a magical (or alchemical) working. Sound is not limited to drumming alone; there is also chanting, singing, poetry, and spoken word pieces. This type of drum circle is not usually facilitated.

===Shamanic Drumming Circles===
This type of circle tends to center around Native American Cultural Drums and rattles but is primarily focusing on the spiritual rather than the musical aspects of the culture. They are a facilitated circle (This statement is questionable) but the leader is facilitating a [[shamanic]] journey type process rather than a musical event.  Shamanic drumming is generally simple and repetitive, often considered as a form of prayer or method of trance induction, rather than as music or entertainment.  During a shamanic trance or shamanic journey, the shaman uses the steady beat of the drum as a "lifeline" to find the way back to the world of ordinary consciousness. Note that in these cultures, the term "Drum Circle" would certainly not be used. Rather, the terms 'drumming ceremony" or "ceremonial drumming" would be more accurate.

===Medicine Wheel Drumming and Prayer Ceremony===
[[File:Pow-Wow avec les drummers.jpg|thumb|[[Atikamekw]] drum circle at a [[pow-wow]] in Manawan, Quebec, Canada]]
Practiced by various groups, and outlined step by step in the book, "Finding Sanctuary in Nature: Simple Ceremonies in the Native American Tradition for Healing Yourself and Others," by Jim PathFinder Ewing (Findhorn Press, Scotland, 2007), (page 147), "the medicine wheel drum circle prayer ceremony" recognizes the four directions—east, south, west, north—as spiritual Powers that can help balance and heal. The ceremony has four rounds, with drumming by all participants at the instruction of the leader allowing the energy of each direction in each round to come into the circle to facilitate prayers and healing. It has been described as "like a sweat lodge without the sweat" (page 148, Finding Sanctuary). Ewing held these ceremonies each month for seven years, as outlined in the book, in addition to shamanic drum circles, and at various sites from coast to coast in the United States since the late 1990s. Groups based on his example and the instructions outlined in the book have resulted in other groups forming worldwide. Note: This description is not of a drum circle, in the sense that the term is commonly used. It is a drumming ceremony that takes place in a circle, but very different in content and form than a drum circle (improvised community drumming jam). This type should probably be listed under shamanic or spiritual drumming and not under drum circles.

==Notable figures in the group drumming movement==
Commercial drum circle groups and companies exist in most countries to serve various markets. There is also a growing body of people working in places such as hospitals, prisons, and hospices using drumming as a form of recreational and supportive music making. Music therapists often use various forms of group drumming (including improvised drumming) in their work to reach therapeutic goals and objectives.

'''Episodic storytelling''' is when a story is narrated through [[episode|episodes]], as opposed to chapters, which are typically seen in novels. The term used in [[literature]] to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. [[episodic fiction|Serials]] are also known as [[episodic fiction]]. 

Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a [[Serial (radio and television)|series]] through a unifying [[story arc]]. Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same [[story world]].

'''Eranos''' is an intellectual discussion group dedicated to humanistic and religious studies, as well as to the natural sciences which has met annually in Moscia (Lago Maggiore), the Collegio Papio and on the Monte Verità in Ascona [[Switzerland]] since 1933.

It has also been the name for a circle of scholars at Heidelberg (Germany) in the early 20th century. Among others, Max Weber and Ernst Troeltsch were members of the "Heidelberg Eranos". 

The name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ἔρανος meaning "a [[banquet]] to which the guests bring contributions of food, a no-host dinner." The circle at Moscia was founded by [[Olga Froebe-Kapteyn]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eranosfoundation.org/FA61F37C-0CD0-4ABF-8231-D60361237AEA.html Eranos Foundation (History)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222231402/http://www.eranosfoundation.org/FA61F37C-0CD0-4ABF-8231-D60361237AEA.html |date=2009-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1933, and these conferences have been held annually on the grounds of her estate (on the shores of [[Lago Maggiore]] near [[Ascona]] in [[Switzerland]]) ever since. For over seventy years this event has served as a point of contact for thinkers from disparate fields of knowledge ranging from [[depth psychology]] and [[comparative religion]] to history, [[literary criticism]] and [[folklore]], and provides a setting and a congenial group within which to discuss all things spiritual. Each [[academic conference|conference]] takes place over eight days, during which time all participants eat, sleep and live together, thereby promoting a camaraderie which fosters an atmosphere of free and open discussion. Each year a new theme is addressed, and each participant scholar delivers a two-hour lecture on a topic of his choice relating to the theme &amp;mdash; his/her contribution to the ‘banquet’ of ideas &amp;mdash; thereby attempting to draw these multifarious thinkers into productive intellectual discourse.

==Eranos’ beginnings==
Froebe-Kapteyn established this group at the suggestion of the eminent German religious historian, [[Rudolf Otto]]. Froebe-Kapteyn was the Dutch foundress of the literary salon "Table Ronde" (''Round Table''), which is indicative of the Eranos’ ‘spiritualist’ bent. Indeed Eranos was from its very outset interested in these issues and its first theme, ‘Yoga and Meditation in East and West’, was a truly pioneering subject in the early 1930s. Past themes include Ancient Sun Cults and the Symbolism of Light in the Gnosis and in Early Christianity (1943), Man and Peace (1958), Creation and Organization (1966) and The Truth of Dreams (1995).  Participants over the years have included [[Heinrich Zimmer]] (Indian religious art), [[Karl Kerényi]] (Greek mythology), [[Mircea Eliade]] (history of religions), [[Carl Gustav Jung]] and [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] (analytical psychology), [[Alfons Rosenberg]] (symbolism), [[Gilles Quispel]] (gnostic studies), [[Gershom Scholem]] (Jewish mysticism), [[Henry Corbin]] (Islamic religion), [[Adolf Portmann]] (biology), [[Herbert Read]] (art history), [[Max Knoll]] (physics), and [[Joseph Campbell]] (comparative mythology).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aras.org/arasessay.aspx Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206061847/http://aras.org/arasessay.aspx |date=2006-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eranos conferences have resulted in the publication of a number of books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daimon.ch/Eranos List of published Eranos Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone may attend the lectures upon payment of a small fee.

[[File:Starr 070313-5603 Furcraea foetida.jpg|thumb|200px|Fique fibers are obtained from the leaves of ''[[Furcraea]]'' plants]]
'''Fique''' is a [[natural fibre]] that grows in the leaves of the fique plant, '''''Furcraea andina''''', a  [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] [[monocot]] native to [[Andes|Andean]] regions of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]]. From there its range was extended to [[Venezuela]] and  the east coast of [[Brazil]].  Common names include fique, cabuya, pita, penca, penco, maguey, cabui, chuchao and coquiza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewakulak.com/colombia/asi_es_colombia/la_magia_del_fique.html Ewa Kulak - La magia del fique&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fique plant  is often confused with the [[agave]] plant. The differences are that the agave leaves are stiff, with a strong spine at the tip, while the Fique plant leaves are droopy and lack a spine.

==History==
The [[pre-Columbian]] inhabitants extracted and used the fique fibs for several centuries before the arrival of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish conquerors]] to make garments, ropes, [[hammock]]s and many other applications.

In the 17th century, [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] colonists carried the plant from their [[Dutch Brazil|Brazilian colonies]] in [[Pernambuco]] to the island of [[Mauritius]].  The native inhabitants of the island learned to use the fibre and called it “caraguatá-acú” “croatá-acu” or “gravata”-acú”.

The fibre was also introduced to [[St. Helena]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Algeria]], [[Madagascar]], [[East Africa]], [[Mexico]] and [[Costa Rica]].

In the 18th century, in [[Dagua]], [[Valle del Cauca]], Colombia, the priest Feliciano Villalobos started the first rope and wrapping materials manufacturing industry; his products were made of fique. In 1880 the Colombian government reported a yearly production of three million kilograms of fibres, the exportation to Venezuela of two million, the fabrication of five millions pairs of [[alpargata]]s and four million metres of rope.

Between 1970 and 1975 the fique industry suffered a crisis brought about by the development of [[polypropylene]], which costs less and is produced faster.

Today, fique is considered the Colombian national fibre and is used in the fabrication of ethnic products, [[Colombian handicrafts]] and recently (since July 2007) has been used for the heat protectors (handmade in [[Barichara]]) placed around the [[Colombian coffee]] cups sold in the [[Juan Valdez]] coffee shops worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juanvaldezcafe.com/index.php?id=1465&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Cabuyahandcraft.jpg|thumb|300px|Cabuya handcrafted bag]] --&gt;
*Packing: The main use of the Colombian cabuya is for the fabrication of [[bag|sacks]] and packages for agriculture.   According with the number of threads, the products are classified as:
**Dense: 6000 to 10,000 threads per square metre.  Used for [[flour]] and small grains such [[rice]].
**Semidense: 4800 to 5500. Used for bigger grains such [[coffee]] and [[bean]]s.
**Loose: 300 to 360. Used for fruits, vegetables and [[panela]].
*Ropes: with cabuya one can make very resistant ropes and strings of different calibres, from threads to manilas one inch in diameter.  Such ropes are used in the industries of transportation, construction, sailing and many others.
*[[Arriería]] accessories: many of the elements used in the [[pack animal]]s, such as enjalmas, cinchas, retrancas, lazos, pretales, tapa de enjalma, and cinchos are handmade with fique.
*[[Tapestry]]: the mixed and crude cabuya is used in rugs and tapestry of different size and quality. The fibres can be stained with different organic materials, such as [[avocado]] seed, [[achiote]] and [[eucalyptus]] cortex.
*Others: handcrafts, purses, bags, handbags, [[mattress]]es, curtains, shoes, umbrellas, baskets and many other products.

=== Subproducts ===

*Pulp: Used to produce organic fertilizer and [[paper]]
*Leaves juice: Can be used for fabrication of [[soap]], [[fungicide]]s, [[alcoholic beverages]] (homemade [[tapetusa]]), organic fuel and animal [[food]].
*Floral stem: The strong floral stem of the fique plant is used in the construction of houses and ladders.
*Bulbs: The [[pickled]] terminal bulbs of the plant are edible.
*Medicinal uses: Peasants use the leaves in topic preparations for treatment of [[boil]]s. The extract of leaves is used against [[horse]] [[lice]].

==Cultivation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Fique2.jpg|thumb|Fique plant field in [[Guarne]]{{ifdc|Image:Fique2.jpg|log=2008 February 11}}]]  --&gt;

The fique can be obtained from several species of ''[[Furcraea]]'', such as ''[[Furcraea macrophylla|F. macrophylla]]'' Baker, cabuya Trel, andina Trel, and castilla.  Depending of the process of the fiber and the species used, many varieties of fique fibers can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;http://ces.unicauca.edu.co/archivos/aspectos_del_cultivo_del_fique.doc&lt;/ref&gt;  Among others:

=== Main varieties ===
*Ceniza (ash-colored)
*Espinosa (rough texture)
*Castilla or Golden border
*Sisal

=== Secondary  varieties ===
*Cabuya verde (green)
*Uña de águila (eagle nail)
*Negra común (black common)
*Chachagueña
*Genoia
*Tunosa común (common spiked)
*Jardineña
*Espadilla
*Rabo de chucha ([[opossum]] tail).

Optimal conditions for the growing of the fique plant are:

*Temperature: 19&amp;nbsp;°C – 23&amp;nbsp;°C
*Altitude: 1,300 m – 1,900 m
*Annual rainfall: 1,000&amp;nbsp;mm – 1,600&amp;nbsp;mm
*Sunlight: 5–6 hours/day
*Soil: dry, rich in [[silicate]]s.

Fique crops bring [[nitrogen]] to the soil, improving its fertility.  The plant is very adaptable to different ecological conditions. A fique plant can produce 1 to 6&amp;nbsp;kg of fiber each year.

==Diseases==

*Llaga macana or rayadilla: a viral disease that attacks all varieties of fique and all the parts of the plant, especially in crops over 1900 m altitude.  The disease has no chemical control.  It must be managed with preventive measures.
*Pink disease: caused by the [[fungus]] [[Corticium salmonicolor|''Corticium salmonicolor'']].  The disease damages the leaves, disrupting the fibers. Treatment is undertaken with [[copper]]-based fungicides.  Peasants treat this disease by applying ashes to the base of the leaves.
*Leaf [[cochineal]] ([[Diaspis bromeliae|''Diaspis bromelia'']]): caused by a parasitic [[insect]].
*Leaf beetle: a [[beetle]] that perforates the base of the leaves.

'''Game pie''' is a form of [[meat pie]] featuring [[Game (food)|game]]. The dish dates from Roman times when the main ingredients were wild birds and animals such as [[partridge]], [[pheasant]], [[deer]], and [[hare]]. The pies reached their most elaborate form in [[Victorian England]], with complex recipes and specialized [[Mold (cooking implement)|moulds]] and serving dishes. Modern versions are simpler but savoury combinations of [[rabbit]], [[venison]], [[pigeon]], pheasant, and other commercially available game.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hix [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/recipes/game-pie-516603.html Game pie]; Serves 4–6 26 November 2005 Independent&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

Game pies were consumed by the wealthy in the days of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Wilhelm Adolf Becker]] states that the emperor [[Augustus]] consumed pies that contained chicken, pheasants, pigeon, and duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Gallus: or, Roman scenes of the time of Augustus. With notes and excursuses illustrative of the manners and customs of the Romans |author=Frederick Metcalfeby |others=Frederick Metcalfe (trans.) |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1888 |page= 462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], "bake mete"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.godecookery.com/mtrans/mtrans24.htm |title=Medieval Recipe Translations - A bake Mete Ryalle |year=1888 |publisher= The Early English Text Society by N.

Take and make little pie shells, &amp; take Chicken boiled; or Pork boiled; or them both: take Cloves, Mace, Cubeb, &amp; hack all together, &amp; mix it with crumbled marrow, &amp; add just the right amount of Sugar; then place it a pie shell, &amp; in the middle place a piece of marrow, &amp; all over some Sugar, and let it bake; &amp; this is for a supper.}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a pie in which meat or fish is baked with fruit, spices, etc. The meats and sauces were placed in a tough and inedible pastry shell, or "coffin" with a lid sealed on, then baked. There was no pan: the pie shell itself acted as the container. Frequently the pastry was considered superfluous and was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory.htm |title=History of Pie |publisher=Linda Stradley – WhatsCookingAmerica |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of raising the sides of the pie to form a strong protective crust is described in old cookery books as "raising the coffin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The term "mete" referred to the pie, not the meat: a 15th-century cookbook gives a bake mete recipe for a pear custard pie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godecookery.com/nboke/nboke02.htm |title=A Bake Mete |publisher=Gode Cookery |accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the [[Franklin (class)|franklin]] in the 14th-century classic ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', [[Chaucer]] said: ''"Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous, Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentvous"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canterbury tales, Volume 1 |author=Geoffrey Chaucer |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; co. |year=1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best meat might be reserved for the wealthy, while their servants ate inferior pies made of the left-over "umbles" – liver, heart, tripes, and other offal, hence the term "eating [[humble pie]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=E. Cobham Brewer |title=Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1898) |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |ISBN=1-4192-1607-4 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times, birds that might be found in a game pie included [[heron]], [[Crane (bird)|crane]], [[crow]], [[swan]], [[stork]], [[cormorant]], and [[bittern]] as well as smaller birds trapped by nets such as [[thrushes]], [[starling]]s, and [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-food/medieval-game-birds.htm |title=Medieval Game Birds |publisher=Medieval Life and Times |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 15th-century cookery book ''Un Vyaunde furnez sanz nom de chare'' describes a [[croustade]] of veal, herbs, dates, and eggs baked in a coffin, but other sources describe croustades of chicken and pigeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godecookery.com/friends/frec82.htm |title=Crustade |publisher=Joyce Baldwin |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds were often placed on top of game pies as ornaments, or 'subtelties', a practice that continued into the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]]. An 1890s edition of ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' shows a game pie topped by a stuffed pheasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicfood.com/Pie%20recipe2.htm |title=Bake Metes and Mince Pies |publisher=Ivan Day (Historic Food)

==Tudor and Stuart periods==

Through most of the period of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[Stuart dynasty|Stuart]] monarchs, roughly from 1500 to 1685, it was common for the rulers and their courtiers to stage elaborate feasts where the attraction was as much the entertainment provided by musicians, comedians, jugglers and acrobats as the food itself. Sometimes the two were combined. Around 1630, at a dinner attended by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], a huge game pie was placed on the table. But when the crust was removed, a dwarf armed with sword and buckler sprang from the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=A book about the table

The game pies of that period were sweeter than in later times, often containing fruit as well as meat, game and spices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Tudor Christmas Pie was a rich pie of traditional birds such as partridge, chicken and goose with a recent addition, the turkey, which had been introduced to England from the [[New World]] in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Game pie was not restricted to the rich.
Until the 1816 Gaming act, country people had the right to catch small game such as rabbits and pigeons to supplement their diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More valuable game were reserved for the rich, but perhaps not entirely successfully. [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' alludes to a Venison pasty made from "ill-killed" deer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1653 [[François Pierre La Varenne]] published his groundbreaking work ''Le Pâtissier françois''. On the frontispiece is a country kitchen where the cook is making a game pie surrounded by the dead game that would have been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The large square pie, which was one of her son's favorite dishes, contains a variety of game birds and their livers, veal, pork, truffles, aspic, and much else, in puff pastry. It is described in the classic encyclopedia of [[gastronomy]], the [[Larousse Gastronomique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Golden age of game pies in England==
[[File:Substitutes for bread; - or - right honorables, saving the loaves, and dividing the fishes by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|330px|Substitutes for bread; – or – right honorables, saving the loaves, and dividing the fishes. By [[James Gillray]]]]
In the 18th century, game pies prepared for the prosperous gentry could be very elaborate. [[Hannah Glasse]], in her best-selling ''[[The Art of Cookery|The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy]]'', first published in 1747, gave a recipe for a Christmas pie that included pigeon, partridge, a chicken and a goose, all boned and placed one inside the other, and then placed within an enormous turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=The art of cookery made plain and easy |author=Hannah Glasse |publisher=Applewood Books |year=1998  |origyear=1747 |chapter=VIII Pies

&lt;blockquote&gt;She was a careful yet liberal housekeeper, and well skilled in cookery, pastry, and confectionery. I have heard of a pie she raised in the form of a goose trussed for the spit; the real goose was boned; a duck was boned and laid within it; a fowl was boned and laid within the duck; a boned partridge within the fowl; and a boned pigeon within the partridge. The whole having been properly seasoned, the interstices were filled with rich gravy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life of William Hutton: including a particular account of the riots at Birmingham in 1791; to which is subjoined, the history of his family |author=William Hutton, Catherine Hutton |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |year=1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Benjamin Disraeli]] in his novel ''[[Venetia (Disraeli novel)|Venetia]]'' describes an English dinner around 1770 that included &lt;blockquote&gt;...that masterpiece of the culinary art, a great [[battalia pie]], in which the bodies of chickens, pigeons, and rabbits, were embalmed in spices, cock's combs, and savoury balls, and well bedewed with one of those rich sauces of claret, anchovy, and sweet herbs ... [on] the cover of this pastry ... the curious cook had contrived to represent all the once-living forms that were now entombed in that gorgeous sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Venetia, Volume 7 of Bradenham edition of the novels and tales |author=[[Benjamin Disraeli]]
 |publisher=Read Books |year=2006 |ISBN=1-4067-3661-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At some point, it became customary for game pies to be served cold. An enormous game pie was made for the [[Earl of Sefton]] in the first part of the 19th century to be presented to the corporation of [[Liverpool]]. It contained a great variety of game, stuffed one bird within another, as well as truffles, veal, bacon and other ingredients. The meats were first cooked, then cooled with ice and placed in a huge pastry shell with a crust, which was further cooked for three hours. After pouring a hot aspic sauce into the pie through a funnel, it was allowed to cool again for two days before being served cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[All the Year Round]], Volumes 19-20 |editor=Charles Dickens |year=1868 |page= 564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1845 cookbook ''The practical cook, English and foreign'' describes similar game pies of chickens, pigeons, partridges, hares, rabbits, pheasants, gray plovers, grouse, wild fowls or small birds, which may have slices of ham added. With all of these, calf's foot jelly or the bone of a knuckle of veal stewed down to a jelly was added to form aspic when the pie was cooled. The cold pie would then be sliced and served in the same way as its relative, the modern [[pork pie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The practical cook, English and foreign: containing a great variety of old receipts, improved and re-modelled, and many original receipts in English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Polish, Dutch, American, Swiss, and Indian cookery ; with copious directions for the choice of all provisions |author=Joseph Bregion, Anne Miller |publisher=Chapman and Hall |page=191 |year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moulds and dishes==

In the second half of the 18th century, potters such as [[Josiah Wedgwood]] introduced industrial processes that made it practical to mass-produce glazed pottery containers capable of withstanding the heat of the oven, at relatively low prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Josiah Wedgwood, F. R. S.: his personal history |author=Samuel Smiles |publisher=John Murray |year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a suggestion by [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]] in 1786, Wedgwood started making game pie dishes with an inner liner to hold the contents and an ornamental cover. These were a useful alternative to the traditional pastry coffin, since there were endemic shortages of wheat at this time caused by the early [[industrial revolution]] coupled with the disruption of trade during the [[Napoleonic wars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldandinteresting.com/game-pie-dish.aspx |title=Game pie dish |publisher=Old and Interesting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wedgwood's dishes often had raised bas-relief ornaments of dead game and vine leaves, and a lid handle often modeled on a hare or root vegetable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wedgwoodmuseum.org.uk/collections/online/2219/object/2467 |title=Game pie dish – 1869 |publisher=Wedgwood Museum |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some designs gave the illusion of a pastry coffin and lid. William Jesse in his 1844 biography of Beau Brummel says this design was introduced in 1800 when the royal household prohibited the use of flour for pastry in their kitchens, using rice instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life of George Brummell, esq., commonly called Beau Brummell, Volume 1 |author=William Jesse |publisher=READ BOOKS |year=2008 |ISBN=1-4437-0391-5 |page= 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the sprung metal pie form made it possible to use a finer pastry than the old-fashioned [[hot water crust pastry]], and also to impart much finer decorative detail to the surface of the pastry. The [[Mold (cooking implement)|moulds]] were sold in many different designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicfood.com/Pie%20recipe.htm |title=Pies and Chewitts |publisher=Ivan Day |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potter [[Mintons|Herbert Minton]] introduced [[Victorian majolica|Majolica]] wares in 1851, earthenware ceramics decorated with relief figures and brilliant glazes. Until not long before, only the aristocracy and the gentry had had the right to consume game and there were still many restrictions. Expensive Majolica game pie dishes, draped with images of sumptuous game animals, were used by aspiring middle-class families to signal that they had the wealth or connections to obtain the game that they served to their guests legally rather than through the black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegavel.net/majolica.html |title=Victorian Views of Nature Revealed in Majolica |author=Jeffrey B. Snyder |publisher=Unravel The Gavel |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Victorians and the 20th century==

As the [[Victorian age]] advanced, the middle classes grew rapidly, with aspirations to a lifestyle that had been reserved to the privileged few. Pioneers such as [[Alexis Soyer]] introduced new cooking techniques for the masses based on scientific principles and gas ovens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relish: The Extraordinary Life of Alexis Soyer, Victorian Celebrity Chef |author=Ruth Cowen |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=2008 |ISBN=0-297-64562-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mrs. Beeton]] addressed a broad audience in her 1861 ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|Book of Household Management]]'', giving simple recipes for grouse and partridge pie and for preparing other common game such as wild duck, hare, [[corn-crake]], pheasant, plovers, ptarmigan, quail, venison, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsbeeton.com/23-chapter23.html |title=Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management: Chapter 23 – Game Recipes |publisher=mrsbeeton.com |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game pie gradually waned in snob appeal and popularity. In ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]'', [[P.G. Wodehouse]] notes that [[Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright]] once hit the game pie at the [[Drones Club|Drones]] six times with six consecutive bread rolls from a seat at the far window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The mating season |author=Pelham Grenville Wodehouse |publisher=Overlook Press |year=2002 |ISBN=1-58567-231-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''[[Vile Bodies]]'', a novel about the period between the first and second world wars, [[Evelyn Waugh]] describes the game pie at Shepheard's, a fictional club, as "quite black inside and full of beaks and shot and inexplicable vertebrae".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vile bodies |author=Evelyn Waugh |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=1988 |ISBN=0-86307-691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern variants==
[[File:Game pie.jpg|thumb|right|Game pie as served in a cafe in [[Leith]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]]]
Many restaurants today serve game pies and there are many modern recipes,  but they are usually quite different from the traditional cold game pie. Commonly they contain a savoury stew of commercially available meats such as rabbit and venison, quail and pheasant, but not birds such as pigeons, thrushes, starlings, blackbirds, and crows that were commonly used in the past. They are usually served hot, and may have no shell but only a pastry cover – or in restaurants only a puff-pastry lid added at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/gamepie_8555.shtml

'''Gaye holud''' ({{Lang-bn|গায়ে হলুদ}} ''[[Romanization of Bengali|gaee holud]]'' lit. "yellow/turmeric on the body") is a [[ceremony]] observed mostly in the region of [[Bengal]] (comprising [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]).  It is part of an elaborate series of celebrations constituting the [[Bengali wedding (disambiguation)|Bengali wedding]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;. It originates from the Hindu wedding religious ceremony where Lord Shiva and his bride Sati were applied with Haldi to cool the couple and make them look even more beautiful. Later adopted in the Indian subcontinent as a wedding ritual and celebration by different communities (often called Haldi in the western Hindu communities), it continued in different religions down generations. The gaye holud takes place one or two days prior to the religious and legal Bengali wedding ceremonies. The gaye holud may be a joint event for the bride and groom's families, or it may consist of separate events for the bride's family and the groom's family. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaye Holud|url= 
http://www.thebdbride.com/2014/07/bangladeshi-wedding-traditions-gaye.html?m=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate events are held for the [[bride]]'s gaye holud, the [[Bridegroom|groom]]'s family - minus the groom himself - go in procession to the bride's home. They carry with them the bride's wedding outfit and jewelry, wedding decorations such as the [[turmeric]] paste ({{Lang-bn|হলুদ}} ''holud'') and [[henna]] ({{Lang-bn|মেহেদি or মেন্দি}} ''mehedi''/''mendi''), cosmetics, sweets and other gifts. They may also bring fresh fish dressed as a wedding couple, or desserts molded to resemble fish. The procession traditionally centers on the bride's (younger) female relatives and friends, who traditionally dress in matching clothes. The bride, her attendees, and all the guests traditionally wear red, yellow, orange, or green clothing. Nowadays, other colours may be permitted for gaye holud guests. The guests then enjoy a feast, including music, dance and some performances, arranged by the bride's family.
[[File:Gaye holud, RAOWA Convention Hall.jpg|thumb|A girl is dancing in her turmeric ceremony.]]
The bride is seated on a [[dais]], and the henna is used to decorate her hands and feet with elaborate abstract designs. The turmeric paste is applied by the guests to her face and body. Turmeric is known to cleanse, soften and brighten the skin, giving the bride's skin the distinctive yellow hue that gives its name to this ceremony. The sweets are then fed to the bride by all the guests and attendants, piece by piece.

The groom's gaye holud comes next, and has the same form as the bride's holud ceremony. In this ceremony, the bride does not participate. The groom is accompanied by his younger male relatives and friends, and as with the bride's ceremony, the guests traditionally wear red, yellow, green, or orange clothing. The bride's family brings the gifts for the groom (usually the wedding outfit and some grooming items, along with the turmeric and other gifts) to his house. The guests exchange sweets with and apply turmeric paste to the groom, and a feast (with food, music, dance, and various cultural performances) is arranged for the guests from the groom's family. Unlike the bride, the groom does not get henna applied to his body; henna is only applied to the bride and perhaps also some of her younger female attendants.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Although similar ceremonies exist in other parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the gaye holud is a custom particular to the [[Bengali people]]. It is not considered a [[religion|religious]] function, as it is celebrated by [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Hindu]]s, and [[Christian]]s in both Bangladesh and Indian West Bengal. Although it is considered a part of the Bengali wedding tradition, the couple is not considered married at the end of the gaye holud. There is no legal marriage performed during this ceremony. Unlike the wedding ceremonies, the gaye holud is not a formal or extravagant event; both guests and bridal party members dress more simply and decorate the venue less intricately than at the wedding ceremonies.

'''Hellmouth''' is the entrance to [[Hell]] envisaged as the gaping mouth of a huge monster, an image which first appears in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], and then spread all over Europe, remaining very common in depictions of the ''[[Last Judgment]]'' and ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'' until the end of the [[Middle Ages]], and still sometimes used during the [[Renaissance]] and after.  It enjoyed something of a revival in polemical [[popular print]]s after the [[Protestant Reformation]], when figures from the opposite side would be shown disappearing into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bp2.blogger.com/_xQwP8MNj0EA/R4l1kyLEs5I/AAAAAAAAEQE/k52KOuTH_Dg/s1600-h/Lucas+Cranach+der+J%C3%BCngere+%281515+-+1586%29-+Abendmahl+der+Protestanten+und+H%C3%B6llensturz+der+Katholiken.gif Example by Cranach, 1545]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable late appearance is in the two versions of a painting by [[El Greco]] of about 1578.&lt;ref&gt;Variously called ''The Adoration of the Name of Jesus'' ([[National Gallery, London]])[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng6260 image], ''The Dream of Philip II'' or ''Allegory of the Battle of Lepanto'' ([[Escurial]]).[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:El_Greco_056.jpg image]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political cartoon]]s still showed [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] leading his troops into one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bp3.blogger.com/_xQwP8MNj0EA/R46yoyLEuDI/AAAAAAAAEZU/Qp53qokKvNM/s1600-h/1799.jpg from first external link]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medieval theatre]] often had a hellmouth  [[Theatrical property|prop]] or [[mechanical device]] which was used to attempt to scare the audience by vividly dramatizing an entrance to [[Hell]].  These seem often to have featured a [[battlement]]ed castle entrance, in painting usually associated with [[Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecclsoc.org/mouthofhell.html The Ecclesiological Society] ''Dooms and the mouth of hell in the late medieval period'' with pictures including two Renaissance stagings.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest example of an animal Hellmouth known to [[Meyer Schapiro]] was an ivory carving of c. 800 in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and he says most examples before the 12th century are English.  Many show the [[Harrowing of Hell]], which appealed to Anglo-Saxon taste, as a successful military raid by Christ. Schapiro speculates that the image may have drawn from the pagan myth of the [[Crack of Doom]], with the mouth that of the wolf-monster [[Fenrir]], slain by [[Vidar]], who is used as a symbol of Christ on the [[Gosforth Cross]] and other pieces of [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meyer Schapiro]], "Cain's Jaw-Bone that Did the First Murder", Selected Papers, volume 3, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, pp. 257-9 and notes, Chatto &amp; Windus, London, {{ISBN|0-7011-2514-4}} [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3046829 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the assimilation of Christianised [[Viking]] populations in northern England, the Church was surprisingly ready to allow the association of pagan mythological images with Christian ones, in [[hogback (sculpture)|hogback]] grave markers for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klayperson.com/writing/hogbacks.htm The Anglo-Scandinavian Hogback: A Tool for Assimilation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anglo-Saxon [[Vercelli Homilies]] (4:46-8) Satan is likened to a [[dragon]] swallowing the damned:

"... ne cumaþ þa næfre of þæra wyrma seaðe &amp; of þæs dracan ceolan
þe is Satan nemned." - "[they] never come out of the pit of snakes and of the throat of the dragon which is called Satan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10023/498 Petra Hofmann (thesis)]''Infernal Imagery in Anglo-Saxon Charters'', p. 85, St Andrews, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The whale-monster [[Leviathan]] (translated from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Book of Job|Job]] 41:1, "wreathed animal") has been equated with this description, although this is hard to confirm in the earliest appearances.  However, in ''[[The Whale (poem)|The Whale]]'', an [[Old English]] poem from the [[Exeter Book]], the mouth of Hell is compared to a whale's mouth: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The whale has another trick: when he is hungry, he opens his mouth and a sweet smell comes out.  The fish are tricked by the smell and they enter into his mouth.  Suddenly the whale’s jaws close.

Likewise, any man who lets himself be tricked by a sweet smell and led to sin will go into hell, opened by the devil — if he has followed the pleasures of the body and not those of the spirit.  When the devil has brought them to hell, he clashes together the jaws, the gates of hell.  No one can get out from them, just as no fish can escape from the mouth of the whale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fred.wheatonma.edu/wordpressmu/mdrout/category/whale/ translation by Michael DC Drout]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in the Middle Ages the classical [[Cerberus]] also became associated with the image, although it is hardly likely that the Anglo-Saxons had him in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Satan himself is often shown sitting in Hell eating the damned, but according to G.D. Schmidt this is a separate image, and the Hellmouth should not be considered to be the mouth of Satan, although Hofmann is inclined to disagree with this.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 85&lt;/ref&gt; The Hellmouth never bites the damned, remaining wide open, ready for more.

In late medieval works by [[Hieronymous Bosch]] and his followers, where the wide interior of Hell is shown, there is often a Hellmouth leading to some special compartment.

An '''interocitor''' is a fictional multi-functional device that first appeared in the 1949 story "The Alien Machine", which became the beginning four chapters of the 1952 novel [[This Island Earth (novel)|''This Island Earth'']], which in turn was made into the 1955 [[science fiction film]] ''[[This Island Earth]]''.&lt;ref name=Westfahl&gt;{{cite book |last=Westfahl |first=Gary |author-link=Gary Westfahl |title=Science Fiction, Children's Literature, and Popular Culture: Coming of Age in Fantasyland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlxJKBEEG9QC |chapter=Chapter 5: From the Back of the Head to Beyond the Moon: The Novel and Film ‘’This Island Earth’’ |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlxJKBEEG9QC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |publication-date=January 1, 2000 |page=49 |isbn=978-0313308475 |access-date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FictionDBInterocitor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fictiondb.com/author/raymond-f-jones~this-island-earth~109058~b.htm |title=This Island Earth |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=FictionDB |access-date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesInterocitor&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Raymond F. |year=1952 |title=This Island Earth |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/This_island_earth.html?id=txo3AAAAIAAJ |publisher=[[Shasta Publishers]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=txo3AAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=interocitor 31, 43, 78, et al] |access-date=February 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device arrives in kit form as an intelligence test for scientists who might prove helpful to an alien race.

== ''This Island Earth'' ==
An interocitor is an alien device with unusual and strange properties. The concept was invented by science fiction writer [[Raymond F. Jones]], who wrote the original novel ''This Island Earth'' beginning as a series of three sci-fi short stories now known as "The Peace Engineers Trilogy"{{citation needed|reason=Unable to find a reliable source for this name|date=February 2015}} appearing in the sci-fi pulp magazine ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' from 1949 to 1951. Raymond F. Jones then did a novelization of the complete story into full book form and it was first published in 1952 by Shasta Press. Universal Studios purchased the screen rights to the novel in 1953, since the novel was a popular sci-fi best seller, and made it into a Technicolor film in 1954, which was then released on June 1, 1955. The film was a modest success and has somewhat impressive visual effects. The first third of the trilogy of stories was titled "The Alien Machine," referring to the Interocitor,&lt;ref name=Westfahl/&gt; with original graphic artwork penned by sci-fi artist [[Virgil Finlay]].{{citation needed|reason=unable to find a reliable source for this statement about Finlay|date=February 2015}} The story was sold to the press with the help of literary agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]].

The term ''interocitor'' itself, rather than referring to a specific device, likely refers to a general class of devices that share a common set of operating principles (similar to the term ''computer''). This is inferred from the fact an interocitor is observed or described in many different roles:
* Telecommunications device
* Aircraft autopilot
* Surveillance and security controller
* Directed energy weapon

In the film, advanced physicist Cal Meacham first becomes aware of an interocitor when a book arrives at his lab titled ''Electronic Service, Unit #16''. Inside is contained a bill of materials for the interocitor, describing it as, "incorporating greater advances than hitherto known in the field of electronics." From the specifications, Meacham opines, "There's no limit to what it could do. Laying a four-lane highway at the rate of a mile a minute would be a cinch."

Of the 2486 components making up an interocitor, only three are mentioned by name in the film:
* Bead condenser (model # AB-619)
* Cathermin tube with an indium complex of +4
* Intensifier disk

The instructions accompanying the components also caution that no interocitor part can be replaced, and to bear this in mind while assembling.

Once assembled and powered, Meacham places the intensifier disk into the right-hand control and rotates it 18 degrees counter-clockwise. Upon doing so, the telecommunication function of the interocitor is activated, and Meacham establishes contact with Exeter, the party responsible for sending him the components for the device.

During their conversation, Meacham's lab assistant, Joe Wilson, attempts to photograph the device but is informed by Exeter that, "Your camera will pick up nothing but black fog. Images on the interocitor don't register on film."  Exeter then destroys all evidence of the machine and its blueprints using its functionality as a guided energy weapon{{snd}} Meacham tries to pull the power cord just as Exeter initiates the process, but the interocitor self-destructs, leaving nothing but a pile of debris.

Meacham later boards a [[Douglas DC-3]] autopiloted by an interocitor to join Exeter at his research facility. Exeter is also seen using an interocitor to remotely observe a private conversation between Meacham and two other scientists at the facility, Ruth Adams and Steve Carlson. Exeter's assistant, Brack, later uses the weapons capability of the device to thwart the attempted escape of Meacham, Adams, and Carlson from the facility.

== Other appearances ==
* In the game ''[[Borderlands 2]]'', the character Gaige claimed in her personal ECHO recordings that her project (that would eventually be known as Deathtrap) would make her classmate Marcie Holloway's miniature thermosonic generator look like an interocitor. Given the interociter's status as something beyond the current understanding of technology, it is unclear how this constitutes an insult.
* ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie]]'' contained a version of ''[[This Island Earth]]''. About halfway through the film, [[Tom Servo]] reveals that he has his own interocitor, which the crew uses in an attempt to return to Earth. However, they are foiled first by the inept Metalunan whom they contact, and then by the intervention of Dr. Forrester, who attacks them with his own interocitor.
* A small interocitor is seen, used, and mentioned by name in the 2011 film, ''[[Attack of the Moon Zombies]],'' the sixth in writer/director Christopher R. Mihm's "Mihmiverse" series of modern-made, 1950s-style B-movies.
* In the computer-generated television series ''[[ReBoot]]'', the interocitor was a component which frequently broke on the (flying) car of the main protagonist, [[ReBoot#Bob|Bob]].
* In the 2003 film ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', the mad scientist found in the California desert is looking for an interocitor that she misplaced.
* In the video game ''[[Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude]]'', an interocitor can be seen in the science lab below the library. When examined, Larry will remark "I wonder where the candy comes out."
* The interocitor is the name of a device in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', involving quantum telecommunication across time and space. It is named specifically as a reference to this film, and this is mentioned by the Doctor (Peter Davison) during the story. This is in the 2007 audio play ''[[Renaissance of the Daleks]]''; it is also mentioned in the [[8th Doctor]] audio story ''Lucie Miller''.
* In the novel ''Caves of Ice'' by Sandy Mitchell, set in the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' universe, the Adeptus Mechanicus techpriest Logash remarks that the expedition into the tunnels 'beats recalibrating interociters (sic).'
* The short story, ''A Great Moon Hoax or; A Princess of Mars'' by [[Ben Bova]], starts with an interocitor being operated by a Martian and an American industrialist to watch old baseball games. The short story is available in "Laugh Lines," a collection of short stories available from Baen Books [https://www.webscription.net/p-769-laugh-lines.aspx].
* An interocitor appeared in the [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] 1989 film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and in the [[music video]] for his song [[Dare to be Stupid (song)|Dare to be Stupid]] with black and white footage of men [[yo-yo]]ing.
* In the 1989 film ''[[Arena (1989 film)|Arena]]'', a damaged battle droid near the beginning of the film needs a new interocitor unit to be fully repaired.
* The 1996 novel ''Elocution Engine'', by Malcolm Sadwell, describes a Maximal Interociter, which the main character must master to control a huge flock of birds of different species.
* An interocitor is referenced in the setup of the Kelly LeBrock creation in the 1985 film ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]''.
* In several books by [[Robert Rankin]] the inter-rositor is used as part of a running gag often used as a generic MacGuffin to describe away technological plot points.  Most notably in the book ''[[The Suburban Book of the Dead (Armageddon III: The Remake)]]'' in which the full title of the character Byron Vegan is "Inter-rositor Prestidigitent KK Byron Wheeler-Vegan" and who spends much of the plot being passed from pillar to post failing to request a service replacement on an Inter-Rositor which has "a 2 micron downgrade on its lateral augmenter."
* Dynacon Canada (now MCSI) called the controller of its ''[[Attitude control system|ACS]]'' on ''[[FedSat]]'' an interocitor as an ''[[Easter egg (media)|Easter Egg]]''.

The '''Kharkiv school of psychology''' (''Харьківска психологічна школа'') is a tradition of developmental psychological research conducted in the paradigm of [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s "sociocultural theory of mind" and [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|Leontiev's]] psychological [[activity theory]].

== Kharkiv group: the beginning of the school ==
The school was founded by its leader [[Alexander Luria]], who—along with [[Mark Lebedinsky]] and [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|Alexei Leont'ev]]—moved from Moscow to [[Kharkiv]], the capital of Soviet [[Ukraine]] at that time. The core of the group was formed by Luria, Lebedinsky and Leontiev and their Moscow colleagues, [[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]] and Bozhovich, along with a group of such local researchers as Gal'perin, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], Lukov, Khomenko, Kontsevaya, Rozenblyum, etc. The group conducted a wide range of psychological studies on concept formation in children, voluntary and involuntary memory, development of visual-operational thinking, voluntary behaviour, and reasoning, the role of orientation in thought and activity, etc. that laid the foundation for the psychological [[activity theory|theory of activity]].

== P. I. Zinchenko and the Kharkiv school of developmental psychology ==
In the postwar period, the scientific work of the school developed under informal leadership of [[Pyotr Zinchenko]] in the field of the psychology of memory. The major achievement of the school is the systematic analysis of the phenomenon of [[involuntary memory]] from the standpoint of the [[activity theory|activity approach]] in psychology. Soviet studies of involuntary memory carried out by the representatives of the Kharkiv school influenced psychological research both nationally and worldwide (e.g., memory research by [[Ann Brown|A. Brown]], Murphy, Meacham, Sophian, Hagen, etc.).

The [[information processing]] or [[engineering psychology]] approach to memory and cognition was developed in the research by Zinchenko, Bocharova, Nevel'skii, Repkina. On the other hand, research on the role of involuntary memory in education and memory in thinking and personality development was conducted by Sereda, Ivanova, and associates.

Another major area of research is the theory and practice of developmental teaching (or the system of El'konin-Davydov) associated with such representatives of the Kharkiv school as Repkin, Bodanskii, Dusavitskii.

'''Language politics in Francoist Spain''' centered on attempts in [[Francoist Spain|Spain under Franco]] to increase the dominance of the [[Spanish language]] (Castilian) over the other [[languages of Spain]].
The regime of [[Francisco Franco]] had [[Spanish nationalism]] as one of its bases.&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;
[[Sebastian Balfour]], "Spain from 1931 to the Present", in ''Spain: a History'', edited by
[[Raymond Carr]].  Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0198206194}}. (p. 266).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his dictatorship, the Spanish language (known in some parts of Spain as ''castellano'', i.e., ''Castilian'') was declared Spain's only [[official language]].
The public use of other languages was either banned,&lt;ref&gt;The use Catalan was banned for the on-duty functionaries of the province of Barcelona in 1940. Cf. {{cite book|last=Mariño Paz|first=Ramón|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=84-7824-333-X|pages=353|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; discouraged or frowned upon depending on the particular circumstances and timing, while the use of non Castilian names for newborns was forbidden in 1938, except for foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;"disposición do ''Boletín Oficial del Estado'' do 18 de maio pola que, advertindo que "La España de Franco no puede tolerar AGRESIONES CONTRA LA UNIDAD DE SU IDIOMA, ni la intromisión de nombres que pugnan con su nueva constitución política (...) tratándose de españoles, los nombres deberán consignarse en castellano""{{cite book|last=Mariño Paz|first=Ramón|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=84-7824-333-X|pages=353|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
The situation evolved from the harshest years of the immediate afterwar (especially the 1940s, also the 1950s) to the relative tolerance of the last years (late 1960s and early 1970s); Franco died in 1975, and his successor [[Juan Carlos of Spain]] began the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].

==Previous situation==
For the first time in the history of Spain, the [[Second Republic (Spain)|Second Republic]] recognised [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] as official languages when it granted autonomy for some regions with a regional language.
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

==The Spanish language==
[[File:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|right|300px]] 
As part of the nationalistic efforts:
* [[Spanish film]]s were produced only in Spanish. All foreign films were required to be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]], and all films originally produced in the languages of [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] were required to be re-issued in Spanish.
* [[Spanish names]] and Spanish versions of Catholic and classical names were the only ones allowed. Leftist names like ''[[Lenin|Lenín]]'' and regional names like even the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''[[George (given name)|Jordi]]'' (after Catalonia's patron saint, [[Saint George]]) were forbidden and even forcibly replaced in official records. Only Christian names in Spanish were allowed in official documents.

In the first decade of Franco's rule, languages other than Castilian were "confined to private spaces".&lt;ref name="sb" /&gt;

In the regime's most radical discourse, languages other than Spanish were often considered "[[dialect]]s" in the sense of speeches that were not developed enough to be "real [[language]]s". [[Basque language|Basque]] was different enough that it could not be taken as a debased form of Spanish but was despised as a rural language of limited currency, unfit for modern discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Baker, Sylvia Prys Jones, 
''Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education'', (1998), Multilingual Matters (pp. 285-6).&lt;/ref&gt; This never happened at the academic level, though.

All these policies became less strict and more permissive as time passed.

==Evolution==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The Press Law of [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne]] replaced the pre-publication censorship with after-the-fact punishments.

==Situation by areas==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}

Most notably, several sporting organizations -- including [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Athletic Bilbao]], among others -- were forced to change their names from the local language to Spanish. In fact, [[Atlético Madrid]], itself with roots in Athletic Bilbao, received its current name as a result of Franco's language policies, in 1941. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">{{About|the [[Superseded scientific theories|obsolete theory]] of inheritance|the empirically validated genetic phenomenon|Maternal effect}}
The conception of a '''maternal impression''' rests on the belief that a powerful mental (or sometimes physical) influence working on the mother's mind may produce an impression, either general or definite, on the child she is carrying.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock Ellis, ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', vol. 5 p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The child might be said to be "marked" as a result.

==Medicine==
Maternal impression, according to a [[obsolete scientific theory|long-discredited]] [[medicine|medical]] theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of [[birth defect]]s and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an [[emotion]]al [[stimulation|stimulus]] experienced by a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman could influence the development of the [[fetus]]. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]] was frightened by an [[elephant]] during her pregnancy, thus "imprinting" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression|depression]], were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great [[sadness]] might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb.

The theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern [[genetics|genetic theory]].

==Folklore==
In [[folklore]], maternal imprinting, or '''Versehen'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (a [[German language|German]] noun meaning "inadvertance" or as a verb "to provide") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.

[[Oswald Spengler]] understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called "blood feeling" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is called the ''Versehen'' of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would "prove" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on ''one bodily ideal'', so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald, The Decline of the West, Knopf, NYC, 1928, vol. 2 p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] also comments at length about the phenomenon of ''postpartum'' maternal impression in bears, i.e., the folk belief that newborn bears must be licked and molded into bear-shape by their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny Natural History VIII:126&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2064">'''Mela Chiraghan''' or '''Mela Shalimar''' ({{lang-pa|{{Nastaliq|میلہ چراغاں}}}}; "Festival of Lights") is a three-day annual festival to mark the [[urs]] (death anniversary) of the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] poet and [[Sufi]] saint [[Shah Hussain]] (1538-1599) who lived in Lahore in the 16th century. It takes place at the shrine of Shah Hussain in [[Baghbanpura]], on the outskirts of [[Lahore]], Pakistan, adjacent to the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]].&lt;ref name=apna/&gt; The festival also used to take place in the Shalimar Gardens, until President [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] ordered against it in 1958.

The festival used to be the largest festival in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], but now comes second to [[Basant (season)|Basant]]. Common peasants, [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers, the Punjabi [[Sikh]] residents and even the British officers during their [[British Raj]]
used to show up at this festival. [[Maharaja Ranjeet Singh]] (13 Nov 1780-27 June 1839) had high respect for this 16th century [[sufi]] saint Shah Hussain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1248883, Mela Chiraghan article with many pictures from the festival on [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper, Published 4 April 2016, Retrieved 19 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the early half of the 19th century, during the Sikh ruling period in Punjab, Maharaja Ranjeet Singh used to lead a procession from the [[Lahore Fort]] to this festival site.&lt;ref name=apna&gt;http://apnaorg.com/articles/news-1/, An article on Mela Chiraghan on Academy of the Punjab in North America (APNA) website, Published 29 March 2005, Retrieved 19 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MicroMasters''' programs are a series of [[Massive open online course|online graduate level courses]] launched by [[edX]] that one can take to develop standalone skills for career advancement or earn [[Microdegree|graduate level credentials]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamgordon/2018/02/13/voice-of-employers-rings-out-as-moocs-go-from-education-to-qualification/#3b27ffd2564b|title='MicroMasters' Surge As MOOCs Go From Education To Qualification|last=Gordon|first=Adam|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; from its respective universities, equivalent to a semester of a full master's degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/college-online-degree-blended-learning/557642/|title=The Future of College Looks Like the Future of Retail|last=Selingo|first=Jeffrey|date=2018-04-16|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was designed to be the bridge between a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, allowing employees to continue advancing their education without affecting their employment and personal commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/micromasters-degree-4149968|title=MicroMasters: The Bridge Between a Bachelor’s Degree and a Graduate Degree|last=Williams|first=Terri|date=2017-11-19|website=ThoughtCo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First launched in September 2016 with 19 MicroMasters programs as an extension of its [[Mooc|MOOC]], edX eventually expanded to include 17 additional programs in February 2017. As of November 2018, 51 different MicroMasters programs are being offered, with 47 in English, 3 in Spanish, and 1 in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edx.org/micromasters|title=MicroMasters Programs {{!}} edX|date=2016-08-15|work=edX|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each MicroMasters program is sponsored by at least one industry partner, including [[General Electric|GE]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Hootsuite]], [[Fidelity International|Fidelity]], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], [[Walmart]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PWC]], [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz-Allen Hamilton]], and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamgordon/2018/02/13/voice-of-employers-rings-out-as-moocs-go-from-education-to-qualification/#39c0fc72564b|title='MicroMasters' Surge As MOOCs Go From Education To Qualification|last=Gordon|first=Adam|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to bridge the gap between job candidates with a bachelor's degree and companies that want employees with an advanced degree by offering credentials that are equivalent to 25 to 50 percent of a master's degree or 20 to 30 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodcall.com/news/micromasters-next-stop-graduate-degrees-09048|title=MicroMasters: The Next Big Thing After a Bachelor’s Degree?|last=Williams|first=Terri|date=2016-10-21|website=GoodCall|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other existing microcredentials, the MicroMasters programs offer both the benefit of gaining relevant skills in a particular field that can support career development and a pathway to advanced credits in the respective universities offering the course. This includes many of the top universities in the world such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Columbia University]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Indian Institutes of Management|Indian Institute of Management]]. The idea of the MicroMasters program started out as an iteration of the existing MOOC model when [[Coursera]] first started offering specializations for its various disciplines and a response to the changing nature of work as well as the [[Skills mismatch|major skills shortage]] currently impacting businesses around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/reflecting-original-big-idea-moocs|title=Reflecting on the Original Big Idea for MOOCs {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|website=www.insidehighered.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Structure ==

=== Prerequisites ===
All MicroMasters programs are currently running on the edX MOOC platform, where learners are free to audit any of the courses. Depending on the program, there are prerequisites ranging from graduate level understanding of various specific disciplines or work experienced. However, these prerequisites serve as recommended guidelines for the learners rather than a strictly enforced rule so there are no specific degree requirements for any of the courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/14/skip-college-and-go-to-graduate-school-with-new-mit-program.html|title=Here's how to skip college and go straight to grad school—at MIT|last=Montag|first=Ali|date=2017-07-14|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, learners will have to pay if they wish to pursue a verified certificate.

=== Certification ===
To qualify for a certificate for successfully completing a MicroMasters Program, all learners are required to complete a series of [[Interactive course|interactive courses]] as specified in the respective MicroMasters program and achieve a minimum grade according to the institution awarding the certification.  

For learners interested in developing skills for professional advancement, the certificate for completing a MicroMasters Program may be sufficient.

=== Continuing Education ===
For learners interested in academic credit, the learner must be admitted into the university's respective master's program. Some programs, such as the MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management by MIT also operate on a [[blended learning]] model which include a timed examination as well as a final proctored examination. Admission requirements for its on-campus blended learning program differ from its traditional residential admission requirements as applicants are not required to submit scores in a [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] or [[Graduate Management Admission Test|GMAT]] as performance in the Micromasters program will be taken as a substitute for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scm.mit.edu/blended-admissions|title=SCMb Masters Degree Admissions {{!}} MIT Supply Chain Management|website=scm.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other programs still follow usual admission guidelines and the MicroMasters program has little to no impact on their application apart from receiving advanced credits upon admission into its respective programs. Generally, most courses include practice exercises which are ungraded as well as graded assignments with limited attempts.

The following is a list of the current MicroMasters programs offered as well as the respective graduate degree options available for each program upon graduation of the MicroMasters program.

[[File:Mobile Office on the Streets of London (255640834).jpg|thumb|Mobile Office on the Streets of London.]]
A '''mobile office''' is an office built within a truck, [[motorhome]], trailer or purpose built [[intermodal container|shipping container]]. Most common are towable offices built on an axled iron frame for easy relocation. Mobile field offices are often found on [[construction site]]s, or at [[disaster]] scenes where a temporary office space is needed. Typically, mobile offices in North America feature a single phase split (240 volt center-tapped) electric service that is connected to a nearby source of power, to run small window-unit air conditioners, and the like. There are many types of companies that sell, lease, rent new and used [[intermodal container|storage containers]], [[portable building]]s or [[modular building]]s. This type of construction shortens the construction period as the building can be built in a factory in as little as six weeks and the site and utility work can be done in conjunction with the construction of the building.

The term "'''mobile office'''" is also used for the workspace of [[salesperson|salespeople]] or similar, working out of their company office.  They are usually equipped with a [[portable computer]] and connect to the company servers and [[Intranet]] via [[mobile phone]]s, [[WiFi]] or via fixed connections in [[cybercafe]]s, [[hotel]]s and [[airport]]s. They like to use [[Personal information manager|Personal Information Managers]]

Because they must carry their equipment, mobile office workers push for [[miniaturization]] of devices.

[[File:The_Allegory_of_Immortality_by_Giulio_Romano,_c._1540.jpg|thumb|The Allegory of [[Immortality]] by [[Giulio Romano]], c. 1540. [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Detroit]], MI, USA.]]
A '''monster''' is often a hideously grotesque [[animal]] or [[human]], or a [[Hybrid beasts in folklore|hybrid]] of both, whose appearance frightens and whose powers of destruction threaten the human world's social or moral order.

Animal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice the white bull Poseidon sent him to the god, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull, and she copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, [[Minotaur|the Minotaur]]). Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human ([[Medusa]] and her sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Frankenstein's_monster|Frankenstein's monster]]), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society.

Monsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as ''monstrophy''.{{r|CallForPapers}}

Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. Well-known monsters in fiction include [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[Mummy#Modern mummies|mummies]], and [[zombie]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Arminianism as five-headed monster.JPG|thumb|A polemical allegory presented as a five-headed monster, 1618]]''Monster'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''monstrum'', itself derived ultimately from the verb ''moneo'' ("to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell"), and denotes anything "strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature, by which the gods give notice of evil," "a strange, unnatural, hideous person, animal, or thing," or any "monstrous or unusual thing, circumstance, or adventure." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l_UsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=latin+english+dictionary#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20english%20dictionary The Rev. J.E. Riddle, ''A Complete English-Latin and Latin-English Dictionary'', London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1870, s.v. ''monstrum'', Latin-English part, p. 399].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage==
In the words of Tina Marie Boyer, assistant professor of medieval German literature at [[Wake Forest University]], "monsters do not emerge out of a cultural void; they have a literary and cultural heritage".{{r|Boyer}}

In the religious context of ancient Greeks and Romans, monsters were seen as signs of "divine displeasure", and it was thought that birth defects were especially ominous, being "an unnatural event" or "a malfunctioning of nature".{{sfnp|Beagon|2002|p=127}}

Monsters are not necessarily abominations however. The Roman historian [[Suetonius]], for instance, describes a snake's absence of legs or a bird's ability to fly as monstrous, as both are "against nature".{{sfnp|Wardle|2006|p=330}} Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the word quickly established themselves, and by the playwright and philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s time, the word had extended into its philosophical meaning, "a visual and horrific revelation of the truth".{{sfnp|Staley|2010|pp=80, 96, 109, 113 et passim}}

In spite of this, mythological monsters such as the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] and [[Medusa]] are not natural beings, but divine entities. This seems to be a holdover from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and other belief systems, in which the divisions between "spirit," "monster," and "god" were less evident.

==Monsters in fiction==

===Prose fiction===
The history of monsters in fiction is long, for example [[Grendel]] in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' is an archetypal monster, deformed, brutal, with enormous strength and raiding a human settlement nightly to slay and feed on his victims. The modern literary monster has its roots on examples such as the monster in [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein]] and the vampire in [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula]].

Monsters are a staple of [[fantasy fiction]], [[horror fiction]] or [[science fiction]] (where the monsters are often [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in [[nature]]). There is also a burgeoning subgenre of [[erotic fiction]] involving monsters, [[monster erotica]].

===Film===
{{main|Monster movie}}

====Pre–World War II monster films====
[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hollywood's interpretation of Frankenstein's monster, played by [[Boris Karloff]]]]
During the age of [[silent film]]s, monsters tended to be human-sized, e.g. [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Golem]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and [[vampire]]s. The film ''[[Sigurd|Siegfried]]'' featured a [[dragon]] that consisted of [[Stop motion|stop-motion animated]] models, as in [[RKO]]'s ''King Kong'', the first giant [[Monster movie|monster film]] of the sound era.

[[Universal Studios]] specialized in monsters, with [[Bela Lugosi]]'s reprisal of his stage role, [[Dracula]], and [[Boris Karloff]] playing [[Frankenstein]]'s monster. The studio also made several lesser films, such as ''Man-Made Monster'', starring [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as a carnival side-show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer, able to dispatch victims merely by touching them, causing death by electrocution.

There was also a variant of Dr. Frankenstein, the mad surgeon Dr. Gogol (played by [[Peter Lorre]]), who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments, in the film ''[[Mad Love (1935 film)|Mad Love]]''.


[[Werewolf|Werewolves]] were introduced in films during this period, and similar creatures were presented in ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]''. [[mummy|Mummies]] were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well. As for giant creatures, the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[Serial (film)|serial]] did not use a costumed actor, instead using real-life [[lizard]]s to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective. However, the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the Fire Dragon, which picks up a doll representing Flash in its claws. The cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin, having a comedic turn in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).

====Post–World War II monster films====
[[File:Gojira 1954 poster 3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Original ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' film poster]]
In the [[Aftermath of World War II|post–World War II]] era, however, giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. One early example occurred in the American film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', which was about a [[dinosaur]] that attacked a lighthouse. Subsequently, there were [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] film depictions, ([[Godzilla]], [[Gamera]]), British depictions (''[[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]''), and even [[Cinema of Denmark|Danish]] depictions (''[[Reptilicus]]''), of giant monsters attacking cities. A recent depiction of a giant monster is depicted in [[J. J. Abrams]]'s ''[[Cloverfield]]'', which was released in theaters January 18, 2008. The intriguing proximity of other [[planet]]s brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen, some of which were huge in size (such as [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gigan]]), while others were of a more human scale. During this period, the [[fish]]-man monster [[Gill-man]] was developed in the film series ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.
[[File:Obake Karuta 4-12.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Card from the Japanese game [[Karuta|obake karuta]], c. early 19th century{{efn|Each card features a monster from [[Japanese mythology]] and a character from the [[hiragana]] syllabary.}}]]
Britain's [[Hammer Film Productions]] brought [[Color motion picture film|color]] to the monster movies in the late 1950s. Around this time, the earlier Universal films were usually shown on American television by independent stations (rather than network stations) by using announcers with strange personas, who gained legions of young fans. Although they have since changed considerably, movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s.

Occasionally, monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures. King Kong and Frankenstein's monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures. Frankenstein's monster is frequently depicted in this manner, in films such as ''[[Monster Squad]]'' and ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]''. The Hulk is an example of the "Monster as Hero" archetype. The theme of the "Friendly Monster" is pervasive in pop-culture. [[Chewbacca]], [[Elmo]], and [[Shrek]] are notable examples of friendly "monsters". The creatures of ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' scare children in order to create [[energy]] for running machinery, while the furry monsters of ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' live in harmony with animals and humans alike. Japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent or likable, with the most famous examples being the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise and the pioneering anime ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. The book series/webisodes/toy line of [[Monster High]] is another example.

===Games===
Monsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or role-playing games and video games as enemies for players to fight against. They may include [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, extra-dimensional entities or [[mutant|mutated]] versions of regular animals.

Especially in role-playing games, "monster" is a catch-all term for hostile characters that are fought by the player. [[Sentience|Sentient]] [[race (fantasy)|fictional races]] are usually not referred to as monsters. At other times, the term can carry a neutral connotation, such as in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise, where it is used to refer to fictional creatures that resemble real-world animals/objects. Characters in games may refer to all animals as "monsters".

'''Māori traditional textiles''' are the indigenous [[textile]]s of the [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]]. The organisation [[Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa]], the national Māori weavers' [[collective]], aims to preserve and foster the skills of making and using these materials.

==Fibres and dyes==
Māori made textiles from a number of plants, including [[Phormium tenax|harakeke]], [[Phormium colensoi|wharariki]], [[Cordyline australis|tī kōuka]], [[Cordyline indivisa|tōī]], [[pingao]], [[kiekie (plant)|kiekie]] and [[toetoe]]—although the [[Paper Mulberry|paper mulberry]] was introduced by Māori, who knew it as aute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rangi |first=Te |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_33_1924/Volume_33,_No._129/Evolution_of_Maori_clothing,_by_Te_Rangi_Hiroa,_p_25-47/p1?action=null |title=Journal of the Polynesian Society: Evolution Of Maori Clothing, By Te Rangi Hiroa, P 25-47 |publisher=Jps.auckland.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; it seems not to have thrived and bark cloth ([[Tapa cloth|tapa]]) was always rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Narena Olliver |url=http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/maorikites.html |title=New Zealand Birds &amp;#124; Birds &amp;#124; Maori myth &amp;#124; The Maori Kite, Te Manu Tukutuku or Manu Aute |publisher=Nzbirds.com |date=2010-10-30 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prepared fibre ([[muka]]) of the New Zealand flax  (''[[Phormium|Phormium tenax]]'') became the basis of most clothing. The flax leaves were split and woven into mats, ropes and nets but clothing was often made from the fibre within the leaves. The leaves were stripped using a mussel shell, dressed by soaking and pounding with stone pounders, (''patu muka''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/object/1868/patu-muka-flax-pounder "Patu muka (flax pounder)"], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt; to soften the fibre, spun by rolling the thread against the leg and woven. The fibre within the flax is called muka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=64626&amp;coltype=history&amp;regno=gh003255 |title=Prepared length of Muka (Phormium tenax&amp;#93;) Fibre - Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |publisher=Collections.tepapa.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colours for dyeing muka  were sourced from indigenous materials. Paru (mud high in iron salts) provided black, [[Brachyglottis repanda|raurekau]] bark made yellow, and [[Phyllocladus trichomanoides|tānekaha]] bark made a tan colour. The colours were set by rolling the dyed muka in alum (potash).

==Garments==
There were two main types of garments -

* A knee length kilt-like garment worn around the waist and secured by a belt
* And a rectangular garment worn over the shoulders. This might be a cape-like garment or a long cloak-like garment of finer quality. 

Men's belts were known as tatua and women's as tu. The man's belt was usually the more ornate. Belts were usually made of flax but occasionally other materials were used such as [[Kiekie (plant)|kiekie]] and [[pingao]]. Flax belts were often plaited in patterns with black and white stripes. The belts tied with a string tie. Women often wore a belt composed of many strands of plaited fibre.

==Seeding process==
The weaving process (whatu) for clothing was performed not with a loom and shuttle but with the threads being manipulated and tied with fingers. A strong thread is fastened tautly in a horizontal position between two or four upright weaving sticks (turuturu). To this thread (tawhiu) are attached the upper ends of the warp or vertical threads (io). The warp is arranged close together. The weaving process consisted of working in cross-threads from left to right. The closer these threads are together, the tighter the weave, and the finer the garment.

In the case of fine garments four threads are employed in the forming of each aho. The weaver passes two of these threads on either side of the first io or vertical thread, enclosing it. In the continuing the process the two pairs of threads are reversed, those passing behind the first vertical thread would be brought in front of the next one, then behind the next and so on. Each of the down threads would be enclosed between two or four cross-threads every half inch or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?advanced=colOnlineTitle%3a%22turuturu%22+colCollectionGroup%3aCH |title=Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, NZ |date=1961-02-19 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pake/Hieke==
To meet the cold and wet conditions of the New Zealand winter, a rain cloak  called pake or hieke  was worn. It was made from tags of raw flax or ''[[Cordyline australis|Cordyline]]'' partly scraped and set in close rows attached to the [[muka]] or plaited fibre base.

A type of garment known as a pake karure was made of two-ply closed strands of hukahuka (twisted or rolled cord or tag) interspersed with occasional black-dyed two-ply open type karure (loosely twisted) muka thread cord. Garments such as these were worn interchangeably either around the waist as a piupiu, or across the shoulder as a cape. These types of garments are thought to pre-date European contact, later becoming a more specialised form during the mid to later nineteenth century, which continues today in the standardised form of the piupiu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?advanced=colOnlineTitle%3a%22pake%22+colCollectionGroup%3aCH |title=Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, NZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piupiu==
[[File:Maori carved figure wearing a piupiu and tiki, standing against a wall with weapons, implements and cloaks. ATLIB 273585.png|thumb|Traditional Maori wood carving. The figure, with paua shell eyes, wears a piupiu (flax garment worn around the waist), and a tiki, and is alongside a display of weapons, implements and cloaks, ca. 1900]]
Piupiu are a kind of [[grass skirt]]. The waistband is plaited or in some cases made from ''tāniko''. The body of the piupiu is usually made from flax leaves that are carefully prepared with the ''muka'' or flax fibre exposed in some sections to cause geometric patterns to emerge. The unscraped leaves will curl naturally into tubes as the leaves dry, and make a percussion sound when the wearer sways or moves. The geometric patterns can be emphasised through dyeing as the dye will soak more into the exposed fibres rather than the dried raw leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?term=piupiu&amp;imagesonly=on |title=Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, NZ |date=1928-02-21 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Captain of [[HMS New Zealand (1911)|HMS New ''Zealand'']], a [[battlecruiser]] funded in 1911 by the government of New Zealand  for the defence of the [[British Empire]] and which took an active part in three battles of the First World War, wore into battle a piupiu (as well as a [[hei-tiki]], Māori traditional pendant). The crew attributed to this the ''New Zealand'' being a "lucky ship" which sustained no casualties during the entire war.

==Fine cloaks==
There were a number of different types of fine cloaks including korowai, kaitaka, kahu huruhuru and kahu kurī, all woven from [[muka]] (prepared [[harakeke]] fibre) using the [[tāniko]] technique.

===Korowai===
Korowai are finely woven cloaks covered with muka tassels (hukahuka). Hukahuka are made by the miro (twist thread) process of dying the muka (flax fibre) and rolling two bundles into a single cord which is then woven into the body of the cloak. There are many different types of korowai that are named depending on the type of hukahuka used as the decoration. Korowai karure have tassels (hukahuka) that appear to be unravelling. Korowai ngore have hukahuka that look like pompoms. Korowai hihima had undyed tassels.

Korowai seem to have been rare at the time of Captain Cook's first visit to New Zealand because they do not appear in drawings made by his artists. But by 1844, when George French Angas painted historical accounts of early New Zealand, korowai with their black hukahuka had become the most popular style. Hukahuka on fine examples of korowai were often up to thirty centimetres long and when made correctly would move freely with every movement of the wearer. Today, many old korowai have lost their black hukahuka due to the dying process speeding up the deterioration of the muka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?advanced=colOnlineTitle%3a%22korowai%22+colCollectionGroup%3aCH |title=Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, NZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaitaka===
Kaitaka are cloaks of finely woven muka (''Phormium tenax'') fibre. Kaitaka are among the more prestigious forms of traditional Maori dress. They are made from muka (flax fibre), which is in turn made from those varieties of ''Phormium tenax'' that yield the finest quality fibre characterised by a silk-like texture and rich golden sheen. Kaitaka are usually adorned with broad tāniko borders at the remu (bottom) and narrow tāniko bands along the kauko (sides). The ua (upper border) is plain and undecorated, and the kaupapa (main body) is usually unadorned. There are several sub-categories of kaitaka: parawai, where the aho (wefts) run horizontally; kaitaka paepaeroa, where the aho run vertically; kaitaka aronui or patea, where the aho run horizontally with tāniko bands on the sides and bottom borders; huaki, where the aho run horizontally with taniko bands on the sides and two broad taniko bands, one above the other, on the lower border; and huaki paepaeroa, which has vertical aho with double tāniko bands on the lower border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?advanced=colOnlineTitle%3a%22Kaitaka%22+colCollectionGroup%3aCH |title=Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, NZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kahu huruhuru===
[[File:Detail of bottom border of Māori kahu kiwi.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of the bottom edge of a [[kahu kiwi]], showing the distinctive hair-like nature of the kiwi feathers.]]
Fine [[feather cloak]]s called kahu huruhuru were made of muka fibre with bird feathers woven in to cover the entire cloak. These [[feather cloaks]] became more common during between 1850 and 1900, when cloaks were evolving in their production. Some early examples include kahu kiwi (kiwi feather cloak), which used the soft brown feathers of the kiwi (''Apteryx'' spp). Kahu kiwi were regarded as the most prestigious form of kahu huruhuru. Other kahu huruhuru incorporated the green and white feathers of the [[new Zealand Pigeon|kererū]] (New Zealand pigeon: ''Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae'') and blue feathers from the [[tui (bird)|tūī]] (''Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?advanced=colCollectionType%3a%22Taonga+Maori%22+colOnlineTitle%3a%22Kahu%22+colCollectionGroup%3aCH&amp;imagesonly=on |title=Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, NZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kahu kurī===
A particularly rare type of cloak is the kahu kurī, made from strips of dog skin with hair attached taken from the now extinct [[kurī]] (Māori dog).

The main body of the cloak is made up of strips of white-haired dog skin of various lengths, which are sewn onto the kaupapa (main body) of the cloak with fine bone needles to form a tightly woven muka (flax fibre) foundation called pukupuku. The pukupuku weaving technique uses the whatu-aho-patahi (single pair twine) method, which is very similar to the decorative geometric tāniko (fine embroidery or weaving in a geometric pattern) border designs usually seen on the kaitaka (fine flax cloak) class of cloak, and forms a thick and heavy protective garment. The awe (the tassels that fringe the outside length of the cloak) is likely to have been taken from the underside of the dog's tail. The kurupatu (plaited hem on the cloak edge) is entirely separate to the main kaupapa and made by threading separate strips together to form a length of collar that has been sewn onto the neck of the finished garment.

Kahu kurī are garments possessing great mana (status) and were highly prized heirlooms. Each garment had its own personal name and its history was carefully preserved right up to the time they passed out of Maori ownership. However, most are in museum collections around the world and have lost their provenance. The possession of a kahu kurī immediately identified the owner as a rangatira (chief) or someone who possessed prestige and position within the hapū (family) or iwi (tribe). They were often exchanged between people of rank on important ceremonial occasions and affirmed both the mana of the giver and the recipient. Kahu kurī were made largely between 1500 and 1850, and it is thought that production had ceased altogether by the early nineteenth century.

There are several different varieties of kahu kurī and some tribal variation in the application of the descriptive terms of these types. Some of the types recorded include topuni, ihupuni, awarua, kahuwaero, mahiti, and puahi, but the construction technique remains essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?__VIEWSTATE=%2FwEPDwUKMTAwNTY3MzM4MGRk2VIBUl0c8JJ0OrrEMBcNzXoTvg8%3D&amp;term=kahu+kuri ]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tāniko==
{{main|Tāniko}}
[[Tāniko]] (or taaniko) refers to any ornamental border typically found on mats and clothes. Tāniko patterns are very geometric in form because they can be reduced down to small coloured squares repeated on a lattice framework. These base square forms, articulated in the hands of a weaver, constitute the larger diamond and triangle shapes that are visible in all traditional weaving crafts.

Pātiki or pātikitiki (flounder/flat fish: ''Rhombosolea plebeia'') designs are based on the lozenge or diamond shape of the flounder. They can be quite varied within the basic shape.

The kaokao (side or rib) pattern is formed by zigzag lines that create chevrons. These can be horizontal or vertical, open with paces or closed repetitive lines. The design is sometimes interpreted as the arms of warriors caught in haka (fierce rhythmic dance) action.

The niho taniwha (taniwha tooth) pattern is a notched-tooth design found on all types of objects, mats, woven panels, belts, and clothing.

The poutama is a stepped design signifying the growth of man, striving ever upwards.

Tahekeheke (striped) designs refer to any distinct vertical patterning.

The whetū (stars), purapura whetū (weaving pattern of stars) or roimata (teardrop) pattern is a geometric design using two colours and alternating between them at every stitch. This design is associated with the survival of an iwi (tribe), hapū (sub-tribe), or whānau (extended family), the idea being that it is vital to have a large whanau, just as there are many stars in the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?term=taniko&amp;imagesonly=on |title=Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, NZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NATO reporting names''' are [[code name]]s for military equipment of [[Russia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and, historically, the former [[Eastern Bloc]] ([[Soviet Union]] and other nations of the [[Warsaw Pact]]). They provide unambiguous and easily understood English words in a uniform manner in place of the original designations, which either may have been unknown to the [[Western world]] at the time or easily confused codes.&lt;ref name="NATO list"&gt;{{cite web |title= NATO Code Names for Submarines and Ships: Submarine Classes / Reporting Name |work= Art and Aerospace Page |publisher= Univ. of Michigan, UMCC / AIS |url=http://www.ais.org/~schnars/aero/nato-shp.htm |accessdate= 29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Russian bomber jet [[Tupolev Tu-160]] is simply called Blackjack.

[[NATO]] maintains lists of the names. The assignment of the names for the Russian and Chinese aircraft was once managed by the five-nation '''Air Standardization Coordinating Committee (ASCC)''' (now called the '''[[Air and Space Interoperability Council|Air and Space Interoperability Council, or ASIC]]''', which includes representatives of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), but that is no longer the case.

==U.S. variations==
The [[United States Department of Defense]] (US DoD) expands on the NATO reporting names in some cases. NATO refers to [[surface-to-air missile]] systems mounted on ships or submarines with the same names as the corresponding land-based systems, but the US DoD assigns a different series of numbers with a different suffix (i.e., SA-N- vs. SA-) for these systems. The names are kept the same as a convenience. Where there is no corresponding system, a new name is devised.

==Soviet nicknames==
The Soviet Union did not always assign official "popular names" to its aircraft, but unofficial [[nickname]]s were common as in any [[air force]]. Generally, Soviet pilots did not use the NATO names, preferring a different, Russian, nickname. An exception was that Soviet airmen appreciated the [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]]'s codename "[[Fulcrum]]", as an indication of its pivotal role in Soviet air defence.&lt;ref name="zuyev_fulcrum"&gt;[[Aleksandr Zuyev (pilot)|Zuyev, A.]] and Malcolm McConnell. ''Fulcrum: A Top Gun Pilot's Escape from the Soviet Empire''. Warner Books, 1993. {{ISBN|0-446-36498-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
To reduce the risk of confusion, unusual or made-up names were allocated, the idea being that the names chosen would be unlikely to occur in normal conversation, and be easier to memorise. For fixed-wing aircraft, single-syllable words denoted piston-prop and turboprop, while multiple-syllable words denoted jets. Bombers had names starting with the letter ''B'' and names like [[Tupolev Tu-16|''Badger'']] (2 syllables: jet), [[Tupolev Tu-95|''Bear'']] (single syllable: propeller), and [[Tupolev Tu-160|''Blackjack'']] were used. "Frogfoot," the reporting name for the [[Sukhoi Su-25]], references the aircraft's [[close air support]] role. Transports had names starting with ''C'' (as in "cargo"), which resulted in names like ''[[Antonov An-124|Condor]]'' or [[Ilyushin Il-76|''Candid'']].

==Lists of NATO reporting names==
===Missiles===
The initial letter of the name indicated the use of that equipment.

* '''A'''—air-to-air missiles, example [[AA-2 Atoll]]: [[List of NATO reporting names for air-to-air missiles]]

* '''S'''—surface-to-surface missiles, including ship- and submarine-launched. Land-based missiles have the prefix SS-, for example the [[SS-1 Scud]]. Naval missiles receive the designation SS-N-, e.g. [[SS-N-2 Styx]]. Coastal defence missiles are assigned the prefix SS-C-, e.g. [[K-300P Bastion-P|SS-C-5 Stooge]]: [[List of NATO reporting names for surface-to-surface missiles]]

A '''national heritage site''' is a heritage site having a value that has been registered by a governmental agency as being of national importance to the [[cultural heritage]] or history of that country. Usually such sites are listed in a [[heritage register]] that is open to the public, and many are advertised by national visitor bureaus as [[tourist attraction]]s.

Usually such a heritage register list is split by type of feature (natural wonder, ruin, engineering marvel, etc.). In many cases a country may maintain more than one register; there are also registers for entities that span more than one country. 

==History of national heritage listing==
Each country has its own national heritage list and naming conventions. Sites can be added to a list, and are occasionally removed and even destroyed for economic or other reasons. The concept of protecting and taking pride in [[cultural heritage]] is something that goes back to the [[Seven Wonders of the World]], but usually it is only after destruction, especially mass destruction in times of war, that new lists are drawn up or revisited. Many countries acknowledge under [[UNESCO]] their designation of objects considered to be worthy of having importance to the entire world or [[world heritage]]. These listings also acknowledge the need for a separate list of objects judged part of their own unique [[cultural heritage]]. The concept of a ''national heritage site'' can be split into many types, each type having its own unique list. 

Two major types of cultural heritage are "immoveable" and "moveable" objects. Immoveable objects are usually buildings, locations such as gardens or areas such as city districts.  Small moveable objects may include old books or artworks, large moveable objects may include automobiles, aircraft and ships. 

In the case of a national heritage site in a populated area, monitoring and protection may be under the jurisdiction of a fire department or local police department, whereas more remote sites may be under the protection of a central [[List_of_environmental_organizations|conservation agency]].

===Legal aspects===
Most countries have passed laws to protect national heritage sites, with various classifications for owners. In Europe, many countries uphold the [[Venice Charter]] of 1964 though each country's name and criteria for protection, may change.

===UNESCO World Heritage lists===
{{main|World Heritage Site}}
The [[UNESCO]] keeps a list of heritage sites per country that are considered internationally important.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list World Heritage List], UNESCO World Heritage Sites official sites.&lt;/ref&gt; These sites are almost always also on the national heritage register of the site's country.

'''''Nebulous''''' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[comic science fiction|science fiction comedy]] radio show written by [[Graham Duff]] and produced by [[Ted Dowd]] from [[Baby Cow Productions]]; it is directed by [[Nicholas Briggs]]. The series premiered in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Set in the year 2099 AD, the show focuses on the adventures of the [[eponymous]] [[List of characters from Nebulous#Professor Nebulous|Professor Nebulous]], director of operations for the eco-troubleshooting team KENT ''(the Key Environmental Non-Judgmental Taskforce)'' as they combat various catastrophes and try to set the world back on the right path following a worldwide environmental disaster known as "The Withering". As well as being a [[parody]] of a number of famous [[science fiction]] programmes, including ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Quatermass]]'' and ''[[Doomwatch]]'',&lt;ref name="times1"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article406399.ece|title= Radio Choice|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1 January 2005|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nebulous'' is considered a [[cult radio]] programme, attracting a number of guest appearances from famous actors.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times2"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article697772.ece| title=Radiohead|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1 April 2006|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been three series of ''Nebulous''; the first was broadcast between 6 January and 10 February 2005. The series was well received by critics, and a second series was broadcast between 5 April and 10 May 2006, with a third series commissioned by the BBC which began broadcasting on Thursday, 15 May 2008 at 23:00 BST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nebulouscity.com/ | title = Nebulous City News | accessdate = 2007-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first series was released on [[compact disc]] on 5 February 2007 by [[BBC Audio]]. Since 2009 all three series have been broadcast on [[BBC Radio 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Radio Broadcasts by Year for ''Nebulous''|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b94wn/episodes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duff has also announced that he is planning to make an animated series of ''Nebulous''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duff|first=Graham|authorlink=Graham Duff|url=http://www.grahamduff.co.uk/|title=News Section of Graham Duff's Website|publisher=Graham Duff|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/nebulous/|title=Nebulous|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
The development of the series began with the production [[pilot episode]], written by Graham Duff and produced by Baby Cow Productions in March 2003.&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unofficialhammerfilms.com/interviews/gd.html|title=Interviews: Graham Duff (2005)|first=Robert|last=Simpson|publisher=Unofficial Hammer Films Site|date=2005-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The episode, which eventually became "[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|Night of the Vegetarians]]", featured much of the final cast, but with a number of differences: a different actor played [[List of characters from Nebulous#Rory Lawson|Rory]], and [[List of characters from Nebulous#Sir Ronald Rolands|Sir Ronald Rolands]] was voiced by Duff, while [[List of characters from Nebulous#Gemini|Gemini]] originally had two voices: a female voice played by [[Julia Dalkin]], and a male voice by [[Nicholas Briggs]].&lt;ref name="duff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nebulouscity.com/Graham%20Duff%20Interview.doc|title=Graham Duff Interview|publisher=Nebulous City|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cult"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/01/06/16362.shtml|title=Nick's Nebulous Notes|publisher=BBC Cult Television|accessdate=2007-03-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106220132/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/01/06/16362.shtml|archivedate=6 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm Boyle - who wrote the Nebulous theme and edited the pilot - had written an entire original score for the show. However, due to BBC radio budget limitations, this was not used in the completed series. Nicholas Briggs had also originally created a very deep, realistic [[soundscape]], similar to those he had created for the [[Big Finish Productions]] [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|''Doctor Who'' audioplays]], but was advised that "it's likely the listener will have distractions and will not listen to it more than once; therefore, the soundscape must be totally accessible from any point in the episode", toning down the sound effects to match the series' comic nature.&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nebulouscity.com/Nick%20Briggs%20Interview.doc|title=Nicholas Briggs interview|publisher=Nebulous City|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recording===

The Moat Studios in [[London]] recorded ''Nebulous'' in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]],&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt; with each half-hour episode typically taking one day to record, including [[read-through]] and [[rehearsal]].&lt;ref name="duff"/&gt; Nicholas Briggs produced the sound, using a combination of [[synthesizer|synthesised effects]] from a [[Roland SH-101]] and [[Foley artist|foley]] [[sound effect]]s.&lt;ref name="cult"/&gt; Briggs also carried out the [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|studio editing]] in order to bring the 30-minute episodes down to the 28 minutes mandated by the BBC to allow time for [[Radio commercial|radio trailers]] between programmes.&lt;ref name="briggs"/&gt;

==Plot==
{{main|List of Nebulous episodes}}

===Setting===
Set in the year 2099, the series depicts the [[Earth]] as very different from today. Following a number of environmental disasters, such as "the Withering"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; which resulted in the loss of a great deal of human knowledge including the [[vacuum cleaner]] and [[fire]] (although the latter came back fairly quickly)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;  and a "Cattle-clasm" that killed off most of the livestock,&lt;ref name="vegetarian"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Night of the Vegetarians | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-06 | season = 1 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Earth has been reduced to a wasteland separated between "Withered Zones" and the remaining inhabitable areas.&lt;ref name="lovely"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Lovely Invasion | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-13 | season = 1 | number = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed calendar. Every day of the week is now 25-hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade),&lt;ref name="past"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Past Must be Destroyed| episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#Third series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2008-05-22 | season = 3 | number = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the change in the length of the year led to the creation of new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary. In addition, the dreary season of Hamble was created, which is permanently dark, cold and [[drizzle|drizzly]].&lt;ref name="polished"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Man Who Polished The Sun | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-02-10 | season = 1 | number = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Withering resulted in [[vegetarians]], [[pigeons]] and [[homosexuality|gays]] becoming [[endangered species]],&lt;ref name="vegetarian"/&gt; and completely wiped out [[prostitutes|tarts]].&lt;ref name="dust"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Dust Has Landed | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-20 | season = 1 | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth's geography is also radically altered. A new [[mountain range]] was formed in Britain by a day-long [[ice age]], and the Earth now has twelve and a half [[continent]]s. Many locations have been displaced and reduced to islands, including [[Oxford University]]&lt;ref name="dust"/&gt; and the London borough of [[Deptford]], which is now in the Indonesian Ocean as a part of the Cockney Islands.&lt;ref name="deptford"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Deptford Wives | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#Second series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2006-04-05 | season = 2 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[solar system]] is equally altered: [[Jupiter]] has been deep fried by [[Harry Ramsden's]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Neptune]] have been knocked together, and there was an initiative to destroy the [[Moon]], which according to the show was deleterious to the [[nightlight]] industry.&lt;ref name="destinoyd"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Destiny of the Destinoyd | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#Second series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2006-04-26 | season = 2 | number = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religion]] also exists in the ''Nebulous'' universe. Pieced together following the Withering, theologians conclude that there were four true deities: the evil twins [[Yin and Yang]], [[Feng Shui]] the destroyer, and merciful Bod, based on the children's television programme ''[[Bod (series)|Bod]]'',&lt;ref name="colour"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Madness Is A Strange Colour | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-27 | season = 1 | number = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the theme tune of which has become a [[hymn]], sung in [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;ref name="cult"/&gt; Bod is analogous to [[God]], hence the commonly used phrase "[[wiktionary:oh my God|Oh my Bod]]!"

===Storyline===

''Nebulous'' follows the adventures of the eco-troubleshooting team "KENT" (the ''Key Environmental Non-Judgmental Taskforce'', named after the [[Ceremonial counties of England|English county]] of [[Kent]]). The group is directed by Professor Nebulous toward the goal of restoring a natural balance to Earth. However, they are woefully under-funded; KENT was forced to open a laundry to supplement funds.&lt;ref name="coincidence"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Coincidence Machine | episodelink = List of Nebulous episodes#First series| series = Nebulous | network = [[BBC Radio 4]] | airdate = 2005-01-03 | season = 1 | number = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is at least one other eco-troubleshooting team based in England, but despite their common goals they have a less-than-hospitable view of each other. LOUGHBOROUGH (the ''Legitimate Organisation Undertaking General Humanitarian Business Operations Requiring Optimum Unconditional Global Harmony'', named after the [[Leicestershire]] town [[Loughborough]]) is run by Professor Nebulous’ ex-love interest, Doctor Erica Flazenby. By comparison to KENT it is over-funded and well-equipped, with [[Raygun|bazers]], [[black helicopter]]s and info pills, which provide the user with information by ingestion.&lt;ref name="dust"/&gt;

''Nebulous'' both [[parody|parodies]] and pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to several well known science fiction programmes and films in both its setting and plotlines, often incorporating several different elements within a single story: Professor Nebulous himself is similar to [[Bernard Quatermass]],&lt;ref name="duff"/&gt; a British [[scientist]] who led a research group and fought [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] in the classic science fiction serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' and its sequels. KENT itself is based partly on the Department of Measurement of Scientific Work, nicknamed "Doomwatch", the eponymous organisation from the BBC [[science fiction on television|science fiction television programme]] ''[[Doomwatch]]'', and partly on the Doctor Who Organization "U.N.I.T", otherwise known as the "[[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce]]".&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groups.msn.com/Gallifrey/markgatissinterview.msnw|title=Mark Gatiss|publisher=Gallifrey [[MSN Groups|MSN Group]]|first=James|last=Ellis|date=6 January 2005|accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second episode of series one, "[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|The Loverly Invasion]]"&lt;!-- The Loverly Invasion is the correct spelling--&gt;, is a direct spoof of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Claws of Axos]]",&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2005/01/06/16359.shtml|title= Nebulous Who|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=6 January 2005|accessdate=2007-03-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204093918/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2005/01/06/16359.shtml &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while "[[List of Nebulous episodes#Second series|The Deptford Wives]]" takes both its name and premise from ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'' (and also borrows from ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unofficialhammerfilms.com/articles/prev_nebulous2_01.html|title=Nebulous Series 2 Preview|publisher=Unofficial Hammer Films Site|accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the first episode of series 3 onwards, this also began to include the recent ''Doctor Who'' spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' and the ITV series ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'', with references to "baby dinosaurs falling through a hole in time" and "the sheer amount of paranormal activity in the Cardiff area alone ... starting to threaten the Earth's plausibility shield".  Episode 6 of that series also parodied the tendency in British sci-fi for attempts to take over the world to start in Britain, with the chief villain (played by [[Tenth Doctor]] actor [[David Tennant]]) stating "Funnily enough, that's a tax thing," as well as one of the [[Ninth Doctor]]'s nicknames, [[q:Ninth Doctor#The Parting of the Ways .5B1.13.5D|"the oncoming storm"]] (with Nebulous known as "the oncoming drizzle").

Following positive reviews and high listening figures, the second series was able to attract a number of guest appearances from well known actors, including [[Peter Davison]], [[Steve Coogan]], and [[Kate O'Mara]]. The third series featured appearances from [[Julia Davis]] and [[David Tennant]].

==Reviews==

Reception to ''Nebulous'' was generally positive: a reviewer from ''[[The Times]]'' described the first series as "a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult written all over it",&lt;ref name="times1"/&gt; while the second series was described as "cool and [[Cult radio|cultish]]".&lt;ref name="times2"/&gt; However, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was more guarded, comparing the show to "[[Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy|Hitchhiker's]] without the philosophy or [[Red Dwarf]] without the energy", going on to say that show is "funny, but not seriously so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/01/11/bvgill11.xml|title= A gloriously pompous production|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 January 2005|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''Doctor Who'' website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed "I should have been more patient because when they did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.seenit.co.uk/nebulous-bbc-audio/0177/|title= Nebulous review: BBC Audio|publisher=UnitNews|date=20 February 2007|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''Ngoc Lu drum''' is regarded as one of the most important and prominent artifacts of the [[Dong Son culture]] of the [[Bronze Age]], a civilisation that flourished in around the 2nd to 3rd century BC in the [[Red River Delta]] of [[Vietnam]]. The high level of importance placed on it by historians and archaeologists is due to its well preserved and richly decorated nature.&lt;ref name="h"&gt;Higham, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ngoc Lu bronze drum.JPG|thumb|right|Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface, [[Vietnam]]]]

==Discovery==

The drum was accidentally discovered in 1893 in [[Hà Nam Province]], southeast of Hanoi, by workers building a dike, rather than during a planned expedition.&lt;ref&gt;The Bronze Đông Sỏn Drums: A Collective Work of Archaeologists Thúc Cần Hà, Văn Huyên Nguyẽ̂n - 1989  "We have not classified the above in the series of Dong Son Drums discovered, but have listed them for reference. In the years 1893-1894, Nguyen Van Y, Nguyen Van Tiic and others from Ngọc Lũwere building the Tran Thiiy dike in Nhu Trac, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The drum was named after the Confucian name of the village where it was found, ''Ngọc Lũ'' (Sino-Vietnamese 玉缕, vernacular [[tên chữ]] name ''Làng Chủ'') in [[Bình Lục District]].

==The drum==
In contrast to most other drums of the Dong Son, the [[Drumhead|tympanum]] bears three concentric panels, which depict animals or humans, interleaved with bands of geometric or circular patterns. The innermost panel appears to be a self-referencing depiction, as it is decorated with pictures of humans who appear to be performing a ceremony involving the drums themselves. Other musical instruments and rice growing and harvesting activities are also shown. The two outer panels are decorated with scenes of deer, hornbills and crane egrets.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

The inner panel repeats itself, despite the presence of minor variations. The scenes are the subject of multiple interpretations, but a prominent motif is that of a row of figures who appear to be male. They are plumed, and led by a man holding a spear that is directed towards the ground. He is followed in the line by five more men, at least two of whom appear to playing musical instruments. One appears to be playing a ''khen'' and either cymbals or bells, while another holds a wand-like object in his left hand. The men are wearing a type of kilt and highly feathered headgear, which includes a figure in the shape of a bird's head.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

[[File:Ngoc Lu bronze drum .JPG|thumb|left|Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface (Image), [[Vietnam]]]]

Ahead of the leader, there is some sort of a structure that is supported by stilts with either decorated timber walls or some sort of streamers held at the eaves. A board of gongs is being percussed by a person wearing a kilt, but is not wearing a feathered headdress. Three people depicted beyond the house also do not have any headwear, with two having long hair and another with bun-tied hair. Two of the people are depicted threshing rice with a pole ornamented with feathers, while the other is shooing away a hornbill. A house is depicted beyond them which has decorated posts erected at a sharp angle, close to vertical, which is decorated with what appears to be feathers or streamers. The ends of the gables are further decorated with birds' heads. There are three people depicted inside the house, possibly playing percussion instruments.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

There is also a scene where one standing person and three seated people are brandishing long poles that appear to be used to strike a row of drums placed in front of them. This scene is repeated with a few variations. In one scene the drums are all of identical size, while in the others their sizes are sequenced.  One percussionist uses one striking device, while another uses two for each hand. There are further variations of this scene with seated and standing percussionists.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

Archaeologists are agreed that the scene is likely to depict a festival or ritual of some kind, with the musicians appearing to be part of a parade. The feathered men contrast with those depicted in the house, who have unkempt hair and appear to be female. The decoration on the mantle of the drum depicts plumed warriors in a procession of elegant pirogues with decorated timbers. Birds' heads are found on their headgear, the ends of their water transport vessels and even the rudder.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

The '''Nutabe''' (or "Nutabae")&lt;ref&gt;http://antioquia.gov.co/ Antioquia Government&lt;/ref&gt; were an indigenous people who inhabited the region of Antioquia in Colombia, to about the 14th century. In addition to the stories that indicate the presence of this tribe in the [[Aburrá Valley]] in municipalities such as [[Itagüí]], [[Envigado]] and [[Sabaneta, Antioquia|Sabaneta]], also in the towns of [[Antioquia department|Antioquia]] places like [[Toledo (Antioquia)|Toledo]], [[San Andrés de Cuerquia]] and [[Ituango]] you will find information and other territories mediating the 16th century were inhabited by the tribe.

==History==

According to some historians and researchers Nutabes fall within the language family [[Muisca people|Chibchas]]. Nutabes were essentially farmers, especially maize and beans, fruit trees and even cotton. Also, in other economic fields, were fishermen and also miners mined alluvial gold field and the Medellin river.

==Sociopolitical organization==

Their society was organized into small chiefdoms hereditary, individually scattered and lacking any central power. However, compared to the [[Conquest of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] (and against other situations overall incidence), these tribes used to join in a federated so to call it around the chief who had shown more courage in any of their tasks warriors. The Nutabes despite belonging to a group of peaceful tribes of the area were recognized Antioquia also as warriors typically when protecting their territory. When the Spanish arrived, the leadership of the tribe was exercised by a chief Guarcama'' name''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpaisaysusorigenes.com/p/8-los-nutabes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

The Nutabes traded with neighboring tribes, for which they used a strategic bridge over the river'' San Andreas'', at its mouth, bridging indigenous language he called ''Bredunto''. This name became ''Pescadero'' after the Spanish conquest. This bridge was important for life Nutabe. Amid the bustle conqueror, indigenous him down. Somewhat later, Andres de Valdivia, of the conquering, given its importance rebuilt it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21275">'''One City One Book''' (also '''One Book One City''', '''''[City]'' Reads''', '''On the Same Page''' and other variations) is a generic name for a community reading program that attempts to get everyone in a city to read and discuss the same book. The name of the program is often reversed to One Book One City, or is customized to name the city where it occurs. Popular book picks have been [[Harper Lee]]'s ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', [[Ernest Gaines]]'s ''[[A Lesson Before Dying]]'', [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', and [[Rudolfo Anaya]]'s ''[[Bless Me, Ultima]]''.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html |title="One Book" Reading Promotion Projects |accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher=Library of Congress - Center for the Book |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501024447/http://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}

==History==

One City One Book programs take the idea of a localized [[book discussion club]] and expand it to cover a whole city.&lt;ref name = "LJ2002"&gt;

The first such program was "If All of Seattle Read the Same Book" in 1998, started by [[Nancy Pearl]] at [[Seattle Public Library]]'s Washington Center for the Book.&lt;ref name = "AmericanLibraries2005"&gt;

The book chosen for the program was 'The Sweet Hereafter' by [[Russell Banks]], written in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting On The Same Page -- Library's 'If All Of Seattle Read The Same Book' Program Hopes To Get The City Reading - And Talking - Together |first=Ferdinand M. |last=De Leon |newspaper=Seattle TImes |date=November 5, 1998 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981105&amp;slug=2781661 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities copied the idea, and the Library of Congress listed 404 programs occurring in 2007.&lt;ref name = "LOC" /&gt;

Each city's program has its own goals; these typically include building a sense of community and promoting literacy.&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
Nancy Pearl warns against expecting too much from a program: "Keep in mind that this is a library program, it's not an exercise in civics, it's not intended to have literature cure the racial divide. This is about a work of literature."&lt;ref name = "LJ2002" /&gt;

Programs typically involve more than having everyone read the same book. Some other activities that have been included are: book discussion sessions, scholarly lectures on the book or related topics, a visit by the author, exhibits, related arts programming (especially showing a movie of the book if there is one), and integration into school curricula.&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide"&gt;

In Boston the "[[One City One Story]]" program used shorter stories and distributed tens of thousands of free copies of the story over the course of a month.

[[American Library Association]] puts out a detailed step-by-step guide&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide" /&gt; on how to organize a local program, including the critical step of picking the one book. The [[Center for the Book]] at the [[Library of Congress]] tracks all known programs and the books they have used.&lt;ref name = "LOC" /&gt;

=== Significant "One Book" programs ===
''Most listed are in the United States, perhaps because the meme started there and similar programs elsewhere have a different name.''

Programs sponsored by public libraries are tracked each year by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;At [http://www.read.gov/resources/state.php Read.gov]. Retrieved Jun 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Most programs maintain their own websites devoted to the annual effort.

==== USA ====
The Library of Congress maintains a website with resources for cities that want to run One Book programs, including a partial [http://www.read.gov/resources/authorlist.php list of authors] and [http://www.read.gov/resources/state.php list of past programs].  Some states and the [[American Library Association|ALA]] maintain their own resources to help cities get started.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the ALA's [http://www.lita.org/ala/aboutala/offices/ppo/programming/onebook/files/onebookguide.pdf One Book guide], and Michigan state's list of [http://www.michigan.gov/mde/0,1607,7-140-54574_36788_40452---,00.html related resources]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107141419/http://www.lita.org/ala/aboutala/offices/ppo/programming/onebook/files/onebookguide.pdf |date=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program gives grants to communities across the nation each year to develop community-wide reading programs based on a book selected from The Big Read's library.

Colleges

Some colleges have begun One College One Book programs in addition to the more common summer reading programs for incoming First Year students. The Department of Elementary and Early Childhood Education at the College of New Jersey has been running a One Book, One Department program for all of the students in its major since 2008, requiring students to read a common work of literary non-fiction in both summer and winter breaks. The first book used was Ann Fadiman's The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down and the book for summer 2014 is Dan Fagin's Pulitzer Prize winning Toms River.

==== United Kingdom ====

[http://cityreads.co.uk/ City Reads], Brighton is the longest running and most consistent 'big read' in the UK. Led by artistic director [https://about.me/sarah.hutchings Sarah Hutchings], it is delivered by award-winning literary organisation [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113311/http://cityreads.co.uk/about/collected-works-cic%20Collected%20Works%20CIC Collected Works CIC]. City Reads is an annual collective reading festival conceived to spread a love of books and ideas to the widest possible audience throughout Brighton &amp; Hove, with a healthy reach into the South East region. Over three weeks in October one book is chosen for the whole community to creatively engage with in a series of special events, workshops and performances. Through the outstanding quality of its work, its ability to foster collaboration and the partnerships that support the Festival, City Reads brings regional and national attention to the importance of shared reading and the benefits it can bring to the whole community. 2015 marks the 10th anniversary of City Reads, Brighton. The City Reads slogan is: '''''One city. One book. A thousand conversations...''''' The Festival began in 2005 when the City celebrated Penguin Books' 70th Anniversary and read Lewis Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland''. In 2013, with the support of writer, broadcaster and former children's laureate Michael Rosen Young City Reads was launched. Working with primary aged children at KS2 level, Young City Reads is thought to be the first 'big read' for children in the UK, on such a large scale.

Southampton University:
One Book, One Southampton (OBOS) is the University of Southampton’s initiative to engage with our community through reading. Similar initiatives have been trialled in other institutions internationally, but there are very few UK University One Book programmes. The University encourage staff, students and our local and international community to join us in debates, lectures, talks and online forums to discuss OBOS and explore the themes, subjects and debates that the book raises. You can listen to discussions on the subject, and attend events about the book. The University of Southampton announced that the 2014 book will be Empire by Jeremy Paxman.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.soton.ac.uk/onebook/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternate programs ===
Some cities that have run independent One Book programs have later joined Big Read instead.  An annual "One World, Many Stories" summer reading campaign for children, which has a single selection for the country, has become popular as well.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://ca.evanced.info/lapl/sr/homepage.asp?ProgramID=4 Los Angeles], 
[http://hmcpl.org/2011/05/embark-your-summer-reading-journey Huntsville], and [http://www.idahokidsread.org/ Idaho] libraries. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709145617/http://ca.evanced.info/lapl/sr/homepage.asp?ProgramID=4 |date=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical responses ==

For some, the mere idea of reading as a communal activity is repellent. The literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] said, "I don't like these mass reading bees.... It is rather like the idea that we are all going to pop out and eat Chicken McNuggets or something else horrid at once."&lt;ref name = "NYT2002Fight"&gt;

 | accessdate = 2008-05-02
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are concerned about the temptation to use such a program to promote social values. [[Phillip Lopate]] fears a promotion of [[groupthink]], saying "It is a little like a science fiction plot -- 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or something."&lt;ref name = "NYT2002Fight " /&gt;

In [[New York City]] in 2002, the effort foundered when the selectors split into two rival groups, each with its own favorite: [[Chang-Rae Lee]]'s ''[[Native Speaker (novel)|Native Speaker]]'' and [[James McBride (writer)|James McBride]]'s ''[[The Color of Water]]''. Both books were considered to be offensive to some of New York's ethnic groups.&lt;ref name = "LJ2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT2002"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Nancy Pearl said,
"It's turned into something not to do with literature but to do with curing the ills in society, and while there is a role for that, to ask a book to fit everybody's agenda in talking about particular issues just does a disservice to literature."&lt;ref name = "Guardian2002"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments are sometimes concerned that their endorsement of reading a book will be viewed as endorsing the ideas or language of the book. In Texas in 2006, the [[Galveston County]] Reads committee recommended [[Mark Haddon]]'s ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' as the choice for their county-wide read. There was much criticism of the choice from the Mayor and Council of [[Friendswood]], who objected to obscenity in the novel, and said that it contained ideas that should not be promoted to kids and that taxpayer money should not be used to promote and purchase a book the community wouldn't approve of.&lt;ref name = "Galveston"&gt;

The '''relational meeting''' is a primary organizing tool used by the [[Industrial Areas Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward T. Chambers]] with Michael A Cowan, ''Roots for Radicals: Organizing for Power, Action , and Justice'' (New York: Continuum, 2004), Ch. 2, pp. 44-54.&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Congregation-based Community Organizing| congregation-based community organizing]] groups including [[Gamaliel Foundation]] and [[PICO National Network]] &amp;ndash; and also often in union organizing.  It consists of a one-on-one, face-to-face meeting of two persons lasting at least 30 minutes, where personal topics and stories dealing with values, motivations, self-interest and life are discussed in an often confessional, cathartic sort of manner.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis A. Jacobsen, ''Doing Justice: Congregations and Community Organizing'' (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2001), Ch. 7, pp. 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6642">A '''river  valley civilization''' or '''river culture''' is an [[agricultural]] nation or [[civilization]] situated beside and drawing sustenance from a [[river]]. A "civilization" means a society with large permanent settlements featuring urban development, social stratification, specialization of labour,  centralized organization, and written or other formal means of communication. A river gives the inhabitants a reliable source of water for drinking and agriculture. Additional benefits include fishing, fertile soil due to annual flooding, and ease of transportation. The first great civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia and Egypt, all grew up in river valleys.

==History==
Civilization first began in 3500 BC, which along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers in the Middle East; the name given to that civilization, [[Mesopotamia]], means "land between the rivers". The [[Nile]] valley in Egypt had been home to agricultural settlements as early as 5500 BC, but the growth of Egypt as a civilization began around 3100 BC. A third civilization grew up along the [[Indus River]] around 2600 BC, in parts of what are now India and Pakistan. The fourth great river civilization emerged around 1700 BC along the [[Yellow River]] in China, also known as the Huang-He River Civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCannon|first=John|title=Barron's AP World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNyGSRxHaBgC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=river+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BqwyVKnZO-OwjAL6pYGICg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=river%20civilization&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=Barron's Educational Series Inc.|isbn=978-0-7641-3822-5|pages=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rivervalleycivilizations.com/|title=The River Valley Civilization Guide|work=rivervalleycivilizations.com|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Civilizations tended to grow up in river valleys for a number of reasons. The most obvious is access to a usually reliable source of water for agriculture and human needs. Plentiful water, and the enrichment of the soil due to annual floods, made it possible to grow excess crops beyond what was needed to sustain an agricultural village. This allowed for some members of the community to engage in non-agricultural activities such as construction of buildings and cities (the root of the word "civilization"), metal working, trade, and social organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rivers and Civilization: What's the Link?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ef0xPPsuRgMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=river+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BqwyVKnZO-OwjAL6pYGICg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=river%20civilization&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Mindsparks|isbn=978-1-57596-251-1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mountjoy|first=Shane|title=Rivers in World History: The Indus River|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pyMtW05C0h8C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=river+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UbcyVNSFF4rWiwLkzIGICQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=river%20civilization&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boats on the river provided an easy and efficient way to transport people and goods, allowing for the development of trade and facilitating central control of outlying areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rivervalleycivilizations.com/indus.html|title=Indus River Valley Civilization|work=The River Valley Civilization Guide|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early civilizations==
===Mesopotamia===
[[Mesopotamia]] was the earliest river valley civilization, starting to form around 3500 BC. The civilization was created after regular trading started relationships between multiple cities and states around the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers. Mesopotamian cities became self-run civil governments. One of the cities within this civilization, [[Uruk]], was the first literate society in history. Eventually, they all joined together to irrigate the two rivers in order to make their dry land fertile for agricultural growth. The increase in successful farming in this civilization allowed population growth throughout the cities and states within Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Cole and Stephen Ortega, The Thinking Past (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 83, 95-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[Egypt]] also created irrigation systems from its local river, the [[Nile]] River, more intricate than previous systems. The Egyptians would [[crop rotation|rotate legumes with cereal]] which would stop salt buildup from the fresh water and enhance the fertility of their fields. The Nile River also allowed easier travel among the civilization, eventually resulting in the creation of two kingdoms in the north and south areas of the river until both were unified into one society by 3000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Cole and Stephen Ortega, The Thinking Past (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 83, 95-101.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indus valley ===
Much of the history of the [[Indus valley civilization]] is unknown. Discovered in the 1920s, [[Harappa]]n society remains a mystery because the Harappan system of writing has not yet been deciphered. It was larger than either Egypt or Mesopotamia. Historians have found no evidence of violence or a ruling class; there are no distinctive burial sites and there is not a lot of evidence to suggest a formal military. However, historians believe that the lack of knowledge about the ruling class and the military is mainly due to the inability to read Harappan writing.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Cole and Stephen Ortega, The Thinking Past (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellow River===
The [[Yellow River]] (Huang He) area became settled around 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivervalleycivilizations.com/yellow.html ''The Yellow River''], Rivervalleycivilizations.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many tribes settled along the river, sixth longest in the world, which was distinguished by its heavy load of yellow silt and its periodic devastating floods. A major impetus for the tribes to unite into a single kingdom by around 1500 BCE was the desire to find a solution to the frequent deadly floods. The Yellow River is often called "The Cradle of Chinese Civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/yellow-river-in-chinas-history-195222|title=The Yellow River and its role in Chinese history|last=Szczepanski|first=Kallie|date=March 29, 2017|work=Thoughtco|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ros Beiaard of Dendermonde''' is a large [[folklore|folkloristic]] horse. It differs from the other Ros-Beiaard horses because it is used only once every ten years and because the horse is carried by people. The Ros Beiaard is on [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].

==The legend of Ros Beiaard==
* See: [[Bayard (legend)|Ros Beiaard]]

=='t Peird van Dendermonde==
The Ros Beiaard of [[Dendermonde]] is carried through the town every ten years by a guild of bearers, called the 'Pijnders'. In keeping with the [[legend]], four young brothers from Dendermonde (de [[The Four Sons of Aymon|Vier Heemskinderen]]) wearing full armour sit astride the horse. The legend of Ros Beiaard is acted out during the procession.

==Dimensions and weight==
From the ground to the tallest part of the head, the Ros Beiaard is 4.85m high. If one adds the decorations on top, then the horse is 5.8m high. From nose to tail, the Ros is 5.2m long and the width is exactly 2m. The head of the Ros Beiaard is made out of oak wood and it is 120&amp;nbsp;cm long and 50&amp;nbsp;cm wide. The horse weighs 800&amp;nbsp;kg without the brothers on top. The wooden frame has three spaces and has space for 12 bearers or 'Pijnders'.

==The four 'Heemskinderen'==
Every ten years, the selection of the four 'Heemskinderen' is difficult. The criteria are severe:
* It has to be four consecutive brothers, without a girl in between.
* They all have to be born in Dendermonde.
* The parents and grandparents have to be born in Dendermonde.
* They have to be between 7 and 21 years old on the day of the procession.
* They have to live in Dendermonde or one of its suburbs.

===19th century===
In 1807, the Ros was ridden by Pieter-Emmanuel, Pieter-Frans, Pieter-Jan and Bernard-Jozef Blomme. The horse was used to celebrate the birthday of  [[Napoleon I]] and the Concordate.

In 1850 the brothers were Edmond, Désiré, Henri and Lodewijk Spanogh. The procession celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Court and the Academy of Arts. The historian David Lindanus was also commemorated and [[king Leopold II]] attended the procession.

The inauguration of the statue of Pater De Smet in 1878 entailed a new procession and the knights were Isidoor, Omer, Petrus and Frans Willems. They also celebrated the inauguration of the new lock in the [[Dender]].

When [[Polydore de Keyser]], [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] of [[London]], visited his birth town Dendermonde in 1888, the Heemskinderen were Henri, Lodewijk, Gustaaf and Alfons Pieters.

In 1899, the Ros Beiaard was ridden by Pieter, Adhemar, Lucinthe and Leo Dieltjens. They celebrated a new bridge over the [[Scheldt]].

===20th century===
In 1914, the knights were Jan, Leo, Pieter and Edward De Bruyn. The celebration was the appointment of Leo Bruynincx as mayor of Dendermonde.

In 1930, Dendermonde celebrated the centenary of the Belgian independence and the Horse was ridden by Henri, Jean, Pierre and Albert Van Damme.

In 1952, Jozef, Rafaël, Pieter and Jan Bombay were the knights. The town hall existed for 500 years and this was celebrated.

In 1958, because of the [[Expo 58|World's Fair]] in [[Brussels]], the brothers Emiel, Albert, Jozef and Luc Leybaert rode the Ros.

In 1975 the brothers Dirk, Wim, Boudewijn and Kris De Jonghe rode the Horse. 

In 1990 the honour befell the brothers Veldeman. 

In 2000 the brothers Roy, Nick, Ken and Dean Coppieters rode the Ros.

===21st century===
In 2010 the procession was held in May and the  Van Damme brothers rode the horse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=J92QLDTD&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Pijnders''==
The guild of the ''Pijnders'' originated in the 14th century and had the monopoly on loading and unloading ships and cellars with wine and beer. Today, the ''Pijnders'' are the only persons allowed to carry the ''Ros Beiaard'' in the processions.

The task of the ''Pijnders'' must not be underestimated, as they occupy a main function in the procession in carrying the horse. The movements of the horse have to be synchronized with the directions of the director. The ''Pijnders'' are divided into three groups consisting each of twelve carriers. Every group has its leader who has to set the pace and order the special movements.

==The Hymn==
The legend is told in the city hymn of Dendermonde. The hymn also refers to the rivalry with the neighbor city of [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] who purportedly envy the Dendermonde for its horse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1191">'''S.P.I.T.''' or sometimes simply called SPIT is a methodology, or specific way of learning [[musical improvisation]]. The letters S.P.I.T. is an [[acronym]] for Scale, Pattern, Inversion, and Triad and usually pertains to the first four chord types which include Major 7, Dominant 7, Minor 7, and Half-Diminished expressed in all twelve [[key signatures]]. The use of SPIT methodology involves matching the scale, pattern,inversion, and triad to the key signature of the song that requires improvisation. The methodology allows the musician to scan the SPIT page that matches the key signature of the song for improvisational embellishments that can be applied during rests or whole notes in the melody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usma.edu/Band/education/jazz.htm "An Introduction to Jazz Improvisation" by MSG Gary McCourry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Guitarplayer.com/article/conquering-giant-steps/aug-05/12678 "Conquering Giant Steps, Master Coltrane Harmony by Deconstructing One of the Most Revered and Feared Standards In jazz History" by Cory Christiansen]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nofootnotes|date=November 2014}}
'''''Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life''''' is a 1976 book by Marxist economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and [[Herbert Gintis]]. Widely considered a groundbreaking work in [[sociology of education]],{{fact|date=November 2014}} it argues the "correspondence principle" explains how the internal organization of schools corresponds to the internal organisation of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] workforce in its structures, norms, and values. For example, the authors assert the hierarchy system in schools reflects the structure of the [[Labour economics|labour market]], with the head teacher as the managing director, pupils fall lower down in the hierarchy. Wearing uniforms and discipline are promoted among students from working class, as it would be in the workplace for lower levels employees. Education provides knowledge of how to interact in the workplace and gives direct preparation for entry into the labour market. 

They also believe work casts a "long shadow" in education – education is used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to control the workforce. From their point of view schools reproduce existing inequalities and they reject the notion that there are equal opportunities for all. In this way they argue that education justifies and explains social inequality.

The book is now{{when|date=November 2014}} considered the key text for the Marxist theory of sociology of education.{{fact|date=November 2014}}

==Criticisms==
Bowles and Gintis have been criticised:
* Philip Brown and Hugh Lauder (1991) argue that Bowles and Gintis have simplified the correspondence between education and the labour market. They go on further to state that there are changes in the importance of bureaucratic control in work organisations – it has reduced and there is an increased importance of team working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0962021910010102|title=Education, Economy and Social Change|last=Lauder|first=Hugh|last2=Brown|first2=Phillip|date=1991|website=|publisher=International Studies in Sociology of Education, Vol. 1|doi=10.1080/0962021910010102|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michael Apple]] (1982, 1986) examined the hidden curriculum and concludes teachers are being [[Proletarianization|proletarianised]] as the profession is de-skilled through the standardised curriculum. This increases state control over teachers and how they carry out their functions. He believes schools are sites of struggle and reproduction of inequalities persist. The formal curriculum is class biased. Reproduction of high status academic knowledge is prioritised through the schooling of those who are not poor or part of a minority. Textbooks neglect social conflict, which contribute to the ideological reproduction of capitalism.
* However Ramsey (1983) conducted a larger survey of schools and found a great deal of variation among working class schools.
* Hannan and Boyle (1987) argue the management and attitude of teachers control the ethos of a working class school, not all working class schools prepare their students for failing.
* David Reynolds (1984) – Bowles and Gintis ignore the influence of the formal curriculum. Much of the British school curriculum does not promote the development of an ideal employee under capitalism. The curriculum fails to teach skills needed by employers.
* Willis (1977) – Bowles and Gintis did not carry out detailed research into life in schools and they made assumptions that the hidden curriculum was actually influencing pupils. Many pupils had disrespect for the school rules and for the authority of the teacher. Working class "lads" learned to behave at school in ways that do not fit with capitalism's need for a passive workforce.

A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shop-eat-surf.com/2009/05/the-state-of-the-skateboarding-industry |title=The state of the skateboarding industry |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2014 |first=Tiffany |last=Montgomery |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812232423/http://www.shop-eat-surf.com/2009/05/the-state-of-the-skateboarding-industry/ |archivedate=August 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theridechannel.com/features/2016/08/olympic-games-skateboarding-tokyo-2020 |title=Skateboarding Is Officially an Olympic Sport.

Since the 1970s, [[skatepark]]s have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, [[Freestyle BMX]]ers, [[aggressive inline skating|aggressive skaters]], and very recently, [[Kick scooter|scooters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://skateboard.about.com/cs/boardscience/a/brief_history_2.htm | title=Skateboarding: A Brief History (page 2) | accessdate=December 13, 2006 | author=Steve Cave, [[about.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas and parks.&lt;ref name=skateboarding/&gt;

===1940s–1960s===
[[File:BackSmithGrind.jpg|thumb|Skateboarder in [[Grants Pass]], [[Oregon]]]]
The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate [[Kick scooter|scooter]]s preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars.&lt;ref name="Gnarly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SBH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skateboard.about.com/cs/boardscience/a/brief_history.htm|title=Skateboarding: A Brief History (page 1)|accessdate=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wave"&gt;{{cite web| last = Brooke| first = Michael | title = The Concrete Wave: The History of Skateboarding| work =| publisher = Warwick Publishing Inc| year = 1999| url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Concrete-Wave-History-Skateboarding/dp/1894020545#reader_1894020545| doi =| accessdate = October 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.&lt;ref name="Architecture"&gt;{{cite book| last = Borden| first = Iain | title = Skateboarding and the City: a Complete History| work =| publisher = Bloomsbery| year = 2019| url = https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;ei=b4j1W9eyHqvOgAaGk7HAAQ&amp;q=borden+skateboarding+and+the+city+bloomsbury&amp;oq=borden+skateboarding+and+the+city+bloomsbury| doi =| accessdate = November 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An American [[Women's Army Corps|WAC]], Betty Magnuson, reported seeing [[French people|French children]] in the [[Montmartre]] section of [[Paris]] riding on boards with [[Roller skates|roller skate]] wheels attached to them in late 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnhs.mnpals.net/F/UDHXUHML53N1M94P4J6T1SQHSAXALFU4C9UM65E1IQ7JYA8FJ1-51141?func=find-acc&amp;acc_sequence=088894799 ''A WAC’s war: reminiscences''] by Betty M.

Skateboarding, as we know it, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s,{{fact|date=November 2017}} when [[surfers]] in [[California]] wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called "sidewalk surfing" – a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a [[Los Angeles, California]] surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted "sidewalk surfing" and early skaters emulated [[surfing]] style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.&lt;ref name="Gnarly"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus|first=Ben |last2=Grggi |first2=Lucia |title=The Skateboard: The Good, the Rad, and the Gnarly: An Illustrated History |publisher=MVP Book |year=2011| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NxembYuScL8C |accessdate=October 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Architecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book| last = Weyland| first = Jocko | title = The Answer Is Never: A Skateboarder's History of the World | work =| publisher =Grove Press | year =2002|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O5dvdvyuTOkC&amp;pg=PA21 |accessdate=November 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in [[Southern California]] such as Jack's, Kips', [[Hobart Alter|Hobie]], Bing's and [[Makaha]] started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, [[Larry Stevenson]], in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rompella |first=Natalie |title=Famous Firsts: The Trendsetters, Groundbreakers &amp; Risk-Takers Who Got America Moving! |publisher= Lobster Press |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc-_uWnoZWwC&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thanemagazine.com/2012/08/brian-logan-interview/ |title = Brian Logan Interview |author = gbemi|publisher = Thane Magazine|date = August 29, 2012 |work =  |accessdate= October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web| last = Cave| first = Steve | title = A Brief History of Skateboarding | work =[[About.com]]| publisher = | year =|url=http://skateboard.about.com/cs/boardscience/a/brief_history.htm | doi =| accessdate = November 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called "Surf's Up" in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Skateboarder's Journal – Lives on Board|first= Jack|last= Smith|publisher= The Morro Skateboard Group|location= |year= 2009|isbn= |pages= |page= |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3IROVSEMZ4C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=Surf%27s+Up+with+Stan+Richards#v=onepage&amp;q=Surf%27s%20Up%20with%20Stan%20Richards&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, ''[[Skateboarder (magazine)|The Quarterly Skateboarder]]'' was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:

{{quotation|Today's skateboarders are founders in this sport—they're pioneers—they are the first. There is no history in Skateboarding—its being made now—by you. The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will lead to a bright future for the sport. Already, there are storm clouds on the horizon with opponents of the sport talking about ban and restriction.&lt;ref name="writers"&gt;{{cite web| last = Lannes| first = Xavier | title = Five writers that changed the way we read skateboarding magazines | work =| publisher = | year = 2011|url= http://blog.istia.tv/2011/12/five-writers-that-changed-way-we-read.html | doi =| accessdate = November 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as ''[[Skateboarder (magazine)|Skateboarder]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref name="writers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://vintageskateboardmagazines.com/Skateboarder1965.html|title = The Quarterly Skateboarder (USA) |author = VintageSkateboardMagazine|publisher = osephdreams |year = 2007 |work =  |accessdate= October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://vintageskateboardmagazines.com/Skateboarder.html|title = Skateboarder (USA) |author = VintageSkateboardMagazine|publisher = osephdreams |year = 2007  |work =  |accessdate= October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC’s “[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOwYrTMYTgs&amp;feature=relmfu |title = GIRLS Skateboarding 1965 Skateboard Championships |author = Surfstyley4 |publisher = [[YouTube]] |date = April 7, 2010 |work = Starrfilms |accessdate= October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADtgbABmG18&amp;feature=related |title = 1965 American Skateboard Slalom Championships – Anaheim, California |author = slalomvideos|publisher = [[YouTube]]|date = June 17, 2010 |work =  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland [[Freestyle skateboarding|freestyle]] and [[Slalom skateboarding|slalom]] downhill racing.&lt;ref name="Gnarly"/&gt;

One of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, [[Patti McGee]], was paid by [[Hobart Alter|Hobie]] and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://life.time.com/culture/skateboards-and-skateboarding-photos-1965/#1 |title = LIFE Goes Skateboarding, 1965 |author = Bill Eppridge |publisher =  |date =  |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |accessdate = December 12, 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130112081721/http://life.time.com/culture/skateboards-and-skateboarding-photos-1965/#1 |archivedate = January 12, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs—''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''—which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqrD0Vl5Vo4|title = Patti McGee Skateboard Champion Tv 1965 |author = Surfstyley|publisher = [[YouTube]] |date = January 25, 2011 |work = Starrfilms |accessdate= October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg644sM5tSA&amp;feature=relmfu|title = Patti McGee 1965 Skateboard Champion on What's My Line |author = Surfstyley|publisher = [[YouTube]] |date = October 31, 2010 |work = Starrfilms |accessdate= October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.istia.tv/2011/10/patti-mcgee-interview-with-istia.html|title = Patti McGee interview with isTia |publisher = I Skate Therefore I Am |date = October 17, 2011 |work =  |accessdate= October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, &amp; Jim Fitzpatrick.

The growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $10 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965 (Weyland, 2002:28). By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly (ibid) and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="SBH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SBH2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skatelog.com/skateboarding/skateboarding-history.htm|title= Skateboarding History|accessdate=September 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite web| title = Jim Fitzpatrick Interview | work =| publisher = I Skate Therefore I Am| date = January 6, 2011|url=http://blog.istia.tv/2011/01/jim-fitzpatrick-interview-part-ii-1957.html | doi =| accessdate = November 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, [[Frank Nasworthy]] started to develop a skateboard wheel made of [[polyurethane]], calling his company [[Cadillac Wheels]].&lt;ref name="SBH"/&gt; Prior to this new material, skateboards wheels were metal or "clay" wheels. The improvement in traction and performance was so immense that from the wheel's release in 1972 the popularity of skateboarding started to rise rapidly again, causing companies to invest more in product development. Nasworthy commissioned artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to do a series of paintings promoting Cadillac Wheels, they were featured as ads and posters in the resurrected Skateboarder magazine, and proved immensely popular in promoting the new style of skateboarding.

In the early 1970s skateparks hadn't been invented yet, so skateboarders would flock and skateboard in such urban places as The Escondido reservoir in San Diego, [[California]]. Skateboarding magazine would publish the location and Skateboarders made up nicknames for each location such as the Tea Bowl, the Fruit Bowl, Bellagio, the Rabbit Hole, Bird Bath, the Egg Bowl, Upland Pool and the Sewer Slide. Some of the development concepts in the terrain of skateparks were actually taken from the Escondido reservoir.&lt;ref name="Stalefish"&gt;{{cite book |title= Stalefish: Skateboard Culture from the Rejects Who Made It |first= Sean |last= Mortimer|publisher= Chronicle Books|location= |year= 2008|isbn= 9780811860420|pages= |page= |accessdate= November 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Stalefish.html?id=HVKTyRW-MSkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/peralta/iv.html |title = Stacy Peralta 1st SkateBoarder Magazine Interview

As the equipment became more maneuverable, the decks started to get wider, reaching widths of {{convert|10|in|mm}} and over, thus giving the skateboarder even more control. A banana board is a skinny, flexible skateboard made of [[polypropylene]] with ribs on the underside for structural support.  These were very popular during the mid-1970s and were available in a myriad of colors, bright yellow probably being the most memorable, hence the name.

In 1975 skateboarding had risen back in popularity enough to have one of the largest skateboarding competitions since the 1960s, the Del Mar National Championships, which is said to have had up to 500 competitors. The competition lasted two days and was sponsored by Bahne Skateboards &amp; Cadillac Wheels. While the main event was won by freestyle spinning skate legend [[Russ Howell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.skatelegends.com/russ_howell.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20011224210956/http://www.skatelegends.com/russ_howell.htm |dead-url = yes |archive-date = December 24, 2001 |title = Russ Howell Interview |author = Dan Gesmer |publisher =  |date =  |work = Skate Legends.com |accessdate = November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://skateboard.about.com/od/boardscience/a/DogtownHistory_3.htm |title = The True Story of Dogtown and the Zephyr Team |author1=Steve Cave |publisher =  [[About.com]]|date =  |work = |accessdate= November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a local skate team from Santa Monica, California, the Zephyr team, ushered in a new era of surfer style skateboarding during the competition that would have a lasting impact on skateboarding's history.  With a team of 12, including skating legends such as [[Jay Adams]], [[Tony Alva]], [[Peggy Oki]] &amp; [[Stacy Peralta]], they brought a new progressive style of skateboarding to the event, based on the style of Hawaiian surfers [[Bertlemann slide|Larry Bertlemann]], Buttons Kaluhiokalani and Mark Liddell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.dogtownskateboards.com/about/history.html|title =Our only Crime is Being Original|author =Dogtown Skateboards|publisher =|date =|work =|accessdate =November 24, 2012|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20121226053345/http://www.dogtownskateboards.com/about/history.html|archive-date =December 26, 2012|dead-url =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Stecyk]], a photo journalist for [[Skateboarder Magazine]], wrote about and photographed the team, along with [[Glen E.

Soon, skateboarding contests for cash and prizes, using a professional tier system, began to be held throughout California, such as the [[California Free Former]] World Professional Skateboard Championships, which featured Freestyle and Slalom competitions.&lt;ref name="Birthday"&gt;{{cite web| last = Lannes | first = Xavier | title = Happy Birthday Ellen Oneal| work =| publisher =istia | year = | url= http://blog.istia.tv/2011/05/happy-birthday-ellen-oneal.html | doi =| accessdate = November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor to the extreme sport of [[street luge]], that was sanctioned by the United States Skateboarding Association (USSA), also took place during the 1970s in Signal Hill, California. The competition was called "The Signal Hill Skateboarding Speed Run", with several competitors earning entries into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], at the time clocking speeds of over 50&amp;nbsp;mph on a skateboard. Due to technology and safety concerns at the time, when many competitors crashed during their runs, the sport did not gain popularity or support during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =  http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/18/sports/sp-signalhill18|title = Board out of their minds|author = Mike Horelick|publisher =  |date =  November 18, 2007 |work =  [[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate= November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://sports.yahoo.com/top/news?slug=ycn-8612409 |title =vHistory of skateboard competitions 1960s to 1980s: A brief overview |author1=Killeen Gonzalez |publisher =  |date =  June 9, 2011|work = [[Yahoo]]|accessdate= November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1976, Skateboard City skatepark in Port Orange, Florida and Carlsbad Skatepark in San Diego County, California would be the first two skateparks to be opened to the public, just a week apart. They were the first of some 200 skateparks that would be built through 1982. This was due in part to articles that were running in the investment journals at the time, stating that skateparks were a good investment.&lt;ref name="Gnarly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stalefish"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Skateparks: Grab Your Skateboard|first= Matt|last= Doeden|publisher= Capstone Press|location= |year= 2002|isbn= 0-7368-1072-2 |pages= |page= |accessdate= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU5F2ngzU58C&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=Skateboard+City+skatepark+opens+in+Port+Orange,+Florida&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3RyYUKqgL8X1iQLRmoEg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable skateboarders from the 1970s also include [[Ty Page]], Tom Inouye, Laura Thornhill, Ellen O'Neal, Kim Cespedes, Bob Biniak, Jana Payne, Waldo Autry, Robin Logan, Bobby Piercy, Russ Howell, Ellen Berryman, Shogo Kubo, Desiree Von Essen, Henry Hester, Robin Alaway, Paul Hackett,  Michelle Matta, Bruce Logan, Steve Cathey, Edie Robertson, Mike Weed, David Hackett, Gregg Ayres, Darren Ho, and [[Tom Sims]].&lt;ref name="Birthday"/&gt;

Manufacturers started to experiment with more exotic composites and metals, like [[fiberglass]] and [[aluminium]], but the common skateboards were made of maple plywood. The skateboarders took advantage of the improved handling of their skateboards and started inventing new tricks. Skateboarders, most notably [[Ty Page]], Bruce Logan, Bobby Piercy, Kevin Reed, and the [[Z-Boys]] started to skate the vertical walls of swimming pools that were left empty in the [[Drought in the United States#Localized United States droughts|1976 California drought]]. This started the "vert" trend in skateboarding. With increased control, vert skaters could skate faster and perform more dangerous tricks, such as slash grinds and frontside/backside airs. This caused liability concerns and increased insurance costs to skatepark owners, and the development (first by [[Norcon]], then more successfully by Rector) of improved knee pads that had a hard sliding cap and strong strapping proved to be too-little-too-late. During this era, the "freestyle" movement in skateboarding began to splinter off and develop into a much more specialized discipline, characterized by the development of a wide assortment of flat-ground tricks.

As a result of the "vert" skating movement, skate parks had to contend with high liability costs that led to many park closures. In response, vert skaters started making their own ramps, while freestyle skaters continued to evolve their flatland style. Thus, by the beginning of the 1980s, skateboarding had once again declined in popularity.&lt;ref name="SBH2"/&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Merza.jpg|thumb|Skateboarder at [[Skateistan]] in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
This period was fueled by skateboard companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on [[vert ramp]] skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]]) by [[Alan Gelfand]] in Florida in 1976,&lt;ref name="sm"&gt;{{cite web|title=GASBAG|url=http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000009436/features/gasbag/|work=Transworld Skateboarding|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=August 17, 2012|author=Transworld|date=October 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by [[George Orton]] and [[Tony Alva]] in California, made it possible for skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period didn't ride vert ramps. As most people could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, [[Street skateboarding|street skating]] increased in popularity.

Freestyle skating remained healthy throughout this period, with pioneers such as [[Rodney Mullen]] inventing many of the basic tricks that would become the foundation of modern street skating, such as the "Impossible" and the "[[kickflip]]". The influence that freestyle exerted upon street skating became apparent during the mid-1980s; however, street skating was still performed on wide vert boards with short noses, slide rails, and large soft wheels. In response to the tensions created by this confluence of skateboarding "genres", a rapid evolution occurred in the late 1980s to accommodate the street skater. Since few skateparks were available to skaters at this time, street skating pushed skaters to seek out shopping centers and public and private property as their "spot" to skate. (Public opposition, in which businesses, governments, and property owners have banned skateboarding on properties under their jurisdiction or ownership, would progressively intensify over the following decades.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skate For Life: An Analysis of the Skateboarding Subculture|url=http://honors.usf.edu/documents/Thesis/U69703351.pdf|work=Skate For Life: An Analysis of the Skateboarding Subculture (Honors Thesis)|publisher=USF University of South Florida|accessdate=August 17, 2012|author=Thomas Slee|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Poetics of Security:  Skateboarding, Urban Design, and the New Public Space{{!}}1|url=http://bss.sfsu.edu/urbanaction/ua2001/ps2.html|work=Urban Action 2001|publisher=San Francisco State University|accessdate=August 17, 2012|author=Ocean Howell|year=2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724004733/http://bss.sfsu.edu/urbanaction/ua2001/ps2.html|archivedate=July 24, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, only a small fraction of skateboarders continuing to take part in a highly technical version of street skating, combined with the decline of vert skating, produced a sport that lacked the mainstream appeal to attract new skaters.

===1990s===
Skateboarding during the 1990s became dominated by [[street skateboarding]]. Most boards are about {{convert|7+1/4|to|8|in|mm}} wide and {{convert|30|to|32|in|mm}} long. The wheels are made of an extremely hard [[polyurethane]], with hardness ([[durometer]]) approximately 99A. The wheel sizes are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed dramatically since the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard is derived from the [[Freestyle skateboarding|freestyle]] boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This form had become standard by the mid '90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skateboardexpress.com.au/freestyle/|title=HOME FREESTYLE Freestyle|publisher=Skateboard Express|accessdate=March 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606054411/http://www.skateboardexpress.com.au/freestyle/|archivedate=June 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001 skateboarding had gained so much popularity that more people under the age of 18 rode skateboards (10.6 million) than played baseball (8.2 million), although traditional organized team sports still dominated youth programs overall.&lt;ref name="jump"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ocfamily.com/t-coverstory_action_sports0203.aspx |title = Why kids climb higher and jump farther – on their own terms |author = John Weyler |publisher = OC Metro |date = February 2003 |work =  |accessdate = December 2, 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121102090542/http://ocfamily.com/t-CoverStory_Action_Sports0203.aspx |archivedate = November 2, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skateboarding and skateparks began to be viewed and used in a variety of new ways to complement academic lessons in schools, including new  non-traditional physical education skateboarding programs, like Skatepass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Skateboards coming to a gym class near you |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12708014/ns/health-fitness/t/skateboards-coming-gym-class-near-you/  |date=May 9, 2006  |work=[[NBC News]] |accessdate= December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Skateistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.news.com.au/world/female-afghan-skateboarder-pulls-off-fearless-big-air-at-bamiyan-buddha-site/story-fndir2ev-1226456483883 |title = Female skateboarder pulls off fearless big air at Bamiyan Buddha site  |author = Simon Crerar|publisher = News Limited Network  |date = August 23, 2012 |work =  |accessdate= December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage youth to have better attendance, self-discipline and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.webmd.com/parenting/raising-fit-kids/move/parents-pe-questions |title = What Do You Know About PE for Kids? |author = Ellen Greenlaw|publisher = WebMD |year = 2012 |work = |accessdate= December 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nmai.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/item/399/ |title = Ramp it Up: Skateboard Culture in Native America |publisher = Smithsonian  National Museum of the American Indian |year = 2009 |work = |accessdate= December 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hepg.org/hel/article/143 |title = Getting a Jump on Good Health |author = Sara-Ellen Amster|publisher =  Harvard University  |date = December 2000|work = Volume 16, Number 6|accessdate= December 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also based on the healthy physical opportunities skateboarding was understood to bring participants for muscle &amp; bone strengthening and balance, as well as the positive impacts it can have on youth in teaching them mutual respect, social networking, artistic expression and an appreciation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://business.transworld.net/98778/news/just-one-board-skateboard-recycling-program/ |title = 'Just one Board' Skateboard Recycling Program |author = Kelli Hargrove

According to market research firm American Sports Data the number of skateboarders worldwide increased by more than 60 percent between 1999 and 2002—from 7.8 million to 12.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globe International Headquarters|url=http://www.australiandesignreview.com/interiors/2183-globe-international-headquarters|work=Australian Design Review|publisher=Niche Media|accessdate=May 25, 2013|author=Domingo Antonio Robledo|date=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cities also began implementing recreation plans and statutes during this time period, as part of their vision for local parks and communities to make public lands more available, in particular, for skateboarding, inviting skateboarders to come in off of the city streets and into organized skateboarding activity areas. By 2006 there were over 2,400 skateparks worldwide and the design of skateparks themselves had made a transition, as skaters turned designers.&lt;ref name="jump"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1220532-1,00.html |title = It's All in the Swoop |author = Richard Lacayo |publisher = Time Magazine |date =July 30, 2006 |work = |accessdate= December 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-5726471"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=316.0085&amp;URL=CH0316/SEC0085.HTM |title=The 1999 Florida Statutes 316.0085  Skateboarding; inline skating; freestyle bicycling; definitions; liability. |work=leg.state.fl.us |date=c. 1999 |accessdate=December 1, 2012 |author=The Florida Legislature (1999) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406003947/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=316.0085&amp;URL=CH0316%2FSEC0085.HTM |archivedate=April 6, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cprs.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=261&amp;catid=82&amp;Itemid=56&amp;phpMyAdmin=58b368d4cb5b69c1b7d216ab094e3960 |title=Issues Facing California's Skate Parks |last=Childs |first=Marti |last2=March |first2=Jeff |publisher= California Park &amp; Recreation Society |date=Spring 2002 |volume=58 |issue=2 |page=32 |accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a_D2bsNleDoC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=skateboarding+curriculum#v=onepage&amp;q=skateboarding%20curriculum&amp;f=false |title = Skateboarding Instruction, Programming and Park Design |author = Ben Wixon |publisher = Human Kinetics |year = 2009|work = |accessdate= December 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new places to skateboard designed specifically for street skaters, such as the "Safe Spot Skate Spot" program, first initiated by professional skateboarder [[Rob Dyrdek]] throughout many cities, allowed for the creation of smaller alternative safe skate plazas to be built at a lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000157925/news/kansas-citys-first-safe-spot-skate-spot/ |title = Kansas City’s First Safe Spot Skate Spot |author = Blair Alley|publisher = Transworld Skateboarding|date = May 15, 2012 |work = |accessdate= December 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest locations ever built to skateboard in the world, [[Skateboarding in China|SMP Skatepark]] in China, at 12,000 square meters in size, was built complete with a 5,000-seat stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://uschina.usc.edu/article@usct?skateboarding_with_chinese_characteristics_12079.aspx |title = Skateboarding with Chinese Characteristics |author = Jonathan Chow|publisher =  |date = June 20, 2008 |work = University of Southern California |accessdate= November 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts have been taken to improve recognition of the cultural heritage as well as the positive effects of encouraging skateboarding within designated spaces. In 2015, the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], hosted an event at which skateboarders accompanied by music did tricks on a ramp constructed for a festival of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Finding a Line: Skateboarding, Music, and Media with Jason Moran and The Bandwagon|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/event/XPAEJ|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[John F.

Recently, [[barefoot]] skating has been experiencing a revival. Many skaters ride barefoot, particularly in summer and in warmer countries, such as [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Spain]] and [[South America]]. The plastic [[penny board]] is intended to be ridden barefoot, as is the surfboard-inspired [[hamboard]].

In the 2010s, [[electric skateboard]]s became popular, along with [[self-balancing unicycle]]s in a board format.

==Trick skating==
{{main article|Skateboarding trick}}
[[File:Kickflip1.jpg|thumb|A skater performs a switch [[kickflip]] off a stairset.]]

With the evolution of [[skatepark]]s and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional [[Freestyle skateboarding|freestyle]] manoeuvres like riding on only two wheels ("wheelie" or "manual"), spinning only on the back wheels (a "pivot"), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, also known as a "hippie jump", long jumping from one board to another, (often over small barrels or fearless teenagers), or slalom. Another popular trick was the Bertlemann slide, named after Larry Bertelemann's surfing manoeuvres.

In 1976, skateboarding was transformed by the invention of the [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]] by [[Alan Gelfand|Alan "Ollie" Gelfand]]. It remained largely a unique Florida trick until the summer of 1978, when Gelfand made his first visit to California. Gelfand and his revolutionary maneuvers caught the attention of the West Coast skaters and the media where it began to spread worldwide. The ollie was adapted to flat ground by [[Rodney Mullen]] in 1982. Mullen also invented the "Magic Flip," which was later renamed the [[kickflip]], as well as many other tricks including, the [[360 Kickflip]], which is a 360 pop [[shove-it]] and a kickflip in the same motion. The flat ground ollie allowed skateboarders to perform tricks in mid-air without any more equipment than the skateboard itself, it has formed the basis of many street skating tricks.  A recent development in the world of trick skating is the [[1080 (skateboarding)|1080]], which was first ever landed by [[Tom Schaar]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skateboarding.com.au/news/12-year-old-lands-first-ever-1080-skateboard/|title=12 year old lands the first ever 1080 on a skateboard|date=July 3, 2012|publisher=Skateboarding.com.au|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/Video/tom-schaar-first-ever-1080-video-021243187489113 |date=March 30, 2012 |title=12-year-old skateboarder nails first ever 1080 |format=video |publisher=Red Bull |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{see also|Skate punk|Punk fashion}}
Skateboarding was popularized by the 1986 skateboarding cult classic ''[[Thrashin' (film)|Thrashin'&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]''. Directed by [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]] and starring [[Josh Brolin]], it features appearances from many famous skaters such as [[Tony Alva]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Christian Hosoi]] and [[Steve Caballero]]. ''Thrashin'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' also had a direct impact on ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', as [[Catherine Hardwicke]], who directed ''Lords of Dogtown'', was hired by Winters to work on ''Thrashin''' as a [[production designer]] where she met, worked with and befriended many famous skaters including the real [[Tony Alva]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Christian Hosoi]] and [[Steve Caballero]].

These films have helped improve the reputation of skateboarding youth, depicting individuals of this subculture as having a positive outlook on life, prone to poking harmless fun at each other, and engaging in healthy sportsman's competition. According to the film, lack of respect, egotism and hostility towards fellow skateboarders is generally frowned upon, albeit each of the characters (and as such, proxies of the "stereotypical" skateboarder) have a firm disrespect for authority and for rules in general. ''[[Gleaming the Cube]]'', a 1989 movie starring [[Christian Slater]] as a skateboarding teen investigating the death of his adopted Vietnamese brother, was somewhat of an iconic landmark to the skateboarding genre of the era.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; Many well-known skaters had cameos in the film, including [[Tony Hawk]] and [[Rodney Mullen]], where Mullen served as Slater's stunt double.

Skateboarding was, at first, tied to the culture of [[surfing]]. As skateboarding spread across the [[United States]] to places unfamiliar with surfing or surfing culture, it developed an image of its own. For example, the classic film short ''[[Video Days]]'' (1991) portrayed skateboarders as reckless rebels.

California duo [[Jan and Dean]] recorded the song "[[Sidewalk Surfin']]" in 1964, which is the [[Beach Boys]] song "[[Catch a Wave]]" with new lyrics associated with skateboarding.

Certain cities still oppose the building of [[Skatepark|skate parks]] in their neighborhoods, for fear of increased crime and drugs in the area. The rift between the old image of skateboarding and a newer one is quite visible: magazines such as ''[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]]'' portray skateboarding as dirty, rebellious, and still firmly tied to [[Punk subculture|punk]], while other publications, ''[[Transworld Skateboarding]]'' as an example, paint a more diverse and controlled picture of skateboarding. As more professional skaters use [[hip hop]], [[reggae]], or [[hard rock]] music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip-hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport's punk image.

Group spirit supposedly influences the members of this community. In presentations of this sort, showcasing of criminal tendencies is absent, and no attempt is made to tie extreme sports to any kind of illegal activity. Female based skateboarding groups also exist, such as [[Brujas (skate crew)|Brujas]] which is based in [[New York City]]. Many women use their participation in skate crews to perform an alternative form of femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Deirdre|date=August 2005|title=Skater girlhood and emphasized femininity: 'you can't land an ollie properly in heels'|url=|journal=Gender and Education|volume=17|pages=229–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These female skate crews offer a safe haven for women and girls in cities, where they can skate and bond without male expectations or competition.

The increasing availability of technology is apparent within the skateboarding community. Many skateboarders record and edit videos of themselves and friends skateboarding. However, part of this culture is to not merely replicate but to innovate; emphasis is placed on finding new places and landing new tricks.

Skateboarding video games have also become very popular in skateboarding culture.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; Some of the most popular are the [[Tony Hawk (series)|''Tony Hawk'' series]] and ''[[Skate.|Skate series]]'' for various consoles (including hand-held) and personal computer.

Whilst early skateboarders generally rode [[barefoot]], preferring direct foot-to-board contact, and some skaters continue to do so, one of the early leading trends associated with the [[Subculture|sub-culture]] of skateboarding itself, was the sticky-soled slip-on [[Skate shoes|skate shoe]], most popularized by Sean Penn's skateboarding character from the film [[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]].&lt;ref name="Wave"/&gt; Because early skateboarders were actually surfers trying to emulate the sport of surfing, at the time when skateboards first came out on the market, many skateboarded barefoot. But skaters often lacked traction, which led to foot injuries.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"/&gt; This necessitated the need for a shoe that was specifically designed and marketed for skateboarding, such as the Randy "720", manufactured by the Randolph Rubber Company, and [[Vans]] sneakers, which eventually became cultural iconic signifiers for skateboarders during the 1970s and '80s as skateboarding became more widespread.&lt;ref name="Wave"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Popular"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.highsnobiety.com/2012/10/25/most-popular-and-era-defining-skateshoes-of-the-last-30-years-part-2/ |title = Most Popular and Era-Defining Skateshoes Of the Last 30 Years Part 2 |author = Fritz Radtke|publisher = |date = October 25, 2012 |work = Highsnob |accessdate= November 10, 1012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.ocregister.com/articles/-9209--.html | title= Vans strides back to O.C. | accessdate= October 29, 2012| author= Hang Nguyen| work= Orange County Register| date= June 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://archive.mensjournal.com/jimmy-van-doren-skating%E2%80%99s-accidental-hero | title= Jimmy Van Doren: Skating’s Accidental Hero | accessdate= November 13, 2012 | author= David Browne | work= Men's Journal | year= 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131016124830/http://archive.mensjournal.com/jimmy-van-doren-skating%E2%80%99s-accidental-hero | archivedate= October 16, 2013 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://skateboarddirectory.com/articles/480439_microsoft_video_games_and.html| title= Microsoft, Video Games, and Vans Skateparks| accessdate= October 28, 2012| author= Josh Rabinowitz| work= SkateboardDirectory| date= November 23, 2002| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121027222841/http://skateboarddirectory.com/articles/480439_microsoft_video_games_and.html| archivedate= October 27, 2012| df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://skateboarddirectory.com/articles/483254_vans_second_quarter_sales.html | title= Vans Second Quarter Sales and Earnings | accessdate= October 28, 2012 | author= Vans Inc. | work= SkateboardDirectory | date= December 26, 2003 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121027191512/http://skateboarddirectory.com/articles/483254_vans_second_quarter_sales.html | archivedate= October 27, 2012 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the skate shoes design afforded better connection and traction with the deck, skaterboarders themselves could often be identified when wearing the shoes, with Tony Hawk once saying, "If you were wearing [[Vans]] shoes in 86, you were a skateboarder"&lt;ref name="Stalefish"/&gt; Because of its connection with skateboarding, Vans financed the legendary skateboarding documentary ''[[Dogtown and Z-Boys]]'' and was the first sneaker company to endorse a professional skateboarder [[Stacy Peralta]].

As it eventually became more apparent that skateboarding had a particular identity with a style of shoe, other brands of shoe companies began to specifically design skate shoes for functionality and style to further enhance the experience and culture of skateboarding including such brands as; [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], [[Nike Skateboarding|Nike]], [[DC Shoes]], [[Globe International|Globe]], [[Adidas]], [[Zoo York]] and [[World Industries]]. Many professional skateboarders are designed a pro-model skate shoe, with their name on it, once they have received a [[skateboarding sponsorship]] after becoming notable skateboarders. Some shoe companies involved with skateboarding, like [[Sole Technology]], an American footwear company that makes the [[Etnies]] skate shoe brand, further distinguish themselves in the market by collaborating with local cities to open public [[Skateparks]], such as the etnies skatepark in Lake Forest, California.&lt;ref name="shoes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shoes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Footwear"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sitedesigngroup.com/projects/details/lake-forest |title = Etnies Skatepark Of Lake Forest Aerial |publisher =  |date =  |work = Site Design Group |accessdate = November 2, 1012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091003012253/http://www.sitedesigngroup.com/projects/details/lake-forest |archive-date = October 3, 2009 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Street"&gt;{{Cite book

===Skateboard deck===
{{see also|Skateboard#Deck}}
Individuality and a self-expressed casual style have always been cultural values for skateboarders, as uniforms and jerseys are not typically worn.&lt;ref name="Ethnographic"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://thesportjournal.org/article/ethnographic-study-skateboarding-culture |title = An Ethnographic Study of the Skateboarding Culture |author = Linda Moore |publisher =  |date = October 2009 |work = The Sport Journal |accessdate = November 12, 1012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091012182157/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/ethnographic-study-skateboarding-culture |archivedate = October 12, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of personal style for skateboarders is often reflected in the graphical designs illustrated on the bottom of the deck of skateboards, since its initial conception in the mid seventies, when Wes Humpston and Jim Muri first began doing design work for Dogtown Skateboards out of their garage by hand, creating the very first iconic skateboard-deck art with the design of the "Dogtown Cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://juicemagazine.com/home/dogtown-chronicles-wes-humpston// |title = Dog Town Chronicles:Wes Humpston |author = Ari Marsh|publisher = Juice Magazine|date = December 1, 2005 |work = |accessdate= November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABBvb7X3SWk |title = Walrus TV: Wes Humpston Interview from "The Run Up"  |author = Walrus TV|publisher = |date = December 2, 2009 |work = |accessdate= November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125382730236838863.html#slide/1|title = Skateboarding's History in Graphics  |author = V.Courtlandt Johnson|publisher = |date = September 25, 2009 |work = [[the Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate= November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the mid-seventies many early skateboards were originally based upon the concept of “Sidewalk Surfing” and were tied to the [[surf culture]], skateboards were surfboard like in appearance with little to no graphics located under the bottom of the skateboard-deck. Some of the early manufactured skateboards such as "Roller Derby", the "Duraflex Surfer" and the "Banana board" are characteristic. Some skateboards during that time were manufactured with company logo's or stickers across the top of the deck of the skateboard, as griptape was not initially used for construction. But as skateboarding progressed &amp; evolved, and as artist began to design and add influence to the artwork of skateboards, designs and themes began to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.noupe.com/design/art-on-board-skateboarding-and-the-artistic-sub-culture.html |title = Art on Board: Skateboarding and the Artistic Sub-Culture|author = Kendra Gaines |publisher = Noupe|date = June 14, 2012 |work = |accessdate= December 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several artistic skateboarding pioneers that had an influence on the culture of skateboarding during the 1980s, that transformed skateboard-deck art like Jim Phillips, whose edgy comic-book style "Screaming Hand", not only became the main logo for [[NHS, Inc.|Santa Cruz Skateboards]], but eventually transcended into tattoos of the same image for thousands of people and vinyl collectible figurines over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/05.21.98/nhs-9820.html |title =Extreme Success|author = Mary Spicuzza |publisher = Metro Santa Cruz|date = May 1998 |work = |accessdate= November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.skateboardermag.com/features/phillips-qa/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105102612/http://www.skateboardermag.com/features/phillips-qa/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = November 5, 2013 |title = Jim Phillips Q/A |publisher =  |date = June 1, 2006 |work = [[Skateboarder Magazine]] |accessdate = November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_20377882/wild-aggressive-artwork-jimbo-phillips-carries-well-known  |title = The wild, aggressive artwork of Jimbo Phillips carries on a well-known Santa Cruz dynasty|author = Wallace Baine |publisher = Santa Cruz Sentinel|date = April 12, 2012 |work = |accessdate= November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist Vernon Courtlandt Johnson is said to have used his artwork of skeletons and skulls, for [[Powell Peralta]], during the same time that the music genres of [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]] were beginning to mesh with the culture of skateboarding.&lt;ref name="Wave"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/action/skateboarding/news/story?id=6220433 |title = VCJ rejoins Powell-Peralta|author = Jeff DiNunzio|publisher = ESPN Action Sports|date = March 24, 2011 |work = |accessdate= November 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z30T4ogfo3EC&amp;pg=PT28&amp;dq=most+famous+skateboard+deck+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QXm2UN-7O8m3iwKxwoGwBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |title = The World of Skateboarding|author = Brian Wingate|publisher = Rosen Publishing group|year = 2003 |work = |accessdate= November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other notable skateboard artists that made contribrutions to the culture of skateboarding also include Andy Jenkins, [[Todd Bratrud]], Neil Blender, [[Marc McKee]], [[Tod Swank]], [[Mark Gonzales]], [[Lance Mountain]], [[Natas Kaupas]] and [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =  http://blog.istia.tv/2011/03/skateboard-in-hat.html |title = The skateboard in the hat |author = Xavier Lannes |publisher = I Skate Therefore I Am |date = March 14, 2011 |work = |accessdate= December 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/action/skateboarding/news/story?id=4330040  |title = Indisposable: "The Disposable Skateboard Bible" |author = Josh Brooks

Over the years skateboard-deck art has continued to influence and expand the culture of skateboarding, as many people began collecting skateboards based on their artistic value and nostalgia. Productions of limited editions with particular designs and types of collectible prints that can be hung on the wall, have been created by such famous artist as [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Keith Haring]]. Most professional skateboarders today have their own signature skateboard decks, with their favorite artistic designs printed on them using [[computer graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=47WXJ609j0MC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=powell+peralta+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xHG2UPT9Nc_piQKI14DgCg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=powell%20peralta%20history&amp;f=false  |title = To the Limit Skateboarding|author = Andy Horsley|publisher = Rosen Publishing group|year = 2012 |work = |accessdate= November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Workshop"&gt;{{cite web| last = Fleming| first = Robin | title = Keith Haring x Alien Workshop | work =| publisher = ESPN Action Sports| date =August 14, 2012|url= http://espn.go.com/action/skateboarding/story/_/id/8290604/alien-workshop-releases-keith-haring-series| doi =| accessdate = November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Skateboards, along with other small-wheeled transportation such as in-line skates and scooters, suffer a safety problem:  riders may easily be thrown from small cracks and outcroppings in pavement, especially where the cracks run across the direction of travel.  Hitting such an irregularity is the major cause of falls and injuries.&lt;ref name="Fountain-1996" /&gt;  The risk may be reduced at higher travel speeds.

Severe injuries are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="Keilani-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Keilani | first1 = M. | last2 = Krall | first2 = C. | last3 = Lipowec | first3 = L. | last4 = Posch | first4 = M. | last5 = Komanadj | first5 = TS. | last6 = Crevenna | first6 = R. | title = Skateboarding injuries in Vienna: location, frequency, and severity. | journal = PM&amp;R | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | pages = 619–24 |date=Jul 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.pmrj.2010.04.022 | PMID = 20659717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly, a skateboarder who falls suffers from [[Abrasion (medical)|scrapes]], [[lacerations|cuts]], [[bruise]]s, and [[sprain]]s.&lt;ref name="Keilani-2010" /&gt;  Among injuries reported to a hospital, about half involve broken bones, usually the long bones in the leg or arm.&lt;ref name="Fountain-1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fountain | first1 = JL. | last2 = Meyers | first2 = MC. | title = Skateboarding injuries. | journal = Sports Med | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 360–6 |date=Dec 1996 | doi =  10.2165/00007256-199622060-00004| PMID = 8969014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One-third of skateboarders with reported injuries are very new to the sport, having started skating within one week of the injury.&lt;ref name="Fountain-1996" /&gt;  Although less common, involving 3.5–9 percent of reported injuries, [[traumatic head injuries]] and death are possible severe outcomes.&lt;ref name="Fountain-1996" /&gt;

Skating as a form of transportation exposes the skateboarder to the dangers of other traffic.  Skateboarders on the street may be hit by other vehicles or may fall into vehicular traffic.

Skateboarders also pose a risk to other pedestrians and traffic.  If the skateboarder falls, the skateboard may roll or fly into another person.  A skateboarder who collides with a person who is walking or biking may injure or, rarely, kill that person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_18443561 |title = Woman killed after collision with skateboarder had been hit by one 15 years prior |author=White, Kimberly |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions require skateboarders to wear [[bicycle helmet]]s to reduce the risk of head injuries and death.  Other protective gear, such as [[wrist guard]]s, also reduce injury.  Some medical researchers have proposed restricting skateboarding to designated, specially designed areas, to reduce the number and severity of injuries, and to eliminate injuries caused by motor vehicles or to other pedestrians.&lt;ref name="Fountain-1996" /&gt;

The use, ownership and sale of skateboards were forbidden in [[Norway]] from 1978 to 1989 because of the high number of injuries caused by boards. The ban led skateboarders to construct ramps in the forest and other secluded areas to avoid the police. There was, however, one legal skatepark in the country in [[Frogner Park]] in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The secret skateboarders who defied Norway's 11-year ban|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36077122|website=BBC|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forsman |first=L. |last2=Eriksson |first2=A. |title=Skateboarding injuries of today |date=June 26, 2001 |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group |volume=35 |pages=325–328 |url=http://bjsportmed.com/content/35/5/325.full |doi=10.1136/bjsm.35.5.325 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120134908/http://bjsportmed.com/content/35/5/325.full |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |df=mdy-all |pmc=1724407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19780914&amp;id=sAAkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hGcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5528,6154421 |title=Norway to Ban Skateboards |date=September 14, 1978 |publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
The use of skateboards solely as a form of transportation is often associated with the [[Longboard (skateboard)|longboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://longboardgirlscrew.com/2011/12/board_shapes_and_its_uses/|title=Board shapes and its uses »  Blog Archive » Longboard Girls Crew|website=longboardgirlscrew.com|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on local laws, using skateboards as a form of transportation outside residential areas may or may not be legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20110430/PC1602/304309937|title=Skateboarders face legal roadblocks|last=Behre|first=Robert|date=March 23, 2012|publisher=The Post and Courier|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backers cite portability, exercise, and environmental friendliness as some of the benefits of skateboarding as an alternative to automobiles.

===Military===
The [[United States Marine Corps]] tested the usefulness of commercial off-the-shelf skateboards during [[Urban warfare|urban combat]] [[military exercise]]s in the late 1990s in a program called Urban Warrior '99. Their special purpose was "for maneuvering inside buildings in order to detect [[tripwire]]s and [[sniper]] fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=URBAN WARRIOR `99|url=http://www.dodmedia.osd.mil/DVIC_View/Still_Details.cfm?SDAN=DMSD0002959&amp;JPGPath=/Assets/2000/Marines/DM-SD-00-02959.JPG|work=DefenseImagery.mil|publisher=Defense Visual Information (DVI) Directorate|accessdate=September 14, 2012|author=LCPL CHRISTOPHER L.

===Trampboarding===
Trampboarding is a variant of skateboarding that uses a board without the trucks and the wheels on a [[trampoline]]. Using the bounce of the trampoline gives height to perform a tricks, whereas in skateboarding you need to make the height by performing an [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]]. Trampboarding is seen on [[YouTube]] in numerous videos.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Swing boarding===
Swing boarding is the activity where a skateboard deck is suspended from a pivot point above the rider which allows the rider to swing about that pivot point. The board swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a harness and frame allows the rider to perform turns spins all while flying though the air.

==Controversy==
Skateboarding damages urban terrain features such as curbs, benches, and ledges when skateboarders perform "grinds" and other tricks on these surfaces.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Rosenberger|date=June 19, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701135734/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/how-cities-use-design-to-drive-homeless-people-away/373067/|archivedate=July 1, 2014|title=How Cities Use Design to Drive Homeless People Away: Saying "you're not welcome here"—with spikes|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/how-cities-use-design-to-drive-homeless-people-away/373067/|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=April 23, 2017|quote=An example of an everyday technology that’s used to forbid certain activities is “skateboard deterrents,” that is, those little studs added to handrails and ledges.  These devices, sometimes also called “skatestoppers” or “pig ears,” prevent skateboarders from performing sliding—or “grinding”—tricks across horizontal edges. A small skateboard deterrence industry has developed, with vendors with names like “stopagrind.com” and “grindtoahault.com.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Private industry has responded to this problem by using skate deterrent devices, such as the [[Skatestopper]], in efforts to prevent further damage and to reduce skateboarding on these surfaces.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;

The enactment of ordinances and the posting of signs stating "Skateboarding is not allowed" have also become common methods to discourage skateboarding in public areas in many cities, to protect pedestrians and property.&lt;ref name="Architecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/skateboarding-is-not-a-sport/content?oid=44507 |title = Skateboarding is not a sport: Skateboarding the Sacramento streets takes skill, balance and nerve.

The paper or textile materials take on flexibility and strength through an ordered, honeycomb geometry. Depending on the number of layers, the honeycomb creates stools and benches of various sizes. When folded, the furniture can be stored like a book.

'''''Star 80''''' is a 1983 American film based on, though fictionalized somewhat, ''[[Playboy Magazine|Playboy]]'' model [[Dorothy Stratten]], who was murdered by her husband [[Paul Snider]] in 1980. The film was directed by [[Bob Fosse]], and stars [[Mariel Hemingway]] and [[Eric Roberts]]. [[Hugh Hefner]] sued the producers of the picture, stemming from his disapproval of how he was depicted in the film. In accordance with the family's wishes, Dorothy's mother is never mentioned by name in the movie, and the names of her sister and brother were altered. Other names were also changed due to legal concerns.

The film was shot on location in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and [[Los Angeles, California]]; the death scene was filmed in the same house in which the [[murder-suicide]] actually took place. The story is based on the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Village Voice]]'' article "Death of a Playmate" by [[Teresa Carpenter]]; the film's title was taken from Snider's vanity license plates.

''Star 80'' was the second movie based on the murder of Stratten. It was preceded by the 1981 television film ''[[Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story]]'' in which [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] portrayed Stratten, and [[Bruce Weitz]] portrayed Paul Snider.

Roberts was widely praised for his performance, earning the [[Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor]] and a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama]]. ''Star 80'' was the last film to be directed by Bob Fosse.

==Plot==
In 1980, Dorothy Stratten has been murdered while the murderer reflects on this. The film is interspersed with the murder and events leading up. Two years earlier, she was working at a [[Dairy Queen]] in her hometown of [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] when Paul Snider, a brash, narcissistic, small-time scam artist and pimp, makes her acquaintance. He charms her into letting him take her to her high-school prom. Dorothy's mother is immediately suspicious of Paul, particularly his attempts to ingratiate himself with Dorothy's younger sister. At the dance, quick-tempered Paul stabs her snide ex-boyfriend in the behind with a pocketknife. Afterwards, however, he wins over Dorothy with his attention and flattery, until finally he gets her to agree to pose nude for [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] photographs. He then uses the photographs to persuade a professional to create photographic [[Artist's portfolio|portfolios]] of her. After cheating the first professional out of the promised fee, he uses a second professional and sends the second portfolio to ''[[Playboy]]'', after forging Dorothy's mother's signature on an age consent form. ''Playboy'' invites Dorothy to come to Los Angeles to pose for a professional photographer.

''Playboy'' founder and publisher [[Hugh Hefner]] is taken with Dorothy's beauty and innocence, which fit the Playboy criteria, making her [[List of Playboy Playmates of the Month|Playmate of the Month]] for the issue of August 1979, offering her accommodation and giving her a job as a "[[Playboy Bunny|Bunny]]" at an L.A. [[Playboy Club]]. Paul pressures her into marrying him, which Dorothy agrees to, mostly out of gratitude. She begins an acting career with small film and television roles and is made [[List of Playboy Playmates of the Year|Playmate of the Year]] for 1980.

Paul begins spending money they don't have, going as far as to purchase a Mercedes sports car with the vanity license plate STAR 80. He squanders more of her money on failed business ventures and is increasingly eclipsed by Dorothy's success, making him feel dejected. Paul begins inviting himself to the [[Playboy Mansion]], with or without Dorothy, which annoys Hefner. At a party at the Mansion, Dorothy catches the eye of movie director Aram Nicholas, whom Hefner wheedles into letting her read for a part in his upcoming film. Paul is convinced that Aram is sleeping with her, and harasses her at home and work. He hires a private investigator to follow her, who tells him that Dorothy and Aram are indeed sleeping together. Paul investigates suing her in his roles as informal manager and husband but is told that he has a weak case. He then buys a shotgun.

Paul begs Dorothy for one last chance, but she insists that she is going to leave him. Disregarding Aram's plea for her to not see Paul again, she agrees to one last surreptitious meeting with her estranged husband at their house, hoping to placate him with a financial settlement. He first pleads with her not to leave him, then flies into a rage, rapes her, then shoots her. The screen fades to black as another shotgun blast is heard, now on Snider himself, while a voiceover is heard from Dorothy praising ''Playboy'' for what it did for her.

==Reception==
The film was screened out of competition at the [[34th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1984/02_programm_1984/02_Programm_1984.html |title=Berlinale: 1984 Programme |accessdate=2011-01-06 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "Bob Fosse's latest stylish stinker." [[Gene Siskel]] placed the film on his top-ten list of the best films of 1983, taking into account that the film was very unpleasant to watch.&lt;ref&gt;"The Best of 1983", ''Siskel &amp; Ebert At The Movies'', 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four-out-of-four stars and deemed it an "important movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19831110/REVIEWS/311100301/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Star 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing with Siskel on an October 1986 edition of ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers]]'', Ebert said, to agreement from [[Joan Rivers|Rivers]] and Siskel, that Roberts "should have been [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominated." Ebert spoke of a "''Star 80'' syndrome," with [[Gary Oldman]]'s reading of [[Sid Vicious]] in ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' being snubbed for the same reason as Roberts' turn: "Hollywood will not nominate an actor for portraying a creep, no matter how good the performance is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel|series=[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers]]|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]|station=[[Fox Entertainment Group]]|date=October 17, 1986|season=1|number=7|quote=I tell you who definitely won't be [Oscar] nominated – and should be, and that's a young British actor named Gary Oldman, who plays Sid Vicious – the punk rocker – in ''Sid and Nancy''. And he's going to fall prey to the ''Star 80'' syndrome, which is why Eric Roberts wasn't nominated: Hollywood will not nominate an actor for portraying a creep, no matter how good the performance is...He [Roberts] should have been nominated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film opened in 16 theaters grossing $233,312 its opening weekend. Eventually the film grossed a total of $6,472,990 domestically with 502 theaters being its widest release.&lt;ref name="The Numbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1983/0ST80.php|title=Star 80 (1983) - Financial Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star 80'' maintains an 90% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">In the field of [[linguistics]], '''syntactic change''' is change in the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].

==Description==

If one regards a language as [[vocabulary]] cast into the mould of a particular syntax (with [[functional item]]s maintaining the [[basic structure]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] and with the [[lexical items]] filling in the blanks), syntactic change no doubt plays the greatest role in modifying the physiognomy of a particular language. Syntactic change affects grammar in its morphological and syntactic aspects and is one of the types of change observed in [[language change]].

If, however, one pays close attention to evolutions in the realms of phonology and morphology, it becomes evident that syntactic change can also be the result, rather than the cause, of profound shifts in the shape of a language, i.e. the effect of phonological change can trigger morphological reanalysis which can then engender changes in syntactic structures.    

Syntactic change is a phenomenon creating a shift in language patterns over time, subject to [[Drift (linguistics)|cyclic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann]] (1983). "Les réactions en chaîne en morphologie diachronique."  ''Actes du Colloque de la Société internationale de linguistique fonctionnelle'' 10.285-92.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1983c-morphodia.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The morphological idiosyncrasies of today are seen as the outcome of yesterday's regular syntax.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmy Givon]], Historical syntax and synchronic morphology: an archaeologist's field trip. Papers from the Regional Meetings of the Chicago Linguistic Society, 1971, 7.394-415.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[English language|English]], the past tense of the verb ''to go'' is not ''goed'' or any other form based on the base ''go'', as could be expected, but ''went'', a borrowing from the past tense of the verb ''to wend''.

Over time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Massive changes may occur both in syntax and vocabulary and are attributable to either [[creolization]] or [[relexification]]. Some theories of language change hypothesize that it occurs because the grammatical input children receive is ambiguous, and so they analyze the underlying grammatical construction in a different manner than previous generations did. This reanalyzed grammar, in turn, may create new ambiguities, which subsequent generations may analyze in yet another manner.

In some cases, change can happen in a cyclic manner. For example, [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] can become reduced over time, until they are reanalyzed as [[Grammatical case|case]] markers [[affix]]ed onto the adjacent nouns. These case markers, in turn, may be lost over time, which will lead to the introduction of new prepositions.

An example of syntactic change in English can be seen in the development from the [[V2 word order|verb second (V2)]] word order, used before the 15th Century, to the modern word order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diachronic Syntax|last = Roberts|first = Ian|publisher = Oxford Textbooks in Linguistics|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as with other [[Germanic languages]], [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]] had V2 word order. An example from Middle English is shown in (1), where ''nu'' 'now' is in first position, and the verb ''loke'' 'look' is in second position.

(1)     Nu   loke euerich man toward himsuelen.

now look every   man to         himself

'Now it's for every man to look to himself.' (as cited in [[Ian Roberts (linguist)|Roberts]] 2007: 59)

Even though V2 was lost, verb raising was maintained in the 1600s in Early Modern English. Unlike in Modern English, the verb preceded [[adverbs]] and [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]], as shown in (2). This word order is still apparent in [[Shakespeare]]'s writing.

(2)   if I gave not this accompt to you

'if I didn't give this account to you' (1557: J. Cheke, Letter to Hoby; Görlach 1991: 223, as cited in Roberts 2007: 57)

A '''tie-in''' work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a [[film]], [[video game]], [[television series]], [[board game]], [[web site]], [[role-playing game]] or [[literary property]].  Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of [[cross-promotion]] used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.

== Types ==
[[File:Sacoche South Park.jpg|thumb|This pannier bag is a tie-in product from the [[Television program#Seasons/series|TV series]] ''[[South Park]]''.]]
Common tie-in products include literary works, which may be [[novelization]]s of a media property, original [[novel]]s or story collections inspired by the property, or republished previously existing books, such as the novels on which a media property was based, with artwork or photographs from the property. According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization, making these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film franchises. Although increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.&lt;ref name="NYT 4 January 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|title=Popular TV Series and Movies Maintain Relevance as Novels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/business/media/popular-tv-series-and-movies-maintain-relevance-as-novels.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tie-in products may also have a documentary or supplemental character, such  or "making-of" books documenting the creation of a media property. Tie-in products also include other types of works based on the media property, such as [[soundtrack]] recordings, video games or merchandise including toys and clothing.

===Novelizations===
{{main|Novelization}}
A novelization is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.

===Other tie-in novels===
Tie-in novels are often newly published editions of a novel on which a film was based, sometimes renamed to match the film's title and using promotional art created for the film. For example, when [[Roderick Thorp]]'s 1979 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' was adapted into the 1988 film ''[[Die Hard]]'', the novel was republished as a paperback tie-in under the ''Die Hard'' title with the film's poster on the cover.

If a film is based on a story shorter than a novel — such as a [[short story]], [[Novella|novelette]], or [[novella]] — a tie-in book may be published featuring the adapted story as well as other stories from the same author. For example, when [[Stephen King]]'s novella ''[[Apt Pupil]]'' was adapted to [[Apt Pupil (film)|film]], the book originally featuring the story —  ''[[Different Seasons]]'' — was republished as ''Apt Pupil: A Novella in Different Seasons''. Similarly, tie-in novels were published to promote the films ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', featuring the original "[[The Minority Report|Minority Report]]" and "[[Paycheck (short story)|Paycheck]]" short stories, both written by [[Philip K. Dick]].

Tie-in novels may also continue the story told in the original property, such as the many novels published as part of the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] set before or after the events of the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film trilogy. In 2015, the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted the flourishing market for TV series tie-in novels, coinciding with the increasing cultural significance of quality television series. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has also been credited with these works gaining a "patina of respectability" after having previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.&lt;ref name="NYT 4 January 2015" /&gt;

===Video games===
Some [[video game]]s are tie-in licences for films, television shows or books.

Video game movie tie-ins are expensive for a [[video game developer|game developer]] to license, and the [[game designer]]s have to work within constraints imposed by the [[film studio]], under pressure to finish the game in time for the film's release.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,277135,00.html|title=Review: Movie Tie-In Games Mostly Disappointing|work=foxnews.com | date=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim for the publishers is to increase hype and revenue as the two industries effectively market one another's releases.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&amp;k=10775|title=Hollywood and video game industry profit from movie tie-ins|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053417/http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&amp;k=10775|archivedate=2012-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie license video games have a reputation for being poor quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Amiga Power |date=May 1995 |author= Stuart Campbell |url= http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/world/ap/movies.htm | title = Ready For Your Close-Up }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Amiga Power]]'' awarding [[Psygnosis]]'s three movie licenses (''Dracula'', ''Cliffhanger'' and ''Last Action Hero'', all reviewed in June 1994) 36% ''in total''; that magazine being cynical towards licensed games in general, with ''[[The Blues Brothers (video game)|The Blues Brothers]]'' being one of few exceptions. One of the first movie tie-in games, Atari's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) was deemed so bad, it was cited as one cause of the video game industry crash.&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/19/AR2006071901865.html |title=Movie and Game Studios Getting the Total Picture |accessdate=2007-11-01 |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |date=10 July 2006 |work= |publisher=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such poor quality is often due to game developers forced to rush the product in order to meet the movie's release date,&lt;ref name="washington" /&gt; or due to issues with adapting the original work's plot into an interactive form, such as in the case of the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (video game)|games]] based on the last two films of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, where one reviewer criticised some of the game's missions and side-quests as being unrelated to the film's storyline.&lt;ref name="hp7review"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ps3.ign.com/articles/113/1134912p1.html |title= Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 Video Game Review - PlayStation 3 Review at IGN |work= [[IGN]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video tie-in licences for novels tend to be [[adventure games]]. ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]] (1982)'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' are [[text adventure]]s, whilst ''[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game)|I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]'' (1995) is a [[point-and-click adventure]] and ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]'' (1988) is a [[graphic adventure]]. Action games based on novels are less common (''[[William Shatner's TekWar]]'' (1995), a [[first-person shooter]]). Novel tie-ins were published less frequently after the 1990s, with developers only taking risks with stories that had already been licensed for movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Why-Are-Books-Never-Made-Into-Games-6706.html|title=Why Are Books Never Made Into Games?|author=Rich Knight|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2009-03-01|work=Blend Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue and structure ==

Tie-ins are considered an important part of the revenue-stream for any major media release, and planning, and licensing for such works often begins at the very earliest stages of creating such a property. Tie-ins provide both an important way of generating additional income from a property, and a way of satisfying the desires of fans who enthusiastically support a popular media property.

The lineage of tie-in works can be quite convoluted.  For example, a novelization might be done of a video game, which was based on a television show, based on a movie, based on a comic book which was the original media property.  In several cases, a novelization has been released based on a movie which was in turn adapted from an original novel.  In such cases, it is not uncommon to see the novelization and a movie release of the original novel side-by-side on the same shelf.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

These tie-ins can be considered as forms of "free advertising", as they create more exposure for the media property. Tie-ins need not have a direct association with the property. For example, a particular pizza company can offer coupons that are associated with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, but that specific pizza company itself does not necessarily have to appear in the movies. By this association, however, the pizza company is exposed to a bigger audience. If a media property does well, the tie-ins gain that positive exposure as well.&lt;ref&gt; Wasko, Janet, Mark Phillips, and Chris Purdie. 1993. "Hollywood Meets Madison Avenue: The Commercialization of US Films". Media, Culture &amp; Society 15(2): 271-293. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Early examples ==

Some early examples of TV tie-in books are ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' (1960), ''Here's Beaver!'' (1961), and ''Beaver and Wally'' (1961) by [[Beverly Cleary]] and ''[[Star Trek]]'' (1967) by [[James Blish]].

The '''Totonacan languages''' (also known as Totonac–Tepehua languages) are a [[Language families|family]] of closely related languages spoken by approximately 290,000 [[Totonac]] (approx. 280,000) and [[Tepehua people|Tepehua]] (approx. 10,000) people in the states of [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] in [[Mexico]]. At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]] Totonacan languages were spoken all along the gulf coast of Mexico {{harv|Reid|Bishop|1974}}. During the colonial period Totonacan languages were occasionally written and at least one grammar was produced {{harv|Anonymous|1990}}. In the 20th century the number of speakers of most varieties have dwindled as indigenous identity increasingly became stigmatized encouraging speakers to adopt Spanish as their main language {{harv|Lam|2009}}.

The Totonacan languages have only recently been compared to other families on the basis of historical-comparative linguistics, though they share numerous [[areal feature]]s with other languages of the [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area]], such as the [[Mayan languages]] and [[Nahuatl]]. Recent work suggests a possible genetic link to the [[Mixe–Zoque]] language family {{harv | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}, although this has yet to be firmly established.

==The Totonacan family==

The family is divided into two branches, [[Totonac languages|Totonac]] and [[Tepehua language|Tepehua]]. Of the two, [[Tepehua language|Tepehua]] is generally considered to consist of three languages—Pisaflores, Huehuetla, and Tlachichilco—while the Totonac branch is considerably more diverse. {{harvtxt | MacKay | 1999}} divides Totonac into four divisions, based on {{harvtxt | García Rojas | 1978}}:

*'''Papantla Totonac''': spoken in El Escolín, [[Papantla]], [[Cazones]], Tajín, [[Espinal, Veracruz|Espinal]], and other towns along the Gulf Coast of Veracruz.
*'''North-Central Totonac''': spoken roughly between [[Poza Rica]] in Veracruz and Mecapalapa, [[Pantepec, Puebla|Pantepec]], and [[Xicotepec (municipality)|Xicotepec de Juárez]] in Puebla.
*'''South-Central Totonac''': spoken mostly in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla]], including the towns of [[Zapotitlán de Méndez]], [[Coatepec, Puebla|Coatepec]], and [[Huehuetla, Puebla|Huehuetla]] in Puebla.
*'''Misantla Totonac''': spoken in [[Yecuatla]] and other communities outside the city of [[Misantla]].

''[http://www.ethnologue.org/ Ethnologue]'' currently recognizes 12 languages in the Totonacan family, three Tepehua languages and nine Totonac:

This classification is the basis of the latest version of the ISO language codes for Totonacan, although some of these classifications are disputed.

The Mexican [[Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas]] (INALI) recognizes 10 distinct languages or "linguistic variants" in the family, 3 Tepehua and 7 Totonac {{harv | INALI | 2008}}:&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.inali.gob.mx/pdf/estadistica/VARIANTE/VARIANTE_C1_sexo.pdf Linguistic Variants of Mexico by Gender]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coyutla Totonac is grouped with South Central Totonac by INALI while Tecpatlán Totonac is included in the North Central Totonac group. Other recent attempts at classification have suggested that some of these divisions, particularly North Central, Costal, and South Central, and are far too broad and include varieties that might also be classified as separate languages ({{harvnb | Beck | 2011}}; {{harvnb | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}; {{harvnb | Levy | Beck (eds.)| 2012}}).

A further drawback of the Ethnologue and INALI classifications is the lack of lower-level subgroups beyond the two-way division into Totonac and Tepehua. In the Totonac branch of the family, [[Misantla Totonac|Misantla]] is the most distinctive, and the remaining languages form a more closely related group {{harv | Arana Osnaya|1953}}. Divisions amongst the latter group, which might be referred to as "Central Totonac," are unclear, though most researchers agree that there is at least a three-way division between Northern, Southern/Sierra, and Lowland/Coastal varieties ({{harvnb | Arana Osnaya|1953}}; {{harvnb | Ichon | 1969}}; {{harvnb | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}). Recent efforts at reconstruction and evidence from lexical similarity further suggest that Southern/Sierra and Lowland group together against Northern {{harv | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}, although this is still uncertain, pending more exhaustive investigation. The most recent proposal for the family is as follows ({{harvnb | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}; {{harvnb | Levy | Beck (eds.)| 2012}}):

:Tepehua
::[[Pisaflores Tepehua|Pisaflores]]
::[[Huehuetla Tepehua|Huehuetla]]
::[[Tlachichilco Tepehua|Tlachichilco]]
:Totonac
::[[Misantla Totonac|Misantla]]
::Central Totonac
:::Northern Totonac
::::[[Upper Necaxa Totonac|Upper Necaxa]]
::::[[Tecpatlán Totonac]]
::::[[Zihuateutla Totonac]]
::::[[Cerro Xinolatépetl Totonac]] (also known as Ozumatlán)
::::[[Apapantilla Totonac]] (also known as Xicotepec)
:::Lowland–Sierra
::::[[Filomeno Mata Totonac|Filomeno Mata]]
::::[[Lowland Totonac]] (many varieties, incl. Papantla)
::::[[Sierra Totonac]] (also known as Highland Totonac)
:::::Coatepec
:::::[[Coyutla Totonac|Coyutla]]
:::::Huehuetla Totonac
:::::Ozelonacaxtla
:::::Olintla
:::::[[Zapotitlán de Méndez Totonac|Zapotitlán de Méndez]]

Lexical comparison also suggests that, for Tepehua, Pisaflores and Huehuetla may be more closely related to each other than either is to Tlalchichilco {{harv | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}.

==Phonology==
There is some variation is the sound systems of the different varieties of Totonac and Tepehua, but the following phoneme inventory can be considered a typical Totonacan inventory {{harv|Aschman|1946}}.

===Consonants===

:{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center

|}
This consonant inventory is essentially equivalent to that reconstructed for proto-Totonacan by {{harvtxt | Arana Osnaya |1953}}, with the exception of the two back fricatives, /x/ and /h/. Most modern languages phonemically have only one of these, but show some allomorphic variation between the two, with one or the other being considered basic. However, Coatepec Totonac is reported to have both phonemes {{harv | McQuown | 1990}}, and more recent reconstructions of the proto-Totonacan consonant inventory have proposed that both were present in that language ({{harvnb | Davletshin|2008}}; {{harvnb | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}). The glottal stop is a marginal phoneme in most of the languages and is posited primarily for morphological reasons. The phonological system is fairly typical of Mesoamerica.

===Vowels===

Most Totonacan languages have a three-vowel system with each quality making distinctions of length and [[laryngealization]]. The following is the "typical" Totonacan vocalic inventory.
:{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''Totonacan vowels'''
! &amp;nbsp; 
! colspan="2" | [[Front vowel|Front]]
! colspan="2" | [[Central vowel|Central]]
! colspan="2" | [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-align=center class=small
! &amp;nbsp; || creaky || plain|| creaky || plain|| creaky || plain
|-align=center
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|ḭ ḭː}}||{{IPA|i iː}}||  ||  ||{{IPA|ṵ ṵː}}  || {{IPA|u uː}}
|-align=center
!  [[Open vowel|Open]]
|  || ||{{IPA|a̰ a̰ː}} ||{{IPA|a aː}} ||    ||
|}

Tepehua has lost the phonemic laryngealization of vowels and has ejective stops where Totonac has creaky vowels preceded by stops {{harv | Arana Osnaya | 1953}}. Some Totonac languages have five-vowel systems, having developed /e/ and /o/ phonemes, whereas in others /e/ and /o/ are clearly allomorphs of /i/ and /u/, respectively, conditioned by proximity to uvular stops or fricatives.

==Grammar==
From a typological perspective, the Totonac–Tepehua family presents a fairly consistent profile, and exhibits many features of the [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area|Mesoamerican areal type]], such as a preference for verb-initial order, [[head-marking]], and extensive use of body part morphemes in metaphorical and locative constructions {{harv | Levy | Beck (eds.)| 2012}}. The Totonacan languages are highly [[agglutinative]] and [[polysynthetic]] with nominative/accusative alignment and a flexible constituent order governed by information structure. Syntactic relations between the verb and its arguments are marked by agreement with the subject and one or sometimes two objects. There is no morphological case on nouns and many languages in the family lack prepositions, making use instead of a rich system of [[causative]]s, [[applicative voice|applicative]]s, and prefixes for body parts and parts of objects. [[Possession (linguistics)|Possession]] is marked on the possessed noun, the head of the NP. Otherwise, nouns are uninflected, number being an optional category and grammatical gender being absent from the languages. Numerals quantifying nouns bear [[Classifier (linguistics)|classificatory]] prefixes, something that is unusual cross-linguistically as affixal classifiers tend heavily to be suffixes {{harv | Aikhenvald |2003}}. Totonacan languages are also known for their use of [[sound symbolism]].

===Causatives and applicatives===
Totonacan languages have a wide assortment of [[morphemes]] for increasing the [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] of a verb.

====Causatives====
All Totonacan languages have at least one [[causative]] [[morpheme]], a prefix ''ma:-'' {{harv | Levy | Beck (eds.)| 2012}}:

:{|
| colspan="3" | [[Filomeno Mata Totonac]]
|-

|-
|}

:{|
| colspan="3" | [[Pisaflores Tepehua]]
|-
| colspan="3" | čáʔa̰ɬ máalákȼḭ́n líitamáaɬkúulátača

|-
| colspan="3" | ‘He got there and saw that they had made a fire.’  {{ harv | MacKay | Trechsel | 2012a | p=112}}
|-
|}
In many of the languages, the causative prefix is regularly or obligatorily associated with a suffix:

:{|
| colspan="4" | [[Upper Necaxa Totonac]]
|-
| colspan="4" |tsa̰x kmaːka̰tsiːniːyáːn mat wan
|-
| tsa̰x ||ḭk–maː–ka̰tsíː–niː–yaː–n || mat || wan

|-
| colspan="4" | ‘ “I'm just letting you know”, he says.’ {{ harv | Beck | 2012 | p=202}}
|-
|}
In some languages like Upper Necaxa, the suffix is analyzed as part of the causative morpheme {{ harv | Beck | 2012}}, but in others it is treated as a separate transitivizer {{harv | Levy |Beck (eds.) | 2012}}.

====Dative/benefactive applicative====
One of the most frequently used valency-increasing affixes in the Totonacan languages is the [[Dative case|dative]] or [[benefactive]] suffix {{harv | Levy |Beck (eds.)| 2012}}:

:{|
| colspan="4" | Ozelonacaxtla Totonac
|-

|-
|3PL.SUB–throw–BEN–PFV || WATER || LOC=piedra
|-
| colspan="3" | ‘They threw water for her on the hot stones.’ {{ harv | Andersen | 2012 | p=186}}
|-
|}

====Comitative applicative====
All the languages of the family have a [[comitative]] construction in which both an actor and a co-actor of a verb are specified {{harv|Levy|Beck (eds.)|2012}}. For instance, in [[Huehuetla Tepehua]] a verb such as ''tamakahuːn'' 'stay, be in a place' is intransitive but can take a comitative prefix to form a verb ''ta̰ːtamakahuːn'' meaning 'stay with someone', someone being the co-actor:

:{|
| colspan="3" | [[Huehuetla Tepehua]]
|-
| colspan="3" | haː laːy k’alakt’aːtamakahuː
|-
|haː || laː–y || k–ʔa–lak–t’aː–tamakahuːn
|-
|INT || poder–IMPF || 1SUB–PL–3PL.OBJ–COM–quedar:PFV
|-
| colspan="3" | ‘Can I stay with you guys?’ {{harv | Smythe Kung | 2012|p=78}}
|-
|}

Similarly, the [[Papantla Totonac]] verb ''muxuː'' ‘bury something’ is [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] but becomes [[ditransitive]] when it takes the comitative prefix:

:{|
|[[Papantla Totonac]]
|-
|nakta̰ːmuxuːyáːn
|-
|na–k–ta̰ː–muxuː–yaː–n
|-
|FUT–1SUB–COM–meterlo–IMPF–2OBJ
|-
|‘I will bury her with you’ {{harv | Levy | 2012|p=375}}
|-
|}

====Instrumental applicative====
The third applicative prefix that is shared across the family is analyzed in most of the languages as an instrumental applicative and is used to add an object used as an instrument or a means to a clause:

:{|
| colspan="4" | Olintla Totonac
|-
| colspan="4" |  pues liːˈlɑqpɑqɬe ˈntʃiwiʃ] [tɘlɑqˈpitsiɬ]

|-
| colspan="4" | ‘So he broke the rock with it, it was split.’ {{ harv | Tino | 2012 | p=297}}
|-
|}
:{|
| colspan="6" | [[Misantla Totonac]]
|-
| colspan="6" | kít čáaču ʔút̰ ʔí k̰ líiteríkuɬ wí ɬ̰ kák̰ máawán
|-
| kit || čaa=ču || ut || ik–lii–ta–riku–la(ɬ) || wḭn–ɬkak̰ || maa–wan 
|-
| I || just=CL || that || 1SUB–INST–INCH–rich–PFV || this–ash || EVI–say
|-
| colspan="6" | ‘ “I just got rich with (i.e. selling) those ashes”, he says.’ {{ harv | MacKay | Trechsel | 2012b| p=135}}
|-
|}
In some of the languages, the instrumental can also be used for the expression of motives:

:{|
| colspan="6" | [[Upper Necaxa Totonac]]
|-
| colspan="6" | ʔeː čuːnúː paɬ tsḭ́n ʔsa̰ liːta̰sáya̰ pus
|-
| ʔeː || čuːnúː || paɬ || tsḭnʔs–ya̰ || liː–ta̰sá–ya̰ || pus 
|-
| and || so || if || be.hungry–IMPF:2SG.SUB || INST–vocalize–IMPF:2SG.SUB || INTJ
|-
| colspan="6" | ‘ “And if you’re hungry, that’s why you cry out, then.’ {{ harv | Beck | 2012 | p=236}}
|-
|}
:{|
| colspan="4" | [[Tlachichilco Tepehua]]
|-
| colspan="4" | porke laqɬuw tumin ɬiːk’uč’ukaɬ
|-
| porke || laq–ɬuw || tumin || ɬiː–k’uč’u–kan–ɬ
|-
| because || CLF–much || money || DIR–cure–PASS–PFV
|-
| colspan="4" | ‘Because they cured him for a lot of money.’ {{ harv | Watters | 2012 | p=56}}
|-
|}

As seen in the last example, this prefix is ''ɬi-'' in Tepehua languages rather than ''liː-'' as it is in Totonac, and in Tlachichilco {{ harv | Watters | 2012}} and Huehuetla {{ harv | Smythe Kung | 2012}} it is analyzed as a directional ("DIR") rather than an instrumental. The prefix seems to be less frequent in Tepehua than in Totonac.

===Body-part prefixation===

The Totonacan languages exhibit a phenomenon similar to [[noun incorporation]] whereby special prefixing combining forms of body-parts may be added to verbs {{harv | Levy | 1999}}, {{harv|Levy|1992}}. When these prefixes are added, they generally serve to delimit the verb's locus of affect; that is, they indicate which part of the subject or object is affected by the action.

| colspan="5" | ‘He put the mask on his face.’ {{harv | Smythe Kung | 2012 | p=81}}
|-
|}
The prefixes can also be used to specify the shape of an affected object:
:{|
| colspan="5" | [[Papantla Totonac]]
|-
| colspan="5" | aɬ túku wanikán čaː̰káː̰ tasun
|-
| an–li || tuku || wan–ni–kan || ča̰ː–ka̰ː || tasun 
|-
|go–PFV || what || say–BEN–INDEF.SUB || '''shin'''–cut || birch
|-
|colspan="5" | ‘He went to, what do you call it?, cut a birch tree,’ {{ harv | Levy |2012 | p=353}}
|-
|}
It is worthwhile to note that the prefixation does not decrease the valency of the verb, differentiating this process from true noun incorporation as the term is usually understood {{harv | Mithun | 1984}}.

Another important role that bodypart prefixes play in Totonacan languages is in the formulation of expressions of the spatial location of objects, which combine a part-prefix with one of four posture verbs (words for ’sit’, ‘stand’, ‘lie’, and ‘be high’):
:{|
| colspan="3" | [[Upper Necaxa Totonac]]
|-
| colspan="3" | taa̰kpuːwilanáɬ čiwíš spuːníːn
|-
| ta–a̰kpuː–wila–nan–ɬ || čiwíš || spuːn–niːn
|-
| 3PL.SUB–crown–sit–PL–PFV || stone || bird–PL 
|-
| colspan="3" | ‘the birds are sitting on the rock’ {{ harv | Beck |2011 | p=94}}
|-
|}

These constructions alternate with expressions using the independent (full) form of the part as a preposition-like element:

:{|
| colspan="4" | [[Upper Necaxa Totonac]]
|-
| colspan="4" | líbɾu ša̰kpúːn mesa wiːɬ
|-
| líbɾu || ḭš–a̰kpúː–n || mesa || wiːɬ
|-
| book || 3PO–crown–NM || table || sit
|-
| colspan="4" | ‘the book is on the table’ {{ harv | Beck |2004 | p=12}}
|-
|}
In the last sentence, the independent form of ''a̰kpuː-'' ‘crown’ is formed by combining this prefix with a base ''-n'' which is sometimes (as here) analyzed as a nominalizing suffix. Because words for body parts are inflected for [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]], ''a̰kpuːn'' ‘crown’ has a third-person singular possessive prefix, linking it to ''mesa'' ‘table’, the object on whose crown the book is located (see the section below on [[#Possessive constructions|Possessive constructions]]).

===Possessive constructions===
[[Possession (linguistics)|Possessive]] constructions in Totonacan languages are marked on the possessed noun rather than on the possessor noun:

:{|
| colspan="3" | [[Upper Necaxa Totonac]]
|-
| colspan="3" | ḭškṵ́šḭ Juan
|-
|  ḭš–kṵ́šḭ || Juan || 
|-
| 3PO–corn || Juan || 
|-
| colspan="2" | ‘Juan’s corn’ || {{harv | Beck|2011 | p=47}}
|-
|}

The person of the possessor is indicated by a prefix and the number of the possessor by a suffix, as shown by the follow [[paradigm]] from Upper Necaxa {{harv | Beck | 2011 | p=47}}:
:{| class="wikitable"
| colspan="3" | [[Upper Necaxa Totonac]]
|-
| singular || plural
|-
| kin–kṵ́šḭ &lt;br&gt;‘my corn’|| kin–kṵ́šḭ–ka̰n &lt;br&gt;‘our corn’
|-
| min–kṵ́šḭ &lt;br&gt;‘your&lt;sub&gt;sg&lt;/sub&gt; corn’|| min–kṵ́šḭ–ka̰n &lt;br&gt;‘your&lt;sub&gt;pl&lt;/sub&gt; corn’
|-
|ḭš–kṵ́šḭ &lt;br&gt;‘his/her corn’|| ḭš–kṵ́šḭ–ka̰n &lt;br&gt;‘their corn’ 
|-
|}
In several of the languages, kinship terms and words referring to parts of the body and objects are inherently possessed—that is, they are obligatorily marked for a possessor. When an inherently possessed noun is used in a generic expression, a special indefinite possessor prefix (''ša-'' in most of the languages that have it) is used—e.g. Upper Necaxa ''šapúškṵ'' ‘an elder brother/elders brothers in general’ {{harv | Beck | 2004 | p=19}}.

===Numerals===
Numerals in Totonacan languages are bound roots that require a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classificatory]] prefix which changes based on the type, shape or measure of object being counted. This is illustrated for one of the languages [[Upper Necaxa Totonac]] in the table below {{harv | Beck | 2011}}:

:{|
|-
|maktin čoʍ &lt;br&gt;‘one tortilla’|| || pḛʔtin pa̰ʔɬma̰ &lt;br&gt;‘one leaf’  || || ʔentin kḭwḭ &lt;br&gt;‘one stick’ || || paːtin ɬa̰mam &lt;br&gt; ‘one pot’ || || puːlaktin sḛ́ːʔna̰ &lt;br&gt; ‘one banana tree’ || || mustin sḛ́ːʔna' &lt;br&gt;‘one full bunch of bananas’ || || kilhmaktin sḛ́ːʔna̰ &lt;br&gt; ‘one small bunch of bananas’ || || heːtin sḛ́ːʔna̰ &lt;br&gt; ‘one banana’
|-

|-

|-

In total, Upper Necaxa has around 30 classificatory prefixes {{ harv | Beck | 2011 }}.

===Sound symbolism===
A prominent feature of Totonacan languages is the presence of sound symbolism (see {{harvnb | Bishop | 1984}}; {{harvnb | Levy | 1987}}; {{harvnb | McQuown | 1990}}; {{harvnb | MacKay |1999}}; {{harvnb|Smythe Kung| 2006}}; {{harvnb | McFarland | 2012}}; {{harvnb | Beck | 2008}}). The most common (but by no means only) sound-symbolic pattern in Totonacan involves fricative alterations, typically /s/ ~ /š/ ~ /ɬ/ and occasionally /ts/ ~ /č/ ~ /š/ correlated either with increasingly more energetic or forceful action or with the size of an event participant,{{harv|Beck|2008|p=8}} as in the following examples from Upper Necaxa Totonac {{harv|Beck|2008}}:
:{|
|-
| ''laŋs'' ‘hand striking hard’&lt;br&gt;''laŋš'' ‘blow striking with force’&lt;br&gt;''laŋɬ'' ‘blow striking with great force’ ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || ''spipispipi'' ‘small person or animal trembling’&lt;br&gt;''špipišpipi'' ‘person or animal shivering or shaking slightly’&lt;br&gt;''ɬpipiɬpipi'' ‘person or animal shaking or having convulsions’
|}
Comparative as well as language-internal evidence suggests that the pattern of consonantal alternations may have their origins in affixes indicating grade—''s-'' ‘diminutive‘, ''š-'' ‘medium’, ''ɬ-'' ‘augmentative’) (see {{harvnb|McQuown|1990}}; {{harvnb|Beck|2008}}; {{harvnb | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}). In general, the productivity of the sound-symbolic alternations is highly variable within and across languages of the family, and many languages preserve for a given stem only one of a set of two or three alternates that can be reconstructed for proto-Totonacan {{harv | Brown | Beck | Kondrak | Watters| 2011}}.

==Media==
Totonacan-language programming is carried by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]]'s radio station [[XECTZ-AM]], broadcasting from [[Cuetzalan, Puebla]].

In [[anthropology]], a '''tribe''' is a [[human]] [[social group]]. Exact definitions of what constitutes a tribe vary among anthropologists, and the term is itself considered controversial in academic circles in part due to its association with [[colonialism]]. In general use, the term may refer to people perceived by a population to be [[wikt:primitive|primitive]] and may have negative connotations. The concept is often contrasted with other social groups concepts, such as [[nation]]s, [[state (polity)|state]]s, and forms of [[kinship]].

In some places, such as [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|India]] and [[Tribe (Native American)|North America]], tribes are [[Polity|polities]] that have been granted legal recognition and limited autonomy by the national or federal government.

== Etymology ==
The word tribe first occurs in English in 12th-century [[Middle English]]-literature, in reference to the [[twelve tribes of Israel]]. The Middle English word is derived from Old French ''tribu'' and, in turn, from Latin ''tribus'' (plural ''tribūs''), in reference to a supposed tripartite division of the original Roman state along ethnic lines, into ''tribūs'' known as the ''Ramnes'' (or ''Ramnenses''), ''Tities'' (or ''Titienses''), and ''Luceres'', corresponding, according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], to the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], [[Sabines]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] respectively. The ''Ramnes'' were named after [[Romulus]], leader of the Latins, ''Tities'' after [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines, and ''Luceres'' after [[Lucumo]], leader of an Etruscan army that had assisted the Latins. In 242–240 BC, the [[Tribal Assembly]] (''comitia tributa'') in the [[Roman Republic]] included 35 tribes (four "urban tribes" and 31 "rural tribes"). According to [[Livy]], the three "tribes" were squadrons of cavalry, rather than ethnic divisions.

The term's ultimate etymology is uncertain, perhaps from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] roots ''tri-'' ("three") and ''bhew'' ("to be"). The classicist [[Gregory Nagy]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]],''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the linguist [[Émile Benveniste]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Benveniste]], ''Origines de la formation des noms en indo-européen'',  {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Umbrian]] ''trifu'' (equivalent of the Latin ''tribus'') is apparently derived from a combination of ''*tri-'' and ''*bhu-'', where the second element is cognate with the Greek root ''phúō'' φύω “to bring forth” and the Greek [[wikt:φυλή|''phulē'']] φυλή "clan, race, people" (plural ''phylai'' φυλαί). The Greek ''[[polis]]'' ("state" or "city") was, like the Roman state, divided into three ''phylai''.

In Europe during the late medieval era, the Bible was written mostly in [[New Latin]] and instead of ''tribus''  the word ''phyle'' was used, derived from the Greek ''phulē''&lt;!-- 'and ultimately the Hebrew, meaning or "sceptre" ' ← Commented this out as the connection, if any, is not at all clear  --&gt;. In the historical sense, "tribe", "race" and "clan" have often been used interchangeably.

==Usage controversy==
The term and concept of a ''tribe'' is controversial among anthropologists and other academics active in the [[social science]]s. The term ''tribe'' was in common use in the field of anthropology until the late 1950s and 1960s, during which time scholars began to reassess its utility. In 1970, anthropologist [[J. Clyde Mitchell]] writes:
:The tribe, a long respected category of analysis in anthropology, has recently been the object of some scrutiny by anthropologists ... Doubts about the utility of the tribe as an analytical category have almost certainly arisen out of the rapid involvement of peoples, even in the remotest parts of the globe, in political, economic and sometimes direct social relationship with industrial nations. The doubts, however, are based ultimately on the definition and meaning which different scholars give to the term 'tribe', its adjective 'tribal', and its abstract form 'tribalism'.&lt;ref name="MITCHELL-1970-83"&gt;Mitchell, Clyde J. 1970. "Tribe and Social Change in South Central Africa: A Situational Approach" in Gutkind, Peter C. W. Editor. ''The Passing of Tribal Man in Africa'', p. 83. [[Brill Publishers|Brill]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in 2013, scholar Matthew Ortoleva notes that "like the word ''Indian'', ''[t]ribe'' is a word that has connotations of colonialism."&lt;ref name="ORTOLEVA-2013-95"&gt;Ortoleva, Matthew. 2013. "We Face East" in Goggin, Peter N. Editor. ''Environmental Rhetoric and Ecologies of Place'', p. 95. [[Routledge]]. {{ISBN|9781135922658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes and nations ==
Considerable debate has accompanied efforts to define and characterize tribes. When scholars use the term, they may perceive differences between pre-state tribes and contemporary tribes; there is also general controversy over [[cultural evolution]] and [[colonialism]].  In the popular imagination, tribes reflect a way of life that predates, and is more natural than that in modern states. Tribes also privilege primordial social ties and are clearly bounded, homogeneous, parochial, and stable.  Tribes are an organization among families (including clans and lineages), which generates a social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some way more limited than that of an "ethnic group" or of a "nation".  [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] research has challenged all of these notions.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[Elman Service]] presented a [[Sociopolitical typology|system of classification]] for societies in all human cultures, based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:

# [[Hunter-gatherer]] [[Band society|bands]] that are generally [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]]
# Tribal societies with some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige
# [[Social stratification|Stratified]] tribal societies led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]] (see [[Chiefdom]])
# [[Civilization]]s, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments

In his 1975 study, ''The Notion of the Tribe'', [[Cultural anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Morton Fried|Morton H. Fried]] provided numerous examples of tribes that encompassed members who spoke different languages and practiced different rituals, or who shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes.  Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in which people followed different political leaders, or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes.  He concluded that tribes in general are characterized by fluid boundaries and heterogeneity, are not parochial, and are dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Morton H. Fried (1972) ''The Notion of Tribe''.  Cummings Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isolierte-Völker.png|thumb|300px|A map of [[uncontacted tribes]], around the start of the 21st century]]
Fried proposed that most contemporary tribes do not have their origin in pre-state tribes, but rather in pre-state bands. Such "secondary" tribes, he suggested, developed as modern products of state expansion. Bands comprise small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak [[leadership]]. They do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standing army.  Fried argued that secondary tribes develop in one of two ways. First, states could set them up as means to extend administrative and economic influence in their hinterland, where direct political control costs too much. States would encourage (or require) people on their frontiers to form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses and taxes, and would have a leadership responsive to the needs of neighboring states (the so-called "scheduled" tribes of the United States or of British India provide good examples of this). Second, bands could form "secondary" tribes as a means to defend against state expansion. Members of bands would form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses that could support a standing army that could fight against states, and they would have a leadership that could co-ordinate economic production and military activities.

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] continue to explore the development of pre-state tribes. Current research suggests that tribal structures constituted one type of adaptation to situations providing plentiful yet unpredictable resources. Such structures proved flexible enough to coordinate production and distribution of food in times of scarcity, without limiting or constraining people during times of surplus.

'''Wild Dunes''' is an oceanfront [[resort]] on [[Isle of Palms, South Carolina]], United States. It is {{convert|1600|acre|km2|0}} on the north end of the [[island]] and has controlled-access gates.

==Information==
Wild Dunes was developed in 1972.

Wild Dunes has two famous [[golf]] courses on it: the Wild Dunes Links Course, and the Harbor Course, both designed by [[Tom Fazio]]. It also has a nationally ranked [[tennis]] complex with 17 clay courts, and an award-winning family recreation program.

In early 2008, large-scale beach erosion led to the depletion of the beachfront area of Wild Dunes. The beachfront was greatly reduced, waterfront buildings received structural damage, and the 18th hole of the Links Golf Course was washed out. After a lengthy process, at the end of the Summer of 2008 the [[Isle of Palms, South Carolina|City of Isle of Palms]] finished repairing the beach. Approximately {{convert|900000|cuft|m3}} of sand was pumped in from offshore, leading to the restoration of over 150 yards of beachfront. Also, the 18th hole of the Links Course has been repaired, but is now a Par 3 instead of the old Par 5. Wild Dunes worked with the golf course designer Tom Fazio to restore the course's final hole to the Par 5 it used to be, a task that was completed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charlestoncvb.com/news/wild_dunes_celebrates_30th_anniversary_of_tom_fazio_designed_links_course~1097/ | title=Wild Dunes Celebrates 30th Anniversary of Tom Fazio-Designed Links Course | work=Charleston Area Convention and Visitors Bureau | date=July 2010 | accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
