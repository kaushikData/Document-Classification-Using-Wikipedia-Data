==Formation==
[[File:PSP 006875 2580 RED.NOMAP Abalos Colles cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Close-up of an Abalos Colles mound]]
The Abalos Colles [[stratigraphy]] shows similar characteristics with the 
Rupes Tenuis basal unit, and it is considered a remnant of a larger, contiguous ancient north polar basal unit. The Abalos Colles formation is considered to be the result of large-scale erosion episodes of the Rupes Tenuis basal unit.&lt;ref name="Martian Geomorphology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geophys"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=Nicholas H.|last2=Farmer|first2=Jack D.|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|title=The origin of conical mounds at the mouth of Chasma Boreale|volume=113|issue=E11008|pages=1–28|doi=10.1029/2007JE003028|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007JE003028/pdf|bibcode=2008JGRE..11311008W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probable erosion mechanisms include crater impact which formed [[ejecta]] that subsequently covered and protected the ancient basal unit.&lt;ref name="Martian Geomorphology"/&gt;

Conical mounds with flat or cratered tops could have been formed by layer accumulations on top of impact craters which then eroded to varying degrees, depending on the size of the original crater.&lt;ref name="Martian Geomorphology"/&gt; At the southern boundary of Chasma Boreale, a sequence of mounds of Abalos Coles with flat, pitted or cratered tops, show similar morphological characteristics to small [[Iceland]]ic [[shield volcano]]es of [[basalt]]ic origin.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt; Adjusted to account for the difference in topology between the two planets, both the terrestrial and Martian volcanoes share similar side slopes and volume to diameter ratios, the latter being defined as the ''volcanic productivity index''.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;

'''Andreas Cellarius''' (c. 1596, [[Worms, Germany|Neuhausen]], &amp;ndash; 1665, [[Hoorn]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Germany|German]] [[cartographer]], best known for his ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' of 1660, a major [[star atlas]], published by [[Johannes Janssonius]] in [[Amsterdam]].

[[File:Copernic solar system, Cellarius (1646).jpg|thumb|Andreas Cellarius, illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' (1660).]]

He was born in Neuhausen (now a part of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]), and was educated in [[Heidelberg]]. The Protestant Cellarius may have left Heidelberg at the onset of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1618 or in 1622 when the city came in Catholic hands. His activities are unclear at this time but based on his later works it is conjectured he spent time in Poland and may have even worked as a military engineer there. In 1625 he married Catharina Elt(e)mans in Amsterdam, where he worked as school master of a Latin School. After a brief stay in [[The Hague]], the family moved to [[Hoorn]]. From 1637 until his death he was rector of the Latin School in Hoorn, where [[Pieter Anthoniszoon Overtwater]] was conrector.

*He published on [[fortification]] and on [[Poland]].
*The minor planet [[12618 Cellarius]] is named in his honour.

==Early life==
Amin was born in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/a/23354/Ash+AMIN.aspx |title=Prof Ash Amin, CBE Authorised Biography &amp;#124; Debrett's People of Today |publisher=Debretts.com |date=31 October 1955 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231153/http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/a/23354/Ash%2BAMIN.aspx |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lived in the South Asian community of Kenya until the age of 16, when he emigrated with his family to settle in Britain. He finished his schooling at [[Stratford Grammar School]] in London. 
He graduated from the [[University of Reading]] in 1979 with a degree in Italian Studies and then gained a PhD in geography from Reading in 1986.

==Career==
He is a geographer, interested in the geographies of contemporary social, political and economic change and their effects on situated life, autonomy and identity. His research has been based mainly in Europe, but is increasingly focusing on informal settlements in the developing world. His career started at [[Newcastle University]] in 1982. He was a Research Fellow and Research Associate at the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies and also a Lecturer and later a Professor in the Department of Geography. In 2005 he left Newcastle for [[Durham University]], where he was head of the geography department and the founding Executive Director of the [[Institute of Advanced Study (Durham)|Institute of Advanced Study]]. In 2011 was appointed as 1931 Chair in Geography at [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|University of Cambridge]] and became a professorial Fellow of [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]].

A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is a interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme  

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australian and New Zealand]].

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Environmental Science degrees==
&lt;!-- NOTE: Only list institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree - those that award BSc's with specialization do not count --&gt;
This listing only includes institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree.  Although there are similar programs that are [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees that specialize in Environmental Science or Environmental Studies, they are not included in this list. In many cases, the differences are political or administrative in nature, as opposed to content.

'''Carlsen Air Force Base''' is a former [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[World War II]] [[airbase]] on [[Trinidad]], consisting of two landing strips, "Edinburgh" and "Xeres".  The airbase also included an emergency landing strip, "Tobago".

==History==
The American rights to the airfield were obtained via the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] in September 1940 when the United States transferred fifty destroyers to [[Great Britain]] in exchange for Army and Navy base rights on British possessions in the Americas.

Opened in 1942, Edinburgh Field had been intended solely as an overflow facility for [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] transport aircraft headed for nearby [[Waller Air Force Base|Waller Field]], but eventually, it grew into an enormous sprawling complex with three parallel paved runways – 5000 x 150&amp;nbsp;ft / 5000 x 150&amp;nbsp;ft / 2000 x 300&amp;nbsp;ft and an Airship operating area that made it physically larger than all the other airbases in Trinidad, being used by both Army and Navy aircraft.

Edinburgh Field became the principal combat base for USAAF bombers and Naval airships on Trinidad as well as Navy fighters with a complex of runways and taxiways that surpassed even Waller Field. This lasted until 3 November 1943, when it was renamed Carlsen Field.  It was also used by the Royal Air Force and was defended by US Army infantry and AA units.  When the Navy began lighter-than-air operations in the Caribbean in the fall of 1943, the 80th Seabees were brought in to build a station at Carlsen Field. To supplement the eight Army-owned buildings taken over by the Navy, the 80th Battalion built a large, steel blimp hangar, a mooring circle, paved runways, a helium-purification plant, and other operational appurtenances.

==Major units assigned==
* [[25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing|25th Bombardment Group]] (Headquarters), 1 November 1942 – 1 August 1943
: [[10th Missile Squadron|10th Bombardment Squadron]], 1 November 1942-1 October 1943, ([[B-18 Bolo]])

==Postwar use==
With the end of World War II Carlsen Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff.  It was placed under the command of the [[24th Wing|24th Composite Wing]] based at [[Ramey AFB|Borinquen AFB]], [[Puerto Rico]].  In 1947 Navy C-47 operations at nearby [[Waller Air Force Base]] were moved to Carlsen.

The airfield was redesignated Carlsen Air Force Base on March 26, 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10. Carlsen AFB was turned over to the United States Navy on 28 May 1949 and was renamed NAF (LTA) Carlsen Field.  Naval units used the facility until it was formally disestablished on 10 January 1950.

Today the former air and naval airship base has been turned into a dairy and agricultural area south of [[Chaguanas]] and is all but unrecognizable.   Much of the former airfield area is owned by National Flour Mills and the only remnants of the base are the name of the area in south Chaguanas, along with streets named "Edinburgh" and "Xeres"

[[Image:City Art.PNG|thumb|450px|One complex in ''City'', photo by Tom Vinetz, ''[[The New York Times]]'']]
'''''City''''' is a piece of [[earth art]] located in Garden Valley, a desert valley in rural [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Lincoln County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]], near the border with [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]]. The work was begun in 1972 by the artist [[Michael Heizer]] and is ongoing. When complete, it will be one of the largest sculptures ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|title=Art's Last, Lonely Cowboy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/magazine/arts-last-lonely-cowboy.html|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=New York Times|date=February 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''City'' will open to the public in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodyear|first1=Dana|title=A Monument To Outlast Humanity (aka The Earth Mover)|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/michael-heizers-city|accessdate=25 August 2016|work=The New Yorker|date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Like Heizer's previous ''[[Double Negative (artwork)|Double Negative]]'' (1969), ''City'' is designed and executed on a massive scale.  Covering a space approximately one and a quarter miles long and more than a quarter of a mile wide (2 km by 0.4 km, roughly the scale of the [[National Mall]]), ''City'' is one of the largest sculptures ever created. Using earth, rocks, sand and concrete as building materials and assembled with heavy machinery, the work comprises five phases, each consisting of a number of structures referred to as complexes, with some of the structures reaching a height of eighty feet.  

''City'' attempts to synthesize [[ancient monument]]s, [[Minimalism]] and industrial technology. Heizer's inspiration for the work came while he was visiting the Yucatan and studying [[Chichen Itza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimmelman|first1=MIchael|title=A Sculptor's Colossus of the Desert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/12/arts/art-architecture-a-sculptor-s-colossus-of-the-desert.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=New York Times|date=December 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heizer also cites an interest in the ceremonial squares and associated civic monuments of cites.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Management==
The cost of ''City'' is being financed by several patrons, including the [[Dia Art Foundation]] and [[Lannan Foundation]], with an estimated cost of well over twenty five million USD. The work is located on a large parcel of private land owned by the artist and is closed to the public until its completion.  Heizer is currently completing the work with a team of roughly a dozen and had, as of 2005, anticipated completion before 2010. As of Spring 2015 ''City'' is not yet open to the public. Visitors are explicitly not welcome, and due to its orientation away from the road and system of earthen berms no part of "City" can be viewed from the ground without trespassing on posted property, but photos can be seen [http://raisethestakeseditions.com/basin-and-range/ here].

==Conservation==
Garden Valley has been eyed for several major projects in the years since Heizer started working on his sculpture. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the government planned to crisscross the valley and others nearby with railroad tracks that would carry MX missiles to and from hidden silos. The program was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name=quietly /&gt;

The proposed [[Yucca Mountain Repository]], a [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] terminal storage facility for [[used nuclear fuel|spent nuclear reactor]] and other [[radioactive waste]] would have included a new [[railroad]] line across Garden Valley, and would have come within its sightline. Heizer reportedly considered burying ''City'' if this line was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knapp|first1=George|title=Yucca grandstanding neglects real impacts|url=http://www.lasvegasmercury.com/2004/MERC-Mar-11-Thu-2004/23397563.html|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=Las Vegas Mercury|date=March 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Harry Reid]] of Nevada introduced “Garden Valley Withdrawal Act,” a bill that would preserve the land around ''City'' and protect 805,100 acres of Federal land from mineral and energy development.&lt;ref name=stoilas&gt;Helen Stoilas (November 3, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Move-to-protect-Heizers-City-from-development/36231 Move to protect Heizer’s City from development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105035435/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Move-to-protect-Heizers-City-from-development/36231 |date=2014-11-05 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Reid had visited the area around ''City'' in 2007, and he soon after tried to pass a similar bill in 2010 that would designate part of Garden Valley and nearby Coal Valley as a national conservation area.&lt;ref name=stoilas /&gt;&lt;ref name=quietly&gt;Steve Tetreault and Henry Brean (October 21, 2014), [http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/sen-reid-quietly-moves-block-development-800000-acres-central-nevada Sen. Reid quietly moves to block development of 800,000 acres in central Nevada] ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, a group of American museums, including the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] the [[Walker Art Center]], and the [[Nevada Museum of Art]] joined together to urge preservation of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burns|first1=Charlotte|title=Museums unite in campaign to save massive land art project|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Museums-unite-in-campaign-to-save-massive-land-art-project/37356|website=The Art Newspaper|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the area became part of the newly-created [[Basin and Range National Monument]]. The national monument designation will prevent new railroad or power lines and other development.&lt;ref name="Jewell"&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/secretary-jewell-applauds-president-obamas-designation-of-basin-and-range-national-monument-in-nevada.cfm Secretary Jewell Applauds President Obama's Designation of Basin and Range National Monument in Nevada: President's Action Preserves Sweeping Landscapes &amp; Ancient Rock Art, Protects Existing Ranching &amp; Military Uses] (press release), United States Department of the Interior (July 10, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map Diego Ribero 1529.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Worldmap by Diogo Ribeiro, 1529]]
'''Diogo Ribeiro''', also known as '''Diego Ribero''', was a Portuguese [[cartographer]] and explorer who worked most of his life in Spain.  He worked on the official maps of the ''[[Padrón Real]]'' (or ''Padrón General'') from 1518-1532. He also made navigation instruments, including [[astrolabe]]s and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s.&lt;ref name=LAV/&gt;

==Early life==
Born as Diogo Ribeiro, he was the son of Afonso Ribeiro and Beatriz de Oliveira.&lt;ref name=LAV/&gt; However, there is no known record of the date and place of his birth. He is believed to have become a seaman at an early age and made several voyages to [[India]] as a ship pilot. Reportedly, Ribeiro sailed with Pedro Afonso de Aguiar who served as captain in the [[Portuguese India Armadas|Armadas]] of the explorers [[Vasco da Gama]] (1502), [[Lopo Soares]] (1504), and [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (1509).&lt;ref name=LAV/&gt;

[[File:Map of America-Ribero (1529).jpeg|thumb|left|Detail of the American coast from Diogo Ribeiro's 1529 map]]

==Career==
By 1516, Diogo Ribeiro and other several Portuguese navigators and cartographers, conflicting with King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], gathered in Seville to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Among them were explorers and cartographers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and [[Jorge Reinel]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ribeiro started working for Charles I (and V of the Holy Roman Empire) in 1518, as a cartographer at the ''[[Casa de Contratación]]'' in [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=REE/&gt; Ferdinand Magellan took part in the development of the maps used in the [[Ferdinand Magellan|first circumnavigation of the Earth]].

On January 10, 1523, he was named Royal Cosmographer and "master in the art of creating maps, astrolabes, and other instruments". He eventually succeeded [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] (who left on a voyage) as the head cartographer. Cabot published his first map in 1544.

In 1524, Ribeiro participated in the Castilian (''Spanish'') delegation at the [[Conference of Badajoz]], where Castile (''Spain'') and Portugal discussed whether the [[Philippines]] were on the Castilian or Portuguese side of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].

In 1527, Ribeiro finished the [[Padrón Real]], the official (and secret) Spanish map used as template for the maps present in all Spanish ships. It is considered the first scientific world map.

In 1531, he invented a bronze water pump that was able to pump water out ten times faster than the previous models.

Diogo Ribeiro died in 1533.

== First scientific world map ==

Ribeiro's most important work is the 1527 [[Padrón Real]]. There are 6 copies attributed to Ribeiro,&lt;ref name=HD/&gt; including at the [[Weimar]] Grand Ducal Library (1527 ''Mundus Novus'') and at the [[Vatican Library]], in [[Vatican City]] (1529 ''Propaganda Map'' or ''Carta Universal'').&lt;ref name=HD/&gt; The layout of the map (''Mapamundi'') is strongly influenced by the information obtained during the Magellan-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] trip around the world.

Diogo's map delineates very precisely the coasts of Central and South America. It shows the whole east coast of the Americas but of the west coast only the area from Guatemala to Ecuador. However, neither Australia nor Antarctica appear, and the [[Indian subcontinent]] appears too small. The map shows, for the first time, the real extension of the Pacific Ocean. It also shows, for the first time, the North American coast as a continuous one (probably influenced by [[Estêvão Gomes]]'s exploration in 1524/25). It also shows the demarcation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The absence of any large continent south of Asia is evidence that there had been no discovery of Australia at that date.

'''Geest''' is a type of landform, slightly raised above the surrounding countryside, that occurs on the plains of Northern [[Germany]], the Northern [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]. It is a landscape of sandy and gravelly soils formed as a glacial [[outwash plain]] and now usually mantled by a heathland vegetation on the [[Glacier|glacial]] deposits left behind after the last [[ice age]] during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, p. 214. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '' [[Geest (topography)|geest]]'' is a substantivisation of the [[Low German]] adjective ''güst'', which means "dry and infertile". It is an [[Old Drift]] landscape, characterised by the sandy depositions of the [[Ice Age]]. In the depressions between the raised flats are wet meadows and, where drainage is poor, [[bog]]s. Geest lands are made up of [[moraine]]s and [[Outwash plain|sandur]]s. They are almost always next to flat [[marsh]]lands, the geest being higher and better protected against flood but, compared to the marsh, with poor soil for agriculture. Where the geest borders the sea directly, sand [[cliff]]s exist. 

The oldest settlements in Northern Germany and Denmark lie on geest, since it provided better protection against [[storm flood]]s. Many important towns are on the boundary between geest and marshland where people could enjoy the flood-protection of the geest but still use the much more fertile soil in the marsh.

Examples of regions characterised by geest are:

* the [[Burgdorf-Peine Geest]]
* the [[Cloppenburg Geest]] near [[Cloppenburg]]
* the geest hillsides between [[Wedel]], [[Hamburg|Altona]] and [[Hamburg|Hamburg-Neustadt]] and between [[Hamburg|Hamburg-St. Georg]], [[Hamburg-Bergedorf|Bergedorf]], [[Geesthacht]] and [[Lauenburg/Elbe|Lauenburg]] north of the [[Elbe]] (see also: [[Elbe Urstromtal]])
* the central geest areas of the islands of [[Amrum]], [[Föhr]] and [[Sylt]]
* the [[Hanoverian Moor Geest]]
* the [[Heide-Itzehoe Geest]]
* the [[Linteln Geest]] near [[Kirchlinteln]]
* the [[Lüneburg Heath]] in [[Lower Saxony]]
* the [[Rehden Geest Moor]]
* the [[Schleswig Geest]]
* the [[Stade Geest]] near [[Stade]] (including the [[Zeven Geest]] and [[Wesermünde Geest]])
* the [[Wildeshausen Geest]] in [[Lower Saxony]] 
* the [[Wingst (ridge)|Wingst]] northwest of [[Hemmoor]] (Lower Saxony)

The '''General Land Office''' ('''GLO''') was an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]] responsible for [[Public domain (land)|public domain]] lands in the [[United States]]. It was created in 1812 to take over functions previously conducted by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].  Starting with the passage of the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], which created the [[Public Land Survey System]], the Treasury Department had already overseen the survey of the "Northwest Territory", including what is now the state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Rectangular Survey System by C. Albert White, 1983, Pub: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management : For sale by Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O.,&lt;/ref&gt;

Placed under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] when that department was formed in 1849, it was merged with the [[United States Grazing Service]] (established in 1934) to become the [[Bureau of Land Management]] on July 16, 1946.

==History==
[[Image:Meridians-baselines.png|275px|thumb|right|This [[Bureau of Land Management]] map depicts the public-domain lands [[surveying|surveyed]] and [[platted]] under the auspices of the GLO to facilitate the sale of those lands.]]

The GLO oversaw the [[surveying]], [[platted|platting]], and sale of the public lands in the [[Western United States]] and administered the [[Homestead Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Preemption Act of 1841|Preemption Act]] in disposal of public lands. The frantic pace of public land sales in the 19th century American West led to the [[idiomatic expression]] "land-office business", meaning a thriving or high-volume trade.

The GLO was placed under the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] when the Department of the Interior was formed in 1849. Reacting to public concerns about forest conservation, Congress in 1891 authorized the [[President of the United States|President]] to withdraw timber lands from disposal. [[Grover Cleveland]] then created 17 forest reserves of nearly {{convert|18000000|acre|km2}}, which were initially managed by the GLO. In 1905, Congress transferred responsibility for these reserves to the newly created [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].

Beginning in the early 20th century, the GLO shifted from a primary function of land sales to issuing [[lease]]s and collecting [[grazing fee]]s for livestock raised on public lands, and [[royalties]] from [[mineral]]s off lands recently withdrawn from disposal under the Withdrawal Act of 1910, as well as other custodial duties. Thus, beginning around 1900, the GLO gained a focus for conservation of renewable public resources, as well as for their exploitation.

On July 16, 1946, the GLO was merged with the [[United States Grazing Service]] (established in 1934 under the [[Taylor Grazing Act]]) to become the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency of the Interior Department responsible for administering the remaining {{convert|264000000|acre|km2}} of public lands still in federal ownership.&lt;ref&gt;

An early commissioner was [[John McLean]], later an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]].

The BLM makes images of GLO records (federal land patents, survey plats and field notes, land status records, and tract books) issued between 1787 and present publicly available on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1990, the BLM's Geographic Coordinates Database (GCDB) program has endeavored to generate coordinate values for each established [[Public Land Survey System|PLSS]] corner using the official survey records of the GLO and BLM on a township basis. The GCDB data are available for download by the public in GIS shapefile format from the GeoCommunicator Land Survey Information System website. The GCDB coordinates are also available to the public in the GCDB flat file and GCDB coverage formats via the National Operations Center website.

Cambodia's main [[geography|geographical]] features are the low lying Central Plain that includes the [[Tonlé Sap]] basin,  the lower [[Mekong River]] flood-plains and the [[Bassac River]] plain surrounded by mountain ranges to the north, east, in the south-west and south. The central lowlands extend into Vietnam to the south-east. The south and south-west of the country constitute a {{convert|443|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long coast at the Gulf of Thailand, characterized by sizable [[mangrove]] marshes, [[peninsula]]s, sandy beaches and [[headlands and bays]]. Cambodia's territorial waters account for over 50 islands. The highest peak is [[Phnom Aural]], sitting {{convert|1810|m|ft|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rrcap.ait.asia/lc/cd/html/countryrep/cambodia/report.pdf |title=Cambodia Study Area |website=Regional Resource Centre for Asia and the Pacific(RRC.AP) |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodata.rrcap.unep.org/all_reports/cambodia_081010.pdf|title=Cambodia Environment Outlook - NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES -  Geography and Climate|date=|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=May 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727032144/http://geodata.rrcap.unep.org/all_reports/cambodia_081010.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oGnZRd4GKwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=cambodia+etymology#v=onepage&amp;q=cambodia%20etymology&amp;f=false  |title= Cambodia   |date=  |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===

"Sandy materials cover a large proportion of the landscape of Cambodia, on account of the [[Siliceous rock|siliceous]] [[sediment]]ary formations that underlie much of the Kingdom. [[Mesozoic]] [[sandstone]] dominates most of the basement geology in Cambodia and hence has a dominating influence on the properties of upland soils. [[Arenosol]]s (sandy soils featuring very weak or no soil development) are mapped on only 1.6% of the land area."

"Sandy surface textures are more prevalent than the deep sandy soils that fit the definition for [[Arenosol]]s. Sandy textured profiles are common amongst the most prevalent soil groups, including [[Acrisol]]s and [[Leptosol]]s. The [[Acrisol]]s are the most prevalent soil group occupying the lowlands - nearly half of the land area of Cambodia. Low fertility and toxic amounts of aluminium pose limitations to its agricultural use, crops that can be successfully cultivated include [[rubber tree]], [[oil palm]], [[coffee]] and [[sugar cane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8594E/w8594e00.htm#  |title= World reference base for soil resources | publisher= FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS Rome, 1998 |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central plain===
[[Image:Cambo 152.jpg|thumb|right|'''extensive flooding in central Cambodia''']]

The vast [[Alluvial plain|alluvial]] and [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]] interconnected Cambodian flood-plain is a geologically relatively recent depression where the sediments of the Mekong and its tributaries accumulate as waters are subject to frequent course changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrcmekong.org/RAK/html/1.2.5a_lower_reaches.html |title=THE LOWER REACHES AND DELTA REGIONS |website=MRC Mekong |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area covers {{convert|25069|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The [[Tonlé Sap]] lake and - river system occupies the lowest area. The Tonle Sap river is a waterway that branches off the Mekong near Phnom Penh in the north-westerly direction and meets the Tonle Sap lake after around {{convert|115|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Its waters' flow reverses direction every year, caused by greatly varying amounts of water carried by the Mekong over the course of a year and the impact of monsoonal rains, that coincides with the river's maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Cambodian+Plain |title= Cambodian Plain definition of Cambodian Plain | publisher= Free Online Encyclopedia |date=  |accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plains of the Mekong and Tonle Sap basin are confined in the North by the Dangrek and Central Annamite Mountains, and to the South by the Cardamom Mountains and Elephant Mountains. The plains completely surround the Tonle Sap Lake in the western half of the country and wind their way through the middle of the country following the course of the Mekong River. The two basins actually form a single body of water, the whole of which effects about 75% of Cambodia’s land cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treeseedfa.org/doc/GeneEcologicalZonation/4DescriptionofEcological.pdf |title=Description of Ecological Factors in Cambodia |publisher=Cambodia Tree Seed Project |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095439/http://www.treeseedfa.org/doc/GeneEcologicalZonation/4DescriptionofEcological.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow reversal===
[[File:Tonle Sap Lake phases.gif|thumb|right|'''Tonle Sap Lake volume over the course of one year''']]
The Mekong river and its tributaries increase water volumes in spring (May) on the northern hemisphere, mainly caused by melting snows. As the Mekong enters Cambodia (over 95% of its waters have already joined the river) it widens and inundates large areas.

{{quotation|"There is extreme hydrodynamic complexity in both time and space and it becomes impossible to measure channel discharge. Water levels, not flow rates and volumes, determine the movement of water across the landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mekonginfo.org/assets/midocs/0001968-inland-waters-overview-of-the-hydrology-of-the-mekong-basin.pdf |title=Overview of the Hydrology of the Mekong Basin  | publisher= Mekong Info |date=October 1, 2005  |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The plain's deepest point - the Tonle Sap -  flooded area varies from a low of around {{convert|2700|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} with a depth of around 1 meter at the end of the dry season (April) to {{convert|26000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and a depth of up to 9 meters in October/November. This figure rose to {{convert|45000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} during 2000 when some of the worst flood conditions recorded caused over 800 deaths in Cambodia and Vietnam.

Inflow starts in May/June with maximum rates of flow of around 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s by late August and ends in October/November, amplified by precipitation of the annual monsoon. In November the lake reaches its maximum size. The annual monsoon coincides to cease around this time of the year. As the Mekong river begins its minimum around this time of the year and its water level falls deeper than the inundated Tonle Sap lake, Tonle Sap river and surrounding wetlands, waters of the lake's basin now drains via the Tonle Sap river into the Mekong. As a result the Tonle Sap River (length around {{convert|115|km|mi|abbr=on}}) flows 6 months a year from South-East (Mekong) to North-West (lake) and 6 month a year in the opposite direction. The mean annual reverse flow volume in the Tonle Sap is {{convert|30|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}, or about half of the maximum lake volume. A further 10% is estimated to enter the system by overland flow from the Mekong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tonlesap.net/ |title= Tonle Sap Cambodia - River Lake |publisher= Tonle Sap |date=  |accessdate= May 12, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150504074909/http://tonlesap.net/ |archive-date= May 4, 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="State of water : Cambodia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/cambodia/overview1_4.htm |title=State of water : Cambodia  | publisher= WEPA |date=  |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mekong branches off into [[Bassac River|several arms]] near [[Phnom Penh]] and reaches Vietnamese territory south of Koh Thom and Loek Daek districts of [[Kandal Province]].

'''The Dangrek Mountains'''
{{main|Dângrêk Mountains}}

A forested range of hills averaging {{convert|450|to|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, dividing Thailand from Cambodia, mainly formed of massive sandstone with slate and silt. A few characteristic basalt hills are located on the northern side of the mountain chain. This east–west-trending range extends from the Mekong River westward for approximately {{convert|320|km|mi|abbr=on}}, merging with the highland area near San Kamphaeng, Thailand. Essentially the southern escarpment of the sandstone [[Khorat Plateau]] of northeastern Thailand, the Dângrêk range slopes gradually northward to the Mun River in Thailand but falls more abruptly in the south to the Cambodian plain. Its highest point is {{convert|761|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The watershed along the escarpment in general terms marks the boundary between [[Thailand]] and Cambodia, however there are exceptions. The region is covered in dry [[evergreen forest]], mixed [[dipterocarp forest]], and [[deciduous]] dipterocarp forests. Tree species like [[Pterocarpus macrocarpus]], [[Shorea siamensis]] and [[Xylia xylocarpa|Xylia xylocarpa var. kerrii]] dominate. [[Illegal logging]] are issues on both, the Thai as well as on the Cambodian side, leaving large hill stretches denuded, vulnerable tree species such as [[Dalbergia cochinchinensis]] have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/277288/dsi-claims-illegal-logging-rampant |title= DSI claims illegal logging rampant |website= Bangkok Post |date= January 29, 2012 |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest fires are common during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/150936/Dangrek-Mountains |title=Dângrêk Mountains | publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annamite Range'''
{{main|Annamite Range}}

Lying to the east of the Mekong River, the long chain of mountains called the Annamite Mountains of Indochina and the lowlands that surround them make up the Greater Annamites ecoregion. Levels of rainfall vary from {{convert|1500|to|3850|mm|in|abbr=on}} annually. Mean annual temperatures are about {{convert|20|C|F|abbr=on}}. This eco-region contains some of the last relatively intact [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|moist forests]] in Indochina. Moisture-laden monsoon winds, that blow in from the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] ensure permanent high air humidity. Plants and animals adapted to moist conditions, to seek refuge here and evolve into highly specialized types that are found nowhere else on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/im0152 | title=Southeastern Asia: Vietnam into Laos and Cambodia | publisher= WWF |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Annamite+Cordillera | title=Annamite Cordillera | publisher= The Free Dictionary |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/annamite_moist_forests.cfm |title=Annamite Range Moist Forests |publisher=WWF |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808092528/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/annamite_moist_forests.cfm |archive-date=2017-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Koppen World Map Am.png|thumb|right|300px|Worldwide zones of tropical monsoon climate (Am).]]
Cambodia's climate, like that of much of the rest of mainland Southeast Asia is dominated by [[monsoon]]s, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences. The monsoonal air-flows are caused by annual alternating high pressure and low pressure over the Central Asian landmass. In summer, moisture-laden air—the southwest monsoon—is drawn landward from the Indian Ocean. The flow is reversed during the winter, and the northeast monsoon sends back dry air. The southwest monsoon brings the rainy season from mid-May to mid-September or to early October, and the northeast monsoon flow of drier and cooler air lasts from early November to March. Temperatures are fairly uniform throughout the [[Tonlé Sap]] Basin area, with only small variations from the average annual mean of around {{convert|25|°C|1}}.

The maximum mean is about {{convert|30|°C|abbr=on}} ; the minimum mean, about {{convert|24|°C|abbr=on}}. Maximum temperatures of higher than {{convert|32|°C|abbr=on}}, however, are common and, just before the start of the rainy season, they may rise to more than {{convert|38|°C|abbr=on}}. Minimum night temperatures sporadically fall below {{convert|20|°C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web    |url=http://www.cambodiaweather.net/weather/sihanoukville-cambodia-weather-in-january.html    |title=Sihanoukville weather in January    |publisher=Cambodia Weather net    |date=    |accessdate=May 27, 2015    |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527111738/http://www.cambodiaweather.net/weather/sihanoukville-cambodia-weather-in-january.html    |archive-date=2015-05-27    |dead-url=yes    |df=    }}&lt;/ref&gt; in January, the coldest month. May is the warmest month - although strongly influenced by the beginning of the wet season, as the area constitutes the easternmost fringe of the [[Monsoon of South Asia|south-west monsoon]]. Tropical cyclones only rarely cause damage in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canbypublications.com/cambodia/climate.htm |title=Cambodia: Climate and Weather  | publisher= Canby Publications Co.  |date=  |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visit-mekong.com/cambodia/weather.htm |title=CAMBODIA WEATHER - CLIMATE AND SEASONS IN CAMBODIA  | publisher= Visit Mekong  |date=  |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total annual rainfall average is between {{convert|1000|and|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the heaviest amounts fall in the southeast. Rainfall from April to September in the [[Tonlé Sap]] Basin-Mekong Lowlands area averages {{convert|1300|to|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually, but the amount varies considerably from year to year. Rainfall around the basin increases with elevation. It is heaviest in the mountains along the coast in the southwest, which receive from {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually as the southwest monsoon reaches the coast. This area of greatest rainfall, however, drains mostly to the sea; only a small quantity goes into the rivers flowing into the basin. Relative humidity is high throughout the entire year; usually exceeding 90%. During the dry season daytime humidity rates average around 50 percent or slightly lower, climbing to about 90% during the rainy season.&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90520/Cambodia/52452/Climate |title=Cambodia's climate |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct rainfall on the lake and the other rivers in the sub-basin contribute the remaining 38%. Major rivers are the [[Stung Sen Wildlife Sanctuary|Sen river]], [[Sreng River]], [[Stung Pouthisat River]], [[Sisophon River]], [[Mongkol Borei River]], and [[Sangkae River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/espim/country/cambodia/print1.stm | title=FAO's Information System on Water and Agriculture | publisher= AQUASTAT  |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/cambodia/river.htm | title=State of water environmental issues | publisher= Water Environment Partnership in Asia  |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller rivers in the southeast, the Cardamom Mountains and Elephant Range form separate [[drainage divide]]s. To the east the rivers flow into the Tonle Sap, as in the south-west rivers flow into the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Toward the southern slopes of the Elephant Mountains, small rivers flow south-eastward on the eastern side of the divide.

The Mekong River flows southward from the Cambodia-Laos border to a point south of [[Kratié (town)]], where it turns west for about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} and then turns southwest towards Phnom Penh. Extensive rapids run north of [[Kratié (town)|Kratie city]]. From [[Kampong Cham Province]] the gradient slopes very gently, and inundation of areas along the river occurs at flood stage. From June through November—through breaks in the natural [[levee]]s that have built up along its course. At Phnom Penh four major water courses meet at a point called the Chattomukh (Four Faces). The Mekong River flows in from the northeast and the Tonle Sap river emanates from the Tonle Sap—flows in from the northwest. They divide into two parallel channels, the Mekong River proper and the [[Bassac River]], and flow independently through the delta areas of Cambodia and Vietnam to the [[South China Sea]].

The flow of water into the Tonle Sap is seasonal. In spring, the flow of the Mekong River, fed by monsoon rains, increases to a point where its outlets through the delta can't handle the enormous volume of water. At this point, the water pushes northward up the Tonle Sap river and empties into the Tonle Sap lake, thereby increasing the size of the lake from about {{convert|2590|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|24605|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} at the height of the flooding. After the Mekong's waters crest — when its downstream channels can handle the volume of water — the flow reverses, and water flows out of the engorged lake.

As the level of the Tonle Sap retreats, it deposits a new layer of sediment. The annual flooding, combined with poor drainage immediately around the lake, transforms the surrounding area into marshlands, unusable for agricultural purposes during the dry season. The sediment deposited into the lake during the Mekong's flood stage appears to be greater than the quantity carried away later by the Tonle Sap River. Gradual silting of the lake would seem to be occurring; during low-water level, it is only about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, while at flood stage it is between {{convert|10|and|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mekonginfo.org/assets/midocs/0001968-inland-waters-overview-of-the-hydrology-of-the-mekong-basin.pdf |title= Overview of the Hydrology of the Mekong Basin | publisher= Mekong River Commission |date=  |accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/38.htm |title= Cambodia - Rivers |website= U.S. Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetation &amp; ecoregions==
[[File:Forest and land cover Cambodia.jpg|thumb|left| '''map of forests, vegetation and land use in Cambodia''']]
Cambodia has one of the highest levels of forest cover in the region as the interdependence of Cambodia’s geography and hydrology makes it rich in natural resources and biological diversity - among the bio-richest countries in Southeast Asia. The Royal Government of Cambodia estimates Cambodia contains approximately 10.36 million hectares of forest cover, representing approximately 57.07% of Cambodia’s land area (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://cambodia.panda.org/where_we_work/dry_forests/ |title=Saving Cambodia's Dry Forests |publisher=WWF |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521101348/http://cambodia.panda.org/where_we_work/dry_forests/# |archive-date=2015-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, international observers and independent sources provide rather different numbers.

According to the ''Forestry Administration'' statistics, a total of 380,000 hectares of forest were cleared between 2002 and 2005/2006 - a deforestation rate of 0.5% per year. The main cause of deforestation has been determined to be large-scale agricultural expansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_country&amp;view=countries&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=587 | title=Cambodia | publisher= UN-REDD org  |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/genetics-and-conservation/international-conifer-conservation-programme/conifers-of-cambodia-lao-pdr-and-vietnam |title=Conifers of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam |publisher=The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129234736/http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/genetics-and-conservation/international-conifer-conservation-programme/conifers-of-cambodia-lao-pdr-and-vietnam |archivedate=November 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Annamites Montane Rain Forests ecoregion===

The [[Annamite Range|Southern Annamites Montane Rain Forests ecoregion]] of the [[Montane ecology|montane]] forests of Kontuey Nea, "the dragon's tail" in the remote north-west of Cambodia, where the boundaries of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam meet, is remarkably rich in [[biodiversity]]. The relatively intact forests occupy a broad topographic range - from lowlands with wet evergreen forests to montane habitats with evergreen hardwood and [[conifer]] forests. The complex geological, topographic and climatic ( rainfall and temperature ) facets that characterize the region make forest structure and composition unique and very variable. There is a unusually high number of near-endemic and [[endemic]] species among the many species to be found in the area,. The entire eco-region has a size of {{convert|94000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156174/ | title=Southern Annamites montane rain forests | publisher= eoearth  |date=May 7, 2014  |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=100 |title= Tropical Rainforest - Biomes of the World |website= Department of Geospatial Science Radford University |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/07/sci_nat_vietnam_unveiled/html/1.stm |title= In pictures: Vietnam unveiled, Green flash |website= BBC News |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Great Lake ecosystem===
[[Image:Engkabang (Shorea sp.) (15607560356).jpg|thumb|right|'''[[Dipterocarpaceae]]''']]
The Tonle Sap, also known as the Great Lake in central Cambodia is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and one of the richest inland fishing grounds in the world. The Lake functions as a natural flood water reservoir for the Mekong system as a whole and therefore is an important source of water for the Mekong Delta during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whrm-kamoto.com/assets/files/PublicationFile20%20tonele%20sap.pdf   |title= The importance of Tonle Sap at multiple levels |publisher=  Water Hazard and Risk management |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ecosystem has developed as a result of the Mekong’s seasonal flow fluctuations. A belt of freshwater mangroves known as the "flooded forest" surrounds the lake. The floodplains in turn are surrounded by low hills, covered with evergreen [[seasonal tropical forest]] with substantial [[Dipterocarpaceae|dipterocarp]] vegetation or [[deciduous]] [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forest]]. The eco-region consists of a mosaic of habitats for a great number of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://193.62.154.38/diptero/ | title= Dipterocarpaceae Data Base  |website= Forestry Research Programme  |date=  |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest gradually yields to bushes and finally grassland with increasing distance from the lake.

{{quotation|"During more than five months of the year, the great lake of Cambodia, Touli-Sap, covers an immense space of ground: after that period there is a diminution in depth owing to the great evaporation, but its width remains nearly unaltered. Although its waters increase in volume during the rainy season, these are not swelled by the streams from the mountains on its western boundary, but by the strength of the current from the Mekon which pours into it its overflow.[sic]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46559/46559-h/46559-h.htm  |title= The Project Gutenberg EBook of Travels in the Central Parts of Indo-China (Siam), Cambodia, and Laos (Vol. 1 of 2), by Henri Mouhot  | publisher= The Project Gutenberg |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The lake’s flooded forest and the surrounding floodplains are of utmost importance for Cambodia's agriculture as the region represents the cultural heart of Cambodia, the center of the national freshwater fishery industry - the nation's primary protein source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4586e/y4586e04.htm | title=Biodiversity and the Ecosystem Approach in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries | publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  |date=  |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Threats to the lake include widespread pollution, stress through growth of the local population which is dependent on the lake for subsistence and livelihood, over-harvesting of fish and other aquatic - often endangered - species, habitat destruction and potential changes in the hydrology, such as the construction and operation of dams, that disrupt the lake's natural flood cycle. However, concerns that the lake is rapidly filling with sediment seem - according to studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.tkk.fi/English/wr/research/global/material/ambio_37(3)/ambio_2008_kummu&amp;al.pdf|title=Sediment: Curse or Blessing for Tonle Sap Lake|publisher=Aalto University|date=|accessdate=June 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082512/http://water.tkk.fi/English/wr/research/global/material/ambio_37%283%29/ambio_2008_kummu%26al.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; - to be unfounded at the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00027-006-0855-0#page-1 |title=Species diversity and ecology of Tonle Sap Great Lake, Cambodia | publisher= Springer International Publishing AG  |date=January 17, 2006  |accessdate=May 20, 2015|doi=10.1007/s00027-006-0855-0#page-1 |doi-broken-date=2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wetlands===
[[Image:Coastal plains near Sihanoukville.jpg|thumb|right|'''coastal wetlands near Ream, [[Sihanoukville Province]]''']]
Wetlands cover more than 30% of Cambodia. In addition to the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap floodplain there are the Stung Sen River and the coastal Stung Koh Pao - and Stung Kep estuaries of [[Koh Kong Province]] and [[Kep Province]]. The freshwater wetlands of Cambodia represent one of the most diverse ecosystems worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mekonginfo.org/assets/midocs/0002811-inland-waters-review-of-wetland-and-aquatic-ecosystem-in-the-lower-mekong-river-basin-of-cambodia.pdf | title= Review of Wetland and Aquatic Ecosystem in the Lower Mekong River Basin of Cambodia   |website= Mekong Info - Mekong River Commission  |date=August 1, 2003 |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area’s extensive wetland habitats are the product of the annual Mekong maximum, the simultaneous wet season and the drainage paths of a number of minor rivers.

===Coastal habitats===
[[Image:Koh Kong mangrove forest.jpg|thumb|right|'''mangrove forests in [[Koh Kong Province]] Cambodia, September 2013''']]

The Cambodian coastline consists of {{convert|60000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of over 30 species of [[mangrove]]s - among the most biologically diverse wetlands on earth.&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?PublicationID=912 | title= Protecting mangrove forests in Cambodia  |website= International Development Research Centre (IDRC)  |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most pristine mangrove forests are found in Koh Kong Province. In addition to mangroves, [[Seagrass|sea-grass]] beds extend throughout the coastal areas, especially in Kampot Province, the Sihanoukville Bay Delta and the Kep municipal waters. The meadows are highly productive, but few animals feed directly on the grasses. Those that do tend to be vertebrates such as sea turtles, dabbling ducks and geese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=831 |title= Seagrass meadows - Biomes of the World |website= Department of Geospatial Science Radford University |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfishcenter.org/Pubs/CambodiaProceedings/pdf/CambodiaProceedings-02.pdf | title= Biodiversity of Cambodia's Wetlands |website=WorldFish Center |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/countries/members/cambodia/ | title= Cambodia - Mangroves for the Future  |website= Mangroves for the Future  |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"With their roots deep in mud, jagged and gnarled mangrove trees are able to grow in the brackish wetlands between land and sea where other plant life cannot survive. The trees offer refuge and nursery grounds for fish, crabs, shrimp, and mollusks. They are nesting - and migratory sites for hundreds of bird species. They also provide homes for monkeys, lizards, sea turtles, and many other animals as well as countless insects. "&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"/&gt;

"Until relatively recently, the mangroves of Koh Kong, Cambodia have remained relatively intact. This is partly because of the region’s location — it is an isolated, inaccessible place — and because decades of war and conflict perversely protected the forests from over-exploitation. Local people, however, tended to use the forest's sustainability, for food, fuel, medicine, building materials, and other basic needs. "&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"/&gt;

==Fauna==

{{main|Wildlife of Cambodia}}

Cambodia is home to a wide array of wildlife. There are 212 [[mammal]] species, 536 [[bird]] species, 176 [[reptile]] species (including 89 subspecies), 850 freshwater [[fish]] species ([[Tonlé Sap]] Lake area), and 435 marine fish species.
Many of the country's species are recognized by the [[IUCN]] or World Conservation Union as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered due to [[Deforestation in Cambodia|deforestation]] and habitat destruction, [[poaching]], illegal [[wildlife trade]], farming, fishing, and unauthorized forestry concessions. Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the [[Kouprey]], to extinction.

Cambodia borders Vietnam over a length of {{convert|1228|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Thailand over a length of {{convert|803|km|mi|abbr=on}} and Laos over a length of {{convert|541|km|mi|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|2572|km|mi|abbr=on}} in total and an additional {{convert|443|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline. The capital (''reach thani'') and provinces (''khaet'') of Cambodia are first-level administrative divisions. Cambodia is divided into 25 [[Provinces of Cambodia|provinces]] including the capital.

Municipalities and districts are the second-level administrative divisions of Cambodia. The provinces are subdivided into 159 districts and 26 municipalities. The districts and municipalities in turn are further divided into communes (''khum'') and quarters (''sangkat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geonames.org/KH/administrative-division-cambodia.html | title=Administrative divisions of Cambodia | publisher= GeoNames |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land use===

Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have experienced major changes in land use and land cover over the last two decades. The emergence from cold war rivalries and recent major economic reforms result in a shift from subsistence agrarian modes of production to market-based agricultural production and industrialized economies, which are heavily integrated into regional and global trade systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp53e.pdf |title=An Investigation of Land Cover and Land Use Change in Stung Chrey Bak Catchment, Cambodia |website=Cambodia Development Resource Institute |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526110703/http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp53e.pdf |archive-date=2015-05-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional divisions===

Cambodia's boundaries were for the most part based upon those recognized by [[France]] and by neighboring countries during the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonial period]]. The {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} boundary with Thailand runs along the [[drainage divide|watershed]] of the Dangrek Mountains, although only in its northern sector. The {{convert|541|km|mi|abbr=on}} border with Laos and the {{convert|1228|km|mi|abbr=on}} border with Vietnam result from French administrative decisions and do not follow major natural features. Border disputes have broken out in the past and do persist between Cambodia and Thailand as well as between Cambodia and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb5-2_amer.pdf?origin=publication_detail | title=Border Conflicts between Cambodia and Vietnam  | publisher= Durham University |date=  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2012/01/27/thai-cambodian-conflict-rooted-in-history/ | title=Thai–Cambodian conflict rooted in history  | publisher= East Asia Forum |date=January 27, 2012  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cambodianlifestory.com/thailand-cambodia-a-love-hate-relationships/ |title= Thailand-Cambodia " A love-hate relationships" |publisher= Cambodian Life Story |date= January 23, 2013 |accessdate= June 6, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150606230918/http://www.cambodianlifestory.com/thailand-cambodia-a-love-hate-relationships/# |archive-date= 2015-06-06 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/06/cambodias-impossible-dream-koh-tral/

==Natural resources==
{{see also|Natural resources of Cambodia}}

* [[Petroleum|Oil]] and [[natural gas]] - In addition to the four parts of mining project, the oilfield, Block A was discovered in 2005 and located {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} offshore in the gulf of Thailand Chevron would operate and hold a 30% interest Block A which cover {{convert|4079|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is expected to get 30-year-production permit in the second quarter of 2011.
In late 1969, the Cambodian government granted a permit to a French company to explore for [[petroleum]] in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. By 1972 none had been located, and exploration ceased when the [[Khmer Republic]] (see Appendix B) fell in 1975. Subsequent oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand and in the [[South China Sea]], however, could spark renewed interest in Cambodia's offshore area, especially because the country is on the same [[continental shelf]] as its Southeast Asian oil-producing neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/world/asia/05cambo.html?_r=0 |title= Big Oil in Tiny Cambodia: The Burden of New Wealth  |date=May 5, 2007 | publisher= The New York Times Company |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geology of the Seychelles''' is an example of a [[felsic]] [[granite]] microcontinent that broke off from the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] within the past 145 million years and become isolated in the Indian Ocean. The islands are primarily granite rock, with some sequences of sedimentary rocks formed during rift basin periods or times when the islands were submerged in shallow water. 
[[File:Seychelles large map.jpg|thumb|Map of the Seychelles]]
==Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
Seychelles began to form in the [[Neoproterozoic]] as a [[granite]] [[microcontinent]]. Granite is the bedrock of [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahe]], [[Praslin]], [[La Digue]] and [[Fregate]], with the rock dated as 755 million years old. Much of the rock is gray granite, while in southwest it is a pink [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] form of granite. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=216-217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic-Mesozoic===
The rifting apart of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] in the [[Late Paleozoic]] created failed rift [[grabens]]. The rifting process stalled and then continued in the [[Triassic]] until the [[Middle Jurassic]] as between two and six kilometers of clastic sediments accumulated on the western margin of the Seychelles microcontinent. Along the passive northwest margin with Gondwana, the coastline was submerged and one kilometer of fine sediments deposited there as the Somali oceanic basin formed 

East Gondwana fragmented 120 million years ago, splitting up Antarctica-Australia and Madagascar-Seychelles-India, which ultimately separated 85 million years ago as the [[Mascarene ocean basin]] formed. The [[Deccan Traps]] hotspot, which poured out immense basalt flows in India 65 million years ago and ultimately formed islands such as [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]], isolated Seychelles. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=216}}

===Mesozoic-Cenozoic ===
The microcontinent was confined between northern Madagascar and western India until the [[Late Cretaceous]] and evolved during the [[Cenozoic]] through a process of rift and drift tectonics. The microcontinent was uplifted, eroded and impacted by volcanic eruptions. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=218}}

In the early Cenozoic, around 63 million years ago, alkaline plutonic and volcanic rocks emplaced to become the Silhouette and North islands. 

==Hydrogeology==
Seychelles sources most of its water from rainfall  and desalination and receives 2300 millimeters of precipitation every year.  Surface water is stored by the [[La Gogue dam]] and the [[Rochon dam]]. However, the government has had to institute water rationing during the dry season from May to October. Beginning in 2009, the Seychelles government took interest in groundwater as a backup supply in fractured granite bedrock, looking to the example of granite aquifers in Sweden and commercial water companies such as Gondwana Water Drilling Company, which drilled eight test wells in the 1990s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Fardial, F. &amp; Bonnelame, B.|year=2015|title=Seychelles aims at making ground water the islands' secon source of water|publisher=Elsevier|url=http://www.seychellesnewsagency.com/articles/4035/Seychelles+aims+at+making+ground+water+the+islands+second+source+of+water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Seychelles had a small scale [[guano]] mining industry until the 1980s and has ongoing exploration for offshore oil and gas. Currently, there is no mining in Seychelles except quarrying for clay, coral and sand to use as building material. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=218}}

'''Ian Gordon Simmons''' (born 22 January 1937) is a British geographer. He retired as Professor of Geography from the [[University of Durham]] in 2001. He has made significant contributions to environmental history and prehistoric archaeology.

== Background ==
Simmons grew up in East London and then East Lincolnshire until the age of 12. He studied physical geography (BSc) and holds a PhD from the University of London (early 1960s) on the vegetation history of [[Dartmoor]].&lt;ref&gt;Preface, Simmons IG. 2003. The moorlands of England and Wales: an environmental history 8000 BC to AD 2000. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He began university lecturing in his early 20s and was Lecturer and then Reader in Geography at the [[University of Durham]] from 1962 to 1977, then Professor of Geography at the [[University of Bristol]] from 1977 to 1981 before returning to a Chair in Geography at Durham, where he worked until retiring in 2001.

In 1972–73, he taught biogeography for a year at York University, Canada and has held other appointments including Visiting Scholar, St. Johns College, University of Oxford in the 1990s. Previously, he had been an ACLS postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.

== Scholarship ==
His research includes the study of the later Mesolithic and early Neolithic in their environmental setting on English uplands, where he has demonstrated the role of these early human communities in initiating some of Britain's characteristic landscape elements. His work also encompasses the long-term effects of human manipulation of the natural environment and its consequences for resource use and environmental change. This line of work resulted in his last three books, which looked at environmental history on three nested scales: the moorlands of England and Wales, Great Britain, and the Globe.  Each dealt with the last 10,000 years and tried to encompassboth conventional science-based data with the insights of the social sciences and humanities.

Simmons has authored several books on environmental thought and culture over the ages as well as contemporary resource management and environmental problems.  Since retirement he has worked on the landscape history of the area of East Lincolnshire where he was a war-time evacuee and has published some papers on the medieval economy and drainage as well as a wide-ranging website at www.dur.ac.uk/east-lincs-history

'''Isidore of Charax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|z|ɪ|ˌ|d|ɔr}}; {{lang-grc|Ἰσίδωρος ὁ Χαρακηνός}}, ''Isídōros o Charakēnós''; {{lang-la|Isidorus Characenus}}) was a [[Roman Greece|Greco-Roman]] [[geographer]] of the 1st century {{sc|BC}} and 1st century {{sc|AD}}, a citizen of the [[Parthian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article = Greece ix. Greek and Persian Romances | last = Davis | first = Richard | authorlink = | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/greece-ix | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. XI, Fasc. 4 | pages = 339-342 | location = | publisher = | year = 2002 | isbn = |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; about whom nothing is known but his name and that he wrote at least one work. 

==Name==
Isidore's name has been interpreted by his editor and translator W.H. Schoff&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Schoff|first=Wilfred H.|year=1914|title=Parthian Stations by Isidore of Charax: The Greek text, with a translation and commentary|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Commercial Museum|url=http://www.parthia.com/doc/parthian_stations.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate that he was from the city of [[Charax Spasinu|Charax]] in [[Characene]] on the northern end of the present [[Persian Gulf]]. However, the Greek ''charax'' merely means "palisade" and there were several fortified towns that [[Charax Spasinu|bore the name]].

==Parthian Stations==
Isidore's best known work is "The [[Parthia]]n Stations" ({{lang-grc|Σταθμοί Παρθικοί}}, ''Stathmœ́ Parthicœ́''; {{lang-la|[[Mansio]]nes Parthicae}}), an [[Guide book|itinerary]] of the overland [[trade route]] from [[Antioch]] to [[India]] along the [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] stations maintained by the [[Arsacid Empire]]. He seems to have given his distances in [[schoeni]] ("ropes") of debated value. Isidore must have written it some time after {{nowrap|26 {{sc|BC}},}} for it refers to the revolt of [[Tiridates II of Parthia|Tiridates II]] against [[Phraates IV of Parthia|Phraates IV]], which occurred in that year. In its surviving form, "The Parthian Stations" appears to be a summary from some larger work. A reference in [[Athenaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus of Naucratis. ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', iii.46.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the title of the greater work was ''A Journey around Parthia'' ({{lang|grc|τὸ τῆς Παρθίας περιηγητικόν}}, ''tò tês Parthías periēgēticón''). Athenaeus's reference, not included in the present text of "The Parthian Stations", is a description of [[pearl fishing]].

The 1st-century [[historiographer]] [[Pliny the Elder]] refers to a "description of the world" commissioned by the [[list of Roman emperors|Emperor]] [[Augustus]] "to gather all necessary information in the east when his eldest son was about to set out for [[Roman_Armenia|Armenia]] to take the command against the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Arabians]]";&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' vi.31.&lt;/ref&gt; this occurred {{nowrap|{{circa|lk=no|1}} {{sc|bc}}.}} Pliny refers to the author as a "Dionysius", but it is assumed by Schoff that this is a mistake and Isidore was meant. It is Isidore who is cited for the relevant measurements of [[geographic distance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny. ''Natural History'', ii.112, iv.5, iv.30, iv.37, v.6, v.9, v.35-39, v.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd-century [[satirist]] [[Lucian of Samosata]] also cites an Isidore (although not necessarily this one) for claims of [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian of Samosata. ''Macrobii'' 15 and 18&lt;/ref&gt; Lucian does not note the name of the work he is quoting.

A collection of translations of the various [[Literary fragment|fragment]]s attributed to Isidore of Charax were published with [[Close reading|commentary]] in a forty-six-page [[book]]let by [[Wilfred Harvey Schoff]] in 1914. The translation of "The Parthian Stations" in that volume is that of [[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller|Karl Müller]].&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Karl. ''[[Geographi Græci Minores]]'', I, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–256. Paris, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Adair''' (1660–1718) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]] and [[cartographer]], noted for the excellence of his maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=82|title=Adair, John|first=Charles W. J.|last=Withers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first came to public notice in 1683, with a prospectus published in [[Edinburgh]] for a "Scottish Atlas" stating that the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] had engaged Adair, a "mathematician and skilfull mechanic", to survey the [[shire]]s of Scotland. He surveyed the coast of Scotland from 1686, and was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1688. The only part of the coastal survey appeared in 1703.

He was perhaps the first Scottish map-maker actively to use [[triangulation]] in his work. Twelve manuscript maps survive from his work at this time, covering the [[Lothians]], [[Stirling]], [[Fife]], [[Kinross]] and southern [[Perthshire]]. Unfortunately, financial and other difficulties hampered much of John Adair's map making, and not only were very few of his maps engraved during his lifetime, but most of his manuscript maps were destroyed by fire in 1811. However, a few of his county maps were engraved and printed by Richard Cooper in the 1730s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nls.uk/maps/counties/info.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714125927/http://www.nls.uk/maps/counties/info.html |archivedate=2009-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lazaret''' is a northern suburb of [[Niamey]], [[Niger]]. It is best known historically for its refugee camp with many [[Tuareg people]]. 
The camp became the largest in the Sahel during the extreme drought of 1973-1975.{{sfn|Janin|2010|p=30-31}}

==Location==

The [[Sahel]] is a belt of grassland and savanna, with areas of woods and shrubs, that runs along the southern rim of the [[Sahara]] desert.
It includes parts of [[Senegal]], Mauritania, Mali, [[Burkina Faso]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]].
The people of the region mostly live through herding, farming and fishing. Farming in most areas depends on the rain that falls during a three-month period of the summer,
although irrigation is practiced along the banks of rivers and lakes.
The region is subject to [[Sahel drought|periodic droughts]].{{sfn|Batterbury|1998}}

==Refugee camp==

A long period of below-average rainfall occurred in the [[Sahel]] between the late 1960s and the early 1980s.  The drought was extreme between 1968 and 1974, with around 100,000 people dying.  Farmers and pastoralists were forced to move, with many ending up in refugee camps.{{sfn|Batterbury|1998}}
The Lazaret  camp was mostly occupied by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads who had moved south from Mali, and held up to 20,000 people.{{sfn|Reyna|Downs|1999|p=232}}
Traditionally breeders, the Tuaregs had been forced to seek refuge in the camps when the drought killed their herds.{{sfn|Grégoire|2010|p=40}}
The nomads at Lazaret had lost at least one sixth of their strength before resigning themselves to move to the camp.{{sfn|Piguet|1998|p=174}}
Some of them, suffering from acute malnutrition, died after reaching the camp from diseases such as measles or pneumonia.{{sfn|Heinzerling|1974}}

Lazaret was one of the most extended of the Sahelian camps, situated {{convert|6|km|mi}} north of [[Niamey]], the capital of [[Niger]], on the road to [[Ouallam]].
The local authorities largely delegated management of the camps to charitable organizations, the Catholic Mission in the case of Lazaret. This organization relied on people among the refugees who were recognized as chiefs to handle distribution of supplies and to maintain a degree of order. 
{{sfn|Bonnecase|2011|p=239}}
Each quarter of the camp was named after the place of origin of the refugees and reproduced the social structure of that region.{{sfn|Janin|2010|p=33}}
Some of the housing was made of mats purchased by the Catholic mission while the rest were made from cardboard, rags or other material recovered by the refugees from the streets of the capital.{{sfn|Janin|2010|p=31-32}}

The Red Cross undertook many of the camp operations, supplying a clinic, tents and food.{{sfn|Vautier|2011|p=1974}}
Many of the refugees lacked such basic equipment as pots in which to store water.{{sfn|Janin|2010|p=32}}
The Red Cross feared that an epidemic of cholera would break out in the camps once the 1974 rainy season began.
The nomad refugees in the Lazaret camp were most at risk.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=377}}
They were in poor health and the crowded conditions were ideal for the spread is disease.{{sfn|Janin|2010|p=32}}

In October 1974 the camp was moved to a new location, Lazaret II, {{convert|40|km|mi}} from Niamey in order to limit contact between the refugees and the capital.{{sfn|Bonnecase|2011|p=239}}
The new camp remained full, with the families grouped by place of origin: [[Gao]], [[Bourem]], [[Timbuktu]] or [[Kidal]].
The French Red Cross renewed its aid for another year.{{sfn|Vautier|2011|p=1975}}
In April 1975 UNESCO reported that 13,000 nomads had been counted in the Lazaret camp.{{sfn|Bernault|1999|p=375}}
Later the whole population had to move&lt;!--did the army force them?  did they run out of food?--&gt; again to the [[Gao Region|Gao]] plateau in Mali, where nothing had been prepared for their reception.{{sfn|Cipriani|1997|p=193}}
Normal rainfall arrived in 1976.  Goats and sheep gave birth and livestock levels began to return to normal. 
The refugees from Lazaret began to return to their grazing lands.{{sfn|Vautier|2011|p=1966}}

==Later history==

Despite the drought, the period from 1970 to 1988 was one in which the economy of Niger boomed, driven by revenue from the uranium mines at [[Arlit]].  In this period, the population of Niamey grew from 108,000 to 398,365 inhabitants.{{sfn|Aloko-N'Guessan|Diallo|Motcho|2010|p=30}}
The city expanded from {{convert|1367|ha|acre}} in 1970 to {{convert|4400|ha|acre}} by 1977, in the process annexing the peripheral villages.
The flimsy huts of Lazaret were replaced by solid buildings of baked mud.{{sfn|Aloko-N'Guessan|Diallo|Motcho|2010|p=31}}
One of the first bilingual (French and Hausa) schools in Niger was founded in Lazaret in October 1983.{{sfn|Garba|Hanafiou|2010|p=8}}
As of 2003 Lazaret was the location for a major market, mostly for animals and animal products brought from the countryside for sale to the butchers and industrial users of Niamey.{{sfn|Damon|Igue|2003|p=309}}

* 582–602: [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns|War]] against the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] in the Balkans.

==7th century==
* 602–628: [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628|Final Byzantine-Persian war]].
* 626: [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|Avar–Sasanian siege]] of Constantinople.
* 633–642: Beginning of the [[Muslim conquests]]. Fall of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]] (634–638) and [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]] (639–642).
* 645–656: Renewed war with the Caliphate, loss of [[Cyprus]] and most of Armenia. The Muslim onslaught towards Constantinople was halted following the outbreak of the [[First Fitna]].
* 647–709: [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]].
* 668–678: Renewed attacks on the Byzantine Empire by [[Muawiyah]], leading to the [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|First Arab Siege]] of Constantinople. Following its failure, a truce was agreed, providing for payment of tribute, men and horses to the Empire.
* 680–681: [[Constantine IV]]'s campaign against the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] khan [[Asparukh]] ends in defeat, forcing the Empire to recognize the establishment of [[Bulgaria]] in [[Moesia]].
* 686–688: Successful Byzantine offensive established Byzantine control over Armenia and [[Caucasian Iberia]], followed by favourable peace agreement with the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], in return for the withdrawal of the [[Mardaites]] into the Empire.
* 688–689: Balkan campaign of [[Justinian II]] secured the coast between Thrace and Macedonia. Many Slavs were captured and resettled in imperial territory. Over 30,000 were incorporated into the Byzantine army.
* 688/689: Byzantine offensive into Syria and Lebanon leads to a new truce, and the withdrawal of more Mardaites.
* 692–718: Almost constant war with the Arabs in various fronts. The defeat at the [[Battle of Sebastopolis]] and internal instability led to the gradual loss of Armenia and Cilicia, and despite some successes by [[Heraclius (brother of Tiberius III)|Heraclius]] the Byzantines generally maintained a defensive stance against the annual Arab raids into Anatolia. [[Carthage]] fell in 697. Recovered soon after, it was [[Battle of Carthage (698)|again lost]] in 698, marking the end of Byzantine North Africa. From 712 on, the Arab raids penetrated ever deeper into Anatolia, with the final objective of mounting an assault on Constantinople. The repulsion of the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|Second Arab Siege]] of Constantinople (717–718) was a major Byzantine success, and halted Arab attacks against the Empire for a few years.

==8th century==
* 708: War with Bulgaria ends in defeat at [[Battle of Anchialus (708)|Anchialus]].
* 720–740 : Annual Arab raiding expeditions (''ṣawā'if'') against Byzantine Anatolia resume. Stiffening Byzantine resistance leads to the victory at [[Battle of Akroinon|Akroinon]] at 740.
* 741–752: Campaigns of [[Constantine V]] against the Arabs, who were embroiled in [[Battle of the Zab|civil war]], leading to the recovery of all of Armenia and [[Cyprus]].

* 772–775: War with the Bulgars under [[Telerig]], launched as a pre-emptive strike by [[Constantine V]].
* 775–783: War with the [[Abbasids]]. After the death of Constantine V in 775, Arab raids resumed. After a heavy defeat at Germanicopolis in 779/780, the Abbasids launched a series of major invasions under [[Harun al-Rashid]], which led to the conclusion of a truce in 783.
* 780–783: Raids by the Bulgars under [[Kardam of Bulgaria|Kardam]], leading to an agreement of non-aggression in exchange for annual payments.
* 783: Expedition of [[Staurakios (eunuch)|Staurakios]] against the ''[[Sclaviniae]]'' of Greece.
* 791–792 and 796: Campaigns against the Bulgarians under [[Constantine VI]] end in defeat at the [[Battle of Marcellae]].

==9th century==
* 803–809: War with the Abbasids, resulting from [[Nikephoros I]]'s cessation of annual tribute payments. The Arabs under [[Harun al-Rashid]] achieved significant early successes, but the outbreak of a revolt in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] facilitated a Byzantine counter-offensive in 807–809. A truce in 809 restored the territorial status quo.
* 808–816: Wars with the Bulgars, beginning with the Bulgarian [[Siege of Serdica (809)|capture of Sofia]]. A large-scale retaliatory campaign ended in the disastrous [[battle of Pliska]] (811), following which [[Krum of Bulgaria]] raided Eastern Thrace and secured a major victory at [[Battle of Versinikia|Versinikia]]. Following his death in 814, [[Leo V the Armenian]] defeated the Bulgars at [[Battle of Mesembria|Mesembria]] and secured a 30-year peace.
* 827–902: [[History of Islam in southern Italy#Conquest of Sicily (827–902)|Muslim conquest]] of [[Sicily]].
* 830–841: War with the Abbasids, with large-scale invasions launched by caliphs [[al-Ma'mun]] and [[al-Mu'tasim]]. Despite a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Dazimon]] and the [[sack of Amorium]] in 838, Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] was able to conclude a truce in 841 without territorial losses, although raids by the Muslim border emirates continued.
* 830s: [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus'|Rus' raid]] in [[Paphlagonia]].
* ca. 844–878: Wars with the [[Paulicians]] of [[Tephrike]] end with the destruction of the Paulician state and its incorporation into the Empire.
* 851–863: War with the Abbasids and their clients. Successful Byzantine raids in Syria, Mesopotamia and Egypt are checked by a series of Muslim invasions of [[Anatolia]] in 860. Another invasion in 863 sees the complete annihilation of the Muslim army at the [[Battle of Lalakaon]].
* 860: [[Rus'–Byzantine War (860)|Rus' raid]] against Constantinople.
* 852, 855–856: Short wars with Bulgaria, ending in the recovery of several cities in northern Thrace.
* 871–885: Campaigns led by [[Basil I]] in person against northern Mesopotamia (871–873) are followed by a series of expeditions against the Muslims in [[Sicily]] and [[Southern Italy]]. The final loss of Sicily could not be averted, but the Arabs are driven from Southern Italy and [[Dalmatia]], laying the foundations of the [[Catepanate of Italy]].
* 894–896/897: [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896|War with Bulgaria]] under Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon]] erupts over trade rights. It ends with a Bulgarian victory after the [[Battle of Bulgarophygon]]. The Byzantines agree to pay tribute and restore the market for Bulgarian goods to Constantinople.

* 961–962: Huge amphibious expedition against the [[Emirate of Crete]] under [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]], resulting in the recapture of the island.
* 964-965: [[Byzantine conquest of Cilicia]]

By the early 19th century, several companies established strings of fur trading posts and forts across North America.

In example connecting the fur trade to the Metis Nation in Canada, in Barton Township, Ontario, the Terryberry Trading Post, later Terryberry Inn, was built on Mohawk road, on the Niagara Escarpment.  Run by William Terryberry, (see Durrenberger d'Iribury France) and family formerly of Butler's Rangers, the Terryberry's had formed war-time bonds with Mohawk and other indigenous peoples, enabling them to both interpret and hunt and trade on the Red River route.

This is a '''list of glaciers in the Antarctic''' with a name starting with the letters '''A&amp;ndash;H'''. This list does not include [[ice sheet]]s, [[ice cap]]s or [[ice field]]s, such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], but includes [[Glacier|glacial]] features that are defined by their flow, rather than general bodies of ice. This list includes [[Glacier morphology#Outlet glaciers|outlet glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Valley glaciers|valley glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Cirque glaciers|cirque glaciers]], [[Glacier#Types of glaciers|tidewater glaciers]] and [[ice stream]]s. Ice streams are a type of glacier&lt;ref name="NSIDC" /&gt; and many of them have "glacier" in their name, e.g. [[Pine Island Glacier]]. [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] are listed separately in the [[List of Antarctic ice shelves]]. For the purposes of this list, the [[Antarctic]] is defined as any [[latitude]] further south than 60° (the continental limit according to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]).&lt;ref name="nbTreatyText" /&gt;

[[File:Tasmania in Australia map.png|thumb|right|Tasmania]]
&lt;/div&gt;
The [[Highway]]s in [[Tasmania]] generally expand from [[Hobart]] and other major cities with secondary roads interconnecting the highways to each other. Functions of these highways include freight, personal travel and tourism.
 
The [[AusLink]] Network currently consists of the [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland]], [[Bass Highway (Tasmania)|Bass]], [[Brooker Highway|Brooker]], [[East Tamar Highway]] and the southern section of the [[Tasman Highway]] (Hobart-Hobart Airport).

Tasmanian highway naming is straightforward. Most are generally named after the geographical regions and features, cities, towns and settlements along the way.

[[File:Brooker Hwy10.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{AUshield|N|1}} Brooker Highway]]
Excluding the old [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway]] (Brooker, Midland, Bass), Tasmanian routes have been marked with the alphanumeric marking scheme since 1979 . Prior to this Tasmanian roads were markerd with a National and State Route Numbering System.

Highways are a part of Tasmania's road network, which covers a distance of approximately {{convert|24000|km}}. As well as major highways between cities and ports, urban connectors between suburbs and commercial areas, residential streets, and forestry roads are also included. The most important state and regional connections, totalling {{convert|3650|km}}, are state-owned roads, which are further classified into a road hierarchy.&lt;ref name=hierarchy&gt;{{cite web|title=Tasmanian State Road Hierarchy|url=http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/20734/DIER_Road_Hierarchy_2007.pdf|publisher=Government of Tasmania|accessdate=27 December 2013|author=Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517192126/http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/20734/DIER_Road_Hierarchy_2007.pdf|archivedate=17 May 2013|deadurl=yes|format=PDF|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–4}}
The herirachy consists of:
* Trunk roads – major highways which are the "primary freight and passenger roads"&lt;ref name=hierarchy /&gt;{{rp|4–5}}
* Regional freight roads – regional roads which connect heavy freight to the trunk roads&lt;ref name=hierarchy /&gt;{{rp|4,6}}
* Regional access roads – providing access to Tasmania’s Regions, with less traffic than trunk and regional freight roads&lt;ref name=hierarchy /&gt;{{rp|4,7}}
* Feeder roads – connect population centres and tourist traffic to and from the rest of the state road network&lt;ref name=hierarchy /&gt;{{rp|4,8}}
* Other roads – lower traffic roads, primarily providing access to private properties&lt;ref name=hierarchy /&gt;{{rp|4,9}}

'''{{not a typo|MIKE FLOOD}}''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates [[inundation]] for rivers, [[flood plain]]s and urban [[Sewage|drainage systems]]. It dynamically couples 1D ([[MIKE 11]] and [[Mouse (software)|Mouse]]) and 2D ([[MIKE 21]]) modeling techniques into one single tool. MIKE FLOOD is developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. 

MIKE FLOOD is accepted by US [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) for use in the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP).

MIKE FLOOD can be expanded with a range of modules and methods including a [[flexible mesh]] overland flow solver, [[MIKE URBAN]], Rainfall-runoff modeling and dynamic operation of structures.

==Applications==
MIKE FLOOD can be used for river-flood plain interaction, integrated urban drainage and river modeling, urban flood analysis and detailed dam break studies.

'''Neuendorf-Sachsenbande''' is a municipality in [[Wilstermarsch]], in the district of [[Steinburg]], in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]. The town is notable for containing the lowest accessible point in Germany, which is 3.54&amp;nbsp;m (11.61&amp;nbsp;ft) below [[sea level]].

==History==
The history of the town only dates back to April 15, 2003, when the town was formed from the merger of the municipalities of ''Neuendorf bei Wilster'' and ''Sachsenbande'' to the municipality of ''Bredensee.'' This new agglomeration was renamed ''Neuendorf-Sachsenbande.''

==Economy==
The land making up the municipality is mainly rural and involved in [[agriculture]], but local registries indicate 30 small businesses in the municipality.

==Politics==
The local council counts one member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], five members of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], five [[Independent (politics)|Independents]]. The design of the coat of arms symbolizes several of the local geographic in political realities, such as the recent consolidation of the cities, the nationally prominent topographical [[depression (geology)|depression]], and the small river, the ''Wilster Au,'' which flows through the municipality.

'''Niagara Falls''' is the collective name for three [[waterfall]]s that straddle [[Canada–United States border|the international border]] between the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]] and the [[United States|American state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. They form the southern end of the [[Niagara Gorge]].

From largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the [[Horseshoe Falls]], the [[American Falls]] and the [[Bridal Veil Falls (Niagara Falls)|Bridal Veil Falls]]. The Horseshoe Falls lies on the border of the United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;USGS 1995 Niagara Falls Map&lt;/ref&gt; with the American Falls entirely on the United States' side, separated by [[Goat Island (New York)|Goat Island]]. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also on the United States' side, separated from the American Falls by [[Luna Island]].

Located on the [[Niagara River]], which drains [[Lake Erie]] into [[Lake Ontario]], the combined falls form the [[List of waterfalls by flow rate|highest flow rate]] of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than {{convert|50|m|ft}}. During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  (six million cubic feet) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niagaraparks.com/visit-niagara-parks/plan-your-visit/niagara-falls-geology-facts-figures/|title=Niagara Falls Geology Facts and Figures|work=Niagara Parks|access-date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate.&lt;ref name=Niagafallstravelguide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gocanada.about.com/od/niagarafalls/tp/niagara_falls_travel_guide.htm| title=City Profile for Niagara Falls, Ontario| accessdate=October 6, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The falls are {{convert|27|km|mi}} north-northwest of [[Buffalo, New York]], and {{convert|121|km|mi}} south-southeast of [[Toronto]], between the [[twin cities]] of [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], and [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] (the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]), and water from the newly formed [[Great Lakes]] carved a path through the [[Niagara Escarpment]] en route to the Atlantic Ocean.

Niagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of [[List of Niagara Falls hydroelectric generating plants|hydroelectric power]]. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Canadian Horseshoe Falls with Buffalo in background.jpg|thumb|The Canadian [[Horseshoe Falls]]]]
[[File:American Falls Niagara Falls USA from Skylon Tower on 2002-05-28.png|thumb|[[American Falls]] (large waterfall on the left) and [[Bridal Veil Falls (Niagara Falls)|Bridal Veil Falls]] (smaller waterfall on the right)]]

The Horseshoe Falls drop about {{convert|57|m|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagaraparks.com/about-niagara-falls/geology-facts-figures.html ''Niagara Falls Geology Facts &amp; Figures.''] Niagara Parks, Government of Ontario, Canada. Retrieved July 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; while the height of the American Falls varies between {{convert|21|and|30|m}} because of the presence of giant boulders at its base. The larger Horseshoe Falls are about {{convert|790|m|ft}} wide, while the American Falls are {{convert|320|m|ft}} wide. The distance between the American extremity of the Niagara Falls and the Canadian extremity is {{convert|1039|m|ft|order=flip}}.

The peak flow over Horseshoe Falls was recorded at {{convert|6400|m3|ft3}} per second.&lt;ref name="History of Power"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html | title = Niagara Falls History of Power – Historical and engineering data on the U.S. and Canadian power stations | accessdate = September 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual flow rate is {{convert|2400|m3|ft3}} per second.&lt;ref name="Niagara Falls| World Waterfall Database"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldwaterfalldatabase.com/waterfall/Niagara-Falls-106/ | title = Niagara Falls – World Waterfall Database | accessdate = November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the flow is a direct function of the [[Lake Erie]] water elevation, it typically peaks in late spring or early summer. During the summer months, at least {{convert|2800|m3|ft3}} per second of water traverses the falls, some 90% of which goes over the Horseshoe Falls, while the balance is diverted to hydroelectric facilities. This is accomplished by employing a [[weir]] – the [[International Control Dam]] – with movable gates upstream from the Horseshoe Falls. The falls' flow is further halved at night, and, during the low tourist season in the winter, remains a minimum of {{convert|1400|m3|ft3}} per second. Water diversion is regulated by the 1950 Niagara Treaty and is administered by the International Niagara Board of Control (IJC).&lt;ref name="IJC – International Niagara Board of Control"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ijc.org/conseil_board/niagara/en/niagara_home_accueil.htm |title=(INBC) – International Niagara Board of Control |accessdate=March 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090726231502/http://www.ijc.org/conseil_board/niagara/en/niagara_home_accueil.htm | archivedate=July 26, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdant green colour of the water flowing over the Niagara Falls is a byproduct of the estimated 60 tonnes/minute of dissolved salts and "rock flour" (very finely ground rock) generated by the erosive force of the Niagara River itself.&lt;ref name="Niagara Parks"/&gt;

==Geology==
The features that became Niagara Falls were created by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] about 10,000 years ago. The same forces also created the North American [[Great Lakes]] and the Niagara River. All were dug by a continental [[ice age|ice sheet]] that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=InfoNiagara |url=http://www.infoniagara.com/other/history/geo.html |title=Niagara Falls Geological History |access-date=March 3, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006094115/http://www.infoniagara.com/other/history/geo.html |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists argue there is an old valley, [[Saint David's Buried Gorge|St David's Buried Gorge]], buried by [[Drift (geology)|glacial drift]], at the approximate location of the present [[Welland Canal]].
[[File:niagara falls.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Niagara Falls, showing parts of Canada (left) and the United States (upper right)]]

When the ice melted, the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which followed the rearranged topography across the [[Niagara Escarpment]]. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or [[cuesta]]. Because of the interactions of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant [[limestone]] and Lockport [[dolomite|dolostone]]. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle [[Silurian]]), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.

Immediately below the hard-rock formation, comprising about two-thirds of the cliff, lay the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian). This formation was composed mainly of [[shale]], though it has some thin limestone layers. It also contains ancient [[fossil]]s. In time, the river eroded the soft layer that supported the hard layers, undercutting the hard caprock, which gave way in great chunks. This process repeated countless times, eventually carving out the falls.

Submerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the [[Queenston Formation]] (Upper [[Ordovician]]), which is composed of shales and fine [[sandstone]]s. All three formations were laid down in an ancient sea, their differences of character deriving from changing conditions within that sea.

About 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was between present-day [[Queenston, Ontario]], and [[Lewiston, New York]], but [[erosion]] of their crest has caused the waterfalls to retreat approximately {{convert|6.8|mi|km}} southward.&lt;ref&gt;Parker E. Calkin and Carlton E. Brett, "Ancestral Niagara River drainage: Stratigraphic and paleontologic setting", ''GSA Bulletin'', August 1978, v. 89; no. 8, pp. 1140–1154&lt;/ref&gt; The Horseshoe Falls, which are approximately {{convert|2600|ft}} wide, have also changed their shape through the process of erosion; evolving from a small arch, to a horseshoe bend, to the present day gigantic V.&lt;ref name="TourNiagara"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just upstream from the falls' current location, [[Goat Island (New York)|Goat Island]] splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of the mostly Canadian Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east. Engineering has slowed erosion and recession.&lt;ref&gt;Irving H. Tesmer, Jerold C. Bastedo, ''Colossal Cataract: The Geologic History of Niagara Falls'' (SUNY Press, 1981, {{ISBN|0-87395-522-6}}), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current rate of erosion is approximately 30 centimeters (1 ft) per year, down from a historical average of 0.91 m (3 ft) per year. According to the [[Timeline of the far future#Future of the Earth, the Solar System and the Universe|timeline of the far future]], in roughly 50,000 years Niagara Falls will have eroded away the remaining {{convert|32|km|mi}} to [[Lake Erie]] and cease to exist.&lt;ref name="Niagara Parks"&gt;

==History==
[[File:PSM V49 D014 View of niagara falls by father hennepin.jpg|thumb|upright=1| Father [[Louis Hennepin]] is depicted in front of the falls in this 1698 print.&lt;ref&gt;''Saut ou chute d'eau de Niagara, qui se voit entre le Lac Ontario, &amp; le Lac Erié''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara - Thomas Davies.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]], ''[[An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara]]'', 1762]]
[[File:Daguerrotype of Niagara Falls by Hugh Lee Pattinson 1840.jpg|thumb|[[Hugh Lee Pattinson]]'s [[daguerreotype]] of the Niagara Falls (left-right inverted), the first known photograph of them, circa 1840]]
Theories differ as to the origin of the name of the falls. According to Iroquoian scholar [[Bruce Trigger]], ''Niagara'' is derived from the name given to a branch of the local native [[Neutral Nation|Neutral Confederacy]], who are described as being called the ''Niagagarega'' people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Trigger, ''The Children of Aataentsic'' ([[McGill-Queen's University Press]], Kingston and Montreal, 1987, {{ISBN|0-7735-0626-8}}), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George R. Stewart]], it comes from the name of an [[Iroquois]] town called ''Onguiaahra'', meaning "point of land cut in two".&lt;ref&gt;[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967) ''Names on the Land.'' Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]]; p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Schoolcraft]] reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Niagara Falls. This name is [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]. It means, according to Mrs. Kerr, the neck; the term being first applied to the portage or neck of land, between lakes Erie and Ontario. By referring to Mr. Elliott's vocabulary, (chapter xi) it will be seen that the human neck, that is, according to the concrete vocabulary, ''his'' neck, is ''onyara''. [[Red Jacket]] pronounced the word Niagara to me, in the spring of 1820, as if written O-ne-au-ga-rah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Schoolcraft|Schoolcraft, Henry R.]] (1847) ''Notes on the Iroquois.'' pp. 453–454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of figures have been suggested as first circulating a European eyewitness description of Niagara Falls. The Frenchman [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area as early as 1604 during his exploration of Canada, and members of his party reported to him the spectacular waterfalls, which he described in his journals. The Finnish-Swedish naturalist [[Pehr Kalm]] explored the area in the early 18th century and is credited with the first scientific description of the falls. The consensus honoree for the first description is the Belgian missionary [[Louis Hennepin]], who observed and described the falls in 1677, earlier than Kalm, after traveling with the explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]], thus bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans. Further complicating matters, there is credible evidence the French Jesuit missionary [[Paul Ragueneau]] visited the falls some 35 years before Hennepin's visit, while working among the [[Wyandot people|Huron First Nation]] in Canada. [[Jean de Brébeuf]] also may have visited the falls, while spending time with the [[Neutral Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_33.html |title=The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents Volume 33 |publisher=Puffin.creighton.edu |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, Captain [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]], a British Army officer and artist, surveyed the area and painted the watercolor, ''[[An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara]]'', the first eyewitness painting of the falls.&lt;ref name=christie1&gt;{{cite web| title=Captain Thomas Davies (1737–1812): An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara| url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/captain-thomas-davies-an-east-view-5873997-details.aspx| publisher=[[Christie's]]| date=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dickenson| first=Victoria| title=Drawn from Life: Science and Art in the Portrayal of the New World| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHET0UM9Q40C&amp;pg=PA195| page=195| year=1998| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]| isbn=978-08020-8073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, tourism became popular, and by mid-century, it was the area's main industry. [[Theodosia Burr Alston]] (daughter of Vice President [[Aaron Burr]]) and her husband [[Joseph Alston]] were the first recorded couple to honeymoon there in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman Zavitz (City of Niagara Falls Official Historian), "Niagara Falls Moment", CJRN 710 Radio, June 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jérôme]] visited with his bride in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Canadadacool"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/ONTARIO/NiagaraFallsNapoleon.html | title = Niagara Falls is such a cool honeymoon destination even Napoleon's Brother chose it | accessdate = September 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837 during the [[Caroline affair]], a rebel supply ship, the ''Caroline'', was burned and sent over the falls. In March 1848, ice blockage caused the falls to stop; no water (or at best a trickle) fell for as much as 40 hours. Waterwheels stopped, mills and factories shut down for having no power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/03/0330niagara-falls-stops |title= March 30, 1848: Niagara Falls Runs Dry |id= "This Day in Tech" |work= Wired.com |date= March 30, 2010 |accessdate= October 16, 2010 |first= Randy |last= Alfred }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, demand for passage over the Niagara River led to the building of a footbridge and then [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge#Charles Ellet, Jr.'s temporary bridge|Charles Ellet's Niagara Suspension Bridge]]. This was supplanted by German-born [[John Augustus Roebling]]'s [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]] in 1855. After the [[American Civil War]], the [[New York Central Railroad]] publicized Niagara Falls as a focus of pleasure and honeymoon visits. With increased railroad traffic, in 1886, Leffert Buck replaced Roebling's wood and stone bridge with the predominantly steel bridge that still carries trains over the Niagara River today. The first steel archway bridge near the falls was completed in 1897. Known today as the [[Whirlpool Rapids Bridge]], it carries passenger vehicles and trains between Canada (through Canadian Customs Border Control) and the U.S.A. just downstream of the falls.

In about 1840, the English industrial chemist [[Hugh Lee Pattinson]] travelled to Canada, stopping at the Niagara Falls long enough to make the earliest known photograph of the falls, a [[daguerreotype]] in the collection of [[Newcastle University]]. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph.&lt;ref name=NiagaraParks/&gt; Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself.&lt;ref name=NiagaraParks&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.niagaraparks.com/media/press-releases/daguerreotype-background.html | title=Backgrounder: Pattinson Daguerreotype | publisher=Niagara Parks, an agency of the Government of Ontario since 1885 |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228214832/http://www.niagaraparks.com/media/press-releases/daguerreotype-background.html |archivedate=December 28, 2010  }} The assumption explained on the web page is that as Pattinson had ample time to walk into the picture, he opened the shutter and then positioned himself at the chosen spot, keeping still there for some minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; The image is left-right inverted, and taken from the Canadian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2009.07-recovered-niagara-falls-1840-photograph/ |title=Photo: Niagara Falls, 1840 |publisher=[[The Walrus (magazine)|The Walrus]] |work=How academics found the first photograph to be taken in Canada |date=July–August 2009 |accessdate=November 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129064747/http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2009.07-recovered-niagara-falls-1840-photograph/ |archivedate=January 29, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate [[Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours]]' ''Excursions Daguerriennes'' (Paris, 1841–1864).&lt;ref name=Newcastle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/collections/daguerreotypes/pattinson.php |title=Hugh Lee Pattinson |publisher=Newcastle University |year=2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[World War I|First World War]], tourism boomed again, as automobiles made getting to the falls much easier. The story of Niagara Falls in the 20th century is largely that of efforts to harness the energy of the falls for [[hydroelectric power]], and to control the development on both sides that threaten the area's natural beauty.

In 1941, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission completed the third current crossing in the immediate area of Niagara Falls with the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]], carrying both pedestrian and vehicular traffic between the two countries and Canadian and U.S. customs for each country.

A team from the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] created a dam on the American Falls in June 1969 to clear rock from the base of the falls. Rock slides caused a significant buildup of rock at the bottom of the American side of the falls, and the engineers were to clean up the rock and repair some faults to prevent eventual erosion of the American side of the waterfall. A temporary dam was built to divert the flow of water to the Canadian side; the dam measured {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} across and was made of nearly 30,000 tons of rock. The engineers cleared the rock debris and tested for safety, finishing the project in November of that year. Water flow was restored on November 25, 1969.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{Cite news |last= Smith |first= Graham |title=The day Niagara Falls ran dry: Newly discovered photos show the moment the iconic waterfall came to a standstill |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1338793/Niagara-Falls-ran-dry-Photos-moment-iconic-waterfall-came-standstilll.html |accessdate= December 15, 2010 |work=Daily Mail |date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the late 20th century, the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in the United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which were once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges. In 1955, the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating [[Terrapin Point]].&lt;ref name=berton&gt;{{cite book |last= Berton |first= Pierre |title= Niagara: A History of the Falls |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Rr06A2H6UC&amp;pg=PA20 |accessdate= December 1, 2010 |year= 2009 |publisher= SUNY Press |isbn= 978-1-4384-2928-1 |pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built [[diversion dam]]s and [[retaining wall]]s to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether, {{convert|400|ft|m|abbr=on}} of the Horseshoe Falls were eliminated, including {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} on the Canadian side. According to author Ginger Strand, the Horseshoe Falls is now entirely in Canada.&lt;ref name=strand&gt;{{cite book |last= Strand |first=Ginger |title=Inventing Niagara: Beauty, Power, and Lies |year= 2009 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=978-1-4165-4657-3 |page= 195 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=obXliU3-7WcC&amp;pg=PA195| accessdate= December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources say "most of" Horseshoe Falls is in Canada.&lt;ref name="vanderwilt"&gt;Vanderwilt, Dirk (2007).

===History of freezing over===
The only recorded freeze up of the river and falls was due to an ice jam on March 29, 1848. Although the falls commonly ices up most winters, the river and the falls do not freeze completely. The years 1885, 1902, 1906, 1911, 1932, 1936, 2014 and 2017 are noted for the falls icing up.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.niagarafallsmarriott.com/niagara-seasons/does-niagara-falls-freeze-winter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/niagarafalls.asp&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, much of the water coming over the American Falls froze, though a trickle still ran and the falls ran at the other two sites.

==Impact on industry and commerce==

===Hydroelectric power===
[[File:Harnessing the Niagara River's power in Niagara Falls, New York, c. 1901.jpg|thumb|right|New York side of [[Niagara Gorge]], c. 1901]]
[[File:Robert moses niagara power plant 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] in [[Lewiston, New York]]]]
The enormous energy of Niagara Falls has long been recognized as a potential source of power. The first known effort to harness the waters was in 1759, when Daniel Joncaire built a small canal above the falls to power his sawmill. Augustus and Peter Porter purchased this area and all of American Falls in 1805 from the New York state government, and enlarged the original canal to provide [[hydropower|hydraulic power]] for their gristmill and tannery. In 1853, the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Mining Company was chartered, which eventually constructed the canals that would be used to generate electricity. In 1881, under the leadership of [[Jacob F. Schoellkopf]], the [[Niagara River]]'s first [[hydroelectric]] generating station was built. The water fell {{convert|86|ft}} and generated [[direct current]] electricity, which ran the machinery of local [[watermill|mills]] and lit up some of the village streets.

The Niagara Falls Power Company, a descendant of Schoellkopf's firm, formed the Cataract Company headed by Edward Dean Adams,&lt;ref&gt;Honor for E.D. Adams: Engineers to Award the John Fritz Medal for Niagara Development. (March 17, 1926). ''The New York Times'' (1857–Current file), 6. ProQuest Historical Newspapers ''The New York Times'' (1851–2004) database. (Document ID: 119063396).&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent of expanding Niagara Falls' power capacity. In 1890, a five-member International Niagara Commission headed by [[Sir William Thomson]] among other distinguished scientists deliberated on the expansion of Niagara hydroelectric capacity based on seventeen proposals, but could not select any as the best combined project for hydraulic development and distribution. In 1893, [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] (which had built the smaller-scale [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]] near [[Ophir, Colorado]], two years earlier) was hired to design a system to generate [[alternating current]] on Niagara Falls, and three years after that this large-scale AC power system was created (activated on August 26, 1895).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PXpNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA719 The electrical features of Niagara] The Electrical world, Volume 29. Electrical World, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adams Power Plant Transformer House]] remains as a landmark of the original system.

By 1896, financing from moguls including [[J.P. Morgan]], [[John Jacob Astor IV]], and the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]] had fueled the construction of giant underground conduits leading to turbines generating upwards of {{convert|100000|hp|MW|lk=on}}, sent as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], {{convert|20|mi}} away. Some of the original designs for the power transmission plants were created by the Swiss firm Faesch &amp; Piccard, which also constructed the original 5,000&amp;nbsp;hp waterwheels.

Private companies on the Canadian side also began to harness the energy of the falls. The [[Government of Ontario]] eventually brought power transmission operations under public control in 1906, distributing Niagara's energy to various parts of the Canadian province.

Other hydropower plants were also being built along the Niagara River. But in 1956, disaster struck when the region's largest hydropower station was partially destroyed in a [[landslide]]. This drastically reduced power production and put tens of thousands of [[Blue-collar worker|manufacturing jobs]] at stake. In 1957, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Niagara Redevelopment Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|85|159|71|401|1957|08|21|H.R.|8643}}&lt;/ref&gt; which granted the [[New York Power Authority]] the right to fully develop the United States' share of the Niagara River's hydroelectric potential.&lt;ref name=nypa /&gt;

In 1961, when the Niagara Falls hydroelectric project went online, it was the largest hydropower facility in the Western world. Today, Niagara is still the largest electricity producer in New York state, with a generating capacity of 2.4 gigawatts (million kilowatts). Up to {{convert|1420|m3|usgal}} of water a second is diverted from the Niagara River through conduits under the city of Niagara Falls to the [[Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant|Lewiston]] and [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant|Robert Moses]] power plants. Currently between 50% and 75% of the Niagara River's flow is diverted via four huge tunnels that arise far upstream from the waterfalls. The water then passes through [[hydroelectric]] turbines that supply power to nearby areas of Canada and the United States before returning to the river well past the falls.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=251| title=Niagara Falls Original Turbines| publisher=[[National Museum of American History]], Smithsonian Institution| accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This water spins [[turbine]]s that power generators, converting [[mechanical energy]] into [[electricity|electrical energy]]. When electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units can operate as pumps to transport water from the lower bay back up to the plant's [[reservoir]], allowing this water to be used again during the daytime when electricity use peaks. During peak electrical demand, the same Lewiston pumps are reversed and actually become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant.&lt;ref name=nypa /&gt;

To preserve Niagara Falls' natural beauty, a 1950 treaty signed by the U.S. and Canada limited water usage by the power plants. The treaty allows higher summertime diversion at night when tourists are fewer and during the winter months when there are even fewer tourists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Niagara Power Goes Under Ground"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1952, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty, designed to ensure an "unbroken curtain of water" flowing over the falls, states that during daylight time during the tourist season (April 1 to October 31) there must be 100,000 cubic feet per second (2,800 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) of water flowing over the falls, and during the night and off-tourist season there must be 50,000 cubic feet per second (1,400 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) of water flowing over the falls. This treaty is monitored by the International Niagara Board of Control, using a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] gauging station above the falls. During winter, the Power Authority of New York works with Ontario Power Generation to prevent ice on the Niagara River from interfering with power production or causing flooding of shoreline property. One of their joint efforts is an {{convert|8800|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ice boom, which prevents the buildup of ice, yet allows water to continue flowing downstream.&lt;ref name=nypa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypa.gov/facilities/niagara.htm |title=NYPA Niagara |publisher=Nypa.gov |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nypa.gov%2Ffacilities%2Fniagara.htm&amp;date=2009-02-17 |archivedate=February 17, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to minimum water volume, the crest of the Horseshoe falls was reduced to maintain an uninterrupted "curtain of water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macfarlane|first1=Daniel|title=How engineers created the icy wonderland at Niagara Falls|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/01/07/how-engineers-created-the-icy-wonderland-at-niagara-falls|accessdate=January 9, 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful hydroelectric stations on the Niagara River are the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations|Sir Adam Beck 1 and 2]] on the Canadian side and the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] and the Lewiston Pump Generating Plant on the American side. Together, Niagara's generating stations can produce about 4.4 [[gigawatt]]s of power.

In August 2005 [[Ontario Power Generation]], which is responsible for the Sir Adam Beck stations, started a major civil engineering project, called the [[Niagara Tunnel Project]], to increase power production by building a new {{convert|12.7|m|adj=on}} diameter, {{convert|10.2|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} water diversion tunnel. It was officially placed into service in March 2013, helping to increase the generating complex's [[nameplate capacity]] by 150 [[megawatts]]. It did so by tapping water from farther up the Niagara River than was possible with the preexisting arrangement. The tunnel provided new hydroelectricity for approximately 160,000 homes.&lt;ref name="NiagaraFrontier-TechFacts"&gt;[http://www.niagarafrontier.com/tunneltechnical.html Niagara Tunnel Project Technical Facts], NiagaraFrontier.com website, updated November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OPG-Website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opg.com/power/hydro/new_projects/ntp/index.asp |date=March 21, 2013 |title=Niagara Tunnel Now In-Service |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119130706/http://www.opg.com/power/hydro/new_projects/ntp/index.asp |archive-date=November 19, 2013 |website=Ontario Power Generation |access-date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
[[File:Rainbow Bridge Rainbow.jpg|thumb|Rainbow Bridge]]
Ships can bypass Niagara Falls by means of the [[Welland Canal]], which was improved and incorporated into the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in the mid-1950s. While the seaway diverted water traffic from nearby [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and led to the demise of its steel and grain mills, other industries in the Niagara River valley flourished with the help of the electric power produced by the river. However, since the 1970s the region has declined economically.

The cities of [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada, and [[Niagara Falls, New York]], United States, are connected by two international bridges. The [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]], just downriver from the falls, affords the closest view of the falls and is open to non-commercial vehicle traffic and pedestrians. The [[Whirlpool Rapids Bridge]] lies {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} north of the Rainbow Bridge and is the oldest bridge over the Niagara River. Nearby [[Niagara Falls International Airport]] and [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] were named after the waterfall, as were [[Niagara University]], countless local businesses, and even an [[asteroid]].&lt;ref name="Asteroid"&gt;Asteroid ''12382 Niagara Falls'' was named after the falls.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation efforts==
Niagara Falls have long been a source of inspiration for explorers, travelers, artists, authors, filmmakers, residents and visitors, few of whom realize the falls were nearly devoted solely to industrial and commercial use. In the 1870s, sightseers had limited access to Niagara Falls and often had to pay for a glimpse, and industrialization threatened to carve up Goat Island to further expand commercial development. Other industrial encroachments and lack of public access led to a conservation movement in the U.S. known as Free Niagara, led by such notables as [[Hudson River School]] artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]], landscape designer [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], and architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. Church approached [[Lord Dufferin]], governor-general of Canada, with a proposal for international discussions on the establishment of a public park.

Goat Island was one of the inspirations for the American side of the effort. [[William Dorsheimer]], moved by the scene from the island, brought Olmsted to Buffalo in 1868 to design a city park system and helped promote Olmsted's career. In 1879, the New York state legislature commissioned Olmsted and James T. Gardner to survey the falls and to create the single most important document in the Niagara preservation movement, a Special Report on the preservation of Niagara Falls. The report advocated for State purchase, restoration and preservation through public ownership of the scenic lands surrounding Niagara Falls. Restoring the former beauty of the falls was described in the report as a "sacred obligation to mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Laura Wood Roper, ''FLO: A Biography of Frederick Law Olmsted''. Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] (1973), pp. 378–81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, New York Governor [[Grover Cleveland]] drafted legislation authorizing acquisition of lands for a state reservation at Niagara, and the Niagara Falls Association, a private citizens group founded in 1882, mounted a great letter-writing campaign and petition drive in support of the park. Professor [[Charles Eliot Norton]] and Olmsted were among the leaders of the public campaign, while New York Governor [[Alonzo Cornell]] opposed.

Preservationists' efforts were rewarded on April 30, 1885, when Governor [[David B. Hill]] signed legislation creating the Niagara Reservation, New York's first state park. New York State began to purchase land from developers, under the charter of the [[Niagara Reservation State Park]]. In the same year, the province of Ontario established the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park for the same purpose. On the Canadian side, the [[Niagara Parks Commission]] governs land usage along the entire course of the Niagara River, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.

In 1887, Olmsted and [[Calvert Vaux]] issued a supplemental report detailing plans to restore the falls. Their intent was "to restore and conserve the natural surroundings of the Falls of Niagara, rather than to attempt to add anything thereto," and the report anticipated fundamental questions. How would preservationists provide access without destroying the beauty of the falls? How would they restore natural landscapes damaged by man? They planned a park with scenic roadways, paths and a few shelters designed to protect the landscape while allowing large numbers of visitors to enjoy the falls.&lt;ref&gt;New York (State). Commissioners of state reservation at Niagara. Albany: The Argus Company, printers, 1887&lt;/ref&gt; Commemorative statues, shops, restaurants, and a 1959 glass and metal observation tower were added later. Preservationists continue to strive to strike a balance between Olmsted's idyllic vision and the realities of administering a popular scenic attraction.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York State Preservationist'', Vol. 6, No. 1, Fall–Winter 2002, "Falling for Niagara", pp. 14, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation efforts continued well into the 20th century. J. Horace McFarland, the [[Sierra Club]], and the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]] persuaded the [[United States Congress]] in 1906 to enact legislation to preserve the falls by regulating the waters of the Niagara River.&lt;ref&gt;Burton Act&lt;/ref&gt; The act sought, in cooperation with the Canadian government, to restrict diversion of water, and a treaty resulted in 1909 that limited the total amount of water diverted from the falls by both nations to approximately 56,000 cubic feet (1,600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) per second. That limitation remained in effect until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 34, Part 1, Chap. 3621, pp. 626–28. "An Act For the control and regulation of the waters of Niagara River, for the preservation of Niagara Falls, and for other purposes." H.R. 18024; Public Act No. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:dryniagara.jpg|thumb|American Falls "shut off" during erosion control efforts in 1969]]

[[Erosion control]] efforts have always been of extreme importance. Underwater [[weir]]s redirect the most damaging currents, and the top of the falls has also been strengthened. In June 1969, the Niagara River was completely diverted from the American Falls for several months through construction of a temporary rock and earth dam (clearly visible in the photo at right).&lt;ref name="Ice Jam"&gt;This remarkable event had occurred only once before, when an upstream ice jam stopped almost all water flow over Niagara Falls on March 29, 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, two bodies were removed from under the falls, including a man who had been seen jumping over the falls, and the body of a woman, which was discovered once the falls dried.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite news| last1=Fischer| first1=Nancy| title=Niagara Falls is going to go dry – again| url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/niagara-falls/niagara-falls-is-going-to-go-dry-again-20160123| accessdate=January 24, 2016| work=[[The Buffalo News]]| date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NFI&gt;{{cite web| title=Niagara Falls Geological History – The American Dry Falls – Niagara Falls USA| url=http://www.niagarafallsinfo.com/history-item.php?entry_id=1251| website=niagarafallsinfo.com| accessdate=January 24, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131084300/http://www.niagarafallsinfo.com/history-item.php?entry_id=1251| archivedate=January 31, 2016| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Horseshoe Falls absorbed the extra flow, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] studied the riverbed and mechanically bolted and strengthened any faults they found; faults that would, if left untreated, have hastened the retreat of the American Falls. A plan to remove the huge mound of [[Scree|talus]] deposited in 1954 was abandoned owing to cost, and in November 1969, the temporary dam was [[dynamite]]d, restoring flow to the American Falls. Even after these undertakings, [[Luna Island]], the small piece of land between the main waterfall and the Bridal Veil, remained off limits to the public for years owing to fears that it was unstable and could collapse into the gorge.

Commercial interests have continued to encroach on the land surrounding the state park, including the construction of several tall buildings (most of them hotels) on the Canadian side. The result is a significant alteration and urbanisation of the landscape. One study indicated it has caused the airflow near the falls to change direction. Students at the [[University of Guelph]] demonstrated, using scale models, that as air passes over the top of the new hotels it causes a breeze to roll down the south sides of the buildings and spill into the gorge below the falls, where it feeds into a whirlpool of moisture and air. The inference was that a documented rise in the number of "mist days" was a result of these breezes, where mist days refers to the mist plume of the falls reaching landside. In 1996 there were 29 mist days recorded, but by 2003 that number had risen to 68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=What causes the mist rising from Niagara Falls?| url=http://opseu-217.blogspot.com/2006/07/what-causes-mist-rising-from-niagara_23.html| publisher=OPSEU-217| accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has discounted this opinion and linked mist production to the difference in air and water temperature at the falls. However, this study does not offer opinion as to why mist days have been increasing, just that the hotel breezes are an unlikely cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Bursik| first=Marcus| title=Temperatures, Not Hotels, Likely Alter Niagara Falls' Mist| url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/fast-execute.cgi/article-page.html?article=78970009| publisher=University at Buffalo| accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, New York State began an effort to renovate The Sisters Islands located on Goat Island. New York State used funds from the re-licensing of the New York Power Authority hydroelectric plant downriver in Lewiston, New York, to rebuild walking paths on the Three Sisters Islands and to plant native vegetation on the islands. The state also renovated the area around Prospect Point at the brink of the American Falls in the state park.

==Over the falls==

{{see also|List of objects that have gone over Niagara Falls}}

In October 1829, [[Sam Patch]], who called himself "the Yankee Leapster", jumped from a high tower into the gorge below the falls and survived; this began a long tradition of [[Stunt performer|daredevils]] trying to go over the falls.

===Jumps and plunges===
[[File:BobbyLeachNiagaraFalls.jpg|thumb|[[Bobby Leach]] and his barrel after his trip over Niagara Falls, 1911]]
On October 24, 1901, 63-year-old [[Michigan]] school teacher [[Annie Edson Taylor]] became the first person to go over the falls in a [[barrel]] as a publicity stunt; she survived, bleeding, but otherwise unharmed.

Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors face charges and stiff fines, as it is illegal, on both sides of the border, to attempt to go over the falls.

In 1918, there was a near disaster when a barge, known locally as the [[Niagara Scow]], working upriver broke its tow, and almost plunged over the falls.

In the "Miracle at Niagara", Roger Woodward, a seven-year-old American boy, was swept over the Horseshoe Falls protected only by a life vest on July 9, 1960, as two tourists pulled his 17-year-old sister Deanne from the river only {{convert|20|ft}} from the lip of the Horseshoe Falls at Goat Island.&lt;ref name="Goat Island"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wholesomewords.org/children/stories/overfalls.html | title = Over the Falls | accessdate = September 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minutes later, Woodward was plucked from the roiling plunge pool beneath the Horseshoe Falls after grabbing a life ring thrown to him by the crew of the ''[[Maid of the Mist]]'' boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoniagara.com/history/rogerwoodward_miracle.aspx| title=Account of Roger Woodward's Niagara Falls incident| accessdate=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nfpl.library.on.ca/nfplindex/search.asp?search=1&amp;db=5&amp;idx=ti&amp;query=roger+Woodward| title=Pictures from the Niagara Falls Public Library (Ont.)

On July 2, 1984, Canadian [[Karel Soucek]] from [[Hamilton, Ontario]], plunged over the Horseshoe Falls in a barrel with only minor injuries. Soucek was fined $500 for performing the stunt without a license. In 1985, he was fatally injured while attempting to re-create the Niagara drop at the [[Houston Astrodome]]. His aim was to climb into a barrel hoisted to the rafters of the Astrodome and to drop {{convert|180|ft|m}} into a water tank on the floor. After his barrel released prematurely, it hit the side of the tank and he died the next day from his injuries.&lt;ref name=KarelSoucek&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoniagara.com/other/daredevils/karel.html| title=Info Niagara Karel Soucek |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |work= | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109131113/http://www.infoniagara.com/other/daredevils/karel.html| archivedate = January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-21/news/mn-14186_1_water-tank|title=35,000 Watch as Barrel Misses Water Tank :  180-Ft.

In August 1985, [[Steve Trotter]], an aspiring stuntman from [[Rhode Island]], became the youngest person ever (age 22) and the first American in 25 years to go over the falls in a barrel. Ten years later, Trotter went over the falls again, becoming the second person to go over the falls twice and survive. It was also the second-ever "duo"; Lori Martin joined Trotter for the barrel ride over the falls. They survived the fall but their barrel became stuck at the bottom of the falls, requiring a rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/devil_frame.html#TROTTER |title=Niagara Falls Daredevils: a history |publisher=Niagarafrontier.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 1989, Niagara natives Peter DeBernardi (age 42) and Jeffery James Petkovich (age 25) became the first "team" to make it over the falls in a two-person barrel. The stunt was conceived by DeBenardi, who wanted to discourage youth from following in his path of addictive drug use. The pair emerged shortly after going over with minor injuries and were charged with performing an illegal [[stunt]] under the Niagara Parks Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/devil_frame.html#DIBERNARDI |title=Niagara Falls Daredevils: a history |publisher=Niagarafrontier.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 1990, Jesse Sharp, a whitewater canoeist from Tennessee paddled over the falls in a closed deck canoe. He neglected to wear a helmet to make his face more visible for photographs of the event. He also did not wear a life vest because he believed it would hinder his escape from the hydraulics at the base of the falls. His boat flushed out of the falls, but his body was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neill|first1=Michael|title=Tennessee Outdoorsman Jessie Sharp Challenged Niagara's Mighty Falls in a Tiny Canoe—and Lost – Vol. 33 No. 25|url=http://people.com/archive/tennessee-outdoorsman-jessie-sharp-challenged-niagaras-mighty-falls-in-a-tiny-canoe-and-lost-vol-33-no-25/|website=PEOPLE.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=June 25, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 1995, Robert Douglas "Firecracker" Overacker went over the falls on a [[Jet Ski]] to raise awareness for the homeless.

One inexperienced walker slid down his safety rope. Only one man fell to his death, at night and under mysterious circumstances, at the anchoring place for his wire.&lt;ref name=Neville/&gt;

These [[tightrope walker]]s drew huge crowds to witness their exploits. Their wires ran across the gorge, near the current Rainbow Bridge, not over the waterfall itself. Among the many was Ontario's [[William Leonard Hunt|William Hunt]], who billed himself as "The Great Farini" and competed with Blondin in performing outrageous stunts over the gorge.&lt;ref name="Niagarafrontier.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/devil_frame.html#FARINI |title=Niagara Falls Daredevils: a history |publisher=Niagarafrontier.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On three occasions Blondin carried his manager, Harry Colcord, on his back—on the final time being watched by the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name=Neville&gt;Anne Neville, [http://www.buffalonews.com/topics/niagara-falls-wire-walk/article896230.ece "Daredevils who wire-walked before Wallenda"], buffalonews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, 23-year-old Italian [[Maria Spelterini]] was the only woman ever to cross the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope, making four crossings over 18 days.

==Other entertainment==

===Movies and television===
Already a huge tourist attraction and favorite spot for honeymooners, Niagara Falls visits rose sharply in 1953 after the release of ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'', a movie starring [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Joseph Cotten]]. In 1956, the ''[[Woody Woodpecker]]'' series released the episode ''[[Niagara Fools]]''. The 1974 [[ABC Movie of the Week]], ''The Great Niagara,'' featuring [[Richard Boone]] and [[Randy Quaid]] and filmed on location, told the story of a family of daredevils who challenged the falls. The falls was a featured location in the 1980 movie ''[[Superman II]]'', and was itself the subject of a popular [[IMAX]] movie, ''[[Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imaxniagara.com/IMAX-theater/the-movie.cfm |title=Niagara Falls IMAX Movie &amp;#124; Ontario, Canada |publisher=Imaxniagara.com |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602082840/http://www.imaxniagara.com/IMAX-theater/the-movie.cfm |archivedate=June 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the episode "[[Return of the Technodrome]]" in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon series]] takes place near the Niagara Falls and its hydroelectric plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart018.htm |title=''Return of the Technodrome'' |publisher=Ninjaturtles |date=December 31, 1988 |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114080838/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart018.htm |archivedate=January 14, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illusionist [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] performed a trick in which he appeared to travel over the Horseshoe Falls in 1990.

The falls, or more particularly, the tourist-supported complex near the falls, was the setting of the short-lived Canadian-shot US television show ''[[Wonderfalls]]'' in early 2004. Location footage of the falls was shot in October 2006 to portray "World's End" of the movie ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/locations| title=Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007)| work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional kayaker Rafa Ortiz's preparation to paddle over the falls in a kayak is documented in the 2015 film ''Chasing Niagara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5192278/|title=Chasing Niagara|date=July 5, 2016|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Composer [[Ferde Grofé]] was commissioned by the Niagara Falls Power Generation project in 1960 to compose the [[Niagara Falls Suite]] in honor of the completion of the first stage of hydroelectric work at the falls. Each movement is dedicated to the falls, or to the history of the greater [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] region. In 1997, composer [[Michael Daugherty]] composed ''[[Niagara Falls (composition)|Niagara Falls]]'', a piece for [[concert band]] inspired by the falls.

===Literature===
The Niagara Falls area features as the base camp for a German aerial invasion of the United States in the [[H. G. Wells]] novel ''[[The War in the Air]]''.

Many poets have been inspired to write about the falls. Among them was the Cuban poet [[José María Heredia y Heredia|José Maria Heredia]], who wrote the poem "Niagara". There are commemorative plaques on both sides of the falls recognising the poem.

In the original 1920s and 1930s ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' stories and [[Comic strip|newspaper cartoons]], Buck Rogers, in his adventures in the 25th century that take place on [[Earth]], helps in the fight for a free Northern America from the liberated zone around Niagara, New York (which by then has grown to a large metropolis—the capital of the liberated zone—that includes [[Niagara Falls, New York]], [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], and [[Buffalo, New York]]), against the Red Mongol Empire, a Chinese empire of the future which in the 25th century rules most of North America.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century'' 1969 Chelsea House—Introduction by [[Ray Bradbury]]—Reprints of the original [[Buck Rogers]] comic strips&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of [[Mark Twain]]'s 1893 short story, "Extract from Adam's Diary" is set at Niagara Falls.

The Bulgarian writer [[Aleko Konstantinov]] portrays the impressiveness of the Niagara Falls in his book, "[[To Chicago and Back]]".

In 2014, the writer [[Alessandro Baricco]] published the book ‘Smith &amp; Wesson’ counting the story of Rachel Green going over the falls.

===Fine art===

The Niagara Falls were such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were "the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American [[landscape painting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Frederic Church |last=Howat |first=John K. |last2=Church |first2=Frederic Edwin |date=2005 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300109881 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church's 1857 ''[[Niagara (Frederic Edwin Church)|Niagara]]'' was exhibited on two continents to thousands of paying customers.

==Tourism==
[[File:Niagara Falls at night1.jpg|thumb|upright|Niagara Falls at night]]

Peak visitor traffic occurs in the summertime, when Niagara Falls are both a daytime and evening attraction. From the Canadian side, floodlights illuminate both sides of the falls for several hours after dark (until midnight). The number of visitors in 2007 was expected to total 20 million, and by 2009 the annual rate was expected to top 28&amp;nbsp;million tourists.&lt;ref name=Trave;ppce&gt;{{cite web | title = Niagara Falls | url = http://www.travelooce.com/niagara-falls.shtml | publisher = Travelooce.com | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130205181245/http://www.travelooce.com/niagara-falls.shtml | archivedate = February 5, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest and best known tourist attraction at Niagara Falls is the ''[[Maid of the Mist]]'' boat cruise, named for an ancient Ongiara Indian mythical character, which has carried passengers into the rapids immediately below the falls since 1846. Cruise boats operate from boat docks on both sides of the falls, with the Maid of the Mist operating from the American side and [[Hornblower Cruises]] from the Canadian side.&lt;ref name=momweb&gt;{{cite web|title=Maid of the Mist |url=http://www.maidofthemist.com/en/ |publisher=Maid of the Mist Steamboat Company, Ltd |accessdate=March 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329072454/http://www.maidofthemist.com/en/ |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=momleg&gt;{{cite web | title = American Indian Legends – Legend of the Maid of the Mist | url = http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/Legend_Of_The_Maid_Of_The_Mist-Unknown.html | publisher =www.firstpeople.us | accessdate = March 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American side===
[[File:Niagara Falls - US Side.JPG|thumb|Niagara Falls: U.S. side]]

From the U.S. side, the American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Point Park, which also features the [[Prospect Point Observation Tower]] and a boat dock for the ''Maid of the Mist''. Goat Island offers more views of the falls and is accessible by foot and automobile traffic by bridge above the American Falls. From Goat Island, the [[Cave of the Winds (New York)|Cave of the Winds]] is accessible by elevator and leads hikers to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls. Also on Goat Island are the Three Sisters Islands, the Power Portal where a huge statue of [[Nikola Tesla]] (the inventor whose patents for the AC [[induction motor]] and other devices for AC power transmission helped make the harnessing of the falls possible) can be seen, and a walking path that enables views of the rapids, the Niagara River, the gorge, and all of the falls. Most of these attractions lie within the [[Niagara Falls State Park]].&lt;ref name = nfspat/&gt;

The Niagara Scenic Trolley offers guided trips along the American Falls and around Goat Island. Panoramic and aerial views of the falls can also be viewed by helicopter. The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center showcases the natural and local history of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge. A casino and luxury hotel was opened in Niagara Falls, New York, by the Seneca Indian tribe. The [[Seneca Niagara Casino &amp; Hotel]] occupies the former Niagara Falls Convention Center. The new hotel is the first addition to the city's skyline since completion of the [[United Office Building]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=nfspat&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.niagarafallsstatepark.com/ | title = Niagara Falls State Park | publisher = Niagara Falls State Park | accessdate = March 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tfoa&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.flightofangels.net/ | title = The Flight of Angels | publisher = The Great American Balloon Company | accessdate = March 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian side===
On the Canadian side, [[Queen Victoria Park]] features manicured gardens, platforms offering views of both the American and Horseshoe Falls, and underground walkways leading into observation rooms that yield the illusion of being within the falling waters. The observation deck of the nearby [[Skylon Tower]] offers the highest view of the falls, and in the opposite direction gives views as far as [[Toronto]]. Along with the [[Minolta Tower]] (formerly the Seagrams Tower and the Konica Minolta Tower, and since 2010 called the Tower Hotel), it is one of two towers in Canada with a view of the falls.&lt;ref name="Let's Go"&gt;''Let's Go Travel Guide'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the Niagara River, the Niagara River Recreational Trail runs {{convert|35|mi}} from [[Fort Erie]] to [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], and includes many historical sites from the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=npnrrt&gt;{{cite web | title = Niagara River Recreation Trail | url = http://www.niagaraparks.com/nature/rectrailarea.php | publisher = Niagara Parks Commission | accessdate = March 27, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070329062514/http://www.niagaraparks.com/nature/rectrailarea.php | archivedate = March 29, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Whirlpool Aero Car]], built in 1916 from a design by Spanish engineer [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]], is a [[aerial tramway|cable car]] that takes passengers over the [[Niagara Whirlpool]] on the Canadian side.

'''''Only If''''' is an [[adventure game]] developed and published by [[Dubai]]-based indie studio Creability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ghandour|first=Tarek|date=July 25, 2014 |url=https://www.creability.co | title=Creability |publisher=creability.co |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Only If'' was released on July 25, 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]].

==Gameplay==
''Only If'' is a [[First-person (video games)|first person]] [[exploration game]] set at modern times and provides a level based progression, from rooms to parks. It takes elements from [[escape room]] games, includes slight [[puzzles]], and random experimental features. The gameplay changes per 'level', moving the player character or interacting with objects is the only repeating gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/if-only/|title=IF Only - Rock, Paper, Shotgun - PC Game Reviews, Previews, Subjectivity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
After a heavy night of partying at his crush's house, Anthony Clyde wakes up to find himself in an unfamiliar room. As he attempts to escape, an angry voice from a telecommunication device, "Vinny", yells insults and hints into him about how he could leave the house, however, Anthony becomes concerned about his crush's safety and attempts to rescue her. The scenes switch from rooms to parks, ending with fantasy environments. This is due to Vinny drugging Anthony from the start. After catching up Vinny, he reveals that Anthony's crush is his sister and that he was trying to keep Anthony away from her. Anthony exits the house by jumping out the window.

==Reception==
The game has been critiqued for its graphics, creativity, and poor story and gameplay execution. It received mixed reviews with [[GameSpot]] giving it a 2/10 as a lowest rating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vanlord|first=Kevin|date=July 25, 2014 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/only-if-review/1900-6415830/ | title=Only If Review |publisher=gamespot.com |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Hardcore Gamer giving it a 3/5 as its highest. "It will cost a couple hours of your life to finish ''Only If'', and that price is too high for the few fleeting, interesting concepts buried in the wreckage", said [[Game Informer]], who gave it a 5/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zuba|first=Joe|date=July 30, 2014 |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/only_if/b/pc/archive/2014/07/30/only-if-review-game-informer.aspx |title=Only If A Muddled And Uneven Journey |publisher=gameinformer.com |accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a score of 39 on [[Metacritic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 25, 2014 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/only-if |title=Only If PC |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ''Only If'' accumulated 500,000 downloads within its first 4 months and reached a million units by the summer of 2015.

Reviews claim the game may be the world's first lengthy and popular story game that's free.

[[File:Reichskommissariat-Ukraine.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Reichskommissariat Ukraine. One of the planned reichskommissariats that was to be set up by Germany after the war.]]
'''''Reichskommissariat''''' ({{lang-en|[[Reich]] [[Commissariat]]}}) is the [[German language|German]] designation for a type of administrative entity headed by a government official known as a ''[[Reichskommissar]]'' ({{lang-en|Reich [[Commissioner]]}}). Although many different such offices existed primarily throughout the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] and [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] periods in a number of different fields (ranging from [[public infrastructure]] and [[spatial planning]] to [[ethnic cleansing]]) it is most commonly used to refer to the [[Colony|quasi-colonial]] [[Territorial_entity#Administrative_territorial_entity|administrative territorial entity]] established by Nazi Germany in several [[German-occupied Europe|occupied countries]] during [[World War II]]. While officially located outside the [[German Reich]] in a legal sense, these entities were directly controlled by their supreme civil authorities (the ''Reichskommissars''), who ruled their assigned territories as German [[governor]]s on behalf of and as direct representatives of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Norman: Hitler's War Aims: The Nazi State and the Course of Expansion'', p. 217. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, New York 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of these territorial administrations served a number of purposes. Those established or planned to be established in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Northern Europe]] were in general envisioned as the transitional phases for the future incorporation of various [[Germanic languages|Germanic countries]] outside pre-war Germany into an expanded Nazi state.&lt;ref name="Bohn"&gt;Bohn, Robert: ''Die deutsche Herrschaft in den "germanischen" Ländern 1940-1945'', p. 39. Steiner, 1997. [https://books.google.com/books?id=08al1e8BdRIC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=grossgermanisches+reich&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=LkZQTJaTLeGJONeh2aEB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Their eastern counterparts served primarily [[Colonialism|colonialist]] and [[Imperialism|imperialist]] purposes, as sources of future ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for [[Generalplan Ost|German settlement]] and the [[exploitation of natural resources]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumkowski, Janusz; Leszczynski, Kazimierz: ''Poland Under Nazi Occupation''. Polonia Pub. House, 1961. {{cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archivedate=2012-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Alex J: ''Exploitation, resettlement, Mass Murder: Political and Economic Planning for German Occupation Policy in the Soviet Union, 1940–1941''. Berghahn Books, 2006.

Another contrast was the level of administrative overhaul implemented in these two types. As in most other territories conquered by the Germans, local administrators and bureaucrats were pressured to continue their regular day-to-day operations (especially at the middle and lower levels) albeit under German oversight. Throughout the war the ''Reichskommissariate'' in Western and Northern Europe simply retained the previously existing administrative structure however, while in the eastern ones completely new such structures were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr-herzfeld.de/kennzeichengeschichte/rk.htm Oversight of the planned territorial organization of the ''Reichskommissariate''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417135014/http://www.dr-herzfeld.de/kennzeichengeschichte/rk.htm |date=2010-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these entities were nonetheless intended for eventual integration into a [[Greater Germanic Reich]] ({{lang-de|Großgermanisches Reich}}) encompassing the general area of [[Europe]] stretching from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Ural mountains]], for which Germany was to form the basis.&lt;ref name="Bohn" /&gt;

==Western and Northern Europe==
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]'' ([[German occupation of Norway]] between 1940 and 1945).
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Niederlande]]'' ([[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|German occupation of Netherlands]] between 1940 and 1945).
* ''[[Reichskommissariat of Belgium and Northern France|Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich]]'' ([[Military Administration in Belgium and North France|German occupation of Belgium and North France]], [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], in 1944. Retrospectively annexed directly into the [[German question#Later influence|Greater German Reich]] in December 1944 as the new [[Reichsgau]]e of [[Reichsgau Flandern|Flanders]], [[Reichsgau Wallonien|Wallonia]] and [[District of Brussels|Brussels]], although most of the region was no longer under German control.

==Formerly Soviet-ruled territories==
In summer 1941, German Nazi-ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] suggested that to facilitate the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]] as a geographical entity, conquered Soviet territory should be administered in the following five Reichskommissariate:

* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]'' (RKO) (The [[Baltic states|Baltic countries]], formerly Soviet-occupied [[Kresy|eastern Poland]] and [[Soviet Belarus]], extended eastward by including some parts of [[Western Russia]]) 1941–1944/45.
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]'' (RKU) (formerly Soviet-occupied [[Kresy|eastern Poland]], and [[Soviet Ukraine]] minus [[District of Galicia]], [[Romania in World War II|Romanian]] [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] and the [[Crimea]], and in late May 1941 was extended eastward up to the [[Volga]]); 1941–1944.
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Don-Wolga]]'' (approximately from the [[Sea of Azov]] to the [[Volga German Republic]] including [[Rostov on Don|Rostov]], [[Voronezh]], and [[Saratov]]; late May 1941 divided between Ukraine and Kaukasus); never established.
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Moskowien]]'' (RKM) ([[Moscow]] metropolitan area and the rest of [[European Russia]] minus [[Karelia]] and the [[Kola peninsula]], promised to [[Finland]]); never fully established. [[Operation Typhoon|German military advance]] halted in 1941/42.
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus]]'' (RKK) ([[Southern Federal District|Southern Russia]] and the [[Caucasus]] area); never fully established. [[Fall Blau|German military advance]] halted in 1942/43.
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Turkestan]]'' (RKT) ([[Central Asia]]n republics and territories); never established.

At Hitler's request the [[Turkestan]] project was shelved by Rosenberg for the immediate future, who was instead ordered to focus on Europe for the time-being.&lt;ref&gt;Dallin, Alexander: ''German rule in Russia 1941–1945: A Study of Occupation Policies''. Westview press, 1981 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLDLmJq4JiYC&amp;q=reichskommissariat+turkestan&amp;dq=reichskommissariat+turkestan&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=lj9QTNjFI8aSONXCyYoB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Asia]] was determined to be a future target for [[Drang nach Osten|German expansion]], as soon as its armies would be ready to move further east after the consolidation of present victories in Soviet Russia. The interest in part of the area of Germany's major Axis partner, the [[Empire of Japan]] (see [[Axis power negotiations on the division of Asia during World War II]]), could have become a topic of discussion regarding their own contemporaneous establishment of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].

Additional units that were under discussion at different points in time include ''[[Reichskommissariat Don-Wolga]]'' but, by the second half of May 1941, the number of administrative units that were to be established in the east were limited to four; as well as a ''[[Reichskommissariat Ural]]'' for the central and southern [[Ural mountains|Ural region]].&lt;ref&gt;Wasser, Bruno: ''Himmler's Raumplanung in Osten: Der Generalplan Ost in Polen 1940-1945'', p. 51.

In Soviet times, the [[Abkhazian ASSR]] was divided into six ''raions'' (districts) named after their respective capitals. 

The administrative divisions of the [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|disputed]] [[Republic of Abkhazia]] have stayed the same, with one exception: in 1995 the [[Tkvarcheli District]] was created around the town of [[Tkvarcheli]] from parts of the Ochamchira and Gali raions. 

The Georgian government, which claims Abkhazia as an Autonomous region but lacks control, has not changed the Soviet divisions.

==Districts of Abkhazia==
{{main|districts of Abkhazia}}
Districts are led by the Head of the Administration, who is simultaneously Mayor of the District's capital, except in the case of Sukhumi. The Head of the Administration is appointed by the President following consultations with the District Assembly. Previously, the Head was appointed from among the District Assembly members, but without consultations, but in practice the President would often appoint an acting Head from without who was subsequently elected to the Assembly. The current procedure was adopted by the [[People's Assembly of Abkhazia]] on 29 January 2016, over competing proposals to elect the Head directly by the District's population or by Assembly members, and after voting almost unanimously not to change the previous procedure on 30 July 2015.&lt;ref name=ekho27519504&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharia|first1=Vitali|title=Против выборности и абортов|url=http://www.ekhokavkaza.org/content/article/27519504.html|accessdate=6 February 2016|agency=[[Echo of the Caucasus]]|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ekho27161608&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zavodskaia|first1=Elena|title=Мажоритарная система осталась в силе|url=http://www.ekhokavkaza.org/content/article/27161608.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|agency=[[Echo of the Caucasus]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic regions of Abkhazia==

Abkhazia has traditionally been divided into several historical regions&lt;ref&gt;Археогия и этнография Абхазии, http://kolhida.ru&lt;/ref&gt; (they roughly correspond to modern districts that are given in parentheses):

*[[Sadzen]] (Gagra district and [[Sochi]] region which is now in [[Russia]])
*[[Bzyb (region)|Bzyb]] (Gudauta district)
*[[Gumaa]] (Sukhumi district)
*[[Abzhywa]] (Ochamchira and partly Tkvarcheli districts)
*[[Samurzakano]] (Gali and partly Tkvarcheli district)
*[[Dal-Tsabal]] (Gulripshi district)

These are the regions mentioned in the Abkhazian Constitution of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of Abkhazia|Constitution_of_Abkhazia]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;President of Abkhazia official site, [http://www.abkhaziagov.org/ru/state/sovereignty/index.php Конституция Республики Абхазия] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119103715/http://www.abkhaziagov.org/ru/state/sovereignty/index.php |date=2012-01-19 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the popular (but erroneous&lt;ref&gt;Аргун Ю.Г.

The '''Syriac Security Office''' ({{lang-syr|ܡܟܬܒܐ ܕܣܘܬܪܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ|Mawtbo d'Sutoro Suryoyo}}, {{lang-ar|سوتورو}}), commonly known as the '''Sutoro''' or the '''Sutoro Police''', is an ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac-Christian]] police force in [[Jazira Canton]] of the [[Rojava|Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] in [[Syria]], where it works in concert with the general [[Asayish (Syria)|Asayish]] police force of the canton with the mission to police ethnic Assyrian areas and neighbourhoods.

== History ==
=== Integration in the Rojava institutions ===
With the outbreak of the [[Syrian Civil War]] and the [[Rojava conflict]], Sutoro units were first organized in town of [[Al-Qahtaniyah, Al-Hasakah Governorate|al-Qahtaniyah]] (Qabre Hewore), and soon thereafter in [[al-Malikiyah]] (Dayrik).&lt;ref name="sycomment-feb14"/&gt; The Syriac Union Party maintains warm and friendly relations with its Kurdish neighbours, and it was one of numerous organisations to join the Kurdish [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] (PYD) in establishing a formal administration for self-governance in northern Syria called [[Rojava]]. Following this policy, the Sutoro has sought to align itself with the Kurdish [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) from an early juncture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrea Glioti|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/syria-syriacs-assyrians-kurds-pyd.html|title=Syriac Christians, Kurds Boost Cooperation in Syria|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406022926/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/syria-syriacs-assyrians-kurds-pyd.html|archivedate=6 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Kurds were initially suspicious when it started organising and wanted its members to either disarm or join Kurdish formations, the Sutoro was soon accepted and welcomed by Kurdish forces. It became fully integrated in the administration of the [[Rojava|Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]], operating alongside the general Rojavan [[Asayish (Syria)|Asayish]] police force, manning joint checkpoints and patrolling neighbourhoods together, while its paramilitary counterpart, the [[Syriac Military Council]] (MFS), joined an alliance with the YPG in January 2014.&lt;ref name="thenational-feb14"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/instead-of-fleeing-some-of-syrias-christians-will-stand-their-ground#full |title=Instead of fleeing, some of Syria's Christians will stand their ground|last=Szlanko|first=Balint|date=20 February 2014|publisher=The National|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakaway of group "Sootoro" ===
{{main|Sootoro}}
The Sutoro Police should not be confused with the [[Sootoro]] which has the same name in the Syriac language, but uses the English translation "Syriac Protection Office" and the transliteration "[[Sootoro]]". This police organization in the city of [[Qamishli]] was originally founded as the local branch of the Sutero but in late 2013 broke away, turning itself into a militia aligned with the [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] government of [[Bashar Assad]].&lt;ref name="cold war"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thenational-feb14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cold war"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sycomment-feb14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/christian-militia-political-dynamics-syria/|title=Christian Militia and Political Dynamics in Syria|last=al-Tamimi|first=Aymenn Jawad|date=23 February 2014|publisher=Syria Comment|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sutoro later founded a new branch in Qamishli.

[[File:1632 Bello Belgico Stradæ.jpg|thumb|The Low Countries indicated in Latin as ''Belgico'' (1631)]]
[[File:The Low Countries.png|thumb|The Low Countries from 1556 to 1648.]] &lt;!-- The map inset provides us a small-scale map. --&gt;

The '''[[Low Countries]]''' is the coastal [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]] region in [[Western Europe]] whose definition usually includes the modern countries of [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Low Countries | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349663/Low-Countries | accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Low+Countries | title=Low Countries - definition of Low Countries by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. | publisher=Farlex, Inc. | accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Belgium and the Netherlands derived their names from earlier names for the region, due to ''nether'' meaning "low" and ''Belgica'' being the [[Latinization of names|Latinized name]] for all the Low Countries,&lt;ref&gt;derived from the ancient [[Belgae]] confederation of tribes.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[nomenclature]] that went obsolete after Belgium's secession in 1830.

The Low Countries—and the Netherlands and Belgium—had in their history exceptionally many and widely varying names, resulting in equally varying names in different languages. There is diversity even within languages: the use of one word for the country and another for the adjective form is common. This holds for English, where ''Dutch'' is the adjective form for the country "the Netherlands". Moreover, many languages have the same word for both the country of the Netherlands and the region of the Low Countries, e.g., French (''les Pays-Bas'') and Spanish (''los Países Bajos''). The complicated nomenclature is a source of confusion for outsiders, and is due to the long history of the language, the culture and the frequent change of economic and military power within the Low Countries over the past 2000 years.

In general, the names for the language, for the region, and for the countries within the region, and the adjective forms can all be arranged in five main groups according to their origin: it is a reference to a non-Latin, Germanic language—''[[theodiscus|þiudisk]]''—(''Dietsc'', "Dutch", ''Nederduits''), whose speakers are ancestral to local Germanic tribes (Belgae, Batavi, Frisii); these tribes dissolved into confederations (Franconian, Frisian) which consolidated into local, economic powerful polities (Flanders, Brabant, Holland) in the low-lying, down river land at the [[North Sea]] (Germania Inferior, Lower Lorraine, Low Countries, Netherlands).
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==History==
The historic Low Countries made up much of [[Frisia]], home to the [[Frisii]], and the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] provinces of [[Gallia Belgica]] and [[Germania Inferior]], home to the [[Belgae]] and [[Germanic peoples]] like the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]. Throughout the centuries, the names of these ancestors have been in use as a reference to the Low Countries, in an attempt to define a collective identity. But it was in the fourth and fifth centuries that a [[Franks|Frankish]] confederation of Germanic tribes significantly made a lasting change by entering the Roman provinces and starting to build the [[Carolingian Empire]], of which the Low Countries formed a core part.

By the eighth century, most of the Franks had exchanged their Germanic [[Franconian languages]] for the Latin-derived [[Romance languages|Romances]] of [[Gaul]]. However, the Franks that stayed in the Low Countries had kept their original language, i.e., [[Old Dutch]], also known as "Old Low Franconian" among linguists. At the time the language was spoken, it was known as *''þiudisk'', meaning "of the people"—as opposed to the Latin language "of the [[clergy]]"—which is the source of the English word ''Dutch''. Now an international exception, it used to have in the Dutch language itself a [[cognate]] with the same meaning, i.e., ''Diets(c)'' or ''Duuts(c)''.

The designation "low" to refer to the region has also been in use many times. First by the Romans, who called it Germania "Inferior". After the Frankish empire was divided several times, most of it became the Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]] in the tenth century, where the Low Countries politically have their origin.&lt;ref name="Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx | title=Franks | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | work=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] | year=2013 | accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nobhist.narod.ru"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html | title=Lotharingia / Lorraine ( Lothringen ) | date=5 September 2013 | accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower Lorraine disintegrated into a number of duchies, counties and bishoprics. Some of these became so powerful, that their names were used as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, i.e., [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and to a lesser extent [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]], and later [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rulers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vre.leidenuniv.nl/vre/dutchrevolt/dutch/verhaal/Pages/verhaal01.aspx |title=1.

==Names from theodiscus==
[[File:Matthias Kramer Het Nieuw Woordenboek 1759 p2.png|thumb|A Dutch-German dictionary. The languages are in Dutch indicated as ''Nederduitsch'' ("Dutch") and ''Hoogduitsch'' ("German"), while in German as ''Holländisch'' and ''Deutsch'' respectively (1759).]]

===Dutch, ''Diets'' and ''Duyts''===
{{main|Theodiscus}}
English is the only language to use the adjective "Dutch" for the language of the Netherlands and Flanders or something else from the Netherlands. The word is derived from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*þiudiskaz}}. The stem of this word, {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*þeudō}}, meant "people" in Proto-Germanic, and {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*-iskaz}} was an adjective-forming suffix, of which {{wikt-lang|en|-ish}} is the [[Modern English]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World |last=Mallory |first=J.&amp;nbsp;P. |last2= Adams|first2=D.&amp;nbsp;Q.|authorlink2=Douglas Q.

Haubrichs, "''Theodiscus'', Deutsch und Germanisch - drei Ethnonyme, drei Forschungsbegriffe. Zur Frage der Instrumentalisierung und Wertbesetzung deutscher Sprach- und Volksbezeichnungen." In: H. Beck et al., ''Zur Geschichte der Gleichung "germanisch-deutsch"'' (2004), 199–228&lt;/ref&gt; and used as an [[adjective]] referring to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[vernacular]]s of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. In this sense, it meant  "the language of the common people", that is, the native Germanic language. The term was used as opposed to [[Latin language|Latin]], the ''non''-native language of writing and the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary'', 2nd revised edn., s.v. "Dutch" (Random House Reference, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; It was first recorded in 786, when the [[Suburbicarian Diocese of Ostia|Bishop of Ostia]] writes to [[Pope Adrian I]] about a [[synod]] taking place in [[Corbridge]], [[England]], where the decisions are being written down "tam Latine quam theodisce" meaning "in Latin as well as Germanic".&lt;ref name="M. Philippa e 2009"&gt;M. Philippa e.a.

During the [[Middle Ages]] the [[Old English]] variant ''þeodisc'' was subsequently influenced from [[Middle Dutch]] ''duutsc/duitsc/dietsc'', and was then mainly used to refer to the inhabitants of the [[Low Countries]], with whom there was extensive trade. Though initially also encompassing a broader definition signifying "speakers of [[Germanic languages]] on the continent" or "Non-[[Romance languages|Romance]] speakers" the use of the word "Dutch" in this sense was rare and would become obsolete following the growing and intensive rivalry between [[England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] during the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;M. Philippa e.a. (2003–2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Weisgerber, Deutsch als Volksname 1953&lt;/ref&gt; An exception are the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], who were originally German immigrants, speak a German dialect and refer to themselves as ''Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=adp&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR2&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-tree_id=3308&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=04000US42&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en|title=American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates|date=|publisher=Factfinder.census.gov|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by I. Richman, 2004: "Taking the name Pennsylvania Dutch from a corruption of their own word for themselves, "Deutsch," the first German settlers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1683. By the time of the American Revolution, their influence was such that Benjamin Franklin, among others, worried that German would become the commonwealth's official language."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Dutch language itself, ''Diets(c)'' (later ''Duyts and Duits'') was used as one of several [[Exonym and endonym|autonyms]] until the 18th century, when it became obsolete and ''Duits'' became the sole Dutch [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] for German.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. de Vries (1971), Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nederduits''===
From the second half of the 16th until the middle of the 18th century, ''Nederduits'' appears as the nomenclature for the Dutch language among both scholars and  writers of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frans|first1=Claes|title=De benaming van onze taal  in woordenboeken en andere vertaalwerken uit de zestiende eeuw|journal=Tijdschrift voor Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde|date=1970|issue=86|page= 300|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_tij003197001_01/_tij003197001_01_0023.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bree|first1=Marijke van der Wal, Cor van|title=Geschiedenis van het Nederlands|date=2008|publisher=Spectrum|location=Houten|isbn=90-491-0011-2|edition= 5., bijgewerkte druk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only because it was perceived as modern, but also because ''nederig'' also means "humble" in Dutch, thus invoking the sense of a humble language, forming a wordplay, which appealed to the highly religious Dutch people of the time and the low lying features of their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toorn|first1=M.C. van den|title=Nederlandse taalkunde|date=1980|publisher=Spectrum|location=Utrecht|isbn=978-90-274-5245-0|edition= 6. verbeterde druk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early 19th century, saw the emergence of modern Germanic linguistics, and German linguists used the term ''Niederdeutsch'' for the German varieties spoken in the North of Germany which did not experience the [[High German consonant shift]]. Dutch linguists subsequently [[calque]]d the terminology, and used ''Nederduits'' as its translation for these German dialects.&lt;ref&gt;As based on WNT, Dictionary of the Dutch language, entry ''Nederduits''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ''Nederduits'' started to have two meanings. To avoid this confusion ''Nederlands'' as a reference to the Dutch language prevailed over ''Nederduits''. ''The Neder'''duits''' Hervormde Kerk in Nederland'' changed in the 19th century its name in ''Neder'''lands''' Hervormde Kerk'', however in South Africa, offshoots of this church kept their old name in the Dutch-related [[Afrikaans]]. Thus the ''Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk van Afrika'' is translated in English as "[[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK)]]" and the ''Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk'' as "[[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)]]".

==Names from low-lying geographical features==
[[File:Descrittione di M. Lodouico Guicciardini patritio fiorentino di tutti i Paesi Bassi 1567.jpg|thumb|380px|On the title page of ''Descrittione'' (1581), an account of the history and the arts of the Low Countries, no less than three names are used to indicate the Low Countries: 1) ''Belgia'' (alongside the woman figure on the left), 2) ''i Paesi Bassi'' and 3) ''Germania inferiore'' (both to the right)]]

===Low as deixis===
Place names with "low(er)" or ''neder'', ''lage'', ''nieder'', ''nether'', ''nedre'', ''bas'' and ''inferior'' are used everywhere in Europe. They are often used as a [[deixis|place deixis]], opposed to either an upstream or higher ground that consecutively is indicated as "upper" or ''boven'', ''oben'', ''superior'' and ''haut''. Both downstream at the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]], and low at the plain near the [[North Sea]] apply to the [[Low Countries]]. However, the related geographical location of the "upper" ground changed over time tremendously, and rendered over time several names for the area now known as the Low Countries:
*[[Germania inferior]]: Roman province established in 89 AC (parts of Belgium and the Netherlands), downstream from [[Germania Superior]] (southern Germany). In the 16th century it was reused without the deictic context.
*[[Lower Lorraine]]: 10th century duchy (covered much of the Low Countries), downstream from [[Duchy of Lorraine|Upper Lorraine]] (northern France)
*Niderlant: Since the 12th century, ''Niderlant'' ("Low land") was mentioned in the [[Nibelungenlied]] as the region between the [[Meuse]] and the lower [[Rhine]]. In this deictic context the higher ground began approximately at upstream [[Cologne]].
*[[Burgundian Netherlands|Les pays de par deçà]]: used by 15th century Burgundian rulers who resided in the Low Countries, meaning "the lands over here". On the other hand, ''Les pays de par delà'' or "the lands over there" was used for their original homeland [[Burgundy]] (central France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Wim Blockmans and Walter Prevenier ; translated by Elizabeth Fackelman ; translation revised and edited by Edward|title=The promised lands the Low Countries under Burgundian rule, 1369–1530|date=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-8122-0070-5|page=85|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=duke+pays+de+par+deçà&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAWoVChMIs5LjwoHJxwIVgjkaCh1JGgSb#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Habsburg Netherlands|Pays d'embas]]: used by 16th century Habsburg ruler  [[Mary, Queen of Hungary]], meaning "land down here", used as apposed to her other possessions on higher grounds in Europe (Austria and Hungary).

[[File:Philip the good.jpg|thumb|Under [[Philip the Good]] (1396–1467), Duke of Burgundy, the provinces of the Netherlands began to grow together: [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] and [[Duchy of Luxemburg|Luxembourg]] were ruled in [[personal union]]. He has been honored by later [[Humanism|humanists]] as the founding father of the Netherlands. By [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]], circa 1450).]]
[[File:Southern Netherlands map 003.jpg|thumb|The Low Countries in 1786 with the Austrian Netherlands highlighted]]
''Pays d'embas'' and later ''Les Pays-Bas'' was translated as ''Neder-landen'' in contemporary Dutch official documents.&lt;ref name=Lem&gt;{{cite web|last=Van der Lem|first=Anton|title=De Opstand in de Nederlanden 1555–1609;De landen van herwaarts over|url=http://www.dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/dutch/verhaal/Pages/verhaal01.aspx|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-sixteenth century on, this became a commonly used name and lost its deictic meaning of a low-lying land as opposed to a high-lying land. But the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Dutch Republic]] (Latin: ''Belgica Foederata'') and the southern [[Spanish Netherlands]] (Latin: ''Belgica Regia''), introducing a new deixis, i.e. Northern vs. Southern Netherlands, the latter being roughly present-day Belgium. ''Nederlands'', as a name for the language, was first attested in a work printed at [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] in 1482.&lt;ref&gt;Rijpma &amp; Schuringa, ''Nederlandse spraakkunst'', Groningen 1969, p. 20.)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 15th century it slowly replaced the Dutch [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] ''Diets'' and ''Duyts''.

The English adjective "Netherlandish", meaning "from the Low Countries", derived directly from the Dutch adjective ''Nederlands''. It is typically used in reference to paintings or music produced anywhere in the Low Countries during the 15th and early 16th century, which are collectively called [[Early Netherlandish painting]] ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse primitieven}}, "Flemish primitives" — also common in English before the mid 20th century), or (regarding music) the [[Franco-Flemish School|Netherlandish School]]. Later art and artists from the southern [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] provinces of the Low Countries are usually called [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and those from the northern [[Protestantism|Protestant]] provinces Dutch, but art historians sometimes use "Netherlandish art" for [[art of the Low Countries]] produced before 1830, i.e., until the secession of Belgium from the Netherlands.

Apart from its use to describe paintings, it is as adjective not common in English. Many languages however, do have a [[cognate]] or [[calque]] derived from the Dutch adjective ''Nederlands'':

===Low Countries===
The [[Low Countries]] ({{lang-nl| Lage Landen}}) refers to the historical region ''de Nederlanden'': those principalities located on and near the mostly low-lying land around the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]]. That region corresponds to all of the Netherlands, [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], forming the [[Benelux]]. The name "Benelux" is formed from joining the first two or three letters of each country's name '''Be'''lgium, '''Ne'''therlands and '''Lux'''embourg. It was first used to name the customs agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944) and is now used more generally to refer to the geopolitical and economical grouping of the three countries, while "Low Countries" is used in a more cultural or historical context.

In many languages the nomenclature "Low Countries" can both refer to the cultural and historical region comprising present-day Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, as to "the Netherlands" alone, i.e., ''Les Pays-Bas'' in French, ''Los Países Bajos'' in Spanish and ''i Paesi Bassi'' in Italian. Several other languages have literally translated "Low Countries" in their own language to refer to the Dutch language:

*[[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Nizozemski''
*[[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Nizozemština''
*[[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Ísiltíris''
*[[Southern Min]]: {{lang|nan-Hant|低地語}}/{{lang|nan-Hans|低地语}} (''Kē-tē-gú'')
*[[Serbian language|Serbian]]: низоземски (''nizozemski'')
*[[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''nizozemščina''
*[[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Iseldireg''

==Names from local polities==
===Flanders (pars pro toto)===
{{Main|County of Flanders}}
[[File:Locator County of Flanders (1350).svg|thumb|The name of the historic [[County of Flanders]] had been a pars pro toto for the Low Countries until the 17th century.]]
[[Flemish]] ({{lang-nl|Vlaams}}) is derived from the name of the [[County of Flanders]] ({{lang-nl|Graafschap Vlaanderen}}), in the early Middle Ages the most influential county in the [[Low Countries]], and the residence of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian dukes]]. Due to its cultural importance, "Flemish" became in certain languages a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries and the Dutch language. This was certainly the case in France, since the Flemish are the first Dutch speaking people for them to encounter. In French-Dutch dictionaries of the 16th century, "Dutch" is almost always translated as ''Flameng''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frans|first1=Claes|title=De benaming van onze taal  in woordenboeken en andere vertaalwerken uit de zestiende eeuw|journal=Tijdschrift voor Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde|date=1970|issue=86|page= 297|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_tij003197001_01/_tij003197001_01_0023.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A calque of ''Vlaams'' as a reference to the language of the Low Countries was also in use in Spain. In the 16th century, when Spain inherited the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], the whole area of the Low Countries was indicated as ''Flandes'', and the inhabitants of ''Flandes'' were called ''Flamencos''. For example, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the rebellious [[Dutch Republic]] and the Spanish Empire was called ''Las guerras de Flandes''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pérez|first1=Yolanda Robríguez|title=The Dutch Revolt through Spanish eyes : self and other in historical and literary texts of Golden Age Spain (c. 1548–1673)|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Oxford|isbn=3-03911-136-1|page=18|edition= Transl. and rev. |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=8h-_H4APTQUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Spanish army that was based in the Low Countries was named the [[Army of Flanders]] ({{lang-es|Ejército de Flandes}}).

==={{anchor|Holland as exonym}} Holland (pars pro toto)===
{{Main|County of Holland}}
[[File:Locator County of Holland (1350).svg|thumb|The name of the historic [[County of Holland]] is currently used as a pars pro toto for the [[Netherlands]].]]
In many languages including English, (a calque of) "Holland" is a common name for the [[Netherlands]] as a whole. Even the Dutch use this sometimes. Strictly speaking, [[Holland]] is only the central-western region of the country comprising two of the twelve provinces, [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]], and thus linguistically a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' similar to use of [[Russia]] for the (former) [[Soviet Union]], and [[England]] for the [[United Kingdom]].

The use is sometimes discouraged. For example, the "Holland" entry in the [[style guide]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' newspapers states: "Do not use when you mean the Netherlands (of which it is a region), with the exception of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch football team]], which is conventionally known as Holland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/h|title=Guardian and Observer style guide: H|work=The Guardian|accessdate=1 July 2010 | location=London | date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 17th century onwards, the [[County of Holland]] was the most powerful region in the current Netherlands. The [[count of Holland|counts of Holland]] were also counts of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[Friesland]] and [[Zeeland]] from the 13th to the 15th centuries. Holland remained most powerful during the period of the [[Dutch Republic]], dominating foreign trade, and hence most of the Dutch traders encountered by foreigners were from Holland, which explains why the Netherlands is often called Holland overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minbuza.nl/en/You_and_the_Netherlands/About_the_Netherlands/General_information/Holland_or_the_Netherlands|title=Holland or the Netherlands?|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|location=The Hague|accessdate=2 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711173902/http://www.minbuza.nl/en/You_and_the_Netherlands/About_the_Netherlands/General_information/Holland_or_the_Netherlands|archive-date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the demise of the Dutch Republic under Napoleon, that country became known as the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806–1810), and the former countship of Holland was split up and became two of its eleven provinces, later known as [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]], because one Holland province by itself was considered too dominant in area, population and wealth compared to the other provinces. Today the two provinces making up Holland, including the cities of [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Rotterdam]], remain politically, economically and demographically dominant &amp;ndash; 37% of the [[Ranked list of Dutch provinces|Dutch population]] live there. In most other Dutch provinces and also [[Flanders]], the word ''Hollander'' is sometimes used in a [[pejorative]] sense to refer to the perceived superiority or supposed arrogance of people from the [[Randstad]] &amp;ndash; the main conurbation of Holland proper and of the Netherlands.

In 2009, members of the [[Senate of the Netherlands|First Chamber]] drew attention to the fact that in Dutch passports, for some EU-languages a translation meaning "Kingdom of Holland" was used, as opposed to "Kingdom of the Netherlands". As replacements for the [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''Hollandi Kuningriik'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''Holland Királyság'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''Regatul Olandei'' and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''Holandské kráľovstvo'', the parliamentarians proposed ''Madalmaade Kuningriik'', ''Németalföldi Királyság'', ''Regatul Țărilor de Jos'' and ''Nizozemské Kráľovstvo'', respectively. Their reasoning was that "if in addition to Holland a recognisable translation of the Netherlands does exist in a foreign language, it should be regarded as the best translation" and that "the Kingdom of the Netherlands has a right to use the translation it thinks best, certainly on official documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.eerstekamer.nl/schriftelijke_vraag/de_tekst_in_het_nederlandse_2/f=x.pdf Article on website of First Chamber]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government initially refused to change the text except for the Estonian, recent Dutch passports feature the translation proposed by the First Chamber members.

===Brabant (pars pro toto)===
{{Main|Duchy of Brabant}}
[[File:Locator Duchy of Brabant (1350).svg|thumb|[[Duchy of Brabant]] located in the heart of the old [[Lower Lorraine]].]]
[[File:National Cockade of Belgium.svg|thumb|upright|Belgian patriots chose the colours of Brabant (red, yellow and black) for their [[cockade]]. This would later influence the [[Flag of Belgium|Belgian flag]] created in 1830.]]
As the Low Country's prime duchy, with the only and oldest scientific centre (the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]]), [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] has served as a pars pro toto for the whole of the Low Countries, for example in the writings of [[Desiderius Erasmus]] in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prevenier|first1=W.|last2=Uytven|first2=R. van|last3=Poelhekke|first3=J. J.|last4=Bruijn|first4=J. R.|last5=Boogman|first5=J. C.|last6=Bornewasser|first6=J. A.|last7=Hegeman|first7=J.

Perhaps of influence for this pars pro toto usage is the Brabantian holding of the ducal title of [[Lower Lorraine]]. In 1190, after the death of [[Godfrey III, Count of Louvain|Godfrey III]], [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry I]] became Duke of Lower Lorraine, where the Low Countries have their political origin. However, by that time the title had lost most of its territorial authority. According to protocol, all his successors were thereafter called Dukes of Brabant and Lower Lorraine (often called Duke of Lothier).

Brabant symbolism served again a role as national symbols during the formation Belgium. The [[national anthem]] of Belgium is called the [[Brabançonne]] (English: "the Brabantian"), and the Belgium flag has taken its colors from the Brabant coat of arms: black, yellow and red. This was influenced by the [[Brabant Revolution]] ({{lang-fr|Révolution brabançonne}}, {{lang-nl|Brabantse Omwenteling}}), sometimes referred to as the "Belgian Revolution of 1789–90" in older writing, that was an armed [[revolution|insurrection]] that occurred in the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (modern-day [[Belgium]]) between October 1789 and December 1790. The revolution led to the brief overthrow of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg rule]] and the proclamation of a short-lived polity, the [[United Belgian States]]. Some historians have seen it as a key moment in [[Belgian nationalism|the formation of a Belgian nation-state]], and an influence on the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830.

===Seventeen Provinces===
Holland, Flanders and 15 other counties, duchies and bishoprics in the Low Countries were united as the [[Seventeen Provinces]] in a [[personal union]] during the 16th century, covered by the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], which freed the provinces from their archaic feudal obligations.

==Names from tribes of the pre-Migration Period==
===Belgae===
The nomenclature ''Belgica'' is harking back to the ancient local tribe of the [[Belgae]] and the Roman province named after that tribe [[Gallia Belgica]]. Although a derivation of that name is now reserved for the Kingdom of [[Belgium]], from the 15th to the 17th century the name was the usual Latin translation to refer to the entire [[Low Countries]], which was on maps sometimes heroically visualised as the [[Leo Belgicus]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, the map "Belgium Foederatum" by [[Matthaeus Seutter]], from 1745, which show the current Netherlands.[http://cartweb.geography.ua.edu:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=Europe&amp;item=France%20and%20Low%20Countries/Europe1745c.sid&amp;wid=500&amp;hei=400&amp;props=item(Name,Description),cat(Name,Description)&amp;style=simple/view.xsl&amp;plugin.xsl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825050353/http://cartweb.geography.ua.edu:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=Europe&amp;item=France%20and%20Low%20Countries%2FEurope1745c.sid&amp;wid=500&amp;hei=400&amp;props=item%28Name%2CDescription%29%2Ccat%28Name%2CDescription%29&amp;style=simple%2Fview.xsl&amp;plugin.xsl |date=25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the centuries the Dutch attempted to define their collective identity by looking at their ancestors, the Batavi. As claimed by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]], the Batavi where a brave Germanic tribe living in the Netherlands, probably in the [[Betuwe]] region. In Dutch, the adjective ''Bataafs'' ("Batavian") was used from the 15th to the 18th century, meaning "of, or relating to the Netherlands" (but not the southern Netherlands).

==Names from confederations of Germanic tribes==
===Franconian===
[[Frankish language|Frankish]] was the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] spoken by the  [[Franks]] between the 4th and 8th century. Between the fifth and ninth centuries, the languages spoken by the [[Salian Franks]] in Belgium and the Netherlands evolved into [[Old Dutch]] ({{lang-nl|Oudnederfrankisch}}), which formed the beginning of a separate Dutch language and is synonymous with [[Old Dutch]]. Compare the near-synonymous usage, in a linguistic context, of Old English versus Anglo-Saxon.

===Frisian===
[[Frisii]] were an ancient tribe who lived in the coastal area of the Netherlands in Roman times. They left the land abandoned due to deteriorating climate conditions. [[Anglo-Saxons]], coming from the east, repopulated the region. [[Franks]] in the south, who were familiar with Roman texts, called the coastal region [[Frisia]], and hence its inhabitants "[[Frisians]]", even though they had no ancestry with the old Frisii.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=fM_cmuhmSbIC&amp;pg=PA332&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ethnic Constructs in Antiquity: The Role of Power and Tradition], Volume 13 van Amsterdam archaeological studies, redacteurs: Ton Derks, Nico Roymans, Amsterdam University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|90-8964-078-9}}, pp. 332–333&lt;/ref&gt;  After a [[Frisian Kingdom]] emerged in the mid-7th century in the Netherlands, with its center of power the city of [[Utrecht]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dijkstra|first1=Menno|title=Rondom de mondingen van Rijn &amp; Maas.

From that time on a colony of Frisians was living in Rome and thus the old name for the people from the [[Low Countries]] who came to Rome has remained in use in the national church of the Netherlands in Rome, which is called the [[Frisian church]] ({{lang-nl|Friezenkerk}}; {{lang-it|chiesa nazionale dei Frisoni}}). In 1989, this church was granted to the Dutch community in Rome.

'''Vallentuna''' is a bimunicipal [[Urban areas in Sweden|locality]] and the seat of [[Vallentuna Municipality]], [[Stockholm County]], [[Sweden]] with 29,519 inhabitants in 2010.&lt;ref name=scb /&gt; It stretches over two municipalities in [[Stockholm County]], in the [[Roslagen]] region. Vallentuna is also a suburb of [[Stockholm]]. The part of the locality which is situated in [[Vallentuna Municipality]] is the seat of that municipality.
The southern part, situated in [[Täby Municipality]], is called [[Täby kyrkby]]. Vallentuna's cultural landscape is well preserved, and human habitation in the area has been traced back as far as the stone age. Archeological excavations in southern Vallentuna near Lilla Gävsjö uncovered remains of a stone age settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vallentuna.se/content.asp?menu=1&amp;sidid=7&amp;subsidid= Vallentuna kommun - Historik &amp; utveckling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yepáchic''', sometimes spelled '''Yepáchi''', is a community in the western part of the Mexican State of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], approximately {{Convert|10|km|abbr = on}} east of the boundary with the State of [[Sonora]]. It is located in the [[Temósachi Municipality|Municipio de Temósachic]] at an altitude of {{Convert|1780|m|sp = us}} in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. Many of the people of the region are members of the indigenous ethnic group called Mountain Pima or the [[Pima Bajo]]. They are related to the [[Pima people|Pima]] and [[Papago (tribe)|Papago]] ([[Tohono O'odham]]) of [[Arizona]] and northern Sonora, speaking a similar but distinct language.&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;Estrada-Fernández, Zarina. 1998. Pima bajo de Yepachi, Chihuahua (Archivo de Lenguas Indigenas de Mexico). Colegio de México.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most maps give the name as Yepáchic, but the citizens in the town and the road signs in the vicinity spell it Yepachi. The population in 2010 was officially listed as 851, but this number swells to a few thousand on the holidays when people from small hamlets in the surrounding region congregate in Yepáchic.

The climate of the region is one of the coolest in all of Mexico. Snow is not uncommon for the region in the winter. Spring and Fall are dry seasons, with thunderstorms prevalent in late summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, C.C. 1955. Some characteristics of precipitation in Mexico. Geografiska Annaler 37:51-85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, J.R. 1964. Climatological data for Sonora and northeastern Sinaloa. University of Arizona Institute of Atmospheric Physical Technical Report on the Meteorology and Climatology of Arid Lands 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Predominant vegetation in the region is a mixed forest of pine and oak.&lt;ref&gt;Rzedowski, J. 1986. Vegetación de México. Ed. Limusa, México D.F.&lt;/ref&gt; Mountains are frequently rather steep, often with loose crumbling soil preventing easy travel. South of Yepáchic, there is a deep canyon with thorny, scrub vegetation characteristic of more arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;P.W.Martin, T.R. Van Devender, D.A. Yetman, M.E. Fishbein, P.D. Jenkins. 1998. Gentry's Rio Mayo Plants: The Tropical Deciduous Forest and Environs of Northwest Mexico. University of Arizona Press, Tucson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the flatter regions have been cleared for farming. The people of the region plant maize, beans, squash, potatoes, and various other crops. They also raise cattle, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and other livestock. The local people eat most of the crops themselves, but most of the cattle raised is sold to buyers from the lowlands. There is also lumbering in the region, a needed source of income for the people of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/bitstream/10150/185519/1/azu_td_9136850_sip1_m.pdf Laferriere, J.E. 1991. Optimal Use of Ethnobotanical Resources by the Mountain Pima of Chihuahua, Mexico. PhD Dissertation, University of Arizona.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Yepáchic traces its recorded history to 1677, when [[Jesuit]] (Compañía de Jésus) missionaries settled in the area. The rugged terrain had prevented Spanish attempts at pacification of the region before that date. The old mission church built in Yepáchic is still in use today, the only such mission church still standing in the region.&lt;ref name="holiday"&gt;Laferrière, Joseph E., &amp; Willard Van Asdall. 1991. Plant use in Mountain Pima holiday decorations. Kiva 57:27-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yepachichurchin.jpg|thumb|Interior of Spanish mission church in Yepachi, Chihuahua, Mexico]]

Yepáchic was affected in the 17th Century by anti-Spanish uprisings by the [[Tarahumara]] to the south, and later in the 19th Century by [[Apache]] raids from the north. The town was briefly abandoned several times because of these conflicts.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Pennington, CW. 1963. The Tarahumar of Mexico, their material culture. University of Utah  Press, Salt Lake City&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as the 1890s, virtually all the residents of Yepáchic were of Pima heritage. In more recent decades, [[mestizos]] from the Mexican lowlands have migrated into the area, and now own most of the homes and nearly all the shops in the center of town. Pima continue to inhabit outlying areas.&lt;ref name="pennington"/&gt;

The region continued to be isolated and largely untouched by the outside world through the middle of the 20th Century.&lt;ref name="pennington"/&gt; There was no road into the area until the 1930s, when a primitive dirt road was built. A much better gravel road replaced this in the 1970s, crossing the mountains and allowing traffic to cross the mountains for the first time. This road was paved in 1990, resulting in regular bus service and a large amount of commercial trucking between [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] and [[Hermosillo]] passing through the Pima region.

==Anthropology==

There have been several [[anthropological]] and [[ethnobotanical]] studies in Yepáchic and in the surrounding area. Estrada-Fernández studied the traditional indigenous Pima language, publishing an overview of their grammar, syntax and vocabulary. She identified consistent dialectical differences between communities in the region, especially between villages in Sonora and those in Chihuahua.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt;

Dunnigan studied relations between the Pima and their mestizo neighbors. He wrote that traditional rituals such as [[Semana Santa]] [Holy Week] play an important role in inter-ethnic relations. This is because the Pima control the elaborate traditional celebrations, reinforcing their identity as a distinct group.&lt;ref&gt;Dunnigan, T. 1981a. Adaptive strategies of peasants in a biethnic Mexican community: a study of Mountain Pima assimilation. In TB Hinton &amp; PC Weigand (eds), Themes of indigenous acculturation in northwest Mexico. Anthropological Papers of the University of Arizona 38:36-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunnigan, T. 1981b.  Ritual as interethnic competition: indito versus blanco in Mountain Pima Easter ceremonies. In: GP Castile &amp; G Kusher (eds), Persistent peoples: cultural enclaves in perspective. University of Arizona Press, Tucson&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennington gathered information on use of [[medicinal plants]] by the people of Yepáchic&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, CW. 1980. Plantas medicinales utilizadas por el pima montañés de Chihuahua/ América Indígena 33:213-232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Edward Laferrière|Laferrière]] continued the ethnobotanical work in the area. He investigated the use of wild and cultivated plants in Yepachic and in the outlying hamlet of Nabogame, {{Convert|18|km|abbr = on}} to the northwest. Wild plants eaten by the Pima include 3 species not previously described by modern science ''([[Hymenocallis pimana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Laferrière, Joseph E. 1990. ''Hymenocallis pimana'' (Amaryllidaceae): a new species from northwestern Mexico. Phytologia 68(4):255-259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laferrière, Joseph E. 1998.

[[File:Tiodoro.jpg|thumb|Decorative flowers made from leaf bases of sotol, ''Darylirion wheeleri'', Yepachi, Chihuahua]]

==Religion==

Most of the people in Yepáchic are [[Roman Catholics]], practicing an antiquated form of the faith taught to them by missionaries centuries ago. This is mixed with remnants of the older indigenous beliefs, mostly in the form of folk tales.&lt;ref&gt;Coronado A., L, F. Alvarez C, &amp; J.A. Galaviz. 1983 Kuen Kueche Leyenda: Tumoka Anatiakiga Oichika. Secretaría de Educatión Pública, Ciudad Chihuahua.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have been actively recruiting new members in the region.

[[Semana Santa]] (Holy Week) practices are quite elaborate. The people decorate the town with flowers and wreaths. They also set up 14 small shrines set up along the streets, representing the 14 [[stations of the Cross]], as per Catholic custom. Each consists of an old print depicting a scene from the Bible. People walk along the route, stopping at each of the 14 shrines and praying at each one. On [[Good Friday]], men carry around the town a platform laden with adobe bricks, along a route that begins and ends at the church. This is a symbolic reenactment of the funeral of Jesus.&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt;

On [[Día de los Muertos]] (Day of the Dead), people congregate in the town cemetery. People locate the graves of lost relatives, clean the weeds off them, and decorate them with flowers, crosses and candles. Some of the mestizos use artificial flowers purchased at the local stores, but most of the Pima use freshly cut flowers from gardens. A priest them performs mass in the cemetery.&lt;ref name="holiday" /&gt;
