      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5908">'''Blom's scheme''' is a symmetric threshold [[key exchange]] protocol in [[cryptography]].  The scheme was proposed by the Swedish cryptographer Rolf Blom in a series of articles in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Rolf. Non-public key distribution. In Proc. CRYPTO 82, pages 231–236, New York, 1983. Plenum Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Rolf. "An optimal class of symmetric key generation systems", Report LiTH-ISY-I-0641, Linköping University, 1984 [http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs6461/www/Reading/blom-eurocrypt84.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A trusted party gives each participant a secret key and a public identifier, which enables any two participants to independently create a shared key for communicating.  However, if an attacker can compromise the keys of at least k users, they can break the scheme and reconstruct every shared key. Blom's scheme is a form of [[threshold scheme|threshold secret sharing]].

Blom's scheme is currently used by the [[HDCP]] (Version 1.x only) copy protection scheme to generate shared keys for high-definition content sources and receivers, such as [[HD DVD]] players and [[high-definition television]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crosby|first1=Scott|last2=Goldberg|first2=Ian|last3=Johnson|first3=Robert|last4=Song|first4=Dawn|last5=Wagner|first5=David|title=A Cryptanalysis of the High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection System|journal=Security and Privacy in Digital Rights Management. DRM 2001. Lecture Notes in Computer Science|date=2002|volume=2320|doi=10.1007/3-540-47870-1_12|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-47870-1_12|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The protocol==
The key exchange protocol involves a trusted party (Trent) and a group of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt; users. Let [[Alice and Bob]] be two users of the group.

===Protocol setup===
Trent chooses a random and secret [[symmetric matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle D_{k,k}&lt;/math&gt; over the [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle GF(p)&lt;/math&gt;, where p is a prime number. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle D&lt;/math&gt; is required when a new user is to be added to the key sharing group.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 k &amp;= 3\\
 p &amp;= 17\\
 D &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;6&amp;2\\6&amp;3&amp;8\\2&amp;8&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\ \mathrm{mod}\ 17
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Inserting a new participant===
New users Alice and Bob want to join the key exchanging group. Trent chooses public identifiers for each of them; i.e., k-element vectors:

&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{Alice}}, I_{\mathrm{Bob}} \in GF^k(p)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{Alice}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, I_{\mathrm{Bob}} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Trent then computes their private keys:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 g_{\mathrm{Alice}} &amp;= DI_{\mathrm{Alice}}\\
 g_{\mathrm{Bob}} &amp;= DI_{\mathrm{Bob}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; as described above:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 g_{\mathrm{Alice}} &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;6&amp;2\\6&amp;3&amp;8\\2&amp;8&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 19\\36\\24\end{pmatrix}\ \mathrm{mod}\ 17 = \begin{pmatrix} 2\\2\\7\end{pmatrix}\ \\
 g_{\mathrm{Bob}} &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;6&amp;2\\6&amp;3&amp;8\\2&amp;8&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 25\\47\\36\end{pmatrix}\ \mathrm{mod}\ 17 = \begin{pmatrix} 8\\13\\2\end{pmatrix}\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Each will use their private key to compute shared keys with other participants of the group.

===Computing a shared key between Alice and Bob===
Now Alice and Bob wish to communicate with one another. Alice has Bob's identifier &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I_{\mathrm{Bob}}&lt;/math&gt; and her private key &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g_{\mathrm{Alice}}&lt;/math&gt;.

She computes the shared key &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k_{\mathrm{Alice / Bob}} = g_{\mathrm{Alice}}^T I_{\mathrm{Bob}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[matrix transpose]].  Bob does the same, using his private key and her identifier, giving the same result:

&lt;math&gt;k_{\mathrm{Alice / Bob}} = k_{\mathrm{Alice / Bob}}^T = (g_{\mathrm{Alice}}^T I_{\mathrm{Bob}})^T = (I_{\mathrm{Alice}}^T D^T I_{\mathrm{Bob}})^T = I_{\mathrm{Bob}}^T D I_{\mathrm{Alice}} = k_{\mathrm{Bob / Alice}}&lt;/math&gt;

They will each generate their shared key as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 k_{\mathrm{Alice / Bob}} &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} 2\\2\\7 \end{pmatrix}^T \begin{pmatrix} 5\\3\\1 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \times 5 + 2 \times 3 + 7 \times 1 = 23\ \mathrm{mod}\ 17 = 6\\
 k_{\mathrm{Bob / Alice}} &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} 8\\13\\2 \end{pmatrix}^T \begin{pmatrix} 1\\2\\3 \end{pmatrix} = 8 \times 1 + 13 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 = 40\ \mathrm{mod}\ 17 = 6
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Attack resistance==
In order to ensure at least k keys must be compromised before every shared key can be computed by an attacker, identifiers must be k-linearly independent: all sets of k randomly selected user identifiers must be linearly independent.  Otherwise, a group of malicious users can compute the key of any other member whose identifier is linearly dependent to theirs.  To ensure this property, the identifiers shall be preferably chosen from a MDS-Code matrix (maximum distance separable error correction code matrix). The rows of the MDS-Matrix would be the identifiers of the users. A MDS-Code matrix can be chosen in practice using the code-matrix of the [[Reed–Solomon error correction]] code (this error correction code requires only easily understandable mathematics and can be computed extremely quickly).&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12160">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bott periodicity theorem''' describes a periodicity in the [[homotopy group]]s of [[classical group]]s, discovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Raoul Bott|first=Raoul |last=Bott|year1=1957|year2=1959}}, which proved to be of foundational significance for much further research, in particular in [[K-theory]] of stable complex [[vector bundle]]s, as well as the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]. Bott periodicity can be formulated in numerous ways, with the periodicity in question always appearing as a period-2 phenomenon, with respect to dimension, for the theory associated to the [[unitary group]]. See for example [[topological K-theory]].

There are corresponding period-8 phenomena for the matching theories, ([[real number|real]]) [[KO-theory]] and ([[quaternion]]ic) [[KSp-theory]], associated to the real [[orthogonal group]] and the quaternionic [[symplectic group]], respectively. The [[J-homomorphism]] is a homomorphism from the homotopy groups of orthogonal groups to  [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]], which causes the period 8 Bott periodicity to be visible in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.

==Statement of result==

Bott showed that if &lt;math&gt;O(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[Direct limit of groups|inductive limit]] of the [[orthogonal groups]], then its [[homotopy groups]] are periodic:&lt;ref&gt;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_{n}(O(\infty))\simeq\pi_{n+8}(O(\infty))&lt;/math&gt; 
and the first 8 homotopy groups are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\pi_{0}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq\Z_2 \\
\pi_{1}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq\Z_2 \\
\pi_{2}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq 0 \\
\pi_{3}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq\Z \\
\pi_{4}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq 0 \\
\pi_{5}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq 0 \\
\pi_{6}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq 0 \\
\pi_{7}(O(\infty))&amp;\simeq\Z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Context and significance==
The context of Bott periodicity is that the [[homotopy group]]s of [[sphere]]s, which would be expected to play the basic part in [[algebraic topology]] by analogy with [[homology theory]], have proved elusive (and the theory is complicated). The subject of [[stable homotopy theory]] was conceived as a simplification, by introducing the [[suspension (mathematics)|suspension]] ([[smash product]] with a [[circle]]) operation, and seeing what (roughly speaking) remained of homotopy theory once one was allowed to suspend both sides of an equation, as many times as one wished. The stable theory was still hard to compute with, in practice.

What Bott periodicity offered was an insight into some highly non-trivial spaces, with central status in topology because of the connection of their [[cohomology]] with [[characteristic class]]es, for which all the (''unstable'') homotopy groups could be calculated.  These spaces are the (infinite, or ''stable'') unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups ''U'', ''O'' and&amp;nbsp;Sp.  In this context, ''stable'' refers to taking the union ''U'' (also known as the [[direct limit]]) of the sequence of inclusions

:&lt;math&gt;U(1)\subset U(2)\subset\cdots\subset U = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty U(k)&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for ''O'' and&amp;nbsp;Sp.  Bott's (now somewhat awkward) use of the word ''stable'' in the title of his seminal paper refers to these stable [[classical groups]] and not to [[stable homotopy theory|stable homotopy]] groups.

The important connection of Bott periodicity with the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_n^S&lt;/math&gt; comes via the so-called stable [[J-homomorphism|''J''-homomorphism]] from the (unstable) homotopy groups of the (stable) classical groups to these stable homotopy groups &lt;math&gt;\pi_n^S&lt;/math&gt;.  Originally described by [[George W. Whitehead]], it became the subject of the famous [[Adams conjecture]] (1963) which was finally resolved in the affirmative by [[Daniel Quillen]] (1971).

Bott's original results may be succinctly summarized in:

'''Corollary:''' The (unstable) homotopy groups of the (infinite) [[classical groups]] are periodic:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\pi_k(U) &amp;=\pi_{k+2}(U) \\
\pi_k(O) &amp;=\pi_{k+4}(\operatorname{Sp}) \\
\pi_k(\operatorname{Sp}) &amp;= \pi_{k+4}(O) &amp;&amp; k=0,1,\ldots 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note:''' The second and third of these isomorphisms intertwine to give the 8-fold periodicity results:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\pi_k(O) &amp;=\pi_{k+8}(O) \\
\pi_k(\operatorname{Sp}) &amp;=\pi_{k+8}(\operatorname{Sp}), &amp;&amp; k=0,1,\ldots 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Loop spaces and classifying spaces==
For the theory associated to the infinite [[unitary group]], ''U'', the space ''BU'' is the [[classifying space]] for stable complex [[vector bundle]]s (a [[Grassmannian]] in infinite dimensions).  One formulation of Bott periodicity describes the twofold loop space, Ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''BU'' of ''BU''.  Here, Ω is the [[loop space]] functor, [[right adjoint]] to [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] and [[left adjoint]] to the [[classifying space]] construction. Bott periodicity states that this double loop space is essentially ''BU'' again; more precisely,

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^2BU\simeq \Z\times BU&lt;/math&gt;

is essentially (that is, [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to) the union of a countable number of copies of ''BU''.  An equivalent formulation is

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^2U\simeq U .&lt;/math&gt;

Either of these has the immediate effect of showing why (complex) topological ''K''-theory is a 2-fold periodic theory.

In the corresponding theory for the infinite [[orthogonal group]], ''O'', the space ''BO'' is the [[classifying space]] for stable real [[vector bundle]]s. In this case, Bott periodicity states that, for the 8-fold loop space,

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^8BO\simeq \Z \times BO ;&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^8O\simeq O ,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields the consequence that ''KO''-theory is an 8-fold periodic theory. Also, for the infinite [[symplectic group]], Sp, the space BSp is the [[classifying space]] for stable quaternionic [[vector bundle]]s, and Bott periodicity states that

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^8\operatorname{BSp}\simeq \Z \times \operatorname{BSp} ;&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^8 \operatorname{Sp}\simeq \operatorname{Sp} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus both topological real ''K''-theory (also known as ''KO''-theory) and topological quaternionic ''K''-theory (also known as KSp-theory) are 8-fold periodic theories.

==Geometric model of loop spaces==
One elegant formulation of Bott periodicity makes use of the observation that there are natural embeddings (as closed subgroups) between the classical groups. The loop spaces in Bott periodicity are then homotopy equivalent to the [[symmetric space]]s of successive quotients, with additional discrete factors of '''Z'''.

Over the complex numbers:

:&lt;math&gt; U \times U \subset U \subset U \times U. &lt;/math&gt;

Over the real numbers and quaternions:

:&lt;math&gt;O \times O \subset O \subset U\subset \operatorname{Sp} \subset \operatorname{Sp} \times \operatorname{Sp} \subset \operatorname{Sp} \subset U \subset O \subset O \times O.&lt;/math&gt;

These sequences corresponds to sequences in [[Clifford algebra]]s – see [[classification of Clifford algebras]]; over the complex numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\C \oplus \C \subset \C \subset \C \oplus \C. &lt;/math&gt;

Over the real numbers and quaternions:

:&lt;math&gt;\R \oplus \R \subset \R\subset \C\subset \H \subset \H \oplus \H \subset \H \subset \C \subset \R \subset \R \oplus \R,&lt;/math&gt;

where the division algebras indicate "matrices over that algebra".

As they are 2-periodic/8-periodic, they can be arranged in a circle, where they are called the '''Bott periodicity clock''' and '''Clifford algebra clock'''.

The Bott periodicity results then refine to a sequence of [[homotopy equivalence]]s:

For complex ''K''-theory:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Omega U           &amp;\simeq \Z\times BU = \Z\times U/(U \times U)\\
\Omega(Z\times BU) &amp;\simeq U = (U \times U)/U
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For real and quaternionic ''KO''- and KSp-theories:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Omega(\Z\times BO) &amp;\simeq O = (O \times O)/O &amp; \Omega(\Z\times \operatorname{BSp}) &amp;\simeq \operatorname{Sp} = (\operatorname{Sp} \times \operatorname{Sp})/\operatorname{Sp}\\
\Omega O                   &amp;\simeq O/U                 &amp; \Omega \operatorname{Sp}           &amp;\simeq \operatorname{Sp}/U\\
\Omega(O/U)                &amp;\simeq U/\operatorname{Sp} &amp; \Omega(\operatorname{Sp}/U)        &amp;\simeq U/O\\
\Omega(U/\operatorname{Sp})&amp;\simeq \Z\times \operatorname{BSp} = \Z\times \operatorname{Sp}/(\operatorname{Sp} \times \operatorname{Sp}) &amp; \Omega(U/O) &amp;\simeq \Z\times BO  = \Z \times O/(O \times O)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting spaces are homotopy equivalent to the classical reductive [[symmetric space]]s, and are the successive quotients of the terms of the Bott periodicity clock. These equivalences immediately yield the Bott periodicity theorems.

The specific spaces are,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The interpretation and labeling is slightly incorrect, and refers to ''irreducible'' symmetric spaces, while these are the more general ''reductive'' spaces. For example, ''SU''/Sp is irreducible, while ''U''/Sp is reductive. As these show, the difference can be interpreted as whether or not one includes ''orientation.''&lt;/ref&gt; (for groups, the [[principal homogeneous space]] is also listed):

[[File:Bouncing_ball_strobe_edit.jpg|thumb|250px|A bouncing ball. The motion is not quite [[parabola|parabolic]] due to [[air resistance]].]]

The '''physics of a bouncing ball''' concerns the physical behaviour of [[deflection (physics)|bouncing]] [[ball]]s, particularly its [[motion (physics)|motion]] before, during, and after [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] against the surface of another [[body (physics)|body]]. Several aspects of a bouncing ball's behaviour serve as an introduction to [[mechanics]] in [[high school]] or [[undergraduate]] level physics courses. However, the exact modelling of the behaviour is complex and of interest in [[sports engineering]].

The motion of a ball is generally described by [[projectile motion]] (which can be affected by [[gravity]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], the [[Magnus effect]], and [[buoyancy]]), while its impact is usually characterized through the [[coefficient of restitution]] (which can be affected by the nature of the ball, the nature of the impacting surface, the impact velocity, rotation, and local conditions such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]). To ensure [[sportsmanship|fair play]], many [[sports governing body|sports governing bodies]] set limits on the bounciness of their ball and forbid tampering with the ball's aerodynamic properties. The bounciness of balls has been a feature of sports as ancient as the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].&lt;ref name=Whittington2001/&gt;

==Forces during flight and effect on motion==
{{hatnote|'''Note:''' In this article, [[vector (physics)|vectors]] are indicated in bold, while [[norm (mathematics)|magnitude]]s and [[scalar (physics)|scalar quantities]] are indicated in italics.}}
[[File:Ball forces during flight.svg|thumb|250px|The forces acting on a spinning ball during its flight are the [[gravitational force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[Magnus force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[buoyant force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

The motion of a bouncing ball obeys [[projectile motion]].&lt;ref name=Brancazio1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2014/&gt; Many forces act on a real ball, namely the [[gravitational force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] due to [[air resistance]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[Magnus force]] due to the ball's [[rotation|spin]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[buoyant force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;). In general, one has to use [[Newton's second law]] taking all forces into account to analyze the ball's motion:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum \mathbf{F} &amp; = m\mathbf{a}, \\
\mathbf{F}_\text{G} + \mathbf{F}_\text{D} + \mathbf{F}_\text{M} + \mathbf{F}_\text{B} &amp; = m \mathbf{a} = m \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = m\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the ball's mass. Here, '''a''', '''v''', '''r''' represent the ball's [[acceleration]], [[velocity]], and [[position (vector)|position]] over [[time]] ''t''.

===Gravity===
{{Main|Gravity}}
[[File:Inclinedthrow.gif|thumb|250px|Trajectory of a ball bouncing at an angle of 70° after impact without {{nowrap|[[Drag (physics)|drag]] {{color box|black}}}}, with {{nowrap|[[Stokes' law|Stokes drag]] {{color box|blue}}}}, and with {{nowrap|[[Newtonian fluid|Newton drag]] {{color box|green}}}}.]]

The gravitational force is directed downwards and is equal to&lt;ref name=Bush2013/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{G} = mg,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the mass of the ball, and ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]], which on [[Earth]] varies between {{val|9.764|ul=m/s2}} and {{val|9.834|u=m/s2}}.&lt;ref name=Hirt2013/&gt; Because the other forces are usually small, the motion is often [[idealized]] as being only under the influence of gravity. If only the force of gravity acts on the ball, the [[mechanical energy]] will be [[conservation of energy|conserved]] during its flight. In this idealized case, the equations of motion are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{a} &amp; = -g \mathbf{\hat{j}}, \\
\mathbf{v} &amp; = \mathbf{v}_\text{0} + \mathbf{a}t, \\
\mathbf{r} &amp; = \mathbf{r}_0 + \mathbf{v}_0 t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}t^2,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''a''', '''v''', and '''r''' denote the acceleration, velocity, and position of the ball, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial velocity and position of the ball, respectively.

More specifically, if the ball is bounced at an angle ''&amp;theta;'' with the ground, the motion in the ''x''- and ''y''-axes (representing ''horizontal'' and ''vertical'' motion, respectively) is described by&lt;ref name=HyperPhysicsTrajectories/&gt;
{{columns|
|col1=
;''x''-axis
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_\text{x} &amp; = 0, \\
v_\text{x} &amp; = v_0 \cos \left(\theta \right), \\
x &amp; = x_0 + v_0 \cos \left( \theta \right) t,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|col2=
;''y''-axis
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_\text{y} &amp; = -g, \\
v_\text{y} &amp; = v_0 \sin \left(\theta \right) -gt, \\
y &amp; = y_0 + v_0 \sin \left( \theta \right) t -\frac{1}{2}gt^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The equations imply that the maximum height (''H'') and [[range of a projectile|range]] (''R'') and [[time of flight]] (''T'') of a ball bouncing on a flat surface are given by&lt;ref name=Brancazio1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=HyperPhysicsTrajectories/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H &amp; = \frac{v_0^2}{2g}\sin^2\left(\theta\right), \\
R &amp;= \frac{v_0^2}{g}\sin\left(2\theta\right),~\text{and} \\
T &amp;= \frac{2v_0}{g} \sin \left(\theta \right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Trajectory of a projectile#Trajectory of a projectile with air resistance|Further refinements]] to the motion of the ball can be made by taking into account [[air resistance]] (and related effects such as [[drag (physics)|drag]] and [[wind]]), the [[Magnus effect]], and [[buoyancy]]. Because lighter balls accelerate more readily, their motion tends to be affected more by such forces.

===Drag===
{{Main|Drag (physics)}}
Air flow around the ball can be either [[laminar flow|laminar]] or [[turbulent flow|turbulent]] depending on the [[Reynolds number]] (Re), defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Re} = \frac{\rho D v}{\mu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''&amp;rho;'' is the [[density of air]], ''&amp;mu;'' the [[dynamic viscosity]] of air, ''D'' the diameter of the ball, and ''v'' the velocity of the ball through air. At a [[temperature]] of {{val|20|u=degC}}, {{nowrap|1=''&amp;rho;'' = {{val|1.2|u=kg/m3}}}} and {{nowrap|1=''&amp;mu;'' = {{val|1.8|e=-5|u=Pa·s}}}}.&lt;ref name=EngineeringToolbox/&gt;

If the Reynolds number is very low (Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1), the drag force on the ball is described by [[Stokes' law]]:&lt;ref name=Southard2006/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{D} = 6 \pi \mu r v,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the radius of the ball. This force acts in opposition to the ball's direction (in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle -\hat \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;). For most sports balls, however, the Reynolds number will be between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and Stokes' law does not apply.&lt;ref name=Metha2008/&gt; At these higher values of the Reynolds number, the drag force on the ball is instead described by the [[drag equation]]:&lt;ref name=NASADragSphere/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{D} = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_\text{d} A v^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[drag coefficient]], and ''A'' the [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]] of the ball.

Drag will cause the ball to lose mechanical energy during its flight, and will reduce the range and the height of a ball, while [[crosswind]]s will deflect it from its original path. Both effects have to be taken into account by players in sports such as golf.

===Magnus effect===
{{Main|Magnus effect}}
[[File:Sketch of Magnus effect with streamlines and turbulent wake.svg|thumb|250px|The Magnus force acting on a ball with [[backspin]]. The curly flow lines represent a [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[wake]]. The airflow has been deflected in the direction of spin.]]

 | footer = In [[table tennis]], a skilled player can exploit the ball's spin to affect the trajectory of the ball [[#Magnus effect|during its flight]] and its [[#spin and angle of impact|reaction upon impact]] with a surface. With [[topspin]], the ball reaches maximum height further into its flight (1) and then curves abruptly downwards (2). The impact propels the ball forward (3) and will tend to bounce upwards when impacting the opposing player's [[paddle]]. The situation is opposite in the case of [[backspin]].
}}
The [[rotation|spin]] of the ball will affect its trajectory through the [[Magnus effect]]. According to the [[Kutta–Joukowski theorem]] for a spinning sphere with an [[inviscid flow]] of air, the Magnus force is equal to&lt;ref name=NASAIdealLift/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{M} = \frac{8}{3} \pi r^3 \rho \omega v,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the radius of the ball, ''&amp;omega;'' the [[angular velocity]] (or spin rate) of the ball, ''&amp;rho;'' the density of air, and ''v'' the velocity of the ball relative to air. This force is directed perpendicular to the motion and perpendicular to the axis of rotation (in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \hat \mathbf{\omega} \times \hat \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;). The force is directed upwards for backspin and downwards for topspin. In reality, flow is never inviscid, and the Magnus lift is better described by&lt;ref name=Nathan2008/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{M}=\frac{1}{2}\rho C_\text{L} A v^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''&amp;rho;'' is the density of air, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the [[lift coefficient]], ''A'' the cross-sectional area of the ball, and ''v'' the velocity of the ball relative to air. The lift coefficient is a complex factor which depends amongst other things on the ratio ''r&amp;omega;''/''v'', the Reynolds number, and [[surface roughness]].&lt;ref name=Nathan2008/&gt; In certain conditions&lt;!--requires a smooth ball, according to a conversation with Rod Cross, will look for sources--&gt;, the lift coefficient can even be negative, changing the direction of the Magnus force ([[reverse Magnus effect]]).&lt;ref name=Bush2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim2011/&gt;

In sports like [[tennis]] or [[volleyball]], the player can use the Magnus effect to control the ball's trajectory (e.g. via [[topspin]] or [[backspin]]) during flight. In [[golf]], the effect is responsible for [[Golf stroke mechanics#Misplayed shots|slicing and hooking]] which are usually a detriment to the golfer, but also helps with increasing the range of a [[drive (golf)|drive]] and other shots.&lt;ref name=HumanKinetics/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeForest1997/&gt; In [[baseball]], [[pitcher]]s use the effect to create [[curveball]]s and other special [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]]es.&lt;ref name=Clanet2015/&gt;

[[Ball tampering]] is often illegal, and is often at the centre of [[cricket]] controversies such as the one between [[ball tampering controversy in August 2006|England and Pakistan in August 2006]].&lt;ref name=GuardianInzamam/&gt; In baseball, the term '[[spitball]]' refers to the illegal coating of the ball with spit or other substances to alter the [[aerodynamics]] of the ball.&lt;ref name=Okrent1989/&gt;

===Buoyancy===
{{Main|Buoyancy}}
Any object immersed in a [[fluid]] such as water or air will experience an upwards [[buoyancy]].&lt;ref name=Post2010/&gt; According to [[Archimedes' principle]], this buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In the case of a sphere, this force is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{B} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho g.&lt;/math&gt;

The buoyant force is usually small compared to the drag and Magnus forces and can often be neglected. However, in the case of a basketball, the buoyant force can amount to about 1.5% of the ball's weight.&lt;ref name=Post2010/&gt; Since buoyancy is directed upwards, it will act to increase the range and height of the ball.

==Impact==
[[File:Bouncing ball compression and decompression.svg|thumb|250px|The compression (A→B) and decompression (B→C) of a ball impacting against a surface. The force of impact is usually proportional to the compression distance, at least for small compressions, and can be modelled as a [[spring force]].&lt;ref name=Cross1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;]]

When a ball [[impact (mechanics)|impacts]] a surface, the surface [[recoil]]s and [[vibration|vibrates]], as does the ball, creating both [[sound]] and [[heat]], and the ball loses [[kinetic energy]]. Additionally, the impact can impart some rotation to the ball, transferring some of its [[translational kinetic energy]] into [[rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]]. This energy loss is usually characterized (indirectly) through the [[coefficient of restitution]] (or COR, denoted ''e''):&lt;ref name=RacquetResearch/&gt;&lt;ref name="v-sign" group="note"&gt;Here, ''v'' and ''u'' are not just the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of velocities, but include also their direction ([[sign (mathematics)|sign]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e = -\frac{v_\text{f} - u_\text{f}}{v_\text{i} - u_\text{i}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and initial velocities of the ball, and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and initial velocities impacting surface, respectively. In the specific case where a ball impacts on an immovable surface, the COR simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;e = -\frac{v_\text{f}}{v_\text{i}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a ball dropped against a floor, the COR will therefore vary between 0 (no bounce, total loss of energy) and 1 (perfectly bouncy, no energy loss). A COR value below 0 or above 1 is theoretically possible, but would indicate that the ball went ''through'' the surface ({{nowrap|''e'' &lt; 0}}), or that the surface was not "relaxed" when the ball impacted it ({{nowrap|''e'' &gt; 1}}), like in the case of a ball landing on spring-loaded platform.

To analyze the vertical and horizontal components of the motion, the COR is sometimes split up into a ''[[normal (vector)|normal]]'' COR (''e''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''[[tangential]]'' COR (''e''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), defined as&lt;ref name=Cross2006/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_\text{y} = -\frac{v_\text{yf} - u_\text{yf}}{v_\text{yi} - u_\text{yi}},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_\text{x} = -\frac{(v_\text{xf}-r\omega_\text{f})-(u_\text{xf}-R\Omega_\text{f})}{(v_\text{xi}-r\omega_\text{i})-(u_\text{xi}-R\Omega_\text{i})},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' and ''&amp;omega;'' denote the radius and angular velocity of the ball, while ''R'' and ''&amp;Omega;'' denote the radius and angular velocity the impacting surface (such as a baseball bat). In particular ''r&amp;omega;'' is the [[tangential velocity]] of the ball's surface, while ''R&amp;Omega;'' is the tangential velocity of the impacting surface. These are especially of interest when the ball impacts the surface at an [[oblique angle]], or when [[rotation]] is involved.

For a straight drop on the ground with no rotation, with only the force of gravity acting on the ball, the COR can be related to several other quantities by:&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haron2012/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e = \left|\frac{v_\text{f}}{v_\text{i}}\right| = \sqrt{\frac{K_\text{f}}{K_\text{i}}} = \sqrt{\frac{U_\text{f}}{U_\text{i}}} = \sqrt{\frac{H_\text{f}}{H_\text{i}}} = \frac{T_\text{f}}{T_\text{i}} =\sqrt{\frac{gT^2_\text{f}}{8H_\text{i}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, ''K'' and ''U'' denote the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]] of the ball, ''H'' is the maximum height of the ball, and ''T'' is the time of flight of the ball. The 'i' and 'f' subscript refer to the initial (before impact) and final (after impact) states of the ball. Likewise, the energy loss at impact can be related to the COR by
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Energy Loss} = \frac{{K_\text{i}}-{K_\text{f}}}{K_\text{i}} \times 100\% = \left( 1 - e^2 \right) \times 100\%.&lt;/math&gt;

The COR of a ball can be affected by several things, mainly
* the nature of the impacting surface (e.g. grass, concrete, wire mesh)&lt;ref name=Haron2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2000/&gt;
* the material of the ball (e.g. leather, rubber, plastic)&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;
* the pressure inside the ball (if hollow)&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;
* the amount of rotation induced in the ball at impact&lt;ref name=Cross2002/&gt;
* the impact velocity&lt;ref name=Cross1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang2002/&gt;

External conditions such as [[temperature]] can change the properties of the impacting surface or of the ball, making them either more flexible or more rigid. This will, in turn, affect the COR.&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt; In general, the ball will deform more at higher impact velocities and will accordingly lose more of its energy, decreasing its COR.&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang2002/&gt;

===Spin and angle of impact===
[[File:Impact with spin.svg|thumb|250px|The forces acting on a spinning ball during impact are the [[force of gravity]], the [[normal force]], and the [[force of friction]] (which has in general both a 'translational' and a 'rotational' component). If the surface is angled, the force of gravity would be at an angle from the surface, while the other forces would remain perpendicular or parallel to the surface.]]

Upon impacting the ground, some [[translational kinetic energy]] can be converted to [[rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] and vice versa depending on the ball's impact angle and angular velocity. If the ball moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's motion. In the figure, the ball is moving to the ''right'', and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing the ball to the ''left''. Additionally, if the ball is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's rotation. On the figure, the ball is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the ''left'' with respect to the ball's [[center of mass]]. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing the ball to the ''right''. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a [[torque]] on the ball, and change its angular velocity (''&amp;omega;'').&lt;ref name="Hesser-Knoll2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsey2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2005/&gt;

Three situations can arise:&lt;ref name=Cross2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaffri2004/&gt;
#If a ball is propelled forward with ''[[backspin]]'', the translational and rotational friction will act in the same directions. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, as will its horizontal velocity, and the ball is propelled ''upwards'', possibly even exceeding its original height. It is also possible for the ball to start spinning in the opposite direction, and even bounce backwards.
#If a ball is propelled forward with ''[[topspin]]'', the translational and rotational friction act will act in opposite directions. What exactly happens depends on which of the two components dominate.
## If the ball is spinning much more rapidly than it was moving, rotational friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be increased. The ball will be propelled ''forward'' but will not exceed its original height, and will keep spinning in the same direction.
## If the ball is moving much more rapidly than it was spinning, translational friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be increased after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be decreased. The ball will not exceed its original height and will keep spinning in the same direction.

If the surface is inclined by some amount ''&amp;theta;'', the entire diagram would be rotated by ''&amp;theta;'', but the force of gravity would remain pointing downwards (forming an angle ''&amp;theta;'' with the surface). Gravity would then have a component parallel to the surface, which would contribute to friction, and thus contribute to rotation.&lt;ref name=Cross2005/&gt;

In [[racquet sports]] such as [[table tennis]] or [[racquetball]], skilled players will use spin (including [[sidespin]]) to suddenly alter the ball's direction when it impacts surface, such as the ground or their opponent's [[racquet]].

===Non-spherical balls===
[[File:Football FBD.svg|thumb|250px|The forces acting on a [[ball (gridiron football)|gridiron football ball]] or [[rugby ball]] at impact are the [[force of gravity]], the [[normal force]], and the [[force of friction]]. Friction will normally have a 'longitudinal' component due to the ball's velocity and 'tumbling' spin and a 'sideways' component due to the 'on-axis' spin of the ball induced by the throw.]]
The bounce of an oval-shaped ball (such as those used in [[gridiron football]] or [[rugby football]]) is in general much less predictable than the bounce of a spherical ball. Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the [[normal force]] can act ahead or behind the [[centre of mass]] of the ball, and [[friction]] from the ground will depend on the alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and impact velocity. Where the forces act with respect to the centre of mass of the ball changes as the ball rolls on the ground, and all forces can exert a [[torque]] on the ball, including the normal force and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the forward velocity of the ball to increase upon impact.&lt;ref name=Cross2011/&gt;

===Multiple stacked balls ===

A popular demonstration involves the bounce of multiple stacked balls. If a tennis ball is stacked on top of a basketball, and the two of them are dropped at the same time, the tennis ball will bounce much higher than it would have if dropped on its own, even exceeding its original release height.&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt; The result is surprising as it apparently violates conservation of energy.&lt;ref name=Hartner1971/&gt; However, upon closer inspection, the basketball does not bounce as high as it would have if the tennis ball had not been on top of it, and transferred some of its energy into the tennis ball, propelling it to a greater height.&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt;

The usual explanation involves considering two separate impacts: the basketball impacting with the floor, and then the basketball impacting with the tennis ball.&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt; Assuming perfectly [[elastic collision]]s, the basketball impacting the floor at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s would rebound at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. The tennis ball going at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s would then have a relative impact velocity of 2&amp;nbsp;m/s, which means it would rebound at 2&amp;nbsp;m/s relative to the basketball, or 3&amp;nbsp;m/s relative to the floor, and ''triple'' its rebound velocity compared to impacting the floor on its own. This implies that the ball would bounce to ''9 times'' its original height.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Since conservation of mechanical energy implies &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{2}mv_\text{f}^2 = mgH_\text{f}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle H_\text{f} \propto v^2_\text{f}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
In reality, due to [[inelastic collision]]s, the tennis ball will increase its velocity and rebound height by a smaller factor, but still will bounce faster and higher than it would have on its own.&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt;

While the assumptions of separate impacts is not actually valid (the balls remain in close contact with each other during most of the impact), this model will nonetheless reproduce experimental results with good agreement,&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt; and is often used to understand more complex phenomena such as the [[Type II supernova#Core collapse|core collapse]] of [[supernova]]e,&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt; or [[gravity assist|gravitational slingshot manoeuvres]].&lt;ref name=HyperphysicsDoubleBallDrop/&gt;

==Sport regulations==
{{See also|Regulation of sport}}
Several [[sports governing body|sports governing bodies]] regulate the bounciness of a ball through various ways, some direct, some indirect.
* [[Australian Football League|AFL]]: Regulates the [[gauge pressure]] of the [[Football (ball)#Australian rules football|football]] to be between {{val|62|u=kPa}} and {{val|76|u=kPa}}.&lt;ref name=AFL/&gt;
* [[FIBA]]: Regulates the gauge pressure so the [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] bounces between 1200&amp;nbsp;mm and 1400&amp;nbsp;mm (top of the ball) when it is dropped from a height of 1800&amp;nbsp;mm (bottom of the ball).&lt;ref name=FIBA/&gt; This roughly corresponds to a COR of 0.727 to 0.806.&lt;ref name="calc" group="note"&gt;Calculated using &lt;math&gt;\textstyle e = \sqrt{\frac{H_\text{f}}{H_\text{i}}}&lt;/math&gt; and (if applicable) the diameter of the ball. The calculation assumes air resistance is negligible.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[FIFA]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[Ball (association football)|soccer ball]] to be between of {{val|0.6|ul=atm}} and {{val|1.1|u=atm}} at [[sea level]] (61 to 111&amp;nbsp;[[kPa]]).&lt;ref name=FIFA/&gt;
* [[FIVB]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] to be between {{val|0.30|u=[[kilogram-force|kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{val|0.325|u=kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (29.4 to 31.9&amp;nbsp;kPa) for [[indoor volleyball]], and {{val|0.175|u=[[kilogram-force|kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{val|0.225|u=kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (17.2 to 22.1&amp;nbsp;kPa) for [[beach volleyball]].&lt;ref name=FIVB-Indoor/&gt;&lt;ref name=FIVB-Beach/&gt;
* [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]]: Regulates the height of the [[tennis ball]] bounce when dropped on a "smooth, rigid and horizontal block of high mass". Different types of ball are allowed for different types of surfaces. When dropped from a height of {{convert|100|in|cm|sigfig=3}}, the bounce must be {{convert|54|–|60|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} for Type 1 balls, {{convert|53|–|58|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} for Type 2 and Type 3 balls, and {{convert|48|–|53|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} for High Altitude balls.&lt;ref name=ITF/&gt; This roughly corresponds to a COR of 0.735–0.775 (Type 1 ball), 0.728–0.762 (Type 2 &amp; 3 balls), and 0.693–0.728 (High Altitude balls) when dropped on the testing surface.&lt;ref name="calc" group=note/&gt;
* [[International Table Tennis Federation|ITTF]]: Regulates the playing surface so that the [[table tennis#ball|table tennis ball]] bounces approximately 23&amp;nbsp;cm when dropped from a height of 30&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=ITTF/&gt; This roughly corresponds to a COR of about 0.876 against the playing surface.&lt;ref name="calc" group=note/&gt;
* [[NBA]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] to be between 7.5 and 8.5&amp;nbsp;[[pounds per square inch|psi]] (51.7 to 58.6 kPa).&lt;ref name=NBA/&gt;
*[[NFL]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[Ball (gridiron football)|American football]] to be between 12.5 and 13.5&amp;nbsp;psi (86 to 93&amp;nbsp;kPa).&lt;ref name=NFL/&gt;
* [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|R&amp;A]]/[[USGA]]: Limits the COR of the [[golf ball]] directly, which should not exceed 0.83 against a [[golf club]].&lt;ref name="RA-USGA"/&gt;

The pressure of an American football was at the center of the [[deflategate]] controversy.&lt;ref name=Botelho2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Well2015/&gt; Some sports do not regulate the bouncing properties of balls directly, but instead specify a construction method. In [[baseball]], the introduction of a cork-based ball helped to end the [[dead-ball era]] and trigger the [[live-ball era]].&lt;ref name=BaseballDigest1963/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sowell2011/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5218">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''C''-theorem}}
In [[theoretical physics]], specifically [[quantum field theory]], '''''C''-theorem''' states that there exists a positive real function, &lt;math&gt;C(g^{}_i,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the [[coupling constant]]s of the quantum field theory considered, &lt;math&gt;g^{}_i&lt;/math&gt;, and on the energy scale, &lt;math&gt;\mu^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;, which has the following properties:

*&lt;math&gt;C(g^{}_i,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; decreases monotonically under the [[renormalization group]] (RG) flow.
*At fixed points of the [[RG flow]], which are specified by a set of fixed-point couplings &lt;math&gt;g^*_i&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;C(g^*_i,\mu)=C_*&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, independent of energy scale.

The theorem formalizes the notion that theories at high energies have more degrees of freedom than theories at low energies and that information is lost as we flow from the former to the latter.

==Two-dimensional case==
[[Alexander Zamolodchikov]] proved in 1986 that two-dimensional quantum field theory always has such a ''C''-function. Moreover, at fixed points of the RG flow, which correspond to [[two-dimensional conformal field theory|conformal field theories]], Zamolodchikov's ''C''-function is equal to the [[central charge]] of the corresponding conformal field theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zamolodchikov | first1 = A.

==Four-dimensional case: ''A''-theorem==
[[John Cardy]] in 1988 considered the possibility to generalise ''C''-theorem to higher-dimensional quantum field theory. He conjectured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cardy | first1 = John | year = 1988 | title = Is there a c-theorem in four dimensions? | url = | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 215 | issue = | pages = 749 | doi=10.1016/0370-2693(88)90054-8|bibcode =1988PhLB..215..749C  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that in four spacetime dimensions, the quantity behaving monotonically under renormalization group flows, and thus playing the role analogous to the central charge {{mvar|c}} in two dimensions, is a certain anomaly coefficient which came to be denoted as {{mvar|a}}. 
For this reason, the analog of the ''C''-theorem in four dimensions is called the '''''A''-theorem'''.

In perturbation theory, that is for renormalization flows which do not deviate much from free theories, the ''A''-theorem in four dimensions was proved by [[Hugh Osborn]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osborn | first1 = Hugh | year = 1989 | title = Derivation of a Four-Dimensional c Theorem | url = | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 222 | issue = | pages = 97 | doi=10.1016/0370-2693(89)90729-6|bibcode =1989PhLB..222...97O  }}
{{cite journal | last1 = Ian | first1 = Jack| last2 = Osborn | first2 = Hugh | year = 1990 | title = Analogs for the c Theorem for Four-Dimensional Renormalizable Field Theories | url = | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 343 | issue = | pages = 647 | doi=10.1016/0550-3213(90)90584-Z|bibcode =1990NuPhB.343..647J  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; using the local renormalization group equation. However, the problem of finding a proof valid beyond perturbation theory remained open for many years.

In 2011, Zohar Komargodski and Adam Schwimmer of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] proposed a nonperturbative proof for the ''A''-theorem, which has gained acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reich | first1 = E.

The 3-clique: &lt;math&gt;k(k-1)(k-2)&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The '''chromatic polynomial''' is a [[graph polynomial]] studied in [[algebraic graph theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]]. It counts the number of [[graph coloring]]s as a function of the number of colors and was originally defined by [[George David Birkhoff]] to attack the [[four color problem]]. It was generalised to the [[Tutte polynomial]] by [[Hassler Whitney]] and [[W. T. Tutte]], linking it to the [[Potts model]] of [[statistical physics]].

==History==
[[George David Birkhoff]] introduced the chromatic polynomial in 1912, defining it only for [[planar graph]]s, in an attempt to prove the [[four color theorem]]. If &lt;math&gt;P(G, k)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of proper colorings of ''G'' with ''k'' colors then one could establish the four color theorem by showing &lt;math&gt;P(G, 4)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for all planar graphs ''G''. In this way he hoped to apply the powerful tools of analysis and algebra for studying the roots of polynomials to the combinatorial coloring problem.

[[Hassler Whitney]] generalised Birkhoff’s polynomial from the planar case to general graphs in 1932. In 1968, [[Ronald C. Read|Read]] asked which polynomials are the chromatic polynomials of some graph, a question that remains open, and introduced the concept of chromatically equivalent graphs. Today, chromatic polynomials are one of the central objects of [[algebraic graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Several chapters {{harvtxt|Biggs|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Chromatic polynomial of all 3-vertex graphs BW with colorings.png|thumb|300px|right|All proper vertex colorings of vertex graphs with 3 vertices using ''k'' colors for &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;. The chromatic polynomial of each graph interpolates through the number of proper colorings.]]

For a graph ''G'', &lt;math&gt;P(G,k)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of its (proper) [[vertex coloring|vertex ''k''-colorings]]. 
Other commonly used notations include &lt;math&gt;P_G(k)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(k)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\pi_G(k)&lt;/math&gt;.
There is a unique [[polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;P(G,x)&lt;/math&gt; which evaluated at any integer ''k ≥ 0'' coincides with &lt;math&gt;P(G,k)&lt;/math&gt;; it is called the '''chromatic polynomial''' of ''G''.

For example, to color the [[path graph]] &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; on 3 vertices with ''k'' colors, one may choose any of the ''k'' colors for the first vertex, any of the &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt; remaining colors for the second vertex, and lastly for the third vertex, any of the &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt; colors that are different from the second vertex's choice.
Therefore, &lt;math&gt;P(P_3,k) = k \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-1)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of ''k''-colorings of &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;.
For a variable ''x'' (not necessarily integer), we thus have &lt;math&gt;P(P_3,x)=x(x-1)^2=x^3-2x^2+x&lt;/math&gt;.
(Note that colorings which differ only by permuting colors or by [[graph automorphism|automorphisms]] of ''G'' are still counted as different.)

===Deletion–contraction===
The fact that the number of ''k''-colorings is a polynomial in ''k'' follows from a recurrence relation called the '''deletion–contraction recurrence''' or '''Fundamental Reduction Theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dong|Koh|Teo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is based on [[edge contraction]]: for a  pair of vertices &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; the graph &lt;math&gt;G/uv&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by merging the two vertices and removing any edges between them. 
If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are adjacent in ''G'', let &lt;math&gt;G-uv&lt;/math&gt; denote the graph obtained by removing the edge &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the numbers of ''k''-colorings of these graphs satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;P(G,k)=P(G-uv, k)- P(G/uv,k)&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are not adjacent in ''G'' and &lt;math&gt;G+uv&lt;/math&gt; is the graph with the edge &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt; added, then
:&lt;math&gt;P(G,k)= P(G+uv, k) + P(G/uv,k)&lt;/math&gt;
This follows from the observation that every ''k''-coloring of ''G'' either gives different colors to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, or the same colors. In the first case this gives a (proper) ''k''-coloring of &lt;math&gt;G+uv&lt;/math&gt;, while in the second case it gives a coloring of &lt;math&gt;G/uv&lt;/math&gt;.
Conversely, every ''k''-coloring of ''G'' can be uniquely obtained from a ''k''-coloring of &lt;math&gt;G+uv&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;G/uv&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are not adjacent in ''G'').

The chromatic polynomial can hence be recursively defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;P(G,x)=x^n&lt;/math&gt; for the edgeless graph on ''n'' vertices, and 
:&lt;math&gt;P(G,x)=P(G-uv, x)- P(G/uv,x)&lt;/math&gt; for a graph ''G'' with an edge &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt; (arbitrarily chosen).
Since the number of ''k''-colorings of the edgeless graph is indeed &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt;, it follows by induction on the number of edges that for all ''G'', the polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(G,x)&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the number of ''k''-colorings at every integer point ''x=k''.
In particular, the chromatic polynomial is the unique [[interpolating polynomial]] of degree at most ''n'' through the points
:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ (0, P(G, 0)), (1, P(G, 1)), \cdots, (n, P(G, n)) \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Tutte]]’s curiosity about which other [[graph invariant]]s satisfied such recurrences led him to discover a bivariate generalization of the chromatic polynomial, the [[Tutte polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
For fixed ''G'' on ''n'' vertices, the chromatic polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monic polynomial|monic]] polynomial of degree exactly ''n'', with integer coefficients. 

The chromatic polynomial includes at least as much information about the colorability of ''G'' as does the chromatic number. Indeed, the chromatic number is the smallest positive integer that is not a zero of the chromatic polynomial,
: &lt;math&gt;\chi (G)=\min\{ k\in\mathbb{N} : P(G, k) &gt; 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The polynomial evaluated at &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;P(G,-1)&lt;/math&gt;, yields &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{|V(G)|}&lt;/math&gt; times the number of [[acyclic orientation]]s of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stanley|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derivative evaluated at 1, &lt;math&gt;P'(G, 1)&lt;/math&gt; equals the [[chromatic invariant]], &lt;math&gt;\theta(G)&lt;/math&gt;, up to sign.
 
If ''G'' has ''n'' vertices and ''c'' [[connected component (graph theory)|components]] &lt;math&gt;G_1, \cdots, G_c&lt;/math&gt;, then
* The coefficients of &lt;math&gt; x^0, \cdots, x^{c-1}&lt;/math&gt; are zeros.
* The coefficients of &lt;math&gt; x^c, \cdots, x^n&lt;/math&gt; are all non-zero and alternate in signs.
* The coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is 1 (the polynomial is [[monic polynomial|monic]]).
* The coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-|E(G)|&lt;/math&gt;.
* The coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; times the number of acyclic orientations that have a unique sink, at a specified, arbitrarily chosen vertex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ellis-Monaghan|Merino|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The absolute values of coefficients of every chromatic polynomial form a [[Logarithmically concave sequence|log-concave sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Huh|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P(G, x) = P(G_1, x)P(G_2,x) \cdots P(G_c,x)&lt;/math&gt;

The last property is generalized by the fact that if ''G'' is a [[Clique-sum|''k''-clique-sum]] of &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a graph obtained by gluing the two at a clique on ''k'' vertices), then
:&lt;math&gt;P(G, x) = \frac{P(G_1,x)P(G_2,x)}{x(x-1)\cdots(x-k+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;


A graph ''G'' with ''n'' vertices is a tree if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt;P(G, x) = x(x-1)^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Chromatic equivalence===
[[File:Chromatically equivalent graphs.svg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;The three graphs with a chromatic polynomial equal to &lt;math&gt;(x-2)(x-1)^3x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Two graphs are said to be ''chromatically equivalent'' if they have the same chromatic polynomial. Isomorphic graphs have the same chromatic polynomial, but non-isomorphic graphs can be chromatically equivalent. For example, all trees on ''n'' vertices have the same chromatic polynomial.
In particular, &lt;math&gt;(x-1)^3x&lt;/math&gt; is the chromatic polynomial of both the [[claw (graph theory)|claw graph]] and the [[path graph]] on 4 vertices.

A graph is ''chromatically unique'' if it is determined by its chromatic polynomial, up to isomorphism. In other words, ''G'' is chromatically unique, then &lt;math&gt;P(G, x) = P(H, x)&lt;/math&gt; would imply that ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic.
All [[cycle graph]]s are chromatically unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chao|Whitehead|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromatic roots===
A [[root of a function|root]] (or ''zero'') of a chromatic polynomial, called a “chromatic root”, is a value ''x'' where &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Chromatic roots have been very well studied, in fact, Birkhoff’s original motivation for defining the chromatic polynomial was to show that for planar graphs, &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for ''x'' ≥ 4. This would have established the [[four color theorem]].

No graph can be 0-colored, so 0 is always a chromatic root. Only edgeless graphs can be 1-colored, so 1 is a chromatic root of every graph with at least one edge. On the other hand, except for these two points, no graph can have a chromatic root at a real number smaller than or equal to 32/27.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jackson|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; A result of Tutte connects the [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with the study of chromatic roots, showing that chromatic roots exist very close to &lt;math&gt;\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;:
If &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt; is a planar triangulation of a sphere then

:&lt;math&gt;P(G_n,\phi^2) \leq \phi^{5-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

While the real line thus has large parts that contain no chromatic roots for any graph, every point in the [[complex plane]] is arbitrarily close to a chromatic root in the sense that there exists an infinite family of graphs whose chromatic roots are dense in the complex plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sokal|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorings using all colors===
For a graph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices, let &lt;math&gt;e_k&lt;/math&gt; denote the number of colorings using exactly ''k'' colors ''up to renaming colors'' (so colorings that can be obtained from one another by permuting colors are counted as one; colorings obtained by [[Graph automorphism|automorphisms]] of ''G'' are still counted separately).
In other words, &lt;math&gt;e_k&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of [[Partition of a set|partitions]] of the vertex set into ''k'' (non-empty) [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent sets]].
Then &lt;math&gt;k! \cdot e_k&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of colorings using exactly ''k'' colors (with distinguishable colors).
For an integer ''x'', all ''x''-colorings of ''G'' can be uniquely obtained by choosing an integer ''k ≤ x'', choosing ''k'' colors to be used out of ''x'' available, and a coloring using exactly those ''k'' (distinguishable) colors.
Therefore:
: &lt;math&gt;P(G,x) = \sum_{k=0}^x \binom{x}{k} k! \cdot e_k = \sum_{k=0}^x (x)_k \cdot e_k&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;(x)_k = x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-k+1)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[falling factorial]].
Thus the numbers &lt;math&gt;e_k&lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(G,x)&lt;/math&gt; in the basis &lt;math&gt;1,(x)_1,(x)_2,(x)_3,\dots&lt;/math&gt; of falling factorials.

Let &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; be the ''k''-th coefficient of &lt;math&gt;P(G,x)&lt;/math&gt; in the standard basis &lt;math&gt;1,x,x^2,x^3,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, that is:
: &lt;math&gt;P(G,x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k&lt;/math&gt;
[[Stirling number]]s give a [[Stirling_number#As_change_of_basis_coefficients|change of basis]] between the standard basis and the basis of falling factorials.
This implies:
:&lt;math&gt;a_k = \sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{j-k} \begin{bmatrix}j\\k\end{bmatrix} e_j&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;e_k = \sum_{j=0}^n \begin{Bmatrix}j\\k\end{Bmatrix} a_j&lt;/math&gt;.

===Categorification===
The chromatic polynomial is [[categorification|categorified]] by a homology theory closely related to [[Khovanov homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Helme-Guizon|Rong|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational problems associated with the chromatic polynomial include

* finding the chromatic polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&lt;/math&gt; of a given graph ''G'';
* evaluating &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&lt;/math&gt; at a fixed point ''x'' for given ''G''.

The first problem is more general because if we knew the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&lt;/math&gt; we could evaluate it at any point in polynomial time because the degree is ''n''. The difficulty of the second type of problem depends strongly on the value of ''x'' and has been intensively studied in [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]. When ''x'' is a natural number, this problem is normally viewed as computing the number of ''x''-colorings of a given graph. For example, this includes the problem '''#3-coloring''' of counting the number of 3-colorings, a canonical problem in the study of complexity of counting, complete for the counting class  [[Sharp-P|#P]].

===Efficient algorithms===
For some basic graph classes, closed formulas for the chromatic polynomial are known. For instance this is true for trees and cliques, as listed in the table above.

Polynomial time algorithms are known for computing the chromatic polynomial for wider classes of graphs, including [[chordal graph]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|Schaffer|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and graphs of bounded [[clique-width]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Giménez|Hliněný|Noy|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Makowsky|Rotics|Averbouch|Godlin|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter class includes [[cograph]]s and graphs of bounded [[tree-width]], such as [[outerplanar graph]]s.

===Deletion–contraction===
The deletion–contraction recurrence gives a way of computing the chromatic polynomial, called the ''deletion–contraction algorithm''. In the first form (with a minus), the recurrence terminates in a collection of empty graphs. In the second form (with a plus), it terminates in a collection of complete graphs. 
This forms the basis of many algorithms for graph coloring. The ChromaticPolynomial function in the computer algebra system [[Mathematica]] uses the second recurrence if the graph is dense, and the first recurrence if the graph is sparse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pemmaraju|Skiena|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst case running time of either formula satisfies the same recurrence relation as the [[Fibonacci numbers]], so in the worst case, the algorithm runs in time within a polynomial factor of

:&lt;math&gt;\phi^{n+m}=\left (\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^{n+m}\in O\left(1.62^{n+m}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

on a graph with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilf|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis can be improved to within a polynomial factor of the number &lt;math&gt;t(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning trees]] of the input graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sekine|Imai|Tani|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, [[branch and bound]] strategies and [[isomorphism|graph isomorphism]] rejection are employed to avoid some recursive calls, the running time depends on the heuristic used to pick the vertex pair.

===Cube Method===
There is a natural geometric perspective on graph colorings by observing that, as an assignment of natural numbers to each vertex, a graph coloring is a vector in the integer lattice.
Since two vertices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; being given the same color is equivalent to the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;’th and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;’th coordinate in the coloring vector being equal, each edge can be associated with a hyperplane of the form &lt;math&gt;\{x\in R^d:x_i=x_j\}&lt;/math&gt;. The collection of such hyperplanes for a given graph is called its '''graphic [[arrangement of hyperplanes|arrangement]]'''. The proper colorings of a graph are those lattice points which avoid forbidden hyperplanes.
Restricting to a set of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; colors, the lattice points are contained in the cube &lt;math&gt;[0,k]^n&lt;/math&gt;. In this context the chromatic polynomial counts the number of lattice points in the &lt;math&gt;[0,k]&lt;/math&gt;-cube that avoid the graphic arrangement.

===Computational complexity===
The problem of computing the number of 3-colorings of a given graph is a canonical example of a [[Sharp-P|#P]]-complete problem, so the problem of computing the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial is #P-hard. Similarly, evaluating &lt;math&gt;P(G, 3)&lt;/math&gt; for given ''G'' is #P-complete. On the other hand, for &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2&lt;/math&gt; it is easy to compute &lt;math&gt;P(G, k)&lt;/math&gt;, so the corresponding problems are polynomial-time computable. For integers &lt;math&gt;k&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; the problem is #P-hard, which is established similar to the case &lt;math&gt;k=3&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, it is known that &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&lt;/math&gt; is #P-hard for all ''x'' (including negative integers and even all complex numbers) except for the three “easy points”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jaeger|Vertigan|Welsh|1990}}, based on a reduction in {{harv|Linial|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the perspective of #P-hardness, the complexity of computing the chromatic polynomial is completely understood.

In the expansion

:&lt;math&gt;P(G, t)= a_1 x + a_2x^2+\dots +a_nx^n,&lt;/math&gt;

the coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; is always equal to 1, and several other properties of the coefficients are known. This raises the question if some of the coefficients are easy to compute. However the computational problem of computing ''a&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a fixed ''r ≥ 1'' and a given graph ''G'' is #P-hard, even for bipartite planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|Welsh|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[approximation algorithms]] for computing &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&lt;/math&gt; are known for any ''x'' except for the three easy points. At the integer points &lt;math&gt;k=3,4,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding [[decision problem]] of deciding if a given graph can be ''k''-colored is [[NP-hard]]. Such problems cannot be approximated to any multiplicative factor by a bounded-error probabilistic algorithm unless NP&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;RP, because any multiplicative approximation would distinguish the values 0 and 1, effectively solving the decision version in bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time. In particular, under the same assumption, this rules out the possibility of a [[FPRAS|fully polynomial time randomised approximation scheme (FPRAS)]]. For other points, more complicated arguments are needed, and the question is the focus of active research. {{As of|2008}}, it is known that there is no [[FPRAS]] for computing &lt;math&gt;P(G, x)&lt;/math&gt; for any ''x'' &gt; 2, unless [[NP (complexity class)|NP]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[RP (complexity class)|RP]] holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Goldberg|Jerrum|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2916">In [[mathematics]], the '''complete Fermi–Dirac integral''', named after [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Paul Dirac]], for an index ''j&amp;nbsp;'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F_j(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(j+1)} \int_0^\infty \frac{t^j}{e^{t-x} + 1}\,dt, \qquad (j &gt; -1)&lt;/math&gt;

This equals 
:&lt;math&gt;-\operatorname{Li}_{j+1}(-e^x),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_{s}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polylogarithm]].

Its derivative is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dF_{j}(x)}{dx} = F_{j-1}(x) , &lt;/math&gt;
and this derivative relationship is used to define the Fermi-Dirac integral for nonpositive indices ''j''.  Differing notation for &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt; appears in the literature, for instance some authors omit the factor &lt;math&gt;1/\Gamma(j+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  The definition used here matches that in the [http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.12#iii NIST DLMF].

== Special values ==
The closed form of the function exists for ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0:

:&lt;math&gt;F_0(x) = \ln(1+\exp(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Eratosthenes of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛr|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|s|θ|ə|n|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἐρατοσθένης ὁ Κυρηναῖος}}, {{IPA-el|eratostʰénɛːs|IPA}}; {{nowrap|{{circa}}&amp;nbsp;276 BC}}&lt;ref&gt;The [[Suda]] states that he was born in the 126th [[Olympiad]], (276–272&amp;nbsp;BC). [[Strabo]] (''Geography'', i.2.2), though, states that he was a "pupil" (γνωριμος) of [[Zeno of Citium]] (who died 262&amp;nbsp;BC), which would imply an earlier year-of-birth ({{nowrap|{{circa}}&amp;nbsp;285 BC}}) since he is unlikely to have studied under him at the young age of 14. However, γνωριμος can also mean "acquaintance", and the year of Zeno's death is by no means definite. Cf. ''Eratosthenes'' entry in the ''[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– {{nowrap|{{circa|195/194 BC|lk=no}}}}&lt;ref&gt;The [[Suda]] states he died at the age of 80, [[Censorinus]] (''De die natali'', 15) at the age of 81, and [[Pseudo-Lucian]] (''Makrobioi'', 27) at the age of 82.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]], [[geographer]], [[poet]], [[astronomer]], and [[music theory|music theorist]]. He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. He invented the discipline of [[geography]], including the terminology used today.&lt;ref name="Roller, Duane W 2010"&gt;Roller, Duane W. Eratosthenes' Geography. New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for being the first person to calculate the [[History of geodesy#Hellenic world|circumference of the Earth]], which he did by comparing altitudes of the mid-day sun at two places a known North-South distance apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Universe|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|publisher=Watson-Guptill|year=2001|isbn=0-8230-2512-8|location=New York, NY|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the [[Axial tilt#Obliquity of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt)|tilt of the Earth's axis]], again with remarkable accuracy. Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the [[Astronomical unit|distance from the Earth to the Sun]] and invented the [[leap day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/06/dayintech_0619 |title=June 19, 240 B.C.: The Earth Is Round, and It's This Big |first=Randy |last=Alfred |work=Wired |date=June 19, 2008 | accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the first [[Ancient world maps#Eratosthenes .28276.E2.80.93194 BCE.29|map of the world]], incorporating [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] and [[Longitude|meridians]] based on the available geographic knowledge of his era.

Eratosthenes was the founder of scientific [[chronology]]; he endeavored to revise the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of [[Troy]]. Eratosthenes dated [[Iliupersis|The Sack of Troy]] to 1183 BC. In [[number theory]], he introduced the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]], an efficient method of identifying [[prime number]]s.

He was a figure of influence in many fields.  According to an entry&lt;ref&gt;Entry {{lang|grc|ε}} 2898&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Suda]] (a 10th-century reference), his critics scorned him, calling him ''Beta'' (the second letter of the Greek alphabet) because he always came in second in all his endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;See also Asimov, Isaac.

This was also asserted by Carl Sagan 31 minutes into his Cosmos episode ''The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean''&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, his devotees nicknamed him ''Pentathlos'' after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Eratosthenes yearned to understand the complexities of the entire world.&lt;ref name="Chambers, James T 1998"&gt;Chambers, James T. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene."

== Life ==

The son of Aglaos, Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC in [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]]. Now part of modern-day [[Libya]], Cyrene had been founded by Greeks centuries earlier and became the capital of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)]], a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinoe, [[Berenice]], Ptolemias, and [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]]. [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC, its rule was given to one of his generals, [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the founder of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and [[silphium]], a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine.&lt;ref name="Roller, Duane W 2010"/&gt; Cyrene became a place of cultivation, where knowledge blossomed. Like any young Greek, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ellen. 2006. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene." Eratosthenes Of Cyrene 1–3. Book Collection Nonfiction: High School Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1959 1225 IN2.jpg|thumb|287px|''Eratosthenes teaching in Alexandria'' by [[Bernardo Strozzi]]]]

Eratosthenes went to Athens to further his studies. There he was taught [[Stoicism]] by its founder, [[Zeno of Citium]], in philosophical lectures on living a virtuous life.&lt;ref&gt;Rist, J.M. "Zeno and Stoic Consistency," in Phronesis. Vol. 22, No. 2, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied under [[Aristo of Chios]], who led a more [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynical]] school of philosophy. He also studied under the head of the [[Platonic Academy]], who was [[Arcesilaus of Pitane]]. His interest in Plato led him to write his very first work at a scholarly level, ''Platonikos'', inquiring into the mathematical foundation of Plato's philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, James T. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene." in ''Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World January'' 1998: 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes was a man of many perspectives and investigated the art of poetry under [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ellen. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene," in Eratosthenes of Cyrene 1–3. Book Collection Nonfiction: High School Edition, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a talented and imaginative poet. He wrote poems: one in [[hexameter]]s called ''Hermes'', illustrating the god's life history; and another, in [[elegiac]]s called ''Erigone'', describing the suicide of the Athenian maiden [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, James T. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene" in ''Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World'' (January 1998): 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''Chronographies'', a text that scientifically depicted dates of importance, beginning with the [[Trojan War]]. This work was highly esteemed for its accuracy. [[George Syncellus]] was later able to preserve from ''Chronographies'' a list of 38 kings of the [[Egyptian Thebes]]. Eratosthenes also wrote ''Olympic Victors'', a chronology of the winners of the Olympic Games. It is not known when he wrote his works, but they highlighted his abilities.

These works and his great poetic abilities led the pharaoh [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] to seek to place him as a librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the year 245 BC. Eratosthenes, then thirty years old, accepted Ptolemy's invitation and traveled to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. Within about five years he became Chief Librarian, a position that the poet [[Apollonius Rhodius]] had previously held. As head of the library Eratosthenes tutored the children of Ptolemy, including [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] who became the fourth Ptolemaic pharaoh. He expanded the library's holdings: in Alexandria all books had to be surrendered for duplication. It was said that these were copied so accurately that it was impossible to tell if the library had returned the original or the copy.
He sought to maintain the reputation of the Library of Alexandria against competition from the [[Library of Pergamum]]. Eratosthenes created a whole section devoted to the examination of Homer, and acquired original works of great tragic dramas of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, James T. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene" Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World, January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eratosthenes made several important contributions to [[mathematics]] and [[science]], and was a friend of [[Archimedes]]. Around 255&amp;nbsp;BC, he invented the [[armillary sphere]]. In ''On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies'', [[Cleomedes]] credited him with having calculated the [[Equator#Exact length of the Equator|Earth's circumference]] around 240 BC, using knowledge of the angle of [[Solar elevation angle|elevation]] of the [[Sun]] at noon on the [[summer solstice]] in Alexandria and on [[Elephantine]] Island near [[Syene]] (modern [[Aswan]], Egypt).

Eratosthenes believed there was good and bad in every nation and criticized [[Aristotle]] for arguing that humanity was divided into Greeks and [[barbarian]]s, and that the Greeks should keep themselves racially pure.&lt;ref&gt;* p439 Vol. 1 William Woodthorpe Tarn ''Alexander the Great''. Vol. I, ''Narrative''; Vol. II, ''Sources and Studies0''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1948. (New ed., 2002 (paperback, {{ISBN|0-521-53137-3}})).&lt;/ref&gt; As he aged he contracted [[ophthalmia]], becoming blind around 195 BC. Losing the ability to read and to observe nature plagued and depressed him, leading him to voluntarily starve himself to death. He died in 194&amp;nbsp;BC at 82 in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ellen. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene." Eratosthenes Of Cyrene (January 2006): 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sunbeams shown as two rays hitting the ground at Syene and Alexandria. Angle of sunbeam and the gnomons (vertical pole) is shown at Alexandria, which allowed Eratosthenes' estimates of radius and circumference of Earth.]]

Eratosthenes calculated the [[Earth's circumference]] without leaving Egypt. He knew that at [[Noon#Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer solstice in [[Syene]] (modern [[Aswan]], Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene is at latitude 24°05′ North, near to the [[Tropic of Cancer]], which was 23°42′ North in 100 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FruHOlKlbJAC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Tropic+of+Cancer%22+BC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tropic+of+Cancer%22+BC&amp;f=false|title=Story of the Delhi Iron Pillar|first=R.|last=Balasubramaniam|date=10 August 2017|publisher=Foundation Books|via=Google Books|isbn=9788175962781}}&lt;/ref&gt;) He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water. He then measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon in Alexandria by using a vertical rod, known as a [[gnomon]], and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eg.bucknell.edu/physics/astronomy/astr101/specials/eratosthenes.html|title=Astronomy 101 Specials: Eratosthenes and the Size of the Earth|website=www.eg.bucknell.edu|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the length of the rod, and the length of the shadow, as the legs of a triangle, he calculated the angle of the sun's rays.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This turned out to be about 7°, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene, he concluded that the Earth's circumference was fifty times that distance.

His knowledge of the size of Egypt was founded on the work of many generations of [[surveying]] trips. Pharaonic bookkeepers gave a distance between Syene and Alexandria of 5,000 stadia (a figure that was checked yearly).&lt;ref name="stade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/eratosthenes-and-the-mystery-of-the-stades-how-long-is-a-stade|title=Eratosthenes and the Mystery of the Stades – How Long Is a Stade? – Mathematical Association of America|website=www.maa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians say that the distance was corroborated by inquiring about the time that it took to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel. Some claim Eratosthenes used the Olympic stade of 176.4 m, which would imply a circumference of 44,100&amp;nbsp;km, an error of 10%,&lt;ref name="stade" /&gt; but the 184.8 m Italian stade became (300 years later) the most commonly accepted value for the length of the stade,&lt;ref name="stade" /&gt; which implies a circumference of 46,100&amp;nbsp;km, an error of 15%.&lt;ref name="stade" /&gt; He made five important assumptions (none of which is perfectly accurate):&lt;ref name="stade" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthonybloggeneral.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/eratosthenes-earth-circumference/|title=How did Eratosthenes measure the circumference of the earth?|date=3 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# That the distance between Alexandria and Syene was 5000 stadia,
# That Alexandria is due north of Syene
# That Syene is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]]
# That the Earth is a perfect sphere.
# That light rays emanating from the Sun are parallel.

Eratosthenes later rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia, likely for reasons of calculation simplicity as the larger number is evenly divisible by 60.&lt;ref name="stade" /&gt; In 2012, Anthony Abreu Mora repeated Eratosthenes's calculation with more accurate data; the result was 40,074&amp;nbsp;km, which is 66&amp;nbsp;km different (0.16%) from the currently accepted polar [[Earth radius|circumference of the Earth]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Seventeen hundred years after Eratosthenes's death, while [[Christopher Columbus]] studied what Eratosthenes had written about the size of the Earth, he chose to believe, based on a map by [[Toscanelli]], that the Earth's circumference was one-third smaller. Had Columbus set sail knowing that Eratosthenes's larger circumference value was more accurate, he would have known that the place that he made landfall was not Asia, but rather the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;Gow, Mary.

{{see also|History of geodesy|history of longitude}}
Eratosthenes now continued from his knowledge about the Earth. Using his discoveries and knowledge of its size and shape, he began to sketch it. In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books, which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sir William. "Eratosthenes", in ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Library, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his three-volume work ''Geography'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Geographika|script=Latn}}), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones:&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Terry R. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene." in ''Encyclopedia Of The Ancient World''. November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; two freezing zones around the poles, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;2011. "Eratosthenes." Hutchinson's Biography Database 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He had invented geography. He created terminology that is still used today. He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was now possible to estimate one's distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the ''Geography'' the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown: this had never been achieved before.&lt;ref name="Roller, Duane W 2010"/&gt;  Unfortunately, his ''Geography'' has been lost to history, {{how|date=September 2017}} but fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Polybius]], [[Strabo]], and [[Marcianus]].

* The first book was something of an introduction and gave a review of his predecessors, recognizing their contributions that he compiled in the library. In this book Eratosthenes denounced [[Homer]] as not providing any insight into what he now described as geography. His disapproval of Homer's topography angered many who believed the world depicted in the Odyssey to be legitimate.&lt;ref name="Chambers, James T 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eckerman, Chris. Review of (D.W.) Roller 'Eratosthenes' Geography. Fragments Collected and Translated, with Commentary and Additional Material. The Classical Review. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He also commented on the ideas of the nature and origin of the Earth: he had thought of Earth as an immovable globe; while on its surface was a place that was changing. He had hypothesized that at one time the [[Mediterranean]] was a vast lake that covered the countries that surrounded it; and had only become connected to the ocean to the west when a passage had opened up sometime in its history.
* In the second book is his discovery about the circumference of the Earth. This is where, according to Pliny, "The world was grasped." Eratosthenes described his famous story of the well in Syene, described above. This book would now be considered a text on [[mathematical geography]].
* His third book of the ''Geography'' contained [[political geography]]. He cited countries and used parallel lines to divide the map into sections, to give accurate descriptions of the realms. This was a breakthrough, and can be considered the beginning of geography.&lt;ref name=Smith2005&gt;Smith, Sir William. "Eratosthenes," in A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.

==  Achievements ==

Eratosthenes was described by the [[Suda Lexicon]] as a Πένταθλος (Pentathlos) which can be translated as "All-Rounder", for he was skilled in a variety of things: He was a true polymath. He was nicknamed Beta because he was great at many things and tried to get his hands on every bit of information but never achieved the highest rank in anything; [[Strabo]] accounts Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers and a geographer among mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;Dicks, D.R. "Eratosthenes," in Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Preparatio Evangelica]]'' includes a brief chapter of three sentences on celestial distances ([http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15.htm Book XV], Chapter 53). He states simply that Eratosthenes found the distance to the Sun to be "{{lang|grc|σταδίων μυριάδας τετρακοσίας καὶ ὀκτωκισμυρίας}}" (literally "of [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] [[myriad]]s 400 and 80,000") and the distance to the Moon to be 780,000 stadia. The expression for the distance to the Sun has been translated either as 4,080,000 stadia (1903 translation by E. H. Gifford), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of Edouard des Places, dated 1974–1991). The meaning depends on whether Eusebius meant 400 myriad plus 80,000 or "400 and 80,000" myriad. With a stade of 185 m, 804,000,000 stadia is 149,000,000&amp;nbsp;km, approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
* Eratosthenes also calculated the Sun's diameter. According to Macrobious, Eratosthenes made the diameter of the Sun to be about 27 times that of the Earth.&lt;ref name=Smith2005/&gt; The actual figure is approximately 109 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/5-How-large-is-the-Sun-compared-to-Earth-|title=Ask an Astronomer|website=Cool Cosmos|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730214334/http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/5-How-large-is-the-Sun-compared-to-Earth-|archivedate=2014-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During his time at the Library of Alexandria, Eratosthenes devised a calendar using his predictions about the [[ecliptic]] of the Earth. He calculated that there are 365 days in a year and that every fourth year there would be 366 days.&lt;ref&gt;Greek Scholar's Work Shows Usefulness of Measurement." Manawatu Standard, June 19, 2012., 07, Newspaper Source Plus&lt;/ref&gt;
* He was also very proud of his solution for [[Doubling the Cube]]. His motivation was that he wanted to produce catapults. Eratosthenes constructed a mechanical line drawing device to calculate the cube, called the mesolabio. He dedicated his solution to King Ptolemy, presenting a model in bronze with it a letter and an epigram.&lt;ref&gt;Zhumud, Leonid. Plato as "Architect of Science". in ''Phonesis''. Vol. 43 (3) 1998. 211–244.&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes was Eratosthenes' friend and he, too, worked on the war instrument with mathematics. Archimedes dedicated his book ''The Method'' to Eratosthenes, knowing his love for learning and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Chondros, Thomas G. Archimedes Life Works and Machines. in ''Mechanism and Machine Theory''. Vol.45(11) 2010. 1766–1775.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sieve of Eratosthenes|primality test}}

Eratosthenes proposed a simple [[algorithm]] for finding [[prime numbers]]. This algorithm is known in mathematics as the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]].

In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους), one of a number of [[Generating primes#Prime sieves|prime number sieves]], is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, ''i.e.'', not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.

== Works ==

Eratosthenes was one of the most pre-eminent scholarly figures of his time, and produced works covering a vast area of knowledge before and during his time at the Library. He wrote on many topics&amp;nbsp;— geography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary criticism, grammar, poetry, and even old comedies. Unfortunately, there are only fragments left of his works after the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=Dicks1971&gt;Dicks, D.R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16045">'''Ewald summation''', named after [[Paul Peter Ewald]], is a method for computing long-range interactions (e.g., [[electrostatic interaction]]s) in periodic systems. It was first developed as the method for calculating electrostatic energies of [[ionic crystal]]s, and is now commonly used for calculating long-range interactions in [[computational chemistry]]. Ewald summation is a special case of the [[Poisson summation formula]], replacing the summation of interaction energies in real space with an equivalent summation in [[Fourier space]]. In this method, the long-range interaction is divided into two parts: a short-range contribution, and a long-range contribution which does not have a [[singularity (mathematics)|singularity]]. The short-range contribution is calculated in real space, whereas the long-range contribution is calculated using a [[Fourier transform]]. The advantage of this method is the rapid [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of the energy compared with that of a direct summation. This means that the method has high accuracy and reasonable speed when computing long-range interactions, and it is thus the de facto standard method for calculating long-range interactions in periodic systems. The method requires charge neutrality of the molecular system in order to calculate accurately the total Coulombic interaction. A study of the truncation errors introduced in the energy and force calculations of disordered point-charge systems is provided by Kolafa and Perram.&lt;ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Ewald summation rewrites the interaction potential as the sum of two terms,

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \varphi_{sr}(\mathbf{r}) + \varphi_{\ell r}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{sr}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; represents the short-range term whose sum quickly converges in real space and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\ell r}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; represents the long-range term whose sum quickly converges in Fourier (reciprocal) space.  The long-ranged part should be finite for all arguments (most notably ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) but may have any convenient mathematical form, most typically a [[Gaussian distribution]]. The method assumes that the short-range part can be summed easily; hence, the problem becomes the summation of the long-range term. Due to the use of the Fourier sum, the method implicitly assumes that the system under study is infinitely [[Periodic boundary conditions|periodic]] (a sensible assumption for the interiors of crystals). One repeating unit of this hypothetical periodic system is called a ''unit cell''. One such cell is chosen as the "central cell" for reference and the remaining cells are called ''images''.

The long-range interaction energy is the sum of interaction energies between the charges of a central unit cell and all the charges of the lattice.   Hence, it can be represented as a ''double'' integral over two charge density fields representing the fields of the unit cell and the crystal lattice

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{\ell r} = \iint d\mathbf{r}\, d\mathbf{r}^\prime\, \rho_\text{TOT}(\mathbf{r}) \rho_{uc}(\mathbf{r}^\prime) \ \varphi_{\ell r}(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^\prime)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the unit-cell charge density field &lt;math&gt;\rho_{uc}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is a sum over the positions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_k&lt;/math&gt; of the charges &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; in the central unit cell

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{uc}(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sum_{\mathrm{charges}\ k} q_k \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_k)
&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''total'' charge density field &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{TOT}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is the same sum over the unit-cell charges &lt;math&gt;q_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and their periodic images

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_\text{TOT}(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sum_{n_1, n_2, n_3} \sum_{\mathrm{charges}\ k} 
q_k \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_k - n_1 \mathbf{a}_1  - n_2 \mathbf{a}_2  - n_3 \mathbf{a}_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_3&lt;/math&gt; are the lattice vectors and &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt; range over all integers.  The total field &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{TOT}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as a [[convolution]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho_{uc}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; with a ''lattice function'' &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sum_{n_1, n_2, n_3}
\delta(\mathbf{r} - n_1 \mathbf{a}_{1}  - n_{2} \mathbf{a}_2  - n_3 \mathbf{a}_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is a [[convolution]], the [[Fourier transformation]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{TOT}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is a product

:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{\rho}_\text{TOT}(\mathbf{k}) = \tilde{L}(\mathbf{k}) \tilde{\rho}_{uc}(\mathbf{k})
&lt;/math&gt;

where the Fourier transform of the lattice function is another sum over delta functions

:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{L}(\mathbf{k}) = 
\frac{\left(2\pi \right)^{3}}{\Omega} \sum_{m_1, m_2, m_3}
\delta(\mathbf{k} - m_1 \mathbf{b}_1  - m_2 \mathbf{b}_2  - m_3 \mathbf{b}_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the reciprocal space vectors are defined &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_{1} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\mathbf{a}_{2} \times \mathbf{a}_{3}}{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; (and cyclic permutations) where &lt;math&gt;\Omega \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathbf{a}_{1} \cdot \left( \mathbf{a}_{2} \times \mathbf{a}_{3} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the central unit cell (if it is geometrically a [[parallelepiped]], which is often but not necessarily the case).  Note that both &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{L}(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; are real, even functions.

For brevity, define an effective single-particle potential

:&lt;math&gt;
v(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int d\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\, \rho_{uc}(\mathbf{r}^\prime) \ \varphi_{\ell r}(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^\prime)
&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is also a convolution, the Fourier transformation of the same equation is a product

:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{V}(\mathbf{k}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \tilde{\rho}_{uc}(\mathbf{k}) \tilde{\Phi}(\mathbf{k})
&lt;/math&gt;

where the Fourier transform is defined

:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{V}(\mathbf{k}) = \int d\mathbf{r} \ v(\mathbf{r}) \ e^{-i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The energy can now be written as a ''single'' field integral

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{\ell r} = \int d\mathbf{r} \ \rho_\text{TOT}(\mathbf{r}) \ v(\mathbf{r}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Parseval's theorem]], the energy can also be summed in Fourier space

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{\ell r} = 
\int \frac{d\mathbf{k}}{\left(2\pi\right)^3} \ \tilde{\rho}_\text{TOT}^*(\mathbf{k}) \tilde{V}(\mathbf{k}) = 
\int \frac{d\mathbf{k}}{\left(2\pi\right)^3} \tilde{L}^*(\mathbf{k}) \left| \tilde{\rho}_{uc}(\mathbf{k})\right|^2 \tilde{\Phi}(\mathbf{k}) = 
\frac{1}{\Omega} \sum_{m_1, m_2, m_3}  \left| \tilde{\rho}_{uc}(\mathbf{k})\right|^2 \tilde{\Phi}(\mathbf{k})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = m_1 \mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{b}_2 + m_3 \mathbf{b}_3&lt;/math&gt;
in the final summation.

This is the essential result.  Once &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\rho}_{uc}(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; is calculated, the summation/integration over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; is straightforward and should converge quickly. The most common reason for lack of convergence is a poorly defined unit cell, which must be charge neutral to avoid infinite sums.

==Particle mesh Ewald (PME) method==

Ewald summation was developed as a method in [[theoretical physics]], long before the advent of [[computer]]s.  However, the Ewald method has enjoyed widespread use since the 1970s in [[computer simulation]]s of particle systems, especially those whose particles interact via an [[inverse square law|inverse square]] [[force]] law such as [[gravity]] or [[electrostatics]]. Recently, PME has also been used to calculate the &lt;math&gt;r^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; part of the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] in order to eliminate artifacts due to truncation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Di Pierro |first=M. |last2=Elber |first2=R. | last3=Leimkuhler |first3=B. |     title=A Stochastic Algorithm for the Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble with Ewald Summations for all Long Range Forces. | journal=[[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation]] | year=2015| doi=10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00648|pmc=4890727 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Applications include simulations of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[molecules]].

In the particle mesh method, just as in standard Ewald summation, the generic interaction potential is separated into two terms
&lt;math&gt;\varphi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \varphi_{sr}(\mathbf{r}) + \varphi_{\ell r}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;.  The basic idea of particle mesh Ewald summation is to replace the direct summation of interaction energies between point particles

:&lt;math&gt;
E_\text{TOT} = \sum_{i,j} \varphi(\mathbf{r}_{j} - \mathbf{r}_i) = E_{sr} + E_{\ell r}
&lt;/math&gt;

with two summations, a direct sum &lt;math&gt;E_{sr}&lt;/math&gt; of the short-ranged potential in real space

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{sr} = \sum_{i,j} \varphi_{sr}(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

(that is the '''particle''' part of '''particle mesh Ewald''') and a summation in Fourier space of the long-ranged
part

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{\ell r} = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \tilde{\Phi}_{\ell r}(\mathbf{k}) \left| \tilde{\rho}(\mathbf{k}) \right|^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Phi}_{\ell r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\rho}(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[Fourier transform]]s of the [[potential]] and the [[charge density]] (that's the '''Ewald''' part).  Since both summations converge quickly in their respective spaces (real and Fourier), they may be truncated with little loss of accuracy and great improvement in required computational time.  To evaluate the Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\rho}(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; of the charge density field efficiently, one uses the [[Fast Fourier transform]], which requires that the density field be evaluated on a discrete lattice in space (that's the '''mesh''' part).

Due to the periodicity assumption implicit in Ewald summation, applications of the PME method to physical systems require the imposition of periodic symmetry. Thus, the method is best suited to systems that can be simulated as infinite in spatial extent. In [[molecular dynamics]] simulations this is normally accomplished by deliberately constructing a charge-neutral unit cell that can be infinitely "tiled" to form images; however, to properly account for the effects of this approximation, these images are reincorporated back into the original simulation cell. The overall effect is called a [[periodic boundary conditions|periodic boundary condition]]. To visualize this most clearly, think of a unit cube; the upper face is effectively in contact with the lower face, the right with the left face, and the front with the back face. As a result, the unit cell size must be carefully chosen to be large enough to avoid improper motion correlations between two faces "in contact", but still small enough to be computationally feasible. The definition of the cutoff between short- and long-range interactions can also introduce artifacts.

The restriction of the density field to a mesh makes the PME method more efficient for systems with "smooth" variations in density, or continuous potential functions.  Localized systems or those with large fluctuations in density may be treated more efficiently with the [[fast multipole method]] of Greengard and Rokhlin.

==Dipole term==

The electrostatic energy of a polar crystal (i.e., a crystal with a net dipole &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_{uc}&lt;/math&gt; in the unit cell) is [[conditionally convergent]], i.e., depends on the order of the summation.  For example, if the dipole-dipole interactions of a central unit cell with unit cells located on an ever-increasing cube, the energy converges to a different value than if the interaction energies had been summed spherically.  Roughly speaking, this conditional convergence arises because (1) the number of interacting dipoles on a shell of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; grows like &lt;math&gt;R^{2}&lt;/math&gt;; (2) the strength of a single dipole-dipole interaction falls like &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;; and (3) the mathematical summation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

This somewhat surprising result can be reconciled with the finite energy of real crystals because such crystals are not infinite, i.e., have a particular boundary.  More specifically, the boundary of a polar 
crystal has an effective surface charge density on its surface &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \mathbf{P} \cdot \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface normal vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; represents the net dipole moment per volume. The interaction energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the dipole in a central unit cell with that surface charge density can be written&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herce|first1=HD|last2=Garcia|first2=AE|last3=Darden|first3=T|title=The electrostatic surface term: (I) periodic systems.|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=28 March 2007|volume=126|issue=12|page=124106|pmid=17411107|doi=10.1063/1.2714527|bibcode = 2007JChPh.126l4106H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
U = \frac{1}{2V_{uc}} \int  
\frac{\left( \mathbf{p}_{uc}\cdot \mathbf{r} \right) 
\left( \mathbf{p}_{uc} \cdot \mathbf{n} \right)dS}{r^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_{uc}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{uc}&lt;/math&gt; are the net dipole moment and volume of the unit cell, &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal area on the crystal surface and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
is the vector from the central unit cell to the infinitesimal area. This formula results from integrating the energy &lt;math&gt; dU = -\mathbf{p}_{uc} \cdot \mathbf{dE}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; represents the infinitesimal electric field generated by an infinitesimal surface charge &lt;math&gt;dq \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sigma dS&lt;/math&gt; ([[Coulomb's law]])

:&lt;math&gt;
d\mathbf{E} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\left( \frac{-1}{4\pi\epsilon} \right) \frac{dq \ \mathbf{r}}{r^3} = 
\left( \frac{-1}{4\pi\epsilon} \right) 
\frac{\sigma\, dS \ \mathbf{r} }{r^3}
&lt;/math&gt;
The negative sign derives from the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, which points towards the charge, not away from it.

==History==

The Ewald summation was developed by [[Paul Peter Ewald]] in 1921 (see References below) to determine the electrostatic energy (and, hence, the [[Madelung constant]]) of ionic crystals.

==Scaling==
Generally different Ewald summation methods give different [[time complexity|time complexities]]. Direct calculation gives &lt;math&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of atoms in the system.  The PME method gives &lt;math&gt;O(N\,\log N)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Darden1993"&gt;J. Chem. Phys. 98, 10089 (1993); {{doi|10.1063/1.464397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22389">'''Fractal compression''' is a [[lossy compression]] method for [[digital image]]s, based on [[fractal]]s. The method is best suited for textures and natural images, relying on the fact that parts of an image often resemble other parts of the same image.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Fractal [[algorithms]] convert these parts into mathematical data called "fractal codes" which are used to recreate the encoded image.

==Iterated function systems==
{{Main|Iterated function system}}

Fractal image representation may be described mathematically as an [[iterated function system]] (IFS).&lt;ref name = "SIGGRAPH'92"/&gt;

===For binary images===
We begin with the representation of a [[binary image]], where the image may be thought of as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. An IFS is a set of [[contraction mapping]]s ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''ƒ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt;f_i:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

According to these mapping functions, the IFS describes a two-dimensional set ''S'' as the fixed point of the [[Hutchinson operator]]

:&lt;math&gt;H(A)=\bigcup_{i=1}^N f_i(A), \quad A \subset \mathbb{R}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''H'' is an operator mapping sets to sets, and ''S'' is the unique set satisfying ''H''(''S'') = ''S''. The idea is to construct the IFS such that this set ''S'' is the input binary image. The set ''S'' can be recovered from the IFS by [[fixed point iteration]]: for any nonempty [[compact space|compact]] initial set ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the iteration ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''H''(''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges to ''S''.

The set ''S'' is self-similar because ''H''(''S'') = ''S'' implies that ''S'' is a union of mapped copies of itself:
:&lt;math&gt;S=f_1(S)\cup f_2(S) \cup\cdots\cup f_N(S)&lt;/math&gt;
So we see the IFS is a fractal representation of ''S''.

===Extension to grayscale===
IFS representation can be extended to a [[grayscale|grayscale image]] by considering the image's [[graph of a function|graph]] as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. For a grayscale image ''u''(''x'',''y''), consider the set
''S'' = {(''x'',''y'',''u''(''x'',''y''))}. Then similar to the binary case, ''S'' is described by an IFS using a set of contraction mappings ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''ƒ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'', but in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;f_i:\mathbb{R}^3\to \mathbb{R}^3.&lt;/math&gt;

===Encoding===
A challenging problem of ongoing research in fractal image representation is how to choose the ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''ƒ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that its fixed point approximates the input image, and how to do this efficiently.

A simple approach&lt;ref name = "SIGGRAPH'92"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for doing so is the following partitioned iterated function system (PIFS):

# Partition the image domain into range blocks ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of size ''s''×''s''.
# For each ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', search the image to find a block ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of size 2''s''×2''s'' that is very similar to ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
# Select the mapping functions such that ''H''(''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')&amp;nbsp;= ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each ''i''.

In the second step, it is important to find a similar block so that the IFS accurately represents the input image, so a sufficient number of candidate blocks for ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' need to be considered. On the other hand, a large search considering many blocks is computationally costly. 
This bottleneck of searching for similar blocks is why PIFS fractal encoding is much slower than for example [[discrete cosine transform|DCT]] and [[wavelet]] based image representation.

The initial square partitioning and brute-force search algorithm presented by Jacquin provides a starting point for further research and extensions in many possible directions -- different ways of partitioning the image into range blocks of various sizes and shapes; fast techniques for quickly finding a close-enough matching domain block for each range block rather than brute-force searching, such as fast [[motion estimation]] algorithms; different ways of encoding the mapping from the domain block to the range block; etc.&lt;ref&gt;

Other researchers attempt to find algorithms to automatically encode an arbitrary image as RIFS (recurrent iterated function systems) or global IFS, rather than PIFS; and algorithms for fractal video compression including [[motion compensation]] and three dimensional iterated function systems.&lt;ref name="lacroix" &gt;

==Features==
With fractal compression, encoding is extremely computationally expensive because of the search used to find the self-similarities. Decoding, however, is quite fast. While this asymmetry has so far made it impractical for real time applications, when video is archived for distribution from disk storage or file downloads fractal compression becomes more competitive.&lt;ref name="Jenson"&gt;{{Citation

Compression efficiency increases with higher image complexity and color depth, compared to simple [[grayscale]] images.

===Resolution independence and fractal scaling===
An inherent feature of fractal compression is that images become resolution independent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byte.com/art/9701/sec12/art1.htm Walking, Talking Web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106202236/http://www.byte.com/art/9701/sec12/art1.htm |date=2008-01-06 }} Byte Magazine article on fractal compression/resolution independence&lt;/ref&gt; after being converted to fractal code. This is because the iterated function systems in the compressed file scale indefinitely. This indefinite scaling property of a fractal is known as "fractal scaling".

===Fractal interpolation===
The resolution independence of a fractal-encoded image can be used to increase the display resolution of an image. This process is also known as "fractal interpolation". In fractal interpolation, an image is encoded into fractal codes via fractal compression, and subsequently decompressed at a higher resolution. The result is an up-sampled image in which iterated function systems have been used as the [[interpolant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TJ4-4J4B95D-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=2f639f75d0ef4078bac00cf994fbedfd Interpolation decoding method with variable parameters for fractal image compression] College of Mathematics and Physics, Chongqing University, China&lt;/ref&gt;
Fractal interpolation maintains geometric detail very well compared to traditional interpolation methods like [[bilinear interpolation]] and [[bicubic interpolation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/GetArticle.aspx?doi=10.1155/JIA/2006/78734 Smooth fractal interpolation] Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad de Zaragoza, Campus Plaza de San Francisco, Zaragoza, Spain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200310/000020031003A0228183.php A Note on Expansion Technique for Self-Affine Fractal Objects Using Extended Fractal Interpolation Functions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101235706/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200310/000020031003A0228183.php |date=2011-01-01 }} Hokkaido Univ., Graduate School of Engineering, JPN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200214/000020021402A0392249.php Studies on Scaling Factor for Fractal Image Coding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127132016/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200214/000020021402A0392249.php |date=2008-01-27 }} Nagasaki University, Faculty of Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; Since the interpolation cannot reverse Shannon entropy however, it ends up sharpening the image by adding random instead of meaningful detail. One cannot, for example, enlarge an image of a crowd where each person's face is one or two pixels and hope to identify them.

==History==
[[Michael Barnsley]] led development of fractal compression in 1987, and was granted several [[patent]]s on the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4941193}}{{snd}} Barnsley and Sloan's first [[iterated function system]] patent, filed in October 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely known practical fractal compression algorithm was invented by Barnsley and Alan Sloan. Barnsley's graduate student Arnaud Jacquin implemented the first automatic algorithm in software in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/tech-reports/95-05.ps Using Fractal Coding to Index Image Content for a Digital Library] Tech report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud E. Jacquin. Image Coding Based on a Fractal Theory of Iterated Contractive Image Transformations. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 1(1), 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; All methods are based on the [[fractal transform]] using [[iterated function system]]s.

A major breakthrough for Iterated Systems Inc. was the automatic fractal transform process which eliminated the need for human intervention during compression as was the case in early experimentation with fractal compression technology. In 1992, Iterated Systems Inc. received a US$2.1 million government grant&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atp.nist.gov/eao/sp950-3/info_tech.pdf NIST SP950-3, "Capturing and Integrating Patient Healthcare Information to Improve Accessibility"; see page 36, "MediaBin Fractal-Based Technology to Compress Digital Image Files"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175932/http://www.atp.nist.gov/eao/sp950-3/info_tech.pdf |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a prototype digital image storage and decompression chip using fractal transform image compression technology.

To date the most successful use of still fractal image compression is by [[Microsoft]] in its [[Encarta]] multimedia encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaware.org/mam/98/articles/theme.essay.html|title=MAW 1998: Theme Essay|author=|date=|website=www.mathaware.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also under license.

Iterated Systems Inc. supplied a shareware encoder (Fractal Imager), a stand-alone decoder, a Netscape plug-in decoder and a development package for use under Windows. As [[Wavelet compression|wavelet-based methods]] of image compression improved and were more easily licensed by commercial software vendors the adoption of the Fractal Image Format failed to evolve.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The redistribution of the "decompressor DLL" provided by the ColorBox III SDK was governed by restrictive per-disk or year-by-year licensing regimes for proprietary software vendors and by a discretionary scheme that entailed the promotion of the Iterated Systems products for certain classes of other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The big squeeze | last=Aitken | first=William | journal=Personal Computer World |date=May 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s Iterated Systems Inc. and its partners expended considerable resources to bring fractal compression to video. While compression results were promising, computer hardware of that time lacked the processing power for fractal video compression to be practical beyond a few select usages. Up to 15 hours were required to compress a single minute of video.

ClearVideo{{snd}} also known as [[RealVideo]] (Fractal){{snd}} and SoftVideo were early fractal video compression products. ClearFusion was Iterated's freely distributed streaming video plugin for web browsers. In 1994 SoftVideo was licensed to [[Spectrum Holobyte]] for use in its [[CD-ROM]] games including Falcon Gold and [[Star Trek: The Next Generation A Final Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startrekgames.cz/downloads/fu_manual_cz.pdf 1994 Manual] specifying on page 11 SoftVideo under license to Spectrum Holobyte&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Iterated Systems Inc. announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_Oct_29/ai_18810482/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120708114422/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_Oct_29/ai_18810482/|deadurl=yes|title=Mitsubishi Corporation Inks Agreement With Iterated Systems - Busines…|author=|date=8 July 2012|archivedate=8 July 2012|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alliance with the [[Mitsubishi]] Corporation to market ClearVideo to their Japanese customers. The original ClearVideo 1.2 decoder driver is still supported&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291948/en-us Microsoft ClearVideo support]&lt;/ref&gt; by Microsoft in [[Windows Media Player]] although the encoder is no longer supported.

Two firms, Total Multimedia Inc. and Dimension, both claim to own or have the exclusive licence to Iterated's video technology, but neither has yet released a working product. The technology basis appears to be Dimension's U.S. patents 8639053 and 8351509, which have been considerably analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paulschlessinger.wordpress.com/2014/04|title=April - 2014 - Due Diligence Study of Fractal Video Technology|author=|date=|website=paulschlessinger.wordpress.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, it is a simple quadtree block-copying system with neither the bandwidth efficiency nor PSNR quality of traditional DCT-based codecs. In January 2016, TMMI announced that it was abandoning fractal-based technology altogether.

Numerous research papers have been published during the past few years discussing possible solutions to improve fractal algorithms and encoding hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=261439.261444|title=Advances in fractal compression for multimedia applications|first=John|last=Kominek|date=1 July 1997|publisher=|journal=Multimedia Systems|volume=5|issue=4|pages=255–270|accessdate=18 April 2018|via=dl.acm.org|doi=10.1007/s005300050059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1380599|title=Refdoc|author=|date=|website=cat.inist.fr|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4289976|title=Fractal image compression performance synthesis through HV partitioning - IEEE Conference Publication|author=|date=|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actapress.com/PaperInfo.aspx?PaperID=13701&amp;reason=500 Simple and Fast Fractal Image Compression] Circuits, Signals, and Systems - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V2M-4M7VB17-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=890409343ad7b639e855141c44d174fb Schema genetic algorithm for fractal image compression] Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yet-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V25-4H27BX7-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=faf77464c176654cb1f27e29ef6e4077 A fast fractal image encoding method based on intelligent search of standard deviation] Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Alabama&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=OPEGAR000044000010107002000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes Novel fractal image-encoding algorithm based on a full-binary-tree searchless iterated function system]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Alabama&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000SPIE.4122..190T Fast classification method for fractal image compression] Proc.

In [[group theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Frattini's argument''' is an important [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] in the structure theory of [[finite group]]s.  It is named after [[Giovanni Frattini]], who used it in a paper from 1885 when defining the [[Frattini subgroup]] of a group. The argument was taken by Frattini, as he himself admits, from a paper of [[Alfredo Capelli]] dated 1884.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brescia, F. de Giovanni, M. Trombetti, [http://www.advgrouptheory.com/journal/Volumes/3/M.%20Brescia,%20F.%20de%20Giovanni,%20M.%20Trombetti%20-%20The%20true%20story%20behind%20Frattinis%20Argument.pdf "The True Story Behind Frattini’s Argument"], ''[[Advances in Group Theory and Applications]]'' '''3''', [https://doi.org/10.4399/97888255036928 doi:10.4399/97888255036928]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frattini's Argument==
===Statement===

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a finite group with normal subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Sylow p-subgroup|Sylow ''p''-subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;G = N_{G}(P)H&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_{G}(P)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[centralizer and normalizer|normalizer]] of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_{G}(P)H&lt;/math&gt; means the [[product of group subsets]].

===Proof===
The group &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a Sylow &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, so every Sylow &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;-conjugate of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, that is, it is of the form  &lt;math&gt;h^{-1}Ph&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;h \in H&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Sylow theorems]]).  Let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the subgroup  &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}Pg&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}Pg&lt;/math&gt; is a Sylow &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by the above, it must be &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;-conjugate to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;: that is, for some &lt;math&gt;h \in H&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^{-1}Pg = h^{-1}Ph&lt;/math&gt;,

and so
  
:&lt;math&gt;hg^{-1}Pgh^{-1} = P&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;gh^{-1} \in N_{G}(P)&lt;/math&gt;,

and therefore &lt;math&gt;g \in N_{G}(P)H&lt;/math&gt;. But &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt; was arbitrary, and so &lt;math&gt;G = HN_G(P) = N_G(P)H. \,\, \square &lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
* Frattini's argument can be used as part of a proof that any finite [[nilpotent group]] is a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of its Sylow subgroups.
* By applying Frattini's argument to &lt;math&gt;N_G(N_G(P))&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;N_G(N_G(P)) = N_G(P)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a finite group and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a Sylow &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally, if a subgroup &lt;math&gt;M  \leq G&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;N_G(P)&lt;/math&gt; for some Sylow &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroup &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is self-normalizing, i.e. &lt;math&gt;M = N_G(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">In [[algebra]], the '''Gelfand–Kirillov dimension''' (or '''GK dimension''') of a [[right module]] ''M'' over a [[K-algebra|''k''-algebra]] ''A'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GKdim} = \sup_{V, M_0} \limsup_{n \to \infty} \log_n \dim_k M_0 V^n&lt;/math&gt;

where the sup is taken over all finite-dimensional [[Linear subspace|subspace]]s &lt;math&gt;V \subset A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_0 \subset M&lt;/math&gt;.

An algebra is said to have polynomial growth if its Gelfand–Kirillov dimension is finite.

== Basic facts ==
*The Gelfand–Kirillov dimension of a finitely generated commutative algebra ''A'' over a field is the [[Krull dimension]] of ''A'' (or equivalently the transcendence degree of the field of fractions of ''A'' over the base field.)
*In particular, the GK dimension of the polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;k[x_1, \dots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; Is ''n''.
*(Warfield) For any real number ''r ''≥ 2, there exists a finitely generated algebra whose GK dimension is ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artin|1999|loc=Theorem VI.2.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the theory of D-Modules ==

Given a right module ''M'' over the [[Weyl algebra]] &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;, the Gelfand–Kirillov dimension of ''M'' over the Weyl algebra coincides with the dimension of ''M'', which is by definition the degree of the [[Hilbert polynomial]] of ''M''. This enables to prove additivity in [[short exact sequence]]s for the Gelfand–Kirillov dimension and finally to prove [[Weyl algebra#Properties of the Weyl algebra|Bernstein's inequality]], which states that the dimension of ''M'' must be at least ''n''. This leads to the definition of [[D-module|holonomic D-Module]]s as those with the minimal dimension ''n'', and these modules play a great role in the [[geometric Langlands program]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3287">The '''graph realization problem''' is a [[decision problem]] in [[graph theory]]. Given a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;(d_1,\dots,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers, the problem asks whether there is labeled [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|simple graph]] such that &lt;math&gt;(d_1,\dots,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[degree sequence]] of this graph.

==Solutions==
The problem can be solved in [[polynomial time]]. One method of showing this uses the [[Havel–Hakimi algorithm]] constructing a special solution with the use of a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Other notations==
The problem can also be stated in terms of [[symmetric matrix|symmetric matrices]] of zeros and ones. The connection can be seen if one realizes that each graph has an [[adjacency matrix]] where the column sums and row sums correspond to &lt;math&gt;(d_1,\ldots,d_n)&lt;/math&gt;. The problem is then sometimes denoted by ''symmetric 0-1-matrices for given row sums''.

==Related problems==
Similar problems describe the [[bipartite graph|degree sequence]]s of [[bipartite graph|simple bipartite graphs]] or the [[directed graph|degree sequence]]s of [[directed graph|simple directed graphs]]. The first problem is the so-called [[bipartite realization problem]]. The second is known as the [[digraph realization problem]].

The problem of constructing a solution for the graph realization problem with the additional constraint that each such solution comes with the same probability was shown to have a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] for the degree sequences of [[regular graph]]s by Cooper et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26421">In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''Haar measure''' assigns an "invariant volume" to subsets of [[locally compact topological group]]s, consequently defining an [[integral]] for functions on those groups.

This [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] was introduced by [[Alfréd Haar]] in 1933,&lt;ref name="Haar"&gt;{{Citation | first = A. | last = Haar | author-link = Alfréd Haar | title = Der Massbegriff in der Theorie der kontinuierlichen Gruppen | periodical = [[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume = 34 | series = 2 | issue = 1 | year = 1933 | pages = 147–169 |jstor=1968346 | doi=10.2307/1968346}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its special case for [[Lie groups]] had been introduced by [[Adolf Hurwitz]] in 1897 under the name "invariant integral".&lt;ref&gt;I. M. James, History of Topology, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Haar measures are used in many parts of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[number theory]], [[group theory]], [[representation theory]], [[mathematical statistics|statistics]], [[probability theory]], and [[ergodic theory]].

==Preliminaries==

Let &lt;math&gt; (G, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  The  [[Sigma-algebra|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] generated by all open subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;  is called the [[Borel algebra]]. An element of the Borel algebra is called a [[Borel set]].  If &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then we define the left and right [[Coset|translates]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
* Left translate:
::&lt;math&gt; g S = \{g\cdot s\,:\,s \in S\}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Right translate:
::&lt;math&gt; S g = \{s\cdot g\,:\,s \in S\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Left and right translates map Borel sets into Borel sets.

A measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on the Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called ''left-translation-invariant'' if for all Borel subsets &lt;math&gt;S\subset G&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; one has
:&lt;math&gt; \mu(g S) = \mu(S). \quad &lt;/math&gt;
A measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on the Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called ''right-translation-invariant'' if for all Borel subsets &lt;math&gt;S\subset G&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; one has
:&lt;math&gt; \mu(S g) = \mu(S). \quad &lt;/math&gt;

==Haar's theorem==

There is, [[up to]] a positive multiplicative constant, a unique [[countably additive]], nontrivial measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on the Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following properties:

* The measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is left-translation-invariant: &lt;math&gt;\mu(gS) = \mu(S)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and all Borel sets &lt;math&gt;S\subset G&lt;/math&gt;.
* The measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is finite on every compact set: &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for all compact &lt;math&gt;K\subset G&lt;/math&gt;.
* The measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is  [[outer regular]] on Borel sets &lt;math&gt;S\subset G&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt; \mu(S) = \inf \{\mu(U): S \subseteq U, U \text{ open}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

* The measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is [[inner regular]] on open sets &lt;math&gt;U\subset G&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt; \mu(U) = \sup \{\mu(K): K \subseteq U, K \text{ compact}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such a measure on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''left Haar measure.''  It can be shown as a consequence of the above properties that &lt;math&gt;\mu(U)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for every non-empty open subset &lt;math&gt;U\subset G&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is compact then &lt;math&gt;\mu(G)&lt;/math&gt; is finite and positive, so we can uniquely specify a left Haar measure on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by adding the normalization condition &lt;math&gt;\mu(G)=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Some authors define a Haar measure on [[Baire set]]s rather than Borel sets. This makes the regularity conditions unnecessary as Baire measures are automatically regular. Halmos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halmos|first1=Paul R.|title=Measure theory|date=1950|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4684-9442-6|page=219-220}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather confusingly uses the term "Borel set" for elements of the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-ring generated by compact sets, and defines Haar measure on these sets.

The left Haar measure satisfies the inner regularity condition for all &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-finite Borel sets, but may not be inner regular for ''all'' Borel sets.  For example, the product of the unit circle (with its usual topology) and the real line with the discrete topology is a locally compact group with the product topology and Haar measure on this group is not inner regular for the closed subset &lt;math&gt;\{1\} \times [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. (Compact subsets of this vertical segment are finite sets and points have measure &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so the measure of any compact subset of this vertical segment is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. But, using outer regularity, one can show the segment has infinite measure.)

The existence and uniqueness (up to scaling) of a left Haar measure was first proven in full generality by [[André Weil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = L'intégration dans les groupes topologiques et ses applications | series = Actualités Scientifiques et Industrielles | publisher = Hermann | year = 1940 | place = Paris | volume = 869}}''&lt;/ref&gt; Weil's proof used the [[axiom of choice]] and [[Henri Cartan]] furnished a proof which avoided its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cartan | first = Henri | author-link = Henri Cartan | title = Sur la mesure de Haar | journal = [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de Paris]] | volume = 211 | pages = 759–762 | year = 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartan's proof also establishes the existence and the uniqueness simultaneously. A simplified and complete account of Cartan's argument was given by Alfsen in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Alfsen | first = E.M. | title = A simplified constructive proof of existence and uniqueness of Haar measure | journal = Math. Scand. | volume = 12 | pages = 106–116 | year = 1963 | url=http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/10675/8696}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special case of invariant measure for [[Second-countable space|second countable]] locally compact groups had been shown by Haar in 1933.&lt;ref name="Haar"/&gt;

==Construction of Haar measure==

===A construction using compact subsets===

The following method of constructing Haar measure is essentially the method used by Haar and Weil.

For any subsets &lt;math&gt;S,T\subset G&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; nonempty define &lt;math&gt;[T:S]&lt;/math&gt; to be the smallest number of left translates of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that cover &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (so this is a non-negative integer or infinity). This is not additive on compact sets &lt;math&gt;K\subset G&lt;/math&gt;, though it does have the property that &lt;math&gt;[K:U]+[L:U]=[K\cup L:U]&lt;/math&gt; for disjoint compact sets &lt;math&gt;K,L\subset G&lt;/math&gt; provided that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficiently small open neighborhood of the identity (depending on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;).  The idea of Haar measure is to take a sort of limit of &lt;math&gt;[K:U]&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller to make it additive on all pairs of disjoint compact sets, though it first has to be normalized so that the limit is not just infinity. So fix a compact set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with non-empty interior (which exists as the group is locally compact) and for a compact set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; define
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(K)=\lim_U\frac{[K:U]}{[A:U]}&lt;/math&gt;
where the limit is taken over a suitable directed set of open neighborhoods of the identity eventually contained in any given neighborhood; the existence of a directed set such that the limit exists follows using [[Tychonoff's theorem]].

The function &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt; is additive on disjoint compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that it is a regular [[content (measure theory)|content]]. From a regular content one can construct a measure by first extending  &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt; to open sets by inner regularity, then to all sets by outer regularity, and then restricting it to Borel sets. (Even for open sets &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding measure &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(U)&lt;/math&gt; need not be given by the lim sup formula above. The problem is that the function given by the lim sup formula is not countably subadditive in general and in particular is infinite on any set without compact closure, so is not an outer measure.)

===A construction using compactly supported functions===

Cartan introduced  another way of constructing Haar measure as a [[Radon measure]] (a positive linear functional on compactly supported continuous functions) which is similar to the construction above except that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are positive continuous functions of compact support rather than subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In this case we define &lt;math&gt;[K:U]&lt;/math&gt; to be the infimum of numbers &lt;math&gt;c_1+\cdots+c_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K(g)&lt;/math&gt; is less than the linear combination &lt;math&gt;c_1 U(g_1 g)+\cdots+c_n U(g_n g)&lt;/math&gt; of left translates of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;g_1,\ldots,g_n\in G&lt;/math&gt;.
As before we define
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(K)=\lim_U\frac{[K:U]}{[A:U]}&lt;/math&gt;.
The fact that the limit exists takes some effort to prove, though the advantage of doing this is that the proof avoids the use of the axiom of choice and also gives uniqueness of Haar measure as a by-product. The functional &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt; extends to a positive linear functional on compactly supported continuous functions and so gives a Haar measure. (Note that even though the limit is linear in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, the individual terms &lt;math&gt;[K:U]&lt;/math&gt; are not usually linear in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.)

===A construction using mean values of functions===

Von Neumann gave a method of constructing Haar measure using mean values of functions, though it only works for compact groups. The idea is that given a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a compact group, one can find a [[convex combination]] &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i f(g_i g)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i=1&lt;/math&gt;) of its left translates that differs from a constant function by at most some small number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Then one shows that as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; tends to zero the values of these constant functions tend to a limit, which is called the mean value (or integral) of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

For groups that are locally compact but not compact this construction does not give Haar measure as the mean value of compactly supported functions is zero. However something like this does work for [[almost periodic function]]s on the group which do have a mean value, though this is not given with respect to Haar measure.

===A construction on Lie groups===

On an ''n''-dimensional Lie group, Haar measure can be constructed easily as the measure induced by a left-invariant ''n''-form. This was known before Haar's theorem.

==The right Haar measure==

It can also be proved that there exists a unique (up to multiplication by a positive constant) right-translation-invariant Borel measure &lt;math&gt; \nu&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the above regularity conditions and being finite on compact sets, but it need not coincide with the  left-translation-invariant measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. The left and right Haar measures are the same only for so-called ''unimodular groups'' (see below). It is quite simple, though, to find a relationship between &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, for a Borel set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, let us denote by &lt;math&gt;S^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; the set of inverses of elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. If we define 
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_{-1}(S) = \mu(S^{-1}) \quad &lt;/math&gt;
then this is a right Haar measure. To show right invariance,  apply the definition:

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_{-1}(S g) = \mu((S g)^{-1}) = \mu(g^{-1} S^{-1}) = \mu(S^{-1}) = \mu_{-1}(S). \quad &lt;/math&gt;

Because the right measure is unique, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\mu_{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and so
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(S^{-1})=k\nu(S)\,&lt;/math&gt;
for all Borel sets &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is some positive constant.

===The modular function===

The ''left'' translate of a right Haar measure is a right Haar measure. More precisely, if &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a right Haar measure, then

:&lt;math&gt; S \mapsto \nu (g^{-1} S) \quad &lt;/math&gt;

is also right invariant.  Thus, by uniqueness of the Haar measure, there exists a function &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; from the group to the positive reals, called the '''Haar modulus''', '''modular function''' or '''modular character''', such that for every Borel set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \nu (g^{-1} S) = \Delta(g) \nu(S). \quad&lt;/math&gt;

Since right Haar measure is well-defined up to a positive scaling factor, this equation shows the modular function is independent of the choice of right Haar measure in the above equation.

The modular function is a continuous group homomorphism into the multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]]. A group is called '''unimodular''' if the modular function is identically &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, or, equivalently, if the Haar measure is both left and right invariant. Examples of unimodular groups are [[abelian group]]s, [[compact group]]s, [[discrete group]]s (e.g., [[finite group]]s), [[semisimple Lie group]]s and connected [[nilpotent Lie group]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} An example of a non-unimodular group is the group of affine transformations

:&lt;math&gt;\big\{ x \mapsto a x + b : a\in\R\setminus\{0\}, b\in\R \big\}=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}
 a &amp; b \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

on the real line. This example shows that a solvable Lie group need not be unimodular.
In this group a left Haar measure is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a^2}da\wedge db&lt;/math&gt;, and a right Haar measure by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|a|}da\wedge db&lt;/math&gt;.

==Measures on homogeneous spaces==

If the locally compact group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts transitively on a [[homogeneous space]] &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;, one can ask if this space has an invariant measure, or more generally a semi-invariant measure with the property that &lt;math&gt;\mu(gS) = \chi(g)\mu(S)&lt;/math&gt; for some character &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a measure is that the restriction &lt;math&gt;\chi|_H&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\Delta|_H/\delta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; are the modular functions of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; respectively. 
In particular an invariant measure on &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; exists if and only if the modular function &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; restricted to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the modular function &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example=== 

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the group &lt;math&gt;SL_2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices, then the modular function of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is nontrivial but the modular function of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is trivial. The quotient of these cannot be extended to any character of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, so the quotient space &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; (which can be thought of as 1-dimensional [[real projective space]]) does not have even a semi-invariant measure.

==Haar integral==
{{expand section|date=December 2011}}
Using the general theory of [[Lebesgue integration]], one can then define an integral for all Borel measurable functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  on  &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This integral is called the '''Haar integral'''.   If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a left Haar measure, then
:&lt;math&gt; \int_G f(sx) \ d\mu(x) = \int_G f(x) \ d\mu(x) &lt;/math&gt;
for any Haar integrable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This is immediate for [[indicator function]]s, being essentially the definition of left invariance.
:&lt;math&gt; \int \mathit{1}_A(tg)\,dg = \int \mathit{1}_{t^{-1}A}(g)\,dg=\mu(t^{-1}A)=\mu(A)=\int\mathit{1}_A(g)\,dg &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

* A Haar measure on the topological group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}, +)&lt;/math&gt; which takes the value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the restriction of [[Lebesgue measure]] to the Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. This can be generalized to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n, +)&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the group of nonzero real numbers with multiplication as operation, then a Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is given by
::&lt;math&gt; \mu(S) = \int_S \frac{1}{|t|} \, dt &lt;/math&gt;
:for any Borel subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of the nonzero reals.

:For example, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be an interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, then we find &lt;math&gt;\mu(S) = \log(b/a)&lt;/math&gt;. Now we let the multiplicative group act on this interval by a multiplication of all its elements by a number &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in &lt;math&gt;gS&lt;/math&gt; being the interval &lt;math&gt;[g\cdot a,g\cdot b]&lt;/math&gt;. Measuring this new interval, we find &lt;math&gt; \mu(gS) = \log((g\cdot b)/(g\cdot a)) = \log(b/a) = \mu(S) &lt;/math&gt;.

* If the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is represented as an open submanifold of &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt; then a left Haar measure on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{J(x)}d^n x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;J(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of left multiplication by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. A right Haar measure is given in the same way, except with &lt;math&gt;J(x)&lt;/math&gt; the Jacobian of right multiplication by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
* As a special case of the previous construction, for &lt;math&gt;G = GL(n,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;, any left Haar measure is a right Haar measure and one such measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is given by
::&lt;math&gt; \mu(S) = \int_S {1\over |\det(X)|^n} \, dX &lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;dX&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Lebesgue measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; identified with the set of all &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt;-matrices.  This follows from the [[change of variables formula]].
* On any [[Lie group]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; a left Haar measure can be associated with any non-zero left-invariant &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, as the ''Lebesgue measure'' &lt;math&gt;|\omega|&lt;/math&gt;; and similarly for right Haar measures. This means also that the modular function can be computed, as the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]].
* In order to define a Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on the [[circle group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;f(t)=(\cos(t),\sin(t))&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by
::&lt;math&gt;\mu(S)=\frac1{2\pi}m\left(f^{-1}(S)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the Lebesgue measure. The factor &lt;math&gt;(2\pi)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that &lt;math&gt;\mu(\mathbb{T})=1&lt;/math&gt;.

* The [[unit hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) : x^2 - y^2 = 1 , x &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; can be taken is a group under multiplication defined as with [[split-complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;z = x + y j, \ \ j^2 = +1 .&lt;/math&gt; The usual [[area]] measure in the crescent &lt;math&gt;C = \{(x,y) : |y| &lt; x, \ \ x^2 - y^2 &lt; 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; serves to define [[hyperbolic angle]] as the area of its [[hyperbolic sector]]. The Haar measure of the unit hyperbola is generated by the hyperbolic angle of segments on the hyperbola. For instance, a measure of one unit is given by the segment running from (1,1) to (e,1/e), where e is [[Euler's number]]. Hyperbolic angle has been exploited in mathematical physics with [[rapidity]] standing in for classical [[velocity]].

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the group of non-zero [[quaternion]]s, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt;. A Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\mu(S)=\int_S\frac1{(x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2)^2}\,dx\,dy\,dz\,dw&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;dx\wedge dy\wedge dz\wedge dw&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Lebesgue measure in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a Borel subset of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the additive group of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic numbers for a prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, then a Haar measure is given by letting &lt;math&gt;a+p^n O&lt;/math&gt; have measure &lt;math&gt;p^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is the ring of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic integers.

==Uses==

In the same issue of ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' and immediately after Haar's paper, the Haar theorem was used to solve [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] for compact groups by [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = J. | last = von Neumann | author-link = John von Neumann | title = Die Einfuhrung Analytischer Parameter in Topologischen Gruppen | periodical = [[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | series = 2 | year = 1933 | pages = 170–179 |jstor=1968347 | doi=10.2307/1968347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete group, it is impossible to define a countably additive left-invariant regular measure on ''all'' subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the [[axiom of choice]],  according to the theory of [[non-measurable set]]s.

===Abstract harmonic analysis===
The Haar measures are used in [[abstract harmonic analysis|harmonic analysis]] on locally compact groups, particularly in the theory of [[Pontryagin duality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banaszczyk|first=Wojciech|title=Additive subgroups of topological vector spaces|series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics|volume=1466|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|year= 1991|pages=viii+178|isbn=3-540-53917-4|mr=1119302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yurii I. Lyubich. ''Introduction to the Theory of Banach Representations of Groups''. Translated from the 1985 Russian-language edition (Kharkov (Kharkiv), Ukraine). Birkhäuser Verlag. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles F. Dunkl]] and Donald E. Ramirez: {{cite book|title=Topics in harmonic analysis|year=1971|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|isbn=039027819X}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove the existence of a Haar measure on a locally compact group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; it suffices to exhibit a left-invariant [[Radon measure]] on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

===Mathematical statistics===
In mathematical statistics, Haar measures are used for prior measures, which are [[prior probability|prior probabilities]] for compact groups of transformations. These prior measures are used to construct [[admissible procedure]]s, by appeal to the characterization of admissible procedures as [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian procedures]] (or limits of Bayesian procedures) by [[Abraham Wald|Wald]]. For example, a right Haar measure for a family of distributions with a [[location parameter]] results in the [[Pitman Estimator|Pitman estimator]], which is [[minimum variance unbiased estimator|best]] [[equivariant estimator|equivariant]]. When left and right Haar measures differ, the right measure is usually preferred as a prior distribution. For the group of affine transformations on the parameter space of the normal distribution, the right Haar measure is the [[Jeffreys prior]] measure&lt;!-- improper "prior", not a probability distribution  --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James O.| last = Berger | author-link = James O. Berger | title = Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis | year = 1985 | edition=second|chapter=6 Invariance|pages = 388–432 |publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, even right Haar measures sometimes result in useless priors, which cannot be recommended for practical use, like other methods of constructing prior measures that avoid subjective information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Robert, Christian P|title=The Bayesian Choice – A Decision-Theoretic Motivation|publisher=Springer|year=2001|edition=second|isbn=0-387-94296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of Haar measure in statistics is in [[conditional inference]], in which the sampling distribution of a statistic is conditioned on another statistic of the data. In invariant-theoretic conditional inference, the sampling distribution is conditioned on an invariant of the group of transformations (with respect to which the Haar measure is defined). The result of conditioning sometimes depends on the order in which invariants are used and on the choice of a [[maximal invariant]], so that by itself a  [[statistical principle]] of invariance fails to select any unique best conditional statistic (if any exist); at least another principle is needed.

For non-compact groups, statisticians have extended Haar-measure results using [[amenable group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bondar | first1 = James V. | last2 = Milnes | first2 = Paul | year = 1981 | title = Amenability: A survey for statistical applications of Hunt–Stein and related conditions on groups | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 103–128 | doi = 10.1007/BF00533716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weil's converse theorem==

In 1936 Weil proved a converse (of sorts) to Haar's theorem, by showing that if a group has a left invariant measure for which one can define a convolution product, then one can define a topology on the group, and the completion of the group is locally compact and the given measure is essentially the same as Haar measure on this completion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="940">In [[graph theory]], an '''incidence''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(u, e)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a vertex and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an edge incident to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. 

Two distinct incidences &lt;math&gt;(u, e)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v,f)&lt;/math&gt; are '''adjacent''' if and only if &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e = f&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;uv = e&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Endlessly interlaced pentagons and some translations.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Wallpaper group|wallpaper]] is '''invariant''' under an infinite number of&amp;nbsp;[[Translation (geometry)|translations]], members of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], of which the [[Binary operation|operation]] denoted by &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the [[function composition]].]]
In [[mathematics]], an '''invariant''' is a property, held by a class of mathematical objects, which remains unchanged when [[Transformation (function)|transformations]] of a certain type are applied to the objects. The particular class of objects and type of transformations are usually indicated by the context in which the term is used. For example, the area of a triangle is an invariant with respect to [[isometry|isometries]] of the Euclidean plane. The phrases "invariant under" and "invariant to" a transformation are both used. More generally, an invariant with respect to an [[equivalence relation]] is a property that is constant on each equivalence class. 

Invariants are used in diverse areas of mathematics such as [[geometry]], [[topology]], [[algebra]] and [[discrete mathematics]]. Some important classes of transformations are defined by an invariant they leave unchanged, for example [[conformal map]]s are defined as transformations of the plane that preserve angles. The discovery of invariants is an important step in the process of classifying mathematical objects.

== Examples ==
A simple example of invariance is expressed in our ability to [[counting|count]]. For a [[finite set]] of objects of any kind, there is a number to which we always arrive, regardless of the [[total order|order]] in which we count the objects in the set. The quantity&amp;mdash;a [[cardinal number]]&amp;mdash;is associated with the set, and is invariant under the process of counting.

An [[List of mathematical identities|identity]] is an equation that remains true for all values of its variables. There are also [[List of inequalities|inequalities]] that remain true when the values of their variables change.

The [[distance]] between two points on a [[number line]] is not changed by [[addition|adding]] the same quantity to both numbers. On the other hand, [[multiplication]] does not have this same property as addition, so distance is not invariant under multiplication.

[[Angle]]s and [[ratio]]s of distances are invariant under [[Scaling (geometry)|scalings]], [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s. These transformations produce [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] shapes, which is the basis of [[trigonometry]]. In contrast, angles and ratios are not invariant under non-uniform scaling (such as stretching). The sum of a triangle's interior angles (180°) is invariant under all the above operations.  As another example, all circles are similar: they can be transformed into each other and the ratio of the [[circumference]] to the [[diameter]] is invariant (denoted by the Greek letter [[pi]]).

Some more complicated examples:
* The [[real part]] and the [[absolute value]] of a [[complex number]] are invariant under [[complex conjugation]].
* The degree of a polynomial is invariant under linear change of variables.
* The dimension and homology groups of a topological object are invariant under [[homeomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The number of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of a [[dynamical system]] is invariant under many mathematical operations.
* Euclidean distance is invariant under [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal transformations]].
* Euclidean [[area]] is invariant under a [[linear map]] with [[determinant]] 1 (see [[2 × 2 real matrices#Equi-areal mapping|Equi-areal maps]]).
* Some invariants of [[projective transformation]]s:  [[collinearity]] of three or more points, [[concurrent lines|concurrency]] of three or more lines, [[conic section]]s, the [[cross-ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|pp=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[determinant]], [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]], and [[eigenvectors]] and [[eigenvalues]] of a square matrix are invariant under changes of basis. In a word, the [[spectrum of a matrix]] is invariant to the change of basis.
* [[Invariants of tensors]].
* The [[singular-value decomposition|singular values]] of a matrix are invariant under orthogonal transformations.
* [[Lebesgue measure]] is invariant under translations.
* The [[variance]] of a [[probability distribution]] is invariant under translations of the [[real number|real]] line; hence the variance of a [[random variable]] is unchanged by the addition of a constant to it.
* The [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of a transformation are the elements in the domain invariant under the transformation. They may, depending on the application, be called [[symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to that transformation. For example, objects with [[translational symmetry]] are invariant under certain translations.
*The integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_M K\,d\mu}&lt;/math&gt; of the Gaussian curvature ''K'' of a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold (''M'',''g'') is invariant under changes of the [[Riemannian metric]] ''g''.  This is the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]].

===MU puzzle===
The [[MU puzzle]]&lt;ref&gt;

Here: Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example of a logical problem where determining an invariant is of use for an [[impossibility proof]]. 
The puzzle asks one to start with the word MI and transform it into the word MU using in each step one of the following transformation rules:

# If a string ends with an I, a U may be appended (''x''I → ''x''IU)
# The string after the M may be completely duplicated (M''x'' → M''xx'')
# Any three consecutive I's (III) may be replaced with a single U (''x''III''y'' → ''x''U''y'')
# Any two consecutive U's may be removed (''x''UU''y'' → ''xy'')

An example derivation (superscripts indicating the applied rules) is
:MI →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MII →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MIIII →&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; MUI →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUI →&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUIU →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUIUUIUIU →&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUIIUIU → ...

Is it possible to convert MI into MU using these four transformation rules only?

One could spend many hours applying these transformation rules to strings. However, it might be quicker to find a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|property]] that is invariant to all rules (i.e. that isn't changed by any of them), and demonstrates that getting to MU is impossible. Logically looking at the puzzle, the only way to get rid of any I's is to have three consecutive I's in the string. This makes the following invariant interesting to consider: 

:''The number of I's in the string is not a multiple of 3''.

This is an invariant to the problem if for each of the transformation rules the following holds: if the invariant held before applying the rule, it will also hold after applying it. If we look at the net effect of applying the rules on the number of I's and U's we can see this actually is the case for all rules:

:{| class=wikitable
|-
! Rule !! #I's !! #U's !! Effect on invariant
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | 1 || style="text-align: right;" | +0 || style="text-align: right;" | +1 || Number of I's is unchanged. If the invariant held, it still does.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |  2 || style="text-align: right;" | ×2 || style="text-align: right;" | ×2 || If ''n'' is not a multiple of 3, then 2×''n'' isn't either. The invariant still holds.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |  3 || style="text-align: right;" | −3 || style="text-align: right;" | +1 || If ''n'' is not a multiple of 3, ''n''−3 isn't either. The invariant still holds.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |  4 || style="text-align: right;" | +0 || style="text-align: right;" | −2 || Number of I's is unchanged. If the invariant held, it still does.
|}

The table above shows clearly that the invariant holds for each of the possible transformation rules, which basically means that whichever rule we pick, at whatever state, if the number of I's was not a multiple of three before applying the rule, it won't be afterwards either.

Given that there is a single I in the starting string MI, and one is not a multiple of three, it's impossible to go from MI to MU as zero is a multiple of three.

==Invariant set==

A subset ''S'' of the domain ''U'' of a mapping ''T'': ''U'' → ''U''  is an '''invariant set''' under the mapping when &lt;math&gt;x \in S \Rightarrow T(x) \in S.&lt;/math&gt; Note that the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of ''S'' are not [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed]], but rather the set ''S'' is fixed in the [[power set]] of ''U''. (Some authors use the terminology ''setwise invariant''&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Simon|title=Representations of Finite and Compact Groups|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-7196-6|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; vs. ''pointwise invariant''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Cederberg|title=A Course in Modern Geometries|year=1989|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4757-3831-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish between these cases.)
For example, a [[circle]] is an invariant subset of the plane under a [[rotation]] about the circle’s center. Further, a [[conical surface]] is invariant as a set under a [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] of space.

An invariant set of an operation ''T'' is also said to be '''stable under''' ''T''. For example, the [[normal subgroup]]s that are so important in [[group theory]] are those [[subgroup]]s that are stable under the [[inner automorphism]]s of the ambient group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Herstein|1964|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other examples occur in [[linear algebra]]. Suppose a [[linear transformation]] ''T'' has an [[eigenvector]] '''v'''. Then the line through 0 and '''v''' is an invariant set under ''T''. The eigenvectors span an [[invariant subspace]] which is stable under ''T''.

When ''T'' is a [[screw displacement]], the [[screw axis]] is an invariant line, though if the [[pitch (screw)|pitch]] is non-zero, ''T'' has no fixed points.

== Formal statement ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
The notion of invariance is formalized in three different ways in mathematics: via [[group action]]s, presentations, and deformation.

=== Unchanged under group action ===
Firstly, if one has a group ''G'' acting on a mathematical object (or set of objects) ''X,'' then one may ask which points ''x'' are unchanged, "invariant" under the group action, or under an element ''g'' of the group.

Very frequently one will have a group acting on a set ''X'' and ask which objects in an ''associated'' set ''F''(''X'') are invariant. For example, rotation in the plane about a point leaves the point about which it rotates invariant, while translation in the plane does not leave any points invariant, but does leave all lines parallel to the direction of translation invariant as lines. Formally, define the set of lines in the plane ''P'' as ''L''(''P''); then a rigid motion of the plane takes lines to lines – the group of rigid motions acts on the set of lines – and one may ask which lines are unchanged by an action.

More importantly, one may define a ''function'' on a set, such as "radius of a circle in the plane" and then ask if this function is invariant under a group action, such as rigid motions.

Dual to the notion of invariants are ''[[coinvariant]]s,'' also known as ''orbits,'' which formalizes the notion of [[congruence relation|congruence]]: objects which can be taken to each other by a group action. For example, under the group of rigid motions of the plane, the perimeter of a triangle is an invariant, while the set of triangles congruent to a given triangle is a coinvariant.

These are connected as follows: invariants are constant on coinvariants (for example, congruent triangles have the same perimeter), while two objects which agree in the value of one invariant may or may not be congruent (two triangles with the same perimeter need not be congruent). In [[classification problem (mathematics)|classification problem]]s, one seeks to find a [[complete set of invariants]], such that if two objects have the same values for this set of invariants, they are congruent.

For example, triangles such that all three sides are equal are congruent under rigid motions, via [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence]], and thus the lengths of all three sides form a complete set of invariants for triangles. The three angle measures of a triangle are also invariant under rigid motions, but do not form a complete set as incongruent triangles can share the same angle measures. However, if one allows scaling in addition to rigid motions, then the [[Similarity (geometry)#Similar triangles|AAA similarity criterion]] shows that this is a complete set of invariants.

=== Independent of presentation ===
Secondly, a function may be defined in terms of some presentation or decomposition of a mathematical object; for instance, the [[Euler characteristic]] of a [[cell complex]] is defined as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension. One may forget the cell complex structure and look only at the underlying topological space (the manifold) – as different cell complexes give the same underlying manifold, one may ask if the function is ''independent'' of choice of ''presentation,'' in which case it is an ''intrinsically'' defined invariant. This is the case for the Euler characteristic, and a general method for defining and computing invariants is to define them for a given presentation and then show that they are independent of the choice of presentation. Note that there is no notion of a group action in this sense.

The most common examples are:
* The [[Differentiable manifold#Definition|presentation of a manifold]] in terms of coordinate charts – invariants must be unchanged under [[change of coordinates]].
* Various [[manifold decomposition]]s, as discussed for Euler characteristic.
* Invariants of a [[presentation of a group]].

=== Unchanged under perturbation ===
Thirdly, if one is studying an object which varies in a family, as is common in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[differential geometry]], one may ask if the property is unchanged under perturbation – if an object is constant on families or invariant under change of metric, for instance.

==Invariants in computer science==
{{For|other uses of the word "invariant" in computer science|invariant (disambiguation)}}
In [[computer science]], one can encounter invariants that can be relied upon to be true during the execution of a program, or during some portion of it. It is a [[logical assertion]] that is always held to be true during a certain phase of execution. For example, a [[loop invariant]] is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every execution of a loop.

Invariants are especially useful when reasoning about whether a computer program is correct. The theory of [[optimizing compiler]]s, the methodology of [[design by contract]], and [[formal methods]] for determining [[program correctness]], all rely heavily on invariants.

Programmers often use [[Assertion (computing)|assertions]] in their code to make invariants explicit. Some [[object oriented]] [[programming language]]s have a special syntax for specifying [[class invariant]]s.
===Automatic invariant detection in imperative programs===

[[Abstract interpretation]] tools can compute simple invariants of given imperative computer programs. The kind of properties that can be found depend on the [[Abstract_interpretation#Examples_of_abstract_domains|abstract domains]] used. Typical example properties are single integer variable ranges like &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=x&lt;1024&lt;/code&gt;, relations between several variables like &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i-j&lt;2*n-1&lt;/code&gt;, and modulus information like &lt;code&gt;y%4==0&lt;/code&gt;. Academic research prototypes also consider simple properties of pointer structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1=A.|last1=Bouajjani|first2=C.|last2=Drǎgoi|first3=C.|last3=Enea|first4=A.|last4=Rezine|first5=M.|last5=Sighireanu|title=Invariant Synthesis for Programs Manipulating Lists with Unbounded Data|booktitle=Proc. CAV|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More sophisticated invariants generally have to be provided manually.
In particular, when verifying an imperative program using [[Hoare logic|the Hoare calculus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a loop invariant has to be provided manually for each loop in the program, which is one of the reasons this is generally impractical for most programs.

In the context of the above [[MU puzzle]] example, there is currently no general automated tool that can detect that a derivation, "MI →...→ MU", is impossible only from rules 1-4. However, once the abstraction from the string to the number of its "I"s has been made by hand, leading e.g. to the following C program, an abstract interpretation tool will be able to detect that &lt;code&gt;ICount%3&lt;/code&gt; can't be 0 and hence the "while"-loop will never terminate.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
void MUPuzzle(void) {
    volatile int RandomRule;
    int ICount=1, UCount=0;
    while (ICount%3!=0)                            // non-terminating loop
        switch(RandomRule) {
        case 1:                UCount+=1;   break;
        case 2:   ICount*=2;   UCount*=2;   break;
        case 3:   ICount-=3;   UCount+=1;   break;
        case 4:                UCount-=2;   break;
        }                                          // computed invariant: ICount%3==1||ICount%3==2
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A [[List of knapsack problems#Multiple constraints|multiple constrained problem]] could consider both the weight and volume of the boxes. &lt;br /&gt;

The '''knapsack problem''' or '''rucksack problem''' is a problem in [[combinatorial optimization]]: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size [[knapsack]] and must fill it with the most valuable items.

The problem often arises in [[resource allocation]] where there are financial constraints and is studied in fields such as [[combinatorics]], [[computer science]], [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], [[cryptography]], [[applied mathematics]], and [[daily fantasy sports]].

The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On the partition of numbers | author = Mathews, G. B. | journal = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | volume = 28 | pages = 486&amp;ndash;490 | date = 25 June 1897 | url = http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s1-28/1/486.full.pdf |doi = 10.1112/plms/s1-28.1.486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "knapsack problem" dates back to the early works of mathematician [[Tobias Dantzig]] (1884&amp;ndash;1956),&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, Tobias. Numbers: The Language of Science, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the commonplace problem of packing the most valuable or useful items without overloading the luggage.

==Applications==
A 1998 study of the [http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/ Stony Brook University Algorithm Repository] showed that, out of 75 algorithmic problems, the knapsack problem was the 19th most popular and the third most needed after [[suffix tree]]s and the [[bin packing problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Who is Interested in Algorithms and Why?

Knapsack problems appear in real-world decision-making processes in a wide variety of fields, such as finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials,&lt;ref&gt;Kellerer, Pferschy, and Pisinger 2004, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt; selection of [[investment]]s and [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]],&lt;ref&gt;Kellerer, Pferschy, and Pisinger 2004, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; selection of assets for [[Securitization|asset-backed securitization]],&lt;ref&gt;Kellerer, Pferschy, and Pisinger 2004, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; and generating keys for the [[Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem|Merkle–Hellman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kellerer, Pferschy, and Pisinger 2004, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[knapsack cryptosystems]].

One early application of knapsack algorithms was in the construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples, it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point values, it is more difficult to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to answer all of the questions to the best of their abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Mathematical Programming Model for Test Construction and Scoring | journal = Management Science | volume = 19 | issue = 8 |date = April 1973|pages = 961–966 |author1=Feuerman, Martin |author2=Weiss, Harvey | jstor = 2629127 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.19.8.961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The most common problem being solved is the '''0-1 knapsack problem''', which restricts the number ''&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;'' of copies of each kind of item to zero or one. Given a set of ''n'' items numbered from 1 up to ''n'', each with a weight ''&lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;'' and a value ''&lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;'', along with a maximum weight capacity ''W'',
: maximize &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n v_i x_i&lt;/math&gt;
: subject to &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \leq W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the number of instances of item ''i'' to include in the knapsack. Informally, the problem is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.

The '''bounded knapsack problem''' ('''BKP''') removes the restriction that there is only one of each item, but restricts the number &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; of copies of each kind of item to a maximum non-negative integer value &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;:
: maximize &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n v_i x_i&lt;/math&gt;
: subject to &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \leq W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x_i \leq c&lt;/math&gt;

The '''unbounded knapsack problem''' ('''UKP''') places no upper bound on the number of copies of each kind of item and can be formulated as above except for that the only restriction on &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is that it is a non-negative integer.
: maximize &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n v_i x_i&lt;/math&gt;
: subject to &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \leq W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

One example of the unbounded knapsack problem is given using the figure shown at the beginning of this article and the text "if any number of each box is available" in the caption of that figure.

== Computational complexity ==
The knapsack problem is interesting from the perspective of computer science for many reasons:
* The [[decision problem]] form of the knapsack problem (''Can a value of at least ''V'' be achieved without exceeding the weight ''W''?'') is [[NP-complete]], thus there is no known algorithm both correct and fast (polynomial-time) in all cases.
* While the decision problem is NP-complete, the optimization problem is [[NP-hard]], its resolution is at least as difficult as the decision problem, and there is no known polynomial algorithm which can tell, given a solution, whether it is optimal (which would mean that there is no solution with a larger ''V'', thus solving the NP-complete decision problem).
* There is a [[pseudo-polynomial time]] algorithm using [[dynamic programming]].
* There is a [[FPTAS|fully polynomial-time approximation scheme]], which uses the pseudo-polynomial time algorithm as a subroutine, described below.
* Many cases that arise in practice, and "random instances" from some distributions, can nonetheless be solved exactly.

There is a link between the "decision" and "optimization" problems in that if there exists a polynomial algorithm that solves the  "decision" problem, then one can find the maximum value for the optimization problem in polynomial time by applying this algorithm iteratively while increasing the value of k . On the other hand, if an algorithm finds the optimal value of the optimization problem in polynomial time, then the decision problem can be solved in polynomial time by comparing the value of the solution output by this algorithm with the value of k . Thus, both versions of the problem are of similar difficulty.

One theme in research literature is to identify what the "hard" instances of the knapsack problem look like,&lt;ref name="pisinger200308"&gt;Pisinger, D. 2003. Where are the hard knapsack problems? Technical Report 2003/08, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cacetta2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caccetta | first1 = L. | last2 = Kulanoot | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Computational Aspects of Hard Knapsack Problems | url = | journal = Nonlinear Analysis | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 5547–5558 | doi=10.1016/s0362-546x(01)00658-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or viewed another way, to identify what properties of instances in practice might make them more amenable than their worst-case NP-complete behaviour suggests.&lt;ref name="poirriez_et_all_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poirriez|first1=Vincent|last2=Yanev|first2=Nicola|last3=Andonov|first3=Rumen|title=A hybrid algorithm for the unbounded knapsack problem|journal=Discrete Optimization|volume=6|issue=1|year=2009|pages=110–124|issn=1572-5286|doi=10.1016/j.disopt.2008.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal in finding these "hard" instances is for their use in [[public key cryptography]] systems, such as the [[Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem]].

== Solving ==
Several algorithms are available to solve knapsack problems, based on dynamic programming approach,&lt;ref name="eduk2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andonov | first1 = Rumen | last2 = Poirriez | first2 = Vincent | last3 = Rajopadhye | first3 = Sanjay | year = 2000 | title = Unbounded Knapsack Problem : dynamic programming revisited | url = http://www.univ-valenciennes.fr/limav/poirriez/pub/rech/PI-1152.ps.gz| journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 123 | issue = 2| pages = 168–181 | doi = 10.1016/S0377-2217(99)00265-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; branch and bound approach&lt;ref name="martellototh90"&gt;S.

=== Dynamic programming in-advance algorithm ===
The '''unbounded knapsack problem''' ('''UKP''') places no restriction on the number of copies of each kind of item. Besides, here we assume that &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;m[w']= \max \left( \sum_{i=1}^n v_i x_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;
: subject to &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \leq w'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;m[w]&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:

1. &lt;math&gt;m[0]=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (the sum of zero items, i.e., the summation of the empty set).

2. &lt;math&gt;m[w]=\max (v_1+m[w-w_1],v_2+m[w-w_2],...,v_i+m[w-w_i])&lt;/math&gt;
, &lt;math&gt;w_i \leq w&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th kind of item.

The second property needs to be explained in detail. During the process of the running of this method, how do we get the weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;? There are only &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; ways and the previous weights are &lt;math&gt;w-w_1, w-w_2,..., w-w_i&lt;/math&gt; where there are total &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; kinds of different item(by saying different, we mean that the weight and the value are not completely the same). If we know each value of these &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; items and the related maximum value previously, we just compare them to each other and get the maximum value ultimately and we are done.

Here the maximum of the empty set is taken to be zero. Tabulating the results from &lt;math&gt;m[0]&lt;/math&gt; up through &lt;math&gt;m[W]&lt;/math&gt; gives the solution. Since the calculation of each &lt;math&gt;m[w]&lt;/math&gt; involves examining at most &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items, and there are at most &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; values of &lt;math&gt;m[w]&lt;/math&gt; to calculate, the running time of the dynamic programming solution is [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O(nW)&lt;/math&gt;]]. Dividing &lt;math&gt;w_1,\,w_2,\,\ldots,\,w_n,\,W&lt;/math&gt; by their [[greatest common divisor]] is a way to improve the running time.

The &lt;math&gt;O(nW)&lt;/math&gt; complexity does not contradict the fact that the knapsack problem is [[NP-complete]], since &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, unlike &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is not polynomial in the length of the input to the problem. The length of the &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; input to the problem is proportional to the number of bits in &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\log W&lt;/math&gt;, not to &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; itself.

==== 0/1 knapsack problem ====
A similar dynamic programming solution for the 0/1 knapsack problem also runs in pseudo-polynomial time. Assume &lt;math&gt;w_1,\,w_2,\,\ldots,\,w_n,\, W&lt;/math&gt; are strictly positive integers. Define &lt;math&gt;m[i,w]&lt;/math&gt; to be the maximum value that can be attained with weight less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; using items up to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (first &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; items).

We can define &lt;math&gt;m[i,w]&lt;/math&gt; recursively as follows: '''(Definition A)
'''
* &lt;math&gt;m[0,\,w]=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;m[i,\,w]=m[i-1,\,w]&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;w_i &gt; w\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (the new item is more than the current weight limit)
* &lt;math&gt;m[i,\,w]=\max(m[i-1,\,w],\,m[i-1,w-w_i]+v_i)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;w_i \leqslant w&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution can then be found by calculating &lt;math&gt;m[n,W]&lt;/math&gt;. To do this efficiently, we can use a table to store previous computations.

The following is pseudo code for the dynamic program:

&lt;source lang="c" line&gt;
// Input:
// Values (stored in array v)
// Weights (stored in array w)
// Number of distinct items (n)
// Knapsack capacity (W)
// NOTE: The array "v" and array "w" are assumed to store all relevant values starting at index 1.

for j from 0 to W do:
    m[0, j] := 0

for i from 1 to n do:
    for j from 0 to W do:
        if w[i] &gt; j then:
            m[i, j] := m[i-1, j]
        else:
            m[i, j] := max(m[i-1, j], m[i-1, j-w[i]] + v[i])

&lt;/source&gt;

This solution will therefore run in &lt;math&gt;O(nW)&lt;/math&gt; time and &lt;math&gt;O(nW)&lt;/math&gt; space.

However, if we take it a step or two further, we should know that the method will run in the time between &lt;math&gt;O(nW)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt;. From '''Definition A''', we can know that there is no need for computing all the weights when the number of items and the items themselves that we chose are fixed. That is to say, the program above computes more than expected because that the weight changes from 0 to W all the time. All we need to do is to compare m[i-1, j] and m[i-1, j-w[i]] + v[i] for m[i, j], and when m[i-1, j-w[i]] is out of range, we just give the value of  m[i-1, j] to m[i, j]. From this perspective, we can program this method so that it runs recursively!

&lt;source lang="c" line&gt;
// Input:
// Values (stored in array v)
// Weights (stored in array w)
// Number of distinct items (n)
// Knapsack capacity (W)
// NOTE: The array "v" and array "w" are assumed to store all relevant values starting at index 1.

Define value[n, W]

Initialize All value[i, j]=-1

Define m:=(i,j)         //Define function m so that it represents the maximum value we can get under the condition: use first i items, total weight limit is j
{
  if i=0 then:
    return 0
  if j&lt;0 or j=0 then:

  return backvalue

Run m(n,W)
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, there are 10 different items and the weight limit is 67. So,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;w[  1]= 23 ,w[  2]= 26,w[  3]= 20,w[  4]= 18,w[  5]= 32,w[  6]= 27,w[  7]= 29,w[  8]= 26,w[  9]= 30,w[ 10]= 27 \\
&amp;v[  1]=505 ,v[  2]=352,v[  3]=458,v[  4]=220,v[  5]=354,v[  6]=414,v[  7]=498,v[  8]=545,v[  9]=473,v[ 10]=543 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
If you use above method to compute for &lt;math&gt;m(10,67)&lt;/math&gt;, you will get:

Besides, we can break the recursion and convert it into a tree. Then we can cut some leaves and use parallel computing to expedite the running of this method!

=== Meet-in-the-middle ===

In particular, if the &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative but not integers, we could still use the dynamic programming algorithm by scaling and rounding (i.e. using [[fixed-point arithmetic]]), but if the problem requires &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; fractional digits of precision to arrive at the correct answer, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; will need to be scaled by &lt;math&gt;10^d&lt;/math&gt;, and the DP algorithm will require &lt;math&gt;O(W10^d)&lt;/math&gt; space and &lt;math&gt;O(nW10^d)&lt;/math&gt; time.

:'' Meet-in-the-middle algorithm

   '''input:''' 
     a set of items with weights and values
   '''output:''' 
     the greatest combined value of a subset
   partition the set {1...n} into two sets A and B of approximately equal size
   compute the weights and values of all subsets of each set
   '''for''' each subset of A
     find the subset of B of greatest value such that the combined weight is less than W
   keep track of the greatest combined value seen so far

The algorithm takes &lt;math&gt;O(2^{n/2})&lt;/math&gt; space, and efficient implementations of step 3 (for instance, sorting the subsets of B by weight, discarding subsets of B which weigh more than other subsets of B of greater or equal value, and using binary search to find the best match) result in a runtime of &lt;math&gt;O(n2^{n/2})&lt;/math&gt;. As with the [[Meet-in-the-middle attack|meet in the middle attack]] in cryptography, this improves on the &lt;math&gt;O(n2^n)&lt;/math&gt; runtime of a naive brute force approach (examining all subsets of &lt;math&gt;\{1...n\}&lt;/math&gt;), at the cost of using exponential rather than constant space (see also [[baby-step giant-step]]).

=== Approximation algorithms ===
As for most NP-complete problems, it may be enough to find workable solutions even if they are not optimal. Preferably, however, the approximation comes with a guarantee on the difference between the value of the solution found and the value of the optimal solution.

As with many useful but computationally complex algorithms, there has been substantial research on creating and analyzing algorithms that approximate a solution. The knapsack problem, though NP-Hard, is one of a collection of algorithms that can still be approximated to any specified degree. This means that the problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme. To be exact, the knapsack problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).&lt;ref name="Vazirani, Vijay 2003"&gt;Vazirani, Vijay. Approximation Algorithms. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greedy approximation algorithm ====
[[George Dantzig]] proposed a [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] [[approximation algorithm]] to solve the unbounded knapsack problem.&lt;ref name="dantzig1957"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dantzig | first1 = George B. | authorlink = George Dantzig | year = 1957 | title = Discrete-Variable Extremum Problems | url = | journal = Operations Research | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 266–288 | doi = 10.1287/opre.5.2.266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His version sorts the items in decreasing order of value per unit of weight, &lt;math&gt;v_i/w_i&lt;/math&gt;. It then proceeds to insert them into the sack, starting with as many copies as possible of the first kind of item until there is no longer space in the sack for more. Provided that there is an unlimited supply of each kind of item, if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum value of items that fit into the sack, then the greedy algorithm is guaranteed to achieve at least a value of &lt;math&gt;m/2&lt;/math&gt;. However, for the bounded problem, where the supply of each kind of item is limited, the algorithm may be far from optimal.

==== Fully polynomial time approximation scheme ====
The [[fully polynomial time approximation scheme]] (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem takes advantage of the fact that the reason the problem has no known polynomial time solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds off some of the least significant digits of the profit values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε where ε is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time that is correct within a factor of (1-ε) of the optimal solution.&lt;ref name="Vazirani, Vijay 2003"/&gt;

:'' An Algorithm for FPTAS

  '''input''': 
    ε ∈ (0,1]
    a list A of n items, specified by their values, &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, and weights
  '''output''':
    S' the FPTAS solution

  P := max &lt;math&gt;\{v_i\mid 1 \leq i \leq n\} &lt;/math&gt;  // the highest item value
  K := ε &lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
  '''for''' i '''from''' 1 '''to''' n '''do'''
     &lt;math&gt;v'_i&lt;/math&gt; := &lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor \frac{v_i}{K} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
  '''end for'''
  '''return''' the solution, S', using the &lt;math&gt;v'_i&lt;/math&gt; values in the dynamic program outlined above

'''Theorem:''' The set &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; computed by the algorithm above satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{profit}(S') \geq (1-\varepsilon) \cdot \mathrm{profit}(S^*)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S^*&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution.

===Dominance relations===
Solving the unbounded knapsack problem can be made easier by throwing away items which will never be needed.  For a given item &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, suppose we could find a set of items &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; such that their total weight is less than the weight of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and their total value is greater than the value of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; cannot appear in the optimal solution, because we could always improve any potential solution containing &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; by replacing &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with the set &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, we can disregard the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th item altogether.  In such cases, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''dominate''' &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.  (Note that this does not apply to bounded knapsack problems, since we may have already used up the items in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.)

Finding dominance relations allows us to significantly reduce the size of the search space.  There are several different types of [[dominance relations]],&lt;ref name="poirriez_et_all_2009" /&gt; which all satisfy an inequality of the form:

&lt;math&gt;\qquad \sum_{j \in J} w_j\,x_j \ \le  \alpha\,w_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} v_j\,x_j \ \ge \alpha\,v_i\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \in Z _+^n &lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;\alpha\in Z_+ \,,J\subsetneq N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i\not\in J&lt;/math&gt;.  The vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of copies of each member of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.

;Collective dominance:  The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th item is  '''collectively dominated''' by &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;i\ll J&lt;/math&gt;, if the total weight of some combination of items in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is less than ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and their total value is greater than ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Formally, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} w_j\,x_j \ \le  w_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} v_j\,x_j \ \ge v_i&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \in Z _+^n &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Verifying this dominance is computationally hard, so it can only be used with a dynamic programming approach.  In fact, this is equivalent to solving a smaller knapsack decision problem where &lt;math&gt;V = v_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;W = w_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the items are restricted to &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.
;Threshold dominance: The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th item is '''threshold dominated'''  by &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;i\prec\prec J&lt;/math&gt;, if some number of copies of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are dominated by &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.  Formally, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} w_j\,x_j \ \le  \alpha\,w_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} v_j\,x_j \ \ge \alpha\,v_i\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \in Z _+^n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a generalization of collective dominance, first introduced in&lt;ref name="eduk2000"/&gt; and used in the EDUK algorithm.  The smallest such &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; defines the '''threshold''' of the item &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, written  &lt;math&gt;t_i =(\alpha-1)w_i&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, the optimal solution could contain at most &lt;math&gt;\alpha-1&lt;/math&gt; copies of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
;Multiple dominance: The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th item is  '''multiply dominated''' by a single item &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;i\ll_{m} j&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is dominated by some number of copies of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.  Formally, &lt;math&gt;w_j\,x_j \ \le  w_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v_j\,x_j \ \ge v_i&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x_j \in Z _+ &lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt; J=\{j\}, \alpha=1,  x_j=\lfloor \frac{w_i}{w_j}\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;. This dominance could be efficiently used during preprocessing because it can be detected relatively easily.
;Modular dominance: Let &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; be the ''best item'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_b}{w_b}\ge\frac{v_i}{w_i}\, &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the item with the greatest density of value. The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th item is '''modularly dominated''' by a single item &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;i\ll_\equiv j&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is dominated by &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; plus several copies of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  Formally, &lt;math&gt; w_j+tw_b \le w_i&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;v_j +tv_b \ge v_i &lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;J=\{b,j\}, \alpha=1,  x_b=t, x_j=1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Variations ==
There are many variations of the knapsack problem that have arisen from the vast number of applications of the basic problem. The main variations occur by changing the number of some problem parameter such as the number of items, number of objectives, or even the number of knapsacks.

===Multi-objective knapsack problem===
This variation changes the goal of the individual filling the knapsack. Instead of one objective, such as maximizing the monetary profit, the objective could have several dimensions. For example, there could be environmental or social concerns as well as economic goals. Problems frequently addressed include portfolio and transportation logistics optimizations.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. J., et al. Heuristics for Cardinality Constrained Portfolio Optimization.
Technical Report, London SW7 2AZ, England: The Management School, Imperial
College, May 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. S., et al. "Genetic Algorithm Based Bicriterion Optimization for Traction
Substations in DC Railway System." In Fogel [102], 11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, suppose you ran a cruise ship. You have to decide how many famous comedians to hire. This boat can handle no more than one ton of passengers and the entertainers must weigh less than 1000&amp;nbsp;lbs. Each comedian has a weight, brings in business based on their popularity and asks for a specific salary. In this example you have multiple objectives. You want, of course, to maximize the popularity of your entertainers while minimizing their salaries. Also, you want to have as many entertainers as possible.

===Multi-dimensional knapsack problem===
In this variation, the weight of knapsack item &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given by a D-dimensional vector &lt;math&gt;\overline{w_i}=(w_{i1},\ldots,w_{iD})&lt;/math&gt; and the knapsack has a D-dimensional capacity vector &lt;math&gt;(W_1,\ldots,W_D)&lt;/math&gt;. The target is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of weights in each dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; does not exceed &lt;math&gt;W_d&lt;/math&gt;.

Multi-dimensional knapsack is computationally harder than knapsack; even for &lt;math&gt;D=2&lt;/math&gt;, the problem does not have [[EPTAS]] unless P&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;NP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kulik | first1 = A. | last2 = Shachnai | first2 = H. | year = 2010 | title = There is no EPTAS for two dimensional knapsack | url = http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~hadas/PUB/multi_knap.pdf| journal = Inf. Process. Lett. | volume = 110 | issue = 16| pages = 707–710 | doi=10.1016/j.ipl.2010.05.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the algorithm in&lt;ref name=CohenGrebla&gt;Cohen, R. and Grebla, G. 2014. [http://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/paper_short.pdf "Multi-Dimensional OFDMA Scheduling in a Wireless Network with Relay Nodes"]. in ''Proc. IEEE INFOCOM’14'', 2427–2435.&lt;/ref&gt; is shown to solve sparse instances efficiently. An instance of multi-dimensional knapsack is sparse if there is a set &lt;math&gt;J=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;D&lt;/math&gt; such that for every knapsack item &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \exists z&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall j\in J\cup \{z\},\ w_{ij}\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall y\notin J\cup\{z\}, w_{iy}=0&lt;/math&gt;. Such instances occur, for example, when scheduling packets in a wireless network with relay nodes.&lt;ref name=CohenGrebla/&gt; The algorithm from&lt;ref name=CohenGrebla/&gt; also solves sparse instances of the multiple choice variant, multiple-choice multi-dimensional knapsack.

The IHS (Increasing Height Shelf) algorithm is optimal for 2D knapsack (packing squares into a two-dimensional unit size square): when there are at most five square in an optimal packing.&lt;ref&gt;Yan Lan, György Dósa, Xin Han, Chenyang Zhou, Attila Benkő [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=txyI5aAAAAAJ]: ''2D knapsack: Packing squares'', Theoretical Computer Science Vol. 508, pp. 35–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple knapsack problem===
This variation is similar to the [[Bin packing problem|Bin Packing Problem]]. It differs from the Bin Packing Problem in that a subset of items can be selected, whereas, in the Bin Packing Problem, all items have to be packed to certain bins. The concept is that there are multiple knapsacks. This may seem like a trivial change, but it is not equivalent to adding to the capacity of the initial knapsack. This variation is used in many loading and scheduling problems in Operations Research and has a [[Polynomial-time approximation scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Chekuri and Sanjeev Khanna. 2000. A PTAS for the multiple knapsack problem. In Proceedings of the eleventh annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms (SODA '00). Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, PA, USA, 213-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quadratic knapsack problem===
As described by Wu et al.:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[quadratic knapsack problem]] (QKP) maximizes a quadratic objective function subject to a binary and linear capacity constraint.&lt;ref name=QKP&gt;{{cite journal | title = Global Optimality Conditions and Optimization Methods for Quadratic Knapsack Problems |author1=Wu, Z.

===Subset-sum problem===
The [[subset sum problem]] is a special case of the decision and '''0-1''' problems where each kind of item, the weight equals the value: &lt;math&gt;w_i=v_i&lt;/math&gt;.  In the field of [[cryptography]], the term ''knapsack problem'' is often used to refer specifically to the subset sum problem and is commonly known as one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Karp (1972). "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems". In R. E. Miller and J. W. Thatcher (editors). Complexity of Computer Computations. New York: Plenum. pp. 85–103&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalization of subset sum problem is called multiple subset-sum problem, in which multiple bins exist with the same capacity. It has been shown that the generalization does not have an FPTAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caprara | first1 = Alberto | last2 = Kellerer | first2 = Hans | last3 = Pferschy | first3 = Ulrich | year = 2000 | title = The Multiple Subset Sum Problem | url = http://www.or.deis.unibo.it/alberto/mssp_siam.ps| journal = SIAM J. on Optimization | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 308–319 | doi = 10.1137/S1052623498348481 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.21.9826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Neal Stephenson provides an example of the knapsack problem in chapter 70 of his novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' to distribute family heirlooms.
* The knapsack problem occurs commonly in role-playing games, both digital and paper-based (prominent examples include ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' series and the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' game, respectively), where the player character is constrained by their encumbrance threshold when carrying items and treasure, which regularly forces the player to evaluate the items' value-to-weight ratio in order to bring only the most value-dense items to a merchant.
* Web comic [https://xkcd.com/287/ xkcd #287] - NP-Complete
* In Charles Stross' ''[[Accelerando]]'', the main character Manfred refers to the 'blind knapsack problem' in chapter 2, presumably a generalization or more complex version of the regular knapsack problem.

The '''Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences''' is awarded once a year by the [[Inamori Foundation]]. The Prize is one of three [[Kyoto Prize]] categories; the others are the [[Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology]] and the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]]. The first Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences was awarded to [[Claude Elwood Shannon]], the “Establishment of Mathematical Foundation of Information Theory”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude Elwood Shannon|url=http://www.kyotoprize.org/en/laureates/claude_elwood_shannon/|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in fields which are traditionally not honored with a [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyoto Prize honors achievement and character|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-11-12-kyoto-prize_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=12 October 2014|date=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields ==
The Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences is awarded on a rotating basis to researchers in the following four fields: 
* [[Mathematical sciences]] (including [[pure mathematics]])
* [[Biological sciences]] ([[evolutionary biology|evolution]], [[ethology|behavior]], [[ecology]], [[environmental biology|environment]])
* [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[planetary science|planetary sciences]], [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]
* [[Cognitive science]]/[[Life sciences]] ([[molecular biology]], [[cell biology]], [[neurobiology]])

[[Image:Laguerre-2d3d-model.svg|350px|thumb|classical Laguerre plane: 2d/3d-model]]
Essentially the classical Laguerre plane is an [[incidence structure]] which describes the incidence behaviour of the curves &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; , i.e. parabolas and lines, in the real affine plane. In order to simplify the structure, to any curve  &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; the point &lt;math&gt;(\infty,a)&lt;/math&gt; is added. A further advantage of this completion is: The plane geometry of the completed parabolas/lines is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections of a cylinder (s. below).

== The classical real Laguerre plane ==

Originally the classical Laguerre plane was defined as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles in the real euclidean plane (see &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Walter Benz]]|Title=Vorlesungen über Geometrie der Algebren : Reprint von 1973|Publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|PublicationPlace=Heidelberg|Year=2013|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;11|ISBN=9783642886713|Date=  2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Here we prefer the parabola model of the classical Laguerre plane.

We define:

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal P:=\R^2\cup (\{\infty\}\times\R), \ \infty \notin \R, &lt;/math&gt; the set of '''points''',
&lt;math&gt;  \mathcal Z:=\{\{(x,y)\in \R^2 \mid y=ax^2+bx+c\}\cup\{(\infty,a)\} \mid a,b,c \in \R\}&lt;/math&gt; the set of '''cycles'''.

The incidence structure &lt;math&gt; (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; is called '''classical Laguerre plane'''.

The point set is &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt; plus a copy of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; (see figure). Any parabola/line &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c &lt;/math&gt; gets the additional point  &lt;math&gt;(\infty,a)&lt;/math&gt;.

Points with the same x-coordinate cannot be connected by curves &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c &lt;/math&gt;. Hence we define:

Two points &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are '''parallel''' (&lt;math&gt;A\parallel B&lt;/math&gt;)
if &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt; or there is no cycle containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

For the description of the classical real Laguerre plane above two points &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2), (b_1,b_2)&lt;/math&gt; are parallel if and only if &lt;math&gt;a_1=b_1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]], similar to the parallelity of lines.

The incidence structure &lt;math&gt; (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:

'''Lemma:'''
:* For any three points &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;, pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;.
:* For any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one point &lt;math&gt;P'\in z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; P\parallel P'&lt;/math&gt;.
:* For any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, any point &lt;math&gt;P\in z&lt;/math&gt; and any point &lt;math&gt;Q\notin z&lt;/math&gt; which is not parallel to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;P,Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z\cap z'=\{P\}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; '''touch''' each other at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''.
[[File:Laguerre-stereogr-proj.svg|250px|thumb|Laguerre-plane: stereographic projection of the x-z-plane onto a cylinder]]
Similar to the sphere model of the classical [[Moebius plane]] there is a '''cylinder model''' for the classical Laguerre plane:

&lt;math&gt; (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a circular cylinder in &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt; .

The following mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a projection with center &lt;math&gt;(0,1,0)&lt;/math&gt; that maps the x-z-plane onto the cylinder with the equation &lt;math&gt;u^2+v^2-v=0&lt;/math&gt;, axis &lt;math&gt;(0,\tfrac{1}{2},..)&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r=\tfrac{1}{2}\ :&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi: \ (x,z) \rightarrow (\frac{x}{1+x^2},\frac{x^2}{1+x^2},\frac{z}{1+x^2})=(u,v,w)\ .&lt;/math&gt;
*The points &lt;math&gt;(0,1,a)&lt;/math&gt; (line on the cylinder through the center) appear not as images. 
*&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; projects the  ''parabola/line'' with equation &lt;math&gt;z=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; into the plane &lt;math&gt;w-a=bu+(a-c)(v-1)&lt;/math&gt;. So, the image of the parabola/line is the plane section of the cylinder with a non perpendicular plane and hence a circle/ellipse without point &lt;math&gt;(0,1,a)&lt;/math&gt;. The parabolas/line &lt;math&gt;z=ax^2+a&lt;/math&gt; are mapped onto (horizontal) circles.
*A line(a=0) is mapped onto a circle/Ellipse through center &lt;math&gt;(0,1,0)&lt;/math&gt; and a parabola ( &lt;math&gt;a\ne0&lt;/math&gt;) onto a circle/ellipse that do not contain &lt;math&gt;(0,1,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

==The axioms of a Laguerre plane==

The Lemma above gives rise to the following definition:

Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt;  be an incidence structure with '''point''' set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P &lt;/math&gt; and set of '''cycles''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Two points &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are '''parallel''' (&lt;math&gt;A\parallel B&lt;/math&gt;) if &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt; or there is no cycle containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; is called '''Laguerre plane''' if the following axioms hold:
[[File:Laguerre-axiome.svg|300px|thumb|Laguerre-plane: axioms]]
:'''B1:''' For any three points &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;, pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''B2:''' For any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one point &lt;math&gt;P'\in z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P\parallel P'&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''B3:''' For any cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, any point &lt;math&gt;P\in z&lt;/math&gt; and any point &lt;math&gt;Q\notin z&lt;/math&gt; which is not parallel to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; there is exactly one cycle &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;P,Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z\cap z'=\{P\}&lt;/math&gt;,
: i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt; '''touch''' each other at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''B4:''' Any cycle contains at least three points, there is at least one cycle. There are at least four points not on a cycle.

Four points &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D&lt;/math&gt; are '''concyclic''' if there is a cycle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D \in z&lt;/math&gt;.

From the definition of relation &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; and axiom '''B2''' we get

'''Lemma:'''
Relation &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]].

Following the cylinder model of the classical Laguerre-plane we introduce the denotation:

a) For &lt;math&gt;P\in \mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; we set &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}:=\{Q\in \mathcal P \ | \ P\parallel Q\}&lt;/math&gt;.
b) An equivalence class &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''generator'''.

For the classical Laguerre plane a generator is a line parallel to the y-axis (plane model) or a line on the cylinder (space model).

The connection to linear geometry is given by the following definition:

For a Laguerre plane   &lt;math&gt; \mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in) &lt;/math&gt; we define the local structure
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A _P:= (\mathcal P\setminus\{\overline{P}\},\{z\setminus\{\overline{P}\} \ | \ P\in z\in\mathcal Z\}
\cup \{\overline{Q} \ | \ Q\in \mathcal P\setminus\{\overline{P}\}, \in)&lt;/math&gt;

and call it the  '''residue''' at point P.

In the plane model of the classical Laguerre plane  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A _\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the real affine plane  &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt;.
In general we get

'''Theorem:''' Any residue of a Laguerre plane is an [[affine plane]].

And the equivalent definition of a Laguerre plane:

'''Theorem:'''
An incidence structure together with an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\parallel&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; is a
Laguerre plane if and only if for any point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; the residue &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A _P &lt;/math&gt; is an affine plane.

==Finite Laguerre planes==

[[File:Laguerre-min-model.svg|300px|thumb|minimal model of a Laguerre plane (only 4 of 8 cycles are shown)]]
The following incidence structure is a '''minimal model''' of a Laguerre plane:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P:=\{A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2\} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z:=\{\{A_i,B_j,C_k\} \ | \ i,j,k=1,2\} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A_1\parallel A_2,\ B_1\parallel B_2,\ C_1\parallel C_2 \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Hence &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal P|= 6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal Z|=8 \ .&lt;/math&gt;

For finite Laguerre planes, i.e. &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal P|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we get:

'''Lemma:'''
For any cycles &lt;math&gt;z_1,z_2&lt;/math&gt; and any generator &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}&lt;/math&gt; of a '''finite''' Laguerre plane
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; we have:
: &lt;math&gt;|z_1|=|z_2|=|\overline{P}|+1&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; and a cycle &lt;math&gt;z\in \mathcal Z&lt;/math&gt; the integer &lt;math&gt;n:=|z|-1&lt;/math&gt; is called '''order''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt;.

From combinatorics we get

'''Lemma:'''
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L:=(\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; be a Laguerre—plane of '''order''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:a) any residue &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A_P&lt;/math&gt; is an affine plane of order &lt;math&gt;n \quad,&lt;/math&gt;  b) &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal P|=n^2+n, &lt;/math&gt;  c) &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal Z|=n^3.&lt;/math&gt;

==Miquelian Laguerre planes==

Unlike Moebius planes the formal generalization of the classical model of a Laguerre plane, i.e. replacing &lt;math&gt;\R &lt;/math&gt; by an arbitrary field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, leads '''in any case''' to an example of a Laguerre plane.

'''Theorem:'''
For a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt;  and
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal P:=K^2 \cup &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\{\infty\}\times K), \ \infty \notin K &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal Z:=\{\{(x,y)\in K^2 \ | \ y=ax^2+bx+c\}\cup\{(\infty,a)\} \ | \ a,b,c \in K\}&lt;/math&gt; the incidence structure
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K):= (\mathcal P,\mathcal Z, \in)&lt;/math&gt; is a Laguerre plane with the following parallel relation: &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2) \parallel (b_1,b_2)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a_1=b_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar to a Möbius plane the Laguerre version of the Theorem of Miquel holds:
[[File:Theorem-of-miquel.svg|300px|thumb|Theorem of Miquel (circles drawn instead of parabolas)]]

'''Theorem of MIQUEL:'''
For the Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; the following is true:

:If for any 8 pairwise not parallel points &lt;math&gt;P_1,\ldots,P_8&lt;/math&gt; which can be assigned to the vertices of a cube such that the points in 5 faces correspond to concyclical quadruples then the sixth quadruple of points is concyclical, too.
(For a better overview in the figure there are circles drawn instead of parabolas)

The importance of the Theorem of Miquel shows the following theorem which is due to v. d. Waerden, Smid and Chen:

'''Theorem:''' Only a Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; satisfies the theorem of Miquel.

Because of the last Theorem &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''miquelian Laguerre plane'''.

'''Remark:''' The '''minimal model''' of a Laguerre plane is miquelian.&lt;br /&gt;
: It is isomorphic to the Laguerre plane &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; K = GF(2)&lt;/math&gt; (field &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Remark:''' A suitable [[stereographic projection]] shows: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(K) &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections on a quadric cylinder over field &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt;.

==Ovoidal Laguerre planes ==
There are a lot of Laguerre planes which are '''not miquelian''' (s. weblink below). The class which is most similar to miquelian Laguerre planes are the '''ovoidal Laguerre planes'''. An ovoidal Laguerre plane is the geometry of the plane sections of a cylinder which is constructed by using an [[quadratic set#Definition of an oval and an ovoid|oval]] instead of a non degenerate conic. An oval is a [[quadratic set]] and bears the same geometric properties as a non degenerate conic in a projective plane: 1) a line intersects an oval in zero, one, or two points and 2) at any point there is a unique tangent. A simple oval in the real plane can be constructed by glueing together two suitable halves of different ellipses, such that the result is not a conic. Even in the finite case there exist ovals (see [[quadratic set]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2751">In [[mathematics]], '''list edge-coloring''' is a type of [[graph coloring]] that combines [[list coloring]] and [[edge coloring]].
An instance of a list edge-coloring problem consists of a graph together with a list of allowed colors for each edge. A list edge-coloring is a choice of a color for each edge, from its list of allowed colors; a coloring is proper if no two adjacent edges receive the same color.

A graph ''G'' is '''''k''-edge-choosable''' if every instance of list edge-coloring that has ''G'' as its underlying graph and that provides at least ''k'' allowed colors for each edge of ''G'' has a proper coloring.
The '''edge choosability''', or ''list edge colorability'', ''list edge chromatic number'', or ''list chromatic index'', ch&amp;prime;(''G'') of graph ''G'' is the least number ''k'' such that ''G'' is ''k''-edge-choosable. It is conjectured that it always equals the [[chromatic index]].

==Properties==
Some properties of ch&amp;prime;(''G''):
# ch&amp;prime;(''G'') &lt; 2 χ&amp;prime;(''G'').
# ch&amp;prime;(K&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''n''.  This is the [[Dinitz conjecture]], proven by {{harvtxt|Galvin|1995}}.
# ch&amp;prime;(''G'') &lt; (1 + o(1))χ&amp;prime;(''G''), i.e. the list chromatic index and the chromatic index agree asymptotically {{harv|Kahn|2000}}.
Here χ&amp;prime;(''G'') is the [[Edge coloring|chromatic index]] of ''G''; and K&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[complete bipartite graph]] with equal [[Glossary of graph theory|partite sets]].

==List coloring conjecture==
The most famous open problem about list edge-coloring is probably the ''list coloring conjecture''.

:ch&amp;prime;(''G'') = χ&amp;prime;(''G'').

This conjecture has a fuzzy origin; {{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}} overview its history. The Dinitz conjecture, proven by {{harvtxt|Galvin|1995}}, is the special case of the list coloring conjecture for the [[complete bipartite graph]]s K&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4785">The '''Mantel test''', named after [[Nathan Mantel]], is a [[statistics|statistical]] test of the [[correlation]] between two [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The matrices must be of the same dimension; in most applications, they are matrices of interrelations between the same [[vector space|vector]]s of objects. The test was first published by [[Nathan Mantel]], a biostatistician at the [[National Institutes of Health]], in 1967.&lt;ref name="Mantel1967"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mantel | first1 = N. | year = 1967 | title = The detection of disease clustering and a generalized regression approach | url = | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 209–220 | pmid = 6018555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of it can be found in advanced statistics books (e.g., Sokal &amp; Rohlf 1995&lt;ref name="Sokal1995"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sokal RR, Rohlf FJ |year=1995 |title=Biometry |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Freeman |isbn=0-7167-2411-1 |pages=813–819}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Usage==

The test is commonly used in [[ecology]], where the data are usually estimates of the "distance" between objects such as [[species]] of organisms.  For example, one matrix might contain estimates of the [[genetics|genetic]] distances (i.e., the amount of difference between two different genomes) between all possible pairs of species in the study, obtained by the methods of [[molecular systematics]]; while the other might contain estimates of the geographical distance between the ranges of each species to every other species.

==Method==

If there are ''n'' objects, and the matrix is [[symmetric matrix|symmetrical]] (so the distance from object ''a'' to object ''b'' is the same as the distance from ''b'' to ''a'') such a matrix contains 

:&lt;math&gt;{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

distances. Because distances are not independent of each other &amp;ndash; since changing the "position" of one object would change &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; of these distances (the distance from that object to each of the others) &amp;ndash; we can not assess the relationship between the two matrices by simply evaluating the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] between the two sets of distances and testing its [[statistical significance]]. The Mantel test deals with this problem.

The procedure adopted is a kind of randomization or [[Resampling (statistics)#Permutation tests|permutation test]]. The correlation between the two sets of &lt;math&gt;n(n-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; distances is calculated, and this is both the measure of correlation reported and the [[test statistic]] on which the test is based. In principle, any correlation coefficient could be used, but normally the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] is used.  

In contrast to the ordinary use of the correlation coefficient, to assess significance of any apparent departure from a zero correlation, the rows and columns of one of the matrices are subjected to [[random permutation]]s many times, with the correlation being recalculated after each permutation. The significance of the observed correlation is the proportion of such permutations that lead to a higher correlation coefficient.  

The reasoning is that if the [[null hypothesis]] of there being no relation between the two matrices is true, then permuting the rows and columns of the matrix should be equally likely to produce a larger or a smaller coefficient. In addition to overcoming the problems arising from the statistical dependence of elements within each of the two matrices, use of the permutation test means that no reliance is being placed on assumptions about the statistical distributions of elements in the matrices.  

Many [[List of statistical packages|statistical packages]] include routines for carrying out the Mantel test.

==Criticism==
The various papers introducing the Mantel test and its extension the partial Mantel test lack a clear statistical framework specifying fully the  null and alternative hypotheses. This may convey the wrong idea that these tests are universal. For example, the Mantel and partial Mantel tests can be flawed in the presence of spatial auto-correlation and return erroneously low p-values
See e.g. Guillot and Rousset, 2013 &lt;ref name="Guillot2013"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1112.0651|author=Guillot G, Rousset F |year=2013 |title=Dismantling the Mantel tests |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution |volume=4 |issue=4| pages=336–344|doi=10.1111/2041-210x.12018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In [[statistics]], '''Markov chain Monte Carlo''' ('''MCMC''') methods comprise a class of [[algorithm]]s for sampling from a [[probability distribution]]. By constructing a [[Markov chain]] that has the desired distribution as its [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|equilibrium distribution]], one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by observing the chain after a number of steps. The more steps there are, the more closely the distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution.

Random-walk Monte Carlo methods make up a large subclass of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

== Application domains ==

Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are primarily used for calculating [[Numerical analysis|numerical approximations]] of [[Multiple integral|multi-dimensional integrals]], for example in [[Bayesian statistics]], [[computational physics]], [[computational biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Ankur|last2=Rawlings|first2=James B. | date = April 2014 |title=Comparison of Parameter Estimation Methods in Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Models: Examples in Systems Biology |journal=AIChE Journal|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1253–1268|doi=10.1002/aic.14409 |pmc=4946376|pmid=27429455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gill 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Robert &amp; Casella 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bayesian statistics, the recent development of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods has been a key step in making it possible to compute large [[Bayesian network#Hierarchical models|hierarchical models]] that require integrations over hundreds or even thousands of unknown parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banerjee|first1=Sudipto|last2=Carlin|first2=Bradley P.|last3=Gelfand|first3=Alan P.|title=Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-1917-3|page=xix|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rare event sampling]], they are also used for generating samples that gradually populate the rare failure region.

== Classification ==

===Random walk Monte Carlo methods===
{{See also|Random walk}}

====Multi-dimensional integrals====
When a Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used for approximating a [[Multiple integral|multi-dimensional integral]], an [[Statistical ensemble|ensemble]] of "walkers" move around randomly. At each point where a walker steps, the integrand value at that point is counted towards the integral. The walker then may make a number of tentative steps around the area, looking for a place with a reasonably high contribution to the integral to move into next.

Random walk Monte Carlo methods are a kind of random [[Computer simulation|simulation]] or [[Monte Carlo method]]. However, whereas the random samples of the integrand used in a conventional [[Monte Carlo integration]] are [[statistically independent]], those used in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are ''[[correlation|correlated]]''. A [[Markov chain]] is constructed in such a way as to have the integrand as its [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|equilibrium distribution]].

====Examples====
[[File:Metropolis algorithm convergence example.png|thumbnail|upright=1.25|Convergence of the [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm]]. Markov chain Monte Carlo attempts to approximate the blue distribution with the orange distribution.]]
Examples of random walk Monte Carlo methods include the following:

* [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm]]: This method generates a [[random walk]] using a proposal density and a method for rejecting some of the proposed moves.
* [[Gibbs sampling]]: This method requires all the [[conditional distribution]]s of the target distribution to be sampled exactly. When drawing from the full-conditional distributions is not straightforward other samplers-within-Gibbs are used (e.g., see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Gibbs Sampling|journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series C (Applied Statistics)|date = 1992-01-01|pages = 337–348|volume = 41|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/2347565|first = W. R.|last = Gilks|first2 = P.|last2 = Wild|jstor=2347565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Adaptive Rejection Metropolis Sampling within Gibbs Sampling|journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series C (Applied Statistics)|date = 1995-01-01|pages = 455–472|volume = 44|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2986138|first = W. R.|last = Gilks|first2 = N. G.|last2 = Best|first3 = K. K. C.|last3 = Tan|jstor=2986138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Independent Doubly Adaptive Rejection Metropolis Sampling Within Gibbs Sampling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7080917|journal = IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1053-587X|pages = 3123–3138|volume = 63|issue = 12|doi = 10.1109/TSP.2015.2420537|first = L.|last = Martino|first2 = J.|last2 = Read|first3 = D.|last3 = Luengo|arxiv = 1205.5494|bibcode = 2015ITSP...63.3123M |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Gibbs sampling is popular partly because it does not require any 'tuning'.
* [[Slice sampling]]: This method depends on the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function.  It alternates uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal 'slice' defined by the current vertical position.
* [[Multiple-try Metropolis]]: This method is a variation of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm that allows multiple trials at each point. By making it possible to take larger steps at each iteration, it helps address the [[curse of dimensionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Multiple-Try Method and Local Optimization in Metropolis Sampling|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2000.10473908|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0162-1459|pages = 121–134|volume = 95|issue = 449|doi = 10.1080/01621459.2000.10473908|first = Jun S.|last = Liu|first2 = Faming|last2 = Liang|first3 = Wing Hung|last3 = Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the flexibility of the design of multiple try Metropolis schemes|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-013-0429-2|journal = Computational Statistics|date = 2013-07-11|issn = 0943-4062|pages = 2797–2823|volume = 28|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s00180-013-0429-2|first = Luca|last = Martino|first2 = Jesse|last2 = Read|arxiv = 1201.0646}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reversible-jump]]: This method is a variant of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm that allows proposals that change the dimensionality of the space.&lt;ref&gt;See Green 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that change dimensionality have long been used in [[statistical physics]] applications, where for some problems a distribution that is a [[grand canonical ensemble]] is used (e.g., when the number of molecules in a box is variable).  But the reversible-jump variant is useful when doing Markov chain Monte Carlo or Gibbs sampling over [[nonparametric]] Bayesian models such as those involving the [[Dirichlet process]] or [[Chinese restaurant process]], where the number of mixing components/clusters/etc. is automatically inferred from the data.

===Other Markov chain Monte Carlo methods===

====Training-based Markov chain Monte Carlo====
Unlike most of the current Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that ignore the previous trials, using a new algorithm the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is able to use the previous steps and generate the next candidate. This training-based algorithm is able to speed-up the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm by an order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad|title=Stochastic shale permeability matching: Three-dimensional characterization and modeling|journal=International Journal of Coal Geology|date=August 2016|volume=165|pages=231–242|doi=10.1016/j.coal.2016.08.024|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307626119_Stochastic_Shale_Permeability_Matching_Three-Dimensional_Characterization_and_Modeling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo methodologies are a class of [[mean field particle methods]] for obtaining [[Pseudo-random number sampling|random samples]] from a sequence of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity.&lt;ref name="dp13"&gt;{{cite book|last = Del Moral|first = Pierre|title = Mean field simulation for Monte Carlo integration|year = 2013|publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press|quote = Monographs on Statistics &amp; Applied Probability|url = http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466504059|pages = 626}}&lt;/ref&gt; These probabilistic models include path space state models with increasing time horizon, posterior distributions w.r.t. sequence of partial observations, increasing constraint level sets for conditional distributions, decreasing temperature schedules associated with some Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions, and many others. In principle, any Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler can be turned into an interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. These interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers can be interpreted as a way to run in parallel a sequence of Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. For instance, interacting [[simulated annealing]] algorithms are based on independent Metropolis-Hastings moves interacting sequentially with a selection-resampling type mechanism. In contrast to traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the precision parameter of this class of interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers is ''only'' related to the number of interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. These advanced particle methodologies belong to the class of Feynman-Kac particle models,&lt;ref name="dp04"&gt;{{cite book|last = Del Moral|first = Pierre|title = Feynman-Kac formulae.

Empirically it allows the reduction of both estimation error and convergence time by an order of magnitude {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

Operations Research 56, 4 (2008): 958-975.&lt;/ref&gt;  combines randomized quasi-Monte Carlo and Markov chain simulation by simulating &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; chains simultaneously in a way that the empirical distribution of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; states at any given step is a better approximation of the true distribution of the chain than with ordinary MCMC. In empirical experiments, the variance of the average of a function of the state sometimes converges at rate &lt;math&gt;O(n^{-2})&lt;/math&gt; or even faster, instead of the &lt;math&gt;O(n^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; Monte Carlo rate.&lt;ref&gt;L'Ecuyer, P., D. Munger, C. Lécot, and B. Tuffin. "Sorting Methods and Convergence Rates for Array-RQMC: Some Empirical Comparisons." Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 143 (2018), 191-201.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Reducing correlation====
More sophisticated methods use various ways of reducing the correlation between successive samples.  These algorithms may be harder to implement, but they usually exhibit faster convergence (i.e. fewer steps for an accurate result).

====Examples====
Examples of non-random walk Markov chain Monte Carlo methods include the following:

* [[Hybrid Monte Carlo]] (HMC): Tries to avoid random walk behaviour by introducing an auxiliary [[momentum]] vector and implementing [[Hamiltonian dynamics]], so the potential energy function is the target density.  The momentum samples are discarded after sampling.  The end result of Hybrid Monte Carlo is that proposals move across the sample space in larger steps; they are therefore less correlated and converge to the target distribution more rapidly.
* Some variations on slice sampling also avoid random walks.&lt;ref&gt;See Neal 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo and other methods that rely on the gradient (and possibly second derivative) of the log posterior to avoid random walks by making proposals that are more likely to be in the direction of higher probability density.&lt;ref&gt;See Stramer 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convergence==

Usually it is not hard to construct a Markov chain with the desired properties. The more difficult problem is to determine how many steps are needed to converge to the stationary distribution within an acceptable error.&lt;ref name="Gelman and Rubin, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelman|first1=A.|last2=Rubin|first2=D.B.|title=Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences (with discussion)|journal=Statistical Science|date=1992|volume=7|pages=457–511|doi=10.1214/ss/1177011136|bibcode=1992StaSc...7..457G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good chain will have [[Markov chain mixing time|rapid mixing]]: the stationary distribution is reached quickly starting from an arbitrary position. A standard empirical method to assess convergence is to run several independent simulated Markov chains and check that the ratio of inter-chain to intra-chain variances for all the parameters sampled is close to 1.&lt;ref name="Gelman and Rubin, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Colwes and Carlin, 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cowles|first1=M.K.|last2=Carlin|first2=B.P.|title=Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: a comparative review|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=1996|volume=91|pages=883–904|doi=10.1080/01621459.1996.10476956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can only approximate the target distribution, as there is always some residual effect of the starting position. More sophisticated Markov chain Monte Carlo-based algorithms such as [[coupling from the past]] can produce exact samples, at the cost of additional computation and an unbounded (though finite in expectation) [[running time]].

Many random walk Monte Carlo methods move around the equilibrium distribution in relatively small steps, with no tendency for the steps to proceed in the same direction. These methods are easy to implement and analyze, but unfortunately it can take a long time for the walker to explore all of the space. The walker will often double back and cover ground already covered.

Midy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leavitt|first=William G.|title=A Theorem on Repeating Decimals|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=June 1967|volume=74|issue=6|pages=669–673|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/mathfacpub/48/|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|doi=10.2307/2314251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemeny|first=John|title=The Secret Theorem of M. E. Midy = Casting In Nines|url=http://johnkemeny.com/blog/?p=393|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a statement about the [[decimal]] expansion of [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s ''a''/''p'' where ''p'' is a [[prime number|prime]] and ''a''/''p'' has a [[repeating decimal]] expansion with an [[even number|even]] period {{OEIS|id=A028416}}. If the period of the decimal representation of ''a''/''p'' is 2''n'', so that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{p}=0.\overline{a_1a_2a_3\dots a_na_{n+1}\dots a_{2n}}&lt;/math&gt;

then the digits in the second half of the repeating decimal period are the [[method of complements#Numeric complements|9s complement]] of the corresponding digits in its first half. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;a_i+a_{i+n}=9 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_1\dots a_n+a_{n+1}\dots a_{2n}=10^n-1. &lt;/math&gt;

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{13}=0.\overline{076923}\text{ and }076+923=999. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{17}=0.\overline{0588235294117647}\text{ and }05882352+94117647=99999999. &lt;/math&gt;

==Extended Midy's theorem==   
If ''k'' is any divisor of the period of the decimal expansion of ''a''/''p'' (where ''p'' is again a prime), then Midy's theorem can be generalised as follows. The '''extended Midy's theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;Bassam Abdul-Baki, [http://www.abdulbaki.org/math/Midys_Theorem.pdf ''Extended Midy's Theorem''], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; states that if the repeating portion of the decimal expansion of ''a''/''p'' is divided into ''k''-digit numbers, then their sum is a multiple of 10&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

For example,   
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{19}=0.\overline{052631578947368421} &lt;/math&gt;   
has a period of 18. Dividing the repeating portion into 6-digit numbers and summing them gives   
:&lt;math&gt;052631+578947+368421=999999.&lt;/math&gt;   
Similarly, dividing the repeating portion into 3-digit numbers and summing them gives   
:&lt;math&gt;052+631+578+947+368+421=2997=3\times999.&lt;/math&gt;

==Midy's theorem in other bases==
Midy's theorem and its extension do not depend on special properties of the decimal expansion, but work equally well in any [[base (exponentiation)|base]] ''b'', provided we replace 10&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 with ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and carry out addition in base ''b''.

For example, in [[octal]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{1}{19}=0.\overline{032745}_8 \\[8pt]
&amp; 032_8+745_8=777_8 \\[8pt]
&amp; 03_8+27_8+45_8=77_8.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[duodecimal]] (using inverted two and three for ten and eleven, respectively)

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{1}{19}=0.\overline{076\mathcal{E}45}_{12} \\[8pt]
&amp; 076_{12}+\mathcal{E}45_{12}=\mathcal{EEE}_{12} \\[8pt]
&amp; 07_{12}+6\mathcal{E}_{12}+45_{12}=\mathcal{EE}_{12}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of Midy's theorem==
Short proofs of Midy's theorem can be given using results from [[group theory]]. However, it is also possible to prove Midy's theorem using [[elementary algebra]] and [[modular arithmetic]]:

Let ''p'' be a prime and ''a''/''p'' be a fraction between 0 and 1. Suppose the expansion of ''a''/''p'' in base ''b'' has a period of ''ℓ'', so

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{a}{p} = [0.\overline{a_1a_2\dots a_\ell}]_b \\[6pt]
&amp; \Rightarrow\frac{a}{p}b^\ell = [a_1a_2\dots a_\ell.\overline{a_1a_2\dots a_\ell}]_b \\[6pt]
&amp; \Rightarrow\frac{a}{p}b^\ell = N+[0.\overline{a_1a_2\dots a_\ell}]_b=N+\frac{a}{p} \\[6pt]
&amp; \Rightarrow\frac{a}{p} = \frac{N}{b^\ell-1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the integer whose expansion in base ''b'' is the string ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is a multiple of ''p'' because (''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''a''/''p'' is an integer. Also ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;1 is ''not'' a multiple of ''p'' for any value of ''n'' less than ''ℓ'', because otherwise the repeating period of ''a''/''p'' in base ''b'' would be less than ''ℓ''.

Now suppose that ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''hk''. Then ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is a multiple of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. (To see this, substitute ''x'' for ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;; then ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is a factor of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. ) Say ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 =&amp;nbsp;''m''(''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1), so

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{p}=\frac{N}{m(b^k-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

But ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is a multiple of ''p''; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is ''not'' a multiple of ''p'' (because ''k'' is less than ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;); and ''p'' is a prime; so ''m'' must be a multiple of ''p'' and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{am}{p}=\frac{N}{b^k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

is an integer. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;N\equiv0\pmod{b^k-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

Now split the string ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; into ''h'' equal parts of length ''k'', and let these represent the integers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;...''N''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; in base ''b'', so that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
N_{h-1} &amp; = [a_1\dots a_k]_b \\
N_{h-2} &amp; = [a_{k+1}\dots a_{2k}]_b \\
&amp; {}\  \   \vdots \\
N_0 &amp; = [a_{l-k+1}\dots a_l]_b
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To prove Midy's extended theorem in base ''b'' we must show that the sum of the ''h'' integers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a multiple of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

Since ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is congruent to 1 modulo ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, any power of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; will also be congruent to 1 modulo ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. So

:&lt;math&gt;N=\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_ib^{ik}=\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_i(b^{k})^i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow N \equiv \sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_i \pmod{b^k-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_i \equiv 0 \pmod{b^k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which proves Midy's extended theorem in base ''b''.

To prove the original Midy's theorem, take the special case where ''h'' = 2. Note that ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are both represented by strings of ''k'' digits in base ''b'' so both satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;0 \leq N_i \leq b^k-1. &lt;/math&gt;

''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cannot both equal 0 (otherwise ''a''/''p'' = 0) and cannot both equal ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (otherwise ''a''/''p'' = 1), so

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; N_0+N_1 &lt; 2(b^k-1) &lt;/math&gt;

and since ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a multiple of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;N_0+N_1 = b^k-1. &lt;/math&gt;

==Corollary==
From the above,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{am}{p}&lt;/math&gt; is an integer

Thus &lt;math&gt;m \equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;

And thus for &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{l}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b^{\frac{l}{2}}+ 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} &lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{l}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and is an integer

:&lt;math&gt;b^{\frac{2}{3}l} + b^{\frac{l}{3}} + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} &lt;/math&gt;

and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6112">'''Minimum distance estimation (MDE)''' is a statistical method for fitting a mathematical model to data, usually the [[Empirical distribution function|empirical distribution]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]] (iid) [[Random variable|random]] [[Random sample|sample]] from a [[Statistical population|population]] with [[Cumulative distribution function|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;F(x;\theta)\colon \theta\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta\subseteq\mathbb{R}^k (k\geq 1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[empirical distribution function]] based on the sample.

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[estimator]] for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(x;\hat{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; is an estimator for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;d[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] returning some measure of [[Distance#General_case|"distance"]] between the two [[Dependent and independent variables#Mathematics|arguments]]. The functional &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle d&lt;/math&gt; is also called the criterion function.

If there exists a &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d[F(x;\hat{\theta}),F_n(x)]=\inf\{d[F(x;\theta),F_n(x)]; \theta\in\Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''minimum distance estimate''' of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statistics used in estimation==

Most theoretical studies of minimum distance estimation, and most applications, make use of "distance" measures which underlie already-established [[goodness of fit]] tests: the test statistic used in one of these tests is used as the distance measure to be minimised. Below are some examples of statistical tests that have been used for minimum distance estimation.

===Chi-square criterion===

The [[Pearson's chi-square test|chi-square test]] uses as its criterion the sum, over predefined groups, of the squared difference between the increases of the empirical distribution and the estimated distribution, weighted by the increase in the estimate for that group.

===Cramér–von Mises criterion===

The [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]] uses the integral of the squared difference between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Kolmogorov–Smirnov criterion===

The [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] uses the [[supremum]] of the [[absolute difference]] between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Anderson–Darling criterion===

The [[Anderson–Darling test]] is similar to the Cramér–von Mises criterion except that the integral is of a weighted version of the squared difference, where the weighting relates the variance of the empirical distribution function {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

==Theoretical results==

The theory of minimum distance estimation is related to that for the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding statistical [[goodness of fit]] tests. Often the cases of the [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]], the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[Anderson–Darling test]] are treated simultaneously by treating them as special cases of a more general formulation of a distance measure. Examples of the theoretical results that are available are: [[Consistency (statistics)|consistency]] of the parameter estimates; the asymptotic covariance matrices of the parameter estimates.

'''NitrosBase''' is a Russian&lt;ref&gt;

The database system supports [[Relational model|relational]], [[Graph database|graph]] and [[Document-oriented database|document]] database models.

== History ==

The developer initially implemented the database as a [[Triplestore|triplestore]], being a [[Semantic Web]] pioneer in [[Russia]].  Remodelling into a [[Multi-model database|multi-model database]] was supported by the [[Skolkovo Innovation Center]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://sk.ru/net/1121679/|title=LLC "NitrosData Rus" - Skolkovo Community |date= 2017 |accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The database is used in information systems that support the health-care reform in modern Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://zakupki.gov.ru/epz/contract/extendedsearch/results.html?sortDirection=true&amp;sortBy=PO_DATE_PUBLIKACII&amp;contractStageList=0%2C1%2C2%2C3&amp;budgetaryFunds=on&amp;extraBudgetaryFunds=on&amp;publishDateFrom=01.01.2015&amp;supplierTitle=7729660520|title=Russian government procurement system official website|date= 2015 |lang=ru|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

In NitrosBase, all data are stored in the format of the internal graph model, while data in other models are their views (representations; similar to [[View_(SQL)| SQL views]]). Regardless of the model in which format data were imported, it is possible to query them using the same query language thereby uniformely addressing data imported in different models.

Moreover, it is possible to query data in any model using query language that is native for that model. NitrosBase supports the following languages:

* [[SQL]] (with elements of object syntax) – for querying data in [[Relational model|relational]] view;
* [[SPARQL]] and [[Gremlin]]-style language ''GraphIQ'' – for querying data in [[Graph database|graph]] view;
* [[JSONiq]] and [[MongoDB]] Query – for querying data in [[Document-oriented database|document]] view.

== Implementation details ==

The internal graph model is close to RDF'''*''' which is used in [[:fr:Blazegraph|Blazegraph]] and [[Amazon Neptune]]. That allows it to treat the internal data graph both as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] graph and as Property Graph, performing queries both in [[SPARQL]] and [[Gremlin]]-style languages.

Instead of [[Database index|indexes]] based on [[B%2B tree|B+-trees]] traditionally used in [[Graph database|graph databases]], NitrosBase uses a sparse link index of its own devising. Another source of performance gain is storage optimization on the physical level in order to reduce the number of [[Random access|random access]] operations.

Like [[memSQL]], NitrosBase [[Translator (computing)|translates]] a query into [[C++]] code.

== Awards and achievements ==

Nitrosbase-derived product ''MS SQL Server Accelerator'' was awarded first prize at the ''Silicon Valley Open Doors'' ([http://www.svod.org www.svod.org]) conference in 2009 and named "startup of the day" of the [[Microsoft BizSpark]] program on {{date|2010-03-03}}.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[several complex variables]], the '''Ohsawa–Takegoshi theorem''' is a fundamental result concerning the [[Holomorphic function#Several variables|holomorphic]] extension of a [[Square-integrable function|&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt;]]-holomorphic function defined on a bounded [[Stein manifold]] (such as a [[pseudoconvex]] [[compact (mathematics)|compact]] set in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; of dimension less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) to a domain of higher dimension, with a bound on the growth. It was discovered by [[Takeo Ohsawa]] and Kensho Takegoshi in 1987,&lt;ref name="OT1987"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01166457?LI=true | title=On the extension of L2 holomorphic functions |author1=Ohsawa, T. |author2=Takegoshi, K. | journal=[[Mathematische Zeitschrift]] | year=1987 | volume=195 | issue=2 | pages=197–204 | doi=10.1007/BF01166457}}&lt;/ref&gt; using what have been described as ''ad hoc'' methods involving twisted [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]]s, but simpler proofs have since been discovered.&lt;ref name="Siu2011"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-011-4293-7 | title=Section extension from hyperbolic geometry of punctured disk and holomorphic family of flat bundles | author=Siu, Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12205">The '''Onsager–Machlup function''' is a function that summarizes the dynamics of a [[stochastic process#Continuous time and continuous state space|continuous stochastic process]]. It is used to define a probability density for a stochastic process, and it is similar to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] of a [[dynamical system]]. It is named after [[Lars Onsager]] and [[S. Machlup]] who were the first to consider such probability densities.&lt;ref&gt;Onsager, L. and Machlup, S. (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of a continuous stochastic process {{mvar|X}} from time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} to {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''T''}} in one dimension, satisfying a [[stochastic differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; dX_t = b(X_t)\,dt + \sigma(X_t)\,dW_t &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|W}} is a [[Wiener process]], can in approximation be described by the [[probability density function]] of its value {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} at a finite number of points in time {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:

:&lt;math&gt; p(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \left( \prod^{n-1}_{i=1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma(x_i)^2\Delta t_i}} \right) \exp\left(-\sum^{n-1}_{i=1} L\left(x_i,\frac{x_{i+1}-x_i}{\Delta t_i}\right) \, \Delta t_i \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; L(x,v) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{v - b(x)}{\sigma(x)}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|Δ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T''}}. A similar approximation is possible for processes in higher dimensions. The approximation is more accurate for smaller time step sizes {{math|Δ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, but in the limit {{math|Δ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' → 0}} the probability density function becomes ill defined, one reason being that the product of terms

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma(x_i)^2\Delta t_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[limit of a sequence#Infinite limits|diverges to infinity]]. In order to nevertheless define a density for the continuous stochastic process {{mvar|X}}, [[ratio]]s of probabilities of {{mvar|X}} lying within a small distance {{mvar|ε}} from [[smooth function|smooth]] curves {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are considered:&lt;ref&gt;Stratonovich, R. (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P\left( \left |X_t - \varphi_1(t) \right| \leq \varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right)}{P\left( \left |X_t - \varphi_2(t) \right | \leq \varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right)} \to \exp\left(-\int^T_0 L \left (\varphi_1(t),\dot{\varphi}_1(t) \right ) \, dt + \int^T_0 L \left (\varphi_2(t),\dot{\varphi}_2(t) \right) \, dt \right)&lt;/math&gt;

as {{math|''ε'' → 0}}, where {{mvar|L}} is the '''Onsager–Machlup function'''.

==Definition==
Consider a {{mvar|d}}-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] {{mvar|M}} and a [[diffusion process]] {{math|''X'' {{=}} {''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' : 0 ≤  ''t'' ≤ ''T''} }} on {{mvar|M}} with [[infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|infinitesimal generator]] {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}Δ&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''}}, where {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] and {{mvar|b}} is a [[vector field]]. For any two [[smooth function|smooth]] curves {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : [0, ''T''] → ''M''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow0} \frac{P\left( \rho(X_t,\varphi_1(t)) \leq \varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right)}{P\left( \rho(X_t,\varphi_2(t)) \leq \varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right)} = \exp\left( -\int^T_0 L \left (\varphi_1(t),\dot{\varphi}_1(t) \right ) \, dt  +\int^T_0 L \left (\varphi_2(t),\dot{\varphi}_2(t) \right ) \, dt  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[metric (mathematics)|Riemannian distance]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \dot{\varphi}_1, \dot{\varphi}_2&lt;/math&gt; denote the first [[derivative]]s of {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{mvar|L}} is called the '''Onsager–Machlup function'''.

The Onsager–Machlup function is given by&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Y. and Watanabe, S. (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fujita, T. and Kotani, S. (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittich, Olaf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L(x,v) = \tfrac{1}{2}\|v-b(x)\|_x^2 +\tfrac{1}{2}\operatorname{div}\, b(x) - \tfrac{1}{12}R(x), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{!!}} ⋅ {{!!}}&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the Riemannian norm in the [[tangent space]] {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(''M'')}} at {{mvar|x}}, {{math|div ''b''(''x'')}} is the [[divergence]] of {{mvar|b}} at {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''R''(''x'')}} is the [[scalar curvature]] at {{mvar|x}}.

==Examples==
The following examples give explicit expressions for the Onsager–Machlup function of a continuous stochastic processes.

===Wiener process on the real line===
The Onsager–Machlup function of a [[Wiener process]] on the [[real line]] {{math|'''R'''}} is given by&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, N. and Watanabe, S. (1980), Chapter VI, Section 9&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(x,v)=\tfrac{1}{2}|v|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;div class="NavFrame collapsed"&gt;
  &lt;div class="NavHead"&gt;[Proof]&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left"&gt;

Let {{math|''X'' {{=}} {''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' : 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''T''} }} be a Wiener process on {{math|'''R'''}} and let {{math|''φ'' : [0, ''T''] → '''R'''}} be a twice differentiable curve such that {{math|''φ''(0) {{=}} ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Define another process {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;φ&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} {''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;φ&lt;/sup&gt;'' : 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''T''} }} by {{math|''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;φ&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} ''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''φ''(''t'')}} and a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] {{math|''P&lt;sup&gt;φ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} by

:&lt;math&gt; P^\varphi = \exp\left( \int^T_0\dot{\varphi}(t) \, dX^\varphi_t + \int^T_0\tfrac{1}{2} \left |\dot{\varphi}(t) \right |^2 \, dt \right) \, dP. &lt;/math&gt;

For every {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, the probability that {{math|{{!}}''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''φ''(''t''){{!}} ≤ ''ε''}} for every {{math|''t'' ∈ [0, ''T'']}} satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
P \left ( \left |X_t-\varphi(t) \right |\leq\varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right ) &amp;=P\left ( \left |X^\varphi_t \right|\leq\varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right) \\
&amp;=\int_{\left \{ \left |X^\varphi_t \right |\leq\varepsilon\text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right\}} \exp\left( -\int^T_0\dot{\varphi}(t) \, dX^\varphi_t -\int^T_0\tfrac{1}{2}|\dot{\varphi}(t)|^2 \, dt \right) \, dP^\varphi.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Girsanov theorem|Girsanov's theorem]], the distribution of {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;φ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} under {{math|''P&lt;sup&gt;φ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} equals the distribution of {{mvar|X}} under {{mvar|P}}, hence the latter can be substituted by the former:

:&lt;math&gt;P(|X_t-\varphi(t)|\leq\varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T])=\int_{\left \{ \left |X^\varphi_t \right |\leq\varepsilon\text{ for every }t\in[0,T] \right\}} \exp\left( -\int^T_0\dot{\varphi}(t) \, dX_t -\int^T_0\tfrac{1}{2}|\dot{\varphi}(t)|^2 \, dt \right) \, dP.&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Itō's lemma]] it holds that

:&lt;math&gt; \int^T_0\dot{\varphi}(t) \, dX_t = \dot{\varphi}(T)X_T - \int^T_0\ddot{\varphi}(t)X_t \, dt, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \ddot{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; is the second derivative of {{mvar|φ}}, and so this term is of order {{mvar|ε}} on the event where {{math|{{!}}''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''{{!}} ≤ ε}} for every {{math|''t'' ∈ [0, ''T'']}} and will disappear in the limit {{math|''ε'' → 0}}, hence

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0} \frac{P(|X_t-\varphi(t)|\leq\varepsilon \text{ for every }t\in[0,T])}{P(|X_t|\leq\varepsilon\text{ for every } t \in [0,T])} =\exp\left( -\int^T_0\tfrac{1}{2}|\dot{\varphi}(t)|^2 \, dt \right).&lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Diffusion processes with constant diffusion coefficient on Euclidean space===
The Onsager–Machlup function in the one-dimensional case with constant [[Itō diffusion|diffusion coefficient]] {{mvar|σ}} is given by&lt;ref&gt;Dürr, D. and Bach, A. (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(x,v)=\frac{1}{2}\left|\frac{v-b(x)}{\sigma}\right|^2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{db}{dx}(x). &lt;/math&gt;

In the {{mvar|d}}-dimensional case, with {{mvar|σ}} equal to the unit matrix, it is given by&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, N. and Watanabe, S. (1980), Chapter VI, Section 9&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L(x,v)=\frac{1}{2}\|v-b(x)\|^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\operatorname{div}\, b)(x), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{!!}} ⋅ {{!!}}}} is the [[Euclidean norm]] and

:&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{div}\, b)(x) = \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} b_i(x).&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
Generalizations have been obtained by weakening the differentiability condition on the curve {{mvar|φ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitouni, O. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than taking the maximum distance between the stochastic process and the curve over a time interval, other conditions have been considered such as distances based on completely convex norms&lt;ref&gt;Shepp, L. and Zeitouni, O. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hölder, Besov and Sobolev type norms.&lt;ref&gt;Capitaine, M. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The Onsager–Machlup function can be used for purposes of reweighting and [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] trajectories,&lt;ref&gt;Adib, A.B. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as for determining the most probable trajectory of a diffusion process.&lt;ref&gt;Adib, A.B. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dürr, D. and Bach, A. (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1064">The '''parallel terraced scan''' is a [[multi-agent system|multi-agent]] based [[search algorithm|search technique]] that is basic to [[cognitive architecture]]s, such as [[copycat (software)|Copycat]], Letter-string, the Examiner, Tabletop, and others. It was developed by [[John Rehling]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] at the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]], [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. 

The parallel terraced scan builds on the concepts of the workspace, coderack, conceptual memory, and temperature. According to Hofstadter the [[Parallel Distributed Processing|parallel]] and [[Randomness|random]] nature of the processing captures aspects of human [[cognition]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''partition''' of an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} on the [[real number|real]] line is a finite [[sequence]] {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of real numbers such that

:{{mvar|''a'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''b''}}.

In other terms, a partition of a compact interval {{mvar|I}} is a strictly increasing sequence of numbers (belonging to the interval {{mvar|I}} itself) starting from the initial point of {{mvar|I}} and arriving at the final point of {{mvar|I}}.

Every interval of the form {{math|[''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is referred to as a '''subinterval''' of the partition ''x''.

==Refinement of a partition==
Another partition of the given interval, {{mvar|Q}}, is defined as a '''refinement of the partition''', {{mvar|P}}, when it contains all the points of {{mvar|P}} and possibly some other points as well; the partition {{mvar|Q}} is said to be “finer” than {{mvar|P}}. Given two partitions, {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}}, one can always form their '''common refinement''', denoted {{math|''P''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''Q''}}, which consists of all the points of {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}}, re-numbered in order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brannan|first=D.

==Norm of a partition==
The '''norm''' (or '''mesh''') of the partition

:{{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}

is the length of the longest of these subintervals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hijab|first=Omar|title=Introduction to Calculus and Classical Analysis|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9781441994882|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gb9fMqur9kC&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Vladimir Zorich|Zorich, Vladimir A.]]|title=Mathematical Analysis II|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=9783540406334|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XF8W9W-eyrgC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Partitions are used in the theory of the [[Riemann integral]], the [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]] and the [[regulated integral]]. Specifically, as finer partitions of a given interval are considered, their mesh approaches zero and the [[Riemann sum]] based on a given partition approaches the [[Riemann integral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghorpade|first1=Sudhir|last2=Limaye|first2=Balmohan||title=A Course in Calculus and Real Analysis|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9780387364254|page=213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ou53zXSBdocC&amp;pg=PA213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tagged partitions==
A '''tagged partition'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dudley|first1=Richard M.|last2=Norvaiša|first2=Rimas|title=Concrete Functional Calculus|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9781441969507|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fuuB59EiIagC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a partition of a given interval together with a finite sequence of numbers {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} subject to the conditions that for each {{mvar|i}},

:{{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In other words, a tagged partition is a partition together with a distinguished point of every subinterval: its mesh is defined in the same way as for an ordinary partition. It is possible to define a [[partial order]] on the set of all tagged partitions by saying that one tagged partition is bigger than another if the bigger one is a refinement of the smaller one.{{Citation needed|reason=I suspect it might be that a partition is smaller than another if the smaller one refines the bigger one.|date=March 2014}}

Suppose that {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} together with {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a tagged partition of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and that {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} together with {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is another tagged partition of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. We say that {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} together is a '''refinement of a tagged partition''' {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} together with {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} if for each integer {{mvar|i}} with {{math|0 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}, there is an integer {{math|''r''(''i'')}} such that {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''r''(''i'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} and such that {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''s&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for some {{mvar|j}} with {{math|''r''(''i'') ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''r''(''i'' + 1) − 1}}. Said more simply, a refinement of a tagged partition takes the starting partition and adds more tags, but does not take any away.

'''Paul Seymour''' (born July 26, 1950) is currently a professor at [[Princeton University]]; half in the department of mathematics and half in the program in applied and computational math. His research interest is in [[discrete mathematics]], especially  [[graph theory]]. He (with others) was responsible for important progress on [[regular matroid]]s and [[totally unimodular matrix|totally unimodular matrices]], the [[four colour theorem]], [[linkless embedding]]s, [[Robertson–Seymour theorem|graph minors and structure]], the [[perfect graph|perfect graph conjecture]], the [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)|Hadwiger conjecture]], and [[claw-free graph]]s. Many of his recent papers are available from his website.&lt;ref name="Papers website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seymour|first=Paul|title=Online Papers|url=https://web.math.princeton.edu/~pds/online.html|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won a [[Sloan Fellowship]] in 1983, and the [[Ostrowski Prize]] in 2004; and (sometimes with others) won the [[Fulkerson Prize]] in 1979, 1994, 2006 and 2009, and the [[George Pólya Prize|Pólya Prize]] in 1983 and 2004. He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 2008 and one from the [[Technical University of Denmark]] in 2013.

==Early life==
Seymour was born in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. He was a day student at [[Plymouth College]], and then studied at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], gaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1971, and [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] in 1975.

==Career==

From 1974–1976 he was a college research fellow at [[Swansea University|University College of Swansea]], and then returned to Oxford for 1976–1980 as a Junior Research Fellow at [[Merton College, Oxford]], with the year 1978–79 at [[University of Waterloo]]. He became an associate and then a full professor at [[Ohio State University]], [[Columbus, Ohio]], between 1980 and 1983, where he began research with [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Neil Robertson]],
a fruitful collaboration that continued for many years. From 1983 until 1996, he was at [[Bellcore]] (Bell Communications Research), [[Morristown, New Jersey]] (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]). He was also an adjunct professor at [[Rutgers University]] from 1984–1987 and at the University of Waterloo from 1988–1993. He became professor at [[Princeton University]] in 1996. He is Editor-in-Chief (jointly with [[Carsten Thomassen]]) for the ''[[Journal of Graph Theory]]''.

==Personal life==

He married Shelley MacDonald of [[Ottawa]] in 1979, and they have two children, Amy and Emily. The couple separated amicably in 2007. His brother [[Leonard W. Seymour]] is Professor of [[gene therapy]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6251303.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major contributions==
Combinatorics in Oxford in the 1970s was dominated by [[matroid theory]], due
to the influence of [[Dominic Welsh]] and [[Aubrey William Ingleton]].
Much of Seymour's early work, up to about 1980, was on matroid theory, and
included three important matroid results: his D.Phil. thesis
on matroids with the max-flow min-cut property (for which he won his first
Fulkerson prize); a characterization by excluded minors of the matroids
representable over the three-element field; and a theorem that all 
[[regular matroid]]s consist of graphic and cographic matroids pieced together in a
simple way (which won his first Pólya prize). There were several other
significant papers from this period: a paper with Welsh on the critical
probabilities for bond percolation on the square lattice; a paper in which
the [[cycle double cover]] conjecture was introduced; a paper on
edge-multicolouring of cubic graphs, which foreshadows
the matching lattice theorem of [[László Lovász]]; a paper proving that all
bridgeless graphs admit nowhere-zero 6-flows, a step towards [[nowhere-zero flow|Tutte's nowhere-zero 5-flow conjecture]];
and a paper solving the
two-paths problem, which was the engine behind much of Seymour's
future work.

In 1980 he moved to Ohio State University, and began work with Neil
Robertson. This led eventually to Seymour's most important accomplishment,
the so-called "Graph Minors Project", a series of 23 papers (joint with Robertson), 
published over the next thirty years, with several
significant results: the [[graph structure theorem|graph minors structure theorem]],
that for any fixed graph, all graphs that do not contain it as a minor
can be built from graphs that are essentially of bounded genus by piecing them
together at small cutsets in a tree structure; a proof of a conjecture
of [[Klaus Wagner|Wagner]] that in any infinite set of graphs, one of them is a minor
of another (and consequently that any property of graphs that can be characterized by excluded minors can be characterized by a finite list of excluded minors);
a proof of a similar conjecture of [[Crispin Nash-Williams|Nash-Williams]] that in any infinite set
of graphs, one of them can be immersed in another; and
polynomial-time algorithms to test if a graph contains a fixed graph as a
minor, and to solve the k vertex-disjoint paths problem for all fixed k.

In about 1990 Robin Thomas began to work with Robertson and Seymour. Their
collaboration resulted in several important joint papers over the next ten years:
a proof of a conjecture of [[Horst Sachs|Sachs]], characterizing
by excluded minors the graphs that admit [[linkless embedding]]s in 3-space;
a proof that every graph that is not five-colourable has a six-vertex complete
graph as a minor (the four-colour theorem is assumed to obtain this result, which is a
case of [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)|Hadwiger's conjecture]]);
with Dan Sanders, a new, simplified, computer based proof of the [[four color theorem|four-colour theorem]];
a description of the bipartite graphs that admit Pfaffian orientations;
and the reduction to the ``almost-planar'' case of a conjecture of [[W. T. Tutte|Tutte]] that every
bridgeless cubic graph that is not three-edge-colourable contains the Petersen graph
as a minor. (The remaining ``almost-planar'' case has now been solved, completing the proof of Tutte's conjecture, in papers
by subsets of Sanders, Seymour, Thomas and Katherine Edwards. This does not assume the four-colour theorem, and re-proves it in an extended form).

In 2000 the trio were supported by the [[American Institute of Mathematics]] to
work on the [[perfect graph|strong perfect graph conjecture]], a famous
open question that had been raised by [[Claude Berge]] in the early 1960s.
Seymour's student [[Maria Chudnovsky]] joined them in 2001, and in 2002
the four jointly proved the conjecture.
Seymour continued to work with Chudnovsky, and obtained several more
results about induced subgraphs, in particular (with
[[Gérard Cornuéjols|Cornuéjols]], Liu, Vuskovic) a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether
a graph is perfect, and
a general description of all claw-free graphs. Most recently, in a series of papers with Alex Scott and partly with Chudnovsky,
they proved two conjectures of [[Andras Gyarfas]], that every graph with bounded clique number and sufficiently large
chromatic number has an induced cycle of odd length at least five, and has an induced cycle of length at least
any specified number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11169">For a [[plane curve]] ''C'' and a given fixed point ''O'', the '''pedal equation''' of the curve is a relation between ''r'' and ''p'' where ''r'' is the distance from ''O'' to a point on ''C'' and ''p'' is the perpendicular distance from ''O'' to the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to ''C'' at the point. The point ''O'' is called the ''pedal point'' and the values ''r'' and ''p'' are sometimes called the ''pedal coordinates'' of a point relative to the curve and the pedal point. It is also useful to measure the distance of ''O'' to the normal &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; (the ''contrapedal coordinate'') even though it is not an independent quantity and it relates to &lt;math&gt;(r,p)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;p_c:=\sqrt{r^2-p^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Some curves have particularly simple pedal equations and knowing the pedal equation of a curve may simplify the calculation of certain of its properties such as curvature. This coordinates are also well suited for solving certain type of force problems in [[classical mechanics]] and [[celestial mechanics]].

==Equations==

===Cartesian coordinates===
For ''C'' given in [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]] by ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and with ''O'' taken to be the origin, the pedal coordinates of the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') are given by:&lt;ref&gt;Yates §1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{x\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+y\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The pedal equation can be found by eliminating ''x'' and ''y'' from these equations and the equation of the curve.

The expression for ''p'' may be simplified if the equation of the curve is written in [[Homogeneous polynomial#Homogenization|homogeneous coordinates]] by introducing a variable ''z'', so that the equation of the curve is ''g''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The value of ''p'' is then given by&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the result is evaluated at ''z''=1

===Polar coordinates===
For ''C'' given in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] by ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(θ), then

:&lt;math&gt;p=r\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Tangential angle#Polar tangential angle|polar tangential angle]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{dr}{d\theta}\tan \phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The pedal equation can be found by eliminating θ from these equations.&lt;ref&gt;Yates p. 166, Edwards p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, from the above we can find that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right|=\frac{r p_c}{p},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; p_c:=\sqrt{r^2-p^2} &lt;/math&gt; is the "contrapedal" coordinate, i.e. distance to the normal. This implies that if a curve satisfies an autonomous differential equation in polar coordinates of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(r,\left|\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right|\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
its pedal equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(r,\frac{rp_c}{p}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Example====
As an example take the logarithmic spiral with the spiral angle α:
:&lt;math&gt;
r=a e^{\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} \theta}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dr}{d\theta}= \frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} a e^{\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} \theta}=\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} r,
&lt;/math&gt;
hence 
:&lt;math&gt; \left|\frac{d r}{d \theta}\right|=\left|\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}\right| r, &lt;/math&gt;
and thus in pedal coordinates we get
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{r}{p}p_c=\left|\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}\right| r, \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad |\sin\alpha| p_c=|\cos\alpha| p,&lt;/math&gt;
or using the fact that &lt;math&gt; p_c^2=r^2-p^2&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
:&lt;math&gt; p=|\sin\alpha|r.&lt;/math&gt;

This approach can be generalized to include autonomous differential equations of any order as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Blaschke Proposition 1&lt;/ref&gt; A curve ''C'' which a solution of an ''n''-th order autonomous differential equation (&lt;math&gt;n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) in polar coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; f\left(r,|r'_{\theta}|,r''_{\theta},|r'''_{\theta}|\dots,r_\theta^{(2j)},|r_\theta^{(2j+1)}|,\dots, r_\theta^{(n)}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[pedal curve]] of a curve given in pedal coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt; f(p,p_c, p_c p_c',p_c (p_c p_c')',\dots, (p_c\partial_p)^n p)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the differentiation is done with respect to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Force problems===
Solutions to some force problems of classical mechanics can be surprisingly easily obtained in pedal coordinates.

Consider a dynamical system:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot x=F^\prime(|x|^2)x+2 G^\prime(|x|^2){\dot x}^\perp,&lt;/math&gt;

describing an evolution of a test particle (with position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot x&lt;/math&gt;) in the plane in the presence of central &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and Lorentz like &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; potential. The quantities:

:&lt;math&gt; L=x\cdot \dot x^\perp+G(|x|^2), \qquad c=|\dot x|^2-F(|x|^2), &lt;/math&gt;

are conserved in this system.

Then the curve traced by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is given in pedal coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\left(L-G(r^2)\right)^2}{p^2}=F(r^2)+c,&lt;/math&gt;

with the pedal point at the origin. This fact was discovered by P. Blaschke in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Blaschke Theorem 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
As an example consider the so-called [[Kepler problem]], i.e. central force problem, where the force varies inversely as a square of the distance:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{x}=-\frac{M}{|x|^{3}}x, &lt;/math&gt;

we can arrive at the solution immediately in pedal coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L^2}{p^2}=\frac{2M}{r}+c, &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the particle's angular momentum and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to its energy. Thus we have obtained the equation of a conic section in pedal coordinates.

Inversely, for a given curve ''C'', we can easily deduce what forces do we have to impose on a test particle to move along it.

==Pedal equations for specific curves==

===Sinusoidal spirals===
For a [[sinusoidal spiral]] written in the form 
:&lt;math&gt;r^n = a^n \sin(n \theta)&lt;/math&gt;
the polar tangential angle is 
:&lt;math&gt;\psi = n\theta&lt;/math&gt;
which produces the pedal equation
:&lt;math&gt;pa^n=r^{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The pedal equation for a number of familiar curves can be obtained setting ''n'' to specific values:&lt;ref&gt;Yates p. 168, Edwards p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirals===
A spiral shaped curve of the form
:&lt;math&gt;r = c \theta^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
satisfies the equation
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dr}{d\theta}=\alpha r^{\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;
and thus can be easily converted into pedal coordinates as 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p^2}=\frac{\alpha^2 c^{\frac{2}{\alpha}}}{r^{2+\frac{2}{\alpha}}}+\frac{1}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y (\theta) = (a + b) \sin \theta - b \sin \left( \frac{a + b}{b} \theta \right),&lt;/math&gt;
the pedal equation with respect to the origin is&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^2=a^2+\frac{4(a+b)b}{(a+2b)^2}p^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13110">The aim of a '''probabilistic logic''' (also '''probability logic''' and '''probabilistic reasoning''')  is to combine the capacity of [[probability theory]] to handle [[uncertainty]] with the capacity of [[deductive logic]] to exploit structure of [[formal proof|formal argument]]. The result is a richer and more expressive formalism with a broad range of possible application areas. Probabilistic logics attempt to find a natural extension of traditional logic truth tables: the results they define are derived through probabilistic expressions instead. A difficulty with probabilistic logics is that they tend to multiply the computational complexities of their probabilistic and logical components.  Other difficulties include the possibility of counter-intuitive results, such as those of [[Dempster-Shafer theory]] in [[evidence-based subjective logic]]. The need to deal with a broad variety of contexts and issues has led to many different proposals.

==Historical context==
There are numerous proposals for probabilistic logics.  Very roughly, they can be categorized into two different classes: those logics that attempt to make a probabilistic extension to [[logical consequence|logical entailment]], such as [[Markov logic network]]s, and those that attempt to address the problems of uncertainty and lack of evidence (evidentiary logics).

That probability and uncertainty are not quite the same thing may be understood by noting that, despite the mathematization of probability in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], mathematical [[probability theory]] remains, to this very day, entirely unused in criminal courtrooms, when evaluating the "probability" of the guilt of a suspected criminal.&lt;ref name=franklin&gt;James Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal'', 2001 The Johns Hopkins Press, {{isbn|0-8018-7109-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, in evidentiary logic, there is a need to distinguish the truth of a statement from the confidence in its truth: thus, being uncertain of a suspect's guilt is not the same as assigning a numerical probability to the commission of the crime.  A single suspect may be guilty or not guilty, just as a coin may be flipped heads or tails.  Given a large collection of suspects, a certain percentage may be guilty, just as the probability of flipping "heads" is one-half.   However, it is incorrect to take this law of averages with regard to a single criminal (or single coin-flip): the criminal is no more "a little bit guilty" than a single coin flip is "a little bit heads and a little bit tails": we are merely uncertain as to which it is.  Conflating probability and uncertainty may be acceptable when making scientific measurements of physical quantities, but it is an error, in the context of "common sense" reasoning and logic.  Just as in courtroom reasoning, the goal of employing uncertain inference is to gather evidence to strengthen the confidence of a proposition, as opposed to performing some sort of probabilistic entailment.

Historically, attempts to quantify probabilistic reasoning date back to antiquity. There was a particularly strong interest starting in the 12th century, with the work of the [[Scholastics]], with the invention of the [[half-proof]] (so that two half-proofs are sufficient to prove guilt), the elucidation of [[moral certainty]] (sufficient certainty to act upon, but short of absolute certainty), the development of [[Catholic probabilism]] (the idea that it is always safe to follow the established rules of doctrine or the opinion of experts, even when they are less probable), the [[case-based reasoning]] of [[casuistry]], and the scandal of [[Laxism]] (whereby probabilism was used to give support to almost any statement at all, it being possible to find an expert opinion in support of almost any proposition.).&lt;ref name=franklin/&gt;

==Modern proposals==
Below is a list of proposals for probabilistic and evidentiary extensions to classical and predicate logic.

* The term "''probabilistic logic''" was first used in a paper by [[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] published in 1986, where the [[truth value]]s of sentences are [[probabilities]].&lt;ref name="N86"&gt;Nilsson, N. J., 1986, "Probabilistic logic," ''Artificial Intelligence'' 28(1): 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed semantical generalization induces a probabilistic logical [[entailment]], which reduces to ordinary logical [[entailment]] when the probabilities of all sentences are either 0 or 1. This generalization applies to any [[logical system]] for which the consistency of a finite set of sentences can be established.
* The central concept in the theory of [[subjective logic]]&lt;ref name="JO1"&gt;Jøsang, A., 2001, "A logic for uncertain probabilities," ''[[International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems]]'' 9(3):279-311.&lt;/ref&gt; are ''opinions'' about some of the [[propositional variable]]s involved in the given logical sentences. A binomial opinion applies to a single proposition and is represented as a 3-dimensional extension of a single probability value to express various degrees of ignorance about the truth of the proposition. For the computation of derived opinions based on a structure of argument opinions, the theory proposes respective operators for various logical connectives, such as e.g. multiplication ([[Logical conjunction|AND]]), comultiplication ([[Logical disjunction|OR]]), division (UN-AND) and co-division (UN-OR) of opinions &lt;ref name="JO4"&gt;Jøsang, A. and McAnally, D., 2004, "Multiplication and Comultiplication of Beliefs," ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', 38(1), pp.19-51, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as well as conditional deduction ([[Modus ponens|MP]]) and abduction ([[Modus tollens|MT]]).&lt;ref name="JO8"&gt;Jøsang, A., 2008, "[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/14842/1/14842.pdf Conditional Reasoning with Subjective Logic]," ''Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic and Soft Computing'', 15(1), pp.5-38, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Approximate reasoning formalism proposed by [[fuzzy logic]] can be used to obtain a logic in which the models are the probability distributions and the theories are the lower envelopes.&lt;ref name="G94"&gt;Gerla, G., 1994, "[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004370294901023 Inferences in Probability Logic]," ''Artificial Intelligence'' 70(1–2):33–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a logic the question of the consistency of the available information is strictly related with the one of the coherence of partial probabilistic assignment and therefore with [[Dutch book]] phenomenon.
* [[Markov logic network]]s implement a form of [[uncertain inference]] based on the [[maximum entropy principle]]—the idea that probabilities should be assigned in such a way as to maximize entropy, in analogy with the way that [[Markov chain]]s assign probabilities to [[finite state machine]] transitions.
* Systems such as [[Pei Wang]]'s [[Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System]] (NARS) or [[Ben Goertzel]]'s [[Probabilistic Logic Network]]s (PLN) add an explicit confidence ranking, as well as a probability to [[atomic formula|atoms]] and sentences.  The rules of deduction and induction incorporate this uncertainty, thus side-stepping difficulties in purely Bayesian approaches to logic (including Markov logic), while also avoiding the paradoxes of [[Dempster-Shafer theory]].  The implementation of PLN attempts to use and generalize algorithms from [[logic programming]], subject to these extensions.
* In the theory of [[probabilistic argumentation]],&lt;ref name="KM95"&gt;Kohlas, J., and Monney, P.A., 1995.

Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HO5"&gt;Haenni, R, 2005, "[http://www.sipta.org/isipta05/proceedings/papers/s007.pdf Towards a Unifying Theory of Logical and Probabilistic Reasoning]," ISIPTA'05, 4th International Symposium on Imprecise Probabilities and Their Applications: 193-202. {{cite web |url=http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~run/papers/haenni05d.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618205254/http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~run/papers/haenni05d.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; probabilities are not directly attached to logical sentences. Instead it is assumed that a particular subset &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of the variables &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; involved in the sentences defines a [[probability space]] over the corresponding sub-[[σ-algebra]]. This induces two distinct probability measures with respect to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, which are called ''degree of support'' and ''degree of possibility'', respectively. Degrees of support can be regarded as non-additive ''probabilities of provability'', which generalizes the concepts of ordinary logical [[entailment]] (for &lt;math&gt;V=\{\}&lt;/math&gt;) and classical [[posterior probability|posterior probabilities]] (for &lt;math&gt;V=W&lt;/math&gt;). Mathematically, this view is compatible with the [[Dempster-Shafer theory]].
* The theory of [[evidential reasoning approach|evidential reasoning]]&lt;ref name="RLS92"&gt;Ruspini, E.H., Lowrance, J., and Strat, T., 1992, "Understanding evidential reasoning," ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', 6(3): 401-424.&lt;/ref&gt; also defines non-additive ''probabilities of probability'' (or ''epistemic probabilities'') as a general notion for both logical [[entailment]] (provability) and [[probability]]. The idea is to augment standard [[propositional logic]] by considering an epistemic operator '''K''' that represents the state of knowledge that a rational agent has about the world. Probabilities are then defined over the resulting ''epistemic universe'' '''K'''''p'' of all propositional sentences ''p'', and it is argued that this is the best information available to an analyst. From this view, [[Dempster-Shafer theory]] appears to be a generalized form of probabilistic reasoning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2085">'''Saint-Venant's principle''', named after [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant]], a [[French people|French]] [[elasticity (mathematics)|elasticity theorist]],  may be expressed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus Edward Hough Love|A. E. H. Love]], "A treatise on the mathematical theory of elasticity," Cambridge University Press, 1927. (Dover reprint {{ISBN|0-486-60174-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... the difference between the effects of two different but statically equivalent loads becomes very small at sufficiently large distances from load.}}

The original statement was published in French by Saint-Venant in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. C. B. Saint-Venant,  1855, Memoire sur la Torsion des Prismes, Mem. Divers Savants, 14, pp. 233–560.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this informal statement of the principle is well known among structural and mechanical engineers, more recent mathematical literature gives a rigorous interpretation in the context of partial differential equations. An early such interpretation was made by [[Richard von Mises|von Mises]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Mises, On Saint-Venant's Principle. Bull. AMS, 51, 555–562, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saint-Venant's principle allows elasticians to replace complicated stress distributions or weak boundary conditions with ones that are easier to solve, as long as that boundary is geometrically short. Quite analogous to the [[electrostatics]], where the [[electric field]] due to the ''i''-th moment of the load (with 0th being the net charge, 1st the [[dipole]], 2nd the [[quadrupole]]) decays as &lt;math&gt;1/r^{i+2} &lt;/math&gt;  over space, Saint-Venant's principle states that high order momentum of mechanical load (moment with order higher than [[torque]]) decays so fast that they never need to be considered for regions far from the short boundary. Therefore, the Saint-Venant's principle can be regarded as a statement on the [[asymptotic]] behavior of the [[Green's function]] by a point-load.

[[File:Scalar field.png|thumb|right|A scalar field such as temperature or pressure, where intensity of the field is represented by different hues of color.]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], a '''scalar field''' associates a scalar value to every point in a [[space (mathematics)|space]] – possibly [[physical space]]. The scalar may either be a ([[dimensionless]]) [[scalar (mathematics)|mathematical number]] or a [[scalar (physics)|physical quantity]]. In a physical context, scalar fields are required to be independent of the choice of reference frame, meaning that any two observers using the same units will agree on the value of the scalar field at the same absolute point in space (or [[spacetime]]) regardless of their respective points of origin.  Examples used in physics include the [[temperature]] distribution throughout space, the [[pressure]] distribution in a fluid, and spin-zero quantum fields, such as the [[Higgs field]].  These fields are the subject of [[scalar field theory]].

==Definition==
Mathematically, a scalar field on a [[Region (mathematical analysis)|region]] ''U'' is a [[real-valued function|real]] or [[complex-valued function]] or [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] on ''U''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Apostol |authorlink=Tom Apostol |title=Calculus  
   |volume=II |publisher=Wiley |year=1969 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|title=Scalar|id=s/s083240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region ''U''may be a set in some [[Euclidean space]], [[Minkowski space]], or more generally a subset of a [[manifold]], and it is typical in mathematics to impose further conditions on the field, such that it be [[continuous function|continuous]] or often [[continuously differentiable]] to some order. A scalar field is a [[tensor field]] of order zero,&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|id=s/s083260|title=Scalar field}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term "scalar field" may be used to distinguish a function of this kind with a more general tensor field, [[density bundle|density]], or [[differential form]].

[[File:Scalar Field.ogv|thumb|The scalar field of &lt;math&gt;\sin (2\pi(xy+\sigma))&lt;/math&gt; oscillating as &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; increases. Red represents positive values, purple represents negative values, and sky blue represents values close to zero.]]

Physically, a scalar field is additionally distinguished by having [[units of measurement]] associated with it. In this context, a scalar field should also be independent of the coordinate system used to describe the physical system—that is, any two [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]s using the same units must agree on the numerical value of a scalar field at any given point of physical space. Scalar fields are contrasted with other physical quantities such as [[vector field]]s, which associate a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] to every point of a region, as well as [[tensor field]]s and [[spinor|spinor fields]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} More subtly, scalar fields are often contrasted with [[pseudoscalar]] fields.

==Uses in physics==
In physics, scalar fields often describe the [[potential energy]] associated with a particular [[force]].  The force is a [[vector field]], which can be obtained as the [[gradient]] of the potential energy scalar field.  Examples include:
*[[Potential field]]s, such as the Newtonian [[gravitational potential]], or the [[electric potential]] in [[electrostatics]], are scalar fields which describe the more familiar forces.
* A [[temperature]], [[humidity]] or [[pressure]] field, such as those used in [[meteorology]].

===Examples in quantum theory and relativity===
* In [[quantum field theory]], a [[Bosonic field|scalar field]] is associated with spin-0 particles. The scalar field may be real or complex valued. Complex scalar fields represent charged particles. These include the charged [[Higgs field]] of the [[Standard Model]], as well as the charged [[pions]] mediating the [[strong nuclear interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Technically, pions are actually examples of [[pseudoscalar meson]]s, which fail to be invariant under spatial inversion, but are otherwise invariant under Lorentz transformations.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Standard Model]] of elementary particles, a scalar [[Higgs field]] is used to give the [[lepton]]s and [[W and Z bosons|massive vector bosons]] their mass, via a combination of the [[Yukawa interaction]] and the [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. This mechanism is known as the [[Higgs mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P.W. Higgs|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=13|issue=16|pages=508|date=Oct 1964|title=Broken Symmetries and the Masses of Gauge Bosons|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.508|bibcode = 1964PhRvL..13..508H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate for the [[Higgs boson]] was first detected at CERN in 2012.
* In [[scalar theories of gravitation]] scalar fields are used to describe the gravitational field.
* [[Scalar-tensor theory|scalar-tensor theories]] represent the gravitational interaction through both a tensor and a scalar. Such attempts are for example the [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]] theory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Jordan |title=Schwerkraft und Weltall |publisher=Vieweg |location=Braunschweig |year=1955 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snJTcgAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a generalization of the [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] and the [[Brans–Dicke theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. |last=Brans |first2=R. |last2=Dicke |title=Mach's Principle and a Relativistic Theory of Gravitation |journal=Phys.

* Scalar fields are found within superstring theories as [[dilaton]] fields, breaking the conformal symmetry of the string, though balancing the quantum anomalies of this tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C.

Massless (i.e. long-ranged) scalar fields in this context are known as [[inflaton]]s. Massive (i.e. short-ranged) scalar fields are proposed, too, using for example Higgs-like fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.

==Other kinds of fields==
*[[Vector field]]s, which associate a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] to every point in space.  Some examples of [[vector field]]s include the [[electromagnetic field]] and the Newtonian gravitational field.
*[[Tensor field]]s, which associate a [[tensor]] to every point in space.  For example, in [[general relativity]] gravitation is associated with the tensor field called [[Einstein tensor]]. In [[Kaluza–Klein theory]], spacetime is extended to five dimensions and its [[Riemann curvature tensor]] can be separated out into ordinary [[dimension|four-dimensional]] gravitation plus an extra set, which is equivalent to [[Maxwell's equations]] for the [[electromagnetic field]], plus an extra scalar field known as the "[[dilaton]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The dilaton scalar is also found among the massless bosonic fields in [[string theory]].

[[File:PlusMinus.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[plus and minus signs|plus and minus symbols]] are used to show the sign of a number.]]

In [[mathematics]], the concept of '''sign''' originates from the property of every non-zero [[real number]] of being positive or [[negative number|negative]]. [[0 (number)|Zero]] itself is signless, although in some contexts it makes sense to consider a [[signed zero]], and in some contexts it makes sense to call 0 its own sign. Along with its application to real numbers, "change of sign" is used throughout mathematics and [[physics]] to denote the [[additive inverse]] (negation, or multiplication by [[−1]]), even for quantities which are not real numbers (so, which are not prescribed to be either positive, negative, or zero). Also, the word "sign" can indicate aspects of mathematical objects that resemble positivity and negativity, such as the [[Parity of a permutation|sign of a permutation]] (see [[#Other meanings|below]]).

==Sign of a number==
Every number has multiple attributes (such as value, sign and [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]). A [[real number]] is said to be positive if its value (''not'' its magnitude) is [[inequality (mathematics)|greater than]] zero, and [[negative number|negative]] if it is less than zero.  The attribute of being positive or negative is called the '''sign''' of the number.  Zero itself is not considered to have a sign (though this is context dependent, see below).  Also, signs are not defined for [[complex numbers]], although the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] generalizes it in some sense.

In common [[numeral system|numeral notation]] (which is used in [[arithmetic]] and elsewhere), the sign of a number is often denoted by placing [[plus and minus signs|a plus sign or a minus sign]] before the number.  For example, +3  denotes "positive three", and −3 denotes "negative three". When no plus or minus sign is given, the default interpretation is that a number is positive. Because of this notation, as well as the definition of negative numbers through [[subtraction]], the [[minus sign]] is perceived to have a strong association with negative numbers (of the negative sign). Likewise, "+" associates with positivity.

In [[algebra]], a minus sign is usually thought of as representing the operation of [[additive inverse]] (sometimes called ''negation''), with the additive inverse of a positive number being negative and the additive inverse of a negative number being positive.  In this context, it makes sense to write −(−3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+3.

Any non-zero number can be changed to a positive one using the [[absolute value]] function.  For example, the absolute value of −3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3.  In symbols, this would be written |−3| = 3 and |3| = 3.

===Sign of zero===
The number [[0 (number)|zero]] is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign.  In arithmetic, +0 and −0 both denote the same number 0, which is the additive inverse of itself.

Note that this definition is culturally determined. In France and Belgium, 0 is said to be both positive and negative. The positive numbers without zero and the negative numbers without zero are said to be "strictly positive" and "strictly negative" respectively.

In some contexts, such as [[signed number representations]] in [[computing]], it makes sense to consider signed versions of zero, with positive zero and negative zero being different numbers (see [[signed zero]]).

One also sees +0 and −0 in [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]] when evaluating [[one-sided limit]]s. This notation refers to the behaviour of a function as the input variable approaches 0 from positive or negative values respectively; these behaviours are not necessarily the same.

==={{anchor|non-negative and non-positive}} Terminology for signs===
&lt;!-- Several articles link to the above anchor --&gt;
Because zero is neither positive nor negative (in most countries), the following phrases are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:
* A number is '''positive''' if it is greater than zero.
* A number is '''negative''' if it is less than zero.
* A number is '''non-negative''' if it is greater than or equal to zero.
* A number is '''non-positive''' if it is less than or equal to zero.
Thus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero.  For example, the [[absolute value]] of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.

The same terminology is sometimes used for [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] that take real or integer values.  For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.

===Sign convention===
{{main|Sign convention}}
In many contexts the choice of sign convention (which range of values is considered positive and which negative) is natural, whereas in others the choice is arbitrary subject only to consistency, the latter necessitating an explicit sign convention.

==Sign function==
[[Image:Signum function.svg|thumb|200px|Signum function ''y'' = sgn(''x'')]]
{{main|Sign function}}
The '''sign function''' or '''signum function''' is sometimes used to extract the sign of a number.  This function is usually defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \sgn(x) = \begin{cases}
-1 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0, \\ 
~~\, 0 &amp; \text{if } x = 0, \\
~~\, 1 &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus sgn(''x'') is 1 when ''x'' is positive, and sgn(''x'') is −1 when ''x'' is negative.  For nonzero values of ''x'', this function can also be defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; \sgn(x) = \frac{x}{|x|} = \frac{|x|}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
where |''x''| is the [[absolute value]] of ''x''.

==Meanings of sign==

===Sign of an angle===
[[File:Angles on the unit circle.svg|right|thumb|Measuring from the [[x-axis]], angles on the [[unit circle]] count as positive in the [[counterclockwise]] direction, and negative in the [[clockwise]] direction.]]
In many contexts, it is common to associate a sign with the measure of an [[angle]], particularly an oriented angle or an angle of [[rotation]].  In such a situation, the sign indicates whether the angle is in the [[clockwise]] or counterclockwise direction.  Though different conventions can be used, it is common in [[mathematics]] to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.

It is also possible to associate a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the [[axis of rotation]] has been oriented.  Specifically, a [[right-hand rule|right-handed]] rotation around an oriented axis typically counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.

===Sign of a change===
When a quantity ''x'' changes over time, the [[Finite difference|change]] in the value of ''x'' is typically defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x_\text{final} - x_\text{initial}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this convention, an increase in ''x'' counts as positive change, while a decrease of ''x'' counts as negative change.  In [[calculus]], this same convention is used in the definition of the [[derivative]].  As a result, any [[Monotonic function|increasing function]] has positive derivative, while a decreasing function has negative derivative.

===Sign of a direction===
In [[analytic geometry]] and [[physics]], it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative.  For a basic example, the [[number line]] is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:
[[File:Number-line.svg|center|600px]]
As a result, when discussing [[linear motion]], [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[velocity]] to the right is usually thought of as being positive, while similar motion to the left is thought of as being negative.

On the [[Cartesian plane]], the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive ''x''-direction, and upward being the positive ''y''-direction.  If a displacement or velocity [[Euclidean vector|vector]] is separated into its [[vector component]]s, then the horizontal part will be positive for motion to the right and negative for motion to the left, while the vertical part will be positive for motion upward and negative for motion downward.

{{main|Signedness}}
In [[computing]], an integer value may be either signed or unsigned, depending on whether the computer is keeping track of a sign for the number.  By restricting an integer [[Variable (programming)|variable]] to non-negative values only, one more [[bit]] can be used for storing the value of a number.  Because of the way integer arithmetic is done within computers, the sign of a signed integer variable is usually not stored as a single independent bit, but is instead stored using [[two's complement]] or some other [[signed number representation]].

In contrast, real numbers are stored and manipulated as [[Floating point]] values.  The floating point values are represented using three separate values, mantissa, exponent, and sign.  Given this separate sign bit, it is possible to represent both positive and negative zero.  Most programming languages normally treat positive zero and negative zero as equivalent values, albeit, they provide means by which the distinction can be detected.

===Other meanings===
[[File:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|right|[[Electric charge]] may be positive or negative.]]
In addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and the sciences:
* Words ''[[up to]] sign'' mean that for a quantity {{mvar|q}} is known that either {{math|1=''q'' = ''Q''}} or {{math|1=''q'' = −''Q''}} for certain {{mvar|Q}}. It is often expressed as {{math|1=''q'' = [[±]]''Q''}}. For real numbers, it means that only the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}}''q''{{!}}}} of the quantity is known. For [[complex numbers]] and [[vector space|vectors]], a quantity known up to sign is a stronger condition than a quantity with known [[norm (mathematics)|magnitude]]: aside {{mvar|Q}} and {{math|−''Q''}}, there are many other possible values of {{mvar|q}} such that {{math|1={{!}}''q''{{!}} = {{!}}''Q''{{!}}}}.
* The [[Parity of a permutation|sign of a permutation]] is defined to be positive if the permutation is even, and negative if the permutation is odd.
* In [[graph theory]], a [[signed graph]] is a graph in which each edge has been marked with a positive or negative sign.
* In [[mathematical analysis]], a [[signed measure]] is a generalization of the concept of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] in which the measure of a set may have positive or negative values.
* In a [[signed-digit representation]], each digit of a number may have a positive or negative sign.
* The ideas of [[signed area]] and [[signed volume]] are sometimes used when it is convenient for certain areas or volumes to count as negative.  This is particularly true in the theory of [[determinant]]s. In an (abstract) [[orientation (vector space)|oriented vector space]], each ordered basis for the vector space can be classified as either positively or negatively oriented.
* In [[physics]], any [[electric charge]] comes with a sign, either positive or negative.  By convention, a positive charge is a charge with the same sign as that of a [[proton]], and a negative charge is a charge with the same sign as that of an [[electron]].

[[Image:tetrahedron.png|thumb|A regular 3-simplex or [[tetrahedron]]]]
In [[geometry]], a '''simplex''' (plural: '''simplexes''' or '''simplices''') is a generalization of the notion of a [[triangle]] or [[tetrahedron]] to arbitrary [[dimensions]].
Specifically, a '''''k''-simplex''' is a ''k''-dimensional [[polytope]] which is the [[convex hull]] of its ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]].  
More formally, suppose the ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points &lt;math&gt;u_0,\dots, u_k \in \mathbb{R}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[affinely independent]], which means &lt;math&gt; u_1 - u_0,\dots, u_k-u_0 &lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]].
Then, the simplex determined by them is the set of points

:&lt;math&gt; C = \left\{\theta_0 u_0 + \dots +\theta_k u_k ~\bigg|~ \sum_{i=0}^{k} \theta_i=1 \mbox{ and } \theta_i \ge 0 \mbox{ for all } i\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a 2-simplex is a triangle, a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron, and a 4-simplex is a [[5-cell]].  A single [[point (geometry)|point]] may be considered a 0-simplex, and a [[line segment]] may be considered a 1-simplex. A simplex may be defined as the smallest [[convex set]] containing the given vertices.

A '''regular simplex'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Elte | first = E. L. | title = The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces | publisher = University of Groningen | location = Groningen | year = 1912}} Chapter IV, five dimensional semiregular polytope&lt;/ref&gt; is a simplex that is also a [[regular polytope]]. A regular ''n''-simplex may be constructed from a regular (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.

The '''standard simplex''' or '''probability simplex''' &lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the simplex formed from the ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 standard unit vectors, or 

:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1} : x_0 + \dots + x_k = 1, x_i \ge 0, i=0, \dots, k \}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[topology]] and [[combinatorics]], it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a [[simplicial complex]].  The associated combinatorial structure is called an [[abstract simplicial complex]], in which context the word “simplex” simply means any [[finite set]] of vertices.

==History==
The concept of a simplex was known to [[William Kingdon Clifford]], who wrote about these shapes in 1886 but called them "prime confines". 
[[Henri Poincaré]], writing about [[algebraic topology]] in 1900, called them "generalized tetrahedra".
In 1902 [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute]] described the concept first with the [[Latin]] superlative ''simplicissimum'' ("simplest") and then with the same Latin adjective in the normal form ''simplex'' ("simple").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/s.html|title=Simplex|work=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics|first=Jeff|last=Miller|accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Simplexes.jpg|alt=The four simplexes which can be fully represented in 3D space.|thumb|271x271px|The four simplexes which can be fully represented in 3D space.]]
* A 0-simplex is a [[point (mathematics)|point]].
* A 1-simplex is a [[line segment]].
* A 2-simplex is a [[triangle]].
* A 3-simplex is a [[tetrahedron]].
* A 4-simplex is a [[5-cell]].

The convex hull of any nonempty subset of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points that define an ''n''-simplex is called a '''face''' of the simplex. Faces are simplices themselves. In particular, the convex hull of a subset of size ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 defining points) is an ''m''-simplex, called an '''''m''-face''' of the ''n''-simplex. The 0-faces (i.e., the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the '''vertices''' (singular: vertex), the 1-faces are called the '''edges''', the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-faces are called the '''facets''', and the sole ''n''-face is the whole ''n''-simplex itself. In general, the number of ''m''-faces is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n+1}{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, ''Regular polytopes'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the number of ''m''-faces of an ''n''-simplex may be found in column (''m'' + 1) of row (''n'' + 1) of [[Pascal's triangle]]. A simplex ''A'' is a '''coface''' of a simplex ''B'' if ''B'' is a face of ''A''. ''Face'' and ''facet'' can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a [[simplicial complex]]; see [[Simplicial complex#Definitions|simplical complex]] for more detail.

The '''regular simplex''' family is the first of three [[regular polytope]] families, labeled by [[Coxeter]] as ''α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the other two being the [[cross-polytope]] family, labeled as ''β&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the [[hypercube]]s, labeled as ''γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. A fourth family, the [[hypercubic honeycomb|infinite tessellation of hypercubes]], he labeled as ''δ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The number of 1-faces (edges) of the ''n''-simplex is the ''n''-th [[triangle number]], the number of 2-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)th [[tetrahedron number]], the number of 3-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)th 5-cell number, and so on.

An (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex can be constructed as a join (∨ operator) of an ''n''-simplex and a point,&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An (''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex can be constructed as a join of an ''m''-simplex and an ''n''-simplex. The two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other, with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them. A 1-simplex is the join of two points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) =&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of three points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An [[isosceles triangle]] is the join of a 1-simplex and a point: {&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An [[equilateral triangle]] is 3&amp;middot;(&amp;nbsp;) or&amp;nbsp;{3}. A general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and two points: {&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point: 3.( )∨( ) or {3}∨( ). A [[regular tetrahedron]] is 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) or {3,3} and so on.

In some conventions,&lt;ref&gt;Kozlov, Dimitry, ''Combinatorial Algebraic Topology'', 2008, Springer-Verlag (Series: Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics)&lt;/ref&gt; the empty set is defined to be a (−1)-simplex.  The definition of the simplex above still makes sense if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1.  This convention is more common in applications to algebraic topology (such as [[simplicial homology]]) than to the study of polytopes.

== The standard simplex ==
[[Image:2D-simplex.svg|150px|thumb|right|The standard 2-simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]
The '''standard ''n''-simplex''' (or '''unit ''n''-simplex''') is the subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; given by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n = \left\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}~\big|~\sum_{i = 0}^n t_i = 1 \text{ and } t_i \ge 0 \text{ for all } i\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The simplex Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; lies in the [[affine hyperplane]] obtained by removing the restriction ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 in the above definition.

The ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 vertices of the standard ''n''-simplex are the points ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, where
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 0, 0, ..., 0),
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0),
:&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 0, 0, ..., 1).
There is a canonical map from the standard ''n''-simplex to an arbitrary ''n''-simplex with vertices (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) given by
:&lt;math&gt;(t_0,\ldots,t_n) \mapsto \sum_{i = 0}^n t_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;
The coefficients ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are called the [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] of a point in the ''n''-simplex.  Such a general simplex is often called an '''affine ''n''-simplex''', to emphasize that the canonical map is an [[affine transformation]]. It is also sometimes called an '''oriented affine ''n''-simplex''' to emphasize that the canonical map may be [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation preserving]] or reversing.

More generally, there is a canonical map from the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex (with ''n'' vertices) onto any [[polytope]] with ''n'' vertices, given by the same equation (modifying indexing):
:&lt;math&gt;(t_1,\ldots,t_n) \mapsto \sum_{i = 1}^n t_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;
These are known as [[generalized barycentric coordinates]], and express every polytope as the ''image'' of a simplex: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{n-1} \twoheadrightarrow P.&lt;/math&gt;

A commonly used function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the interior of the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex is the [[softmax function]], or normalized exponential function; this generalizes the [[standard logistic function]].

=== Examples ===

* Δ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the point {{nowrap|1= 1 in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the line segment joining (1,0) and (0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[equilateral triangle]] with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[regular tetrahedron]] with vertices (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Increasing coordinates===
An alternative coordinate system is given by taking the [[indefinite sum]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s_0 &amp;= 0\\
s_1 &amp;= s_0 + t_0 = t_0\\
s_2 &amp;= s_1 + t_1 = t_0 + t_1\\
s_3 &amp;= s_2 + t_2 = t_0 + t_1 + t_2\\
&amp;\dots\\
s_n &amp;= s_{n-1} + t_{n-1} = t_0 + t_1 + \cdots + t_{n-1}\\
s_{n+1} &amp;= s_n + t_n = t_0 + t_1 + \cdots + t_n = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This yields the alternative presentation by ''order,'' namely as nondecreasing ''n''-tuples between 0 and 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_*^n = \left\{(s_1,\ldots,s_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid 0 = s_0 \leq s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \dots \leq s_n \leq s_{n+1} = 1 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Geometrically, this is an ''n''-dimensional subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (maximal dimension, codimension 0) rather than of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; (codimension 1). The facets, which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing, &lt;math&gt;t_i=0,&lt;/math&gt; here correspond to successive coordinates being equal, &lt;math&gt;s_i=s_{i+1},&lt;/math&gt; while the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] corresponds to the inequalities becoming ''strict'' (increasing sequences).

A key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates – the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates, while permuting elements of the "ordered simplex" do not leave it invariant, as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered. Indeed, the ordered simplex is a (closed) [[fundamental domain]] for the action of the symmetric group on the ''n''-cube, meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the ''n''! elements of the symmetric group divides the ''n''-cube into &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries), showing that this simplex has volume &lt;math&gt;1/n!&lt;/math&gt; Alternatively, the volume can be computed by an iterated integral, whose successive integrands are &lt;math&gt;1,x,x^2/2,x^3/3!,\dots,x^n/n!&lt;/math&gt;

A further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition, and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set, and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums.

===Projection onto the standard simplex===
Especially in numerical applications of [[probability theory]] a [[Graphical projection|projection]] onto the standard simplex is of interest. Given &lt;math&gt;\, (p_i)_i&lt;/math&gt; with possibly negative entries, the closest point &lt;math&gt;\left(t_i\right)_i&lt;/math&gt; on the simplex has coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;t_i= \max\{p_i+\Delta\, ,0\},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_i\max\{p_i+\Delta\, ,0\}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; can be easily calculated from sorting &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |arxiv=1101.6081|title=Projection Onto A Simplex |author=Yunmei Chen, Xiaojing Ye  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sorting approach takes &lt;math&gt;O( n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity, which can be improved to &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity via [[Selection algorithm|median-finding]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = MacUlan | first1 = N. | last2 = De Paula | first2 = G. G. | doi = 10.1016/0167-6377(89)90064-3 | title = A linear-time median-finding algorithm for projecting a vector on the simplex of n | journal = Operations Research Letters | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 219 | year = 1989 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projecting onto the simplex is computationally similar to projecting onto the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; ball.

===Corner of cube===
Finally, a simple variant is to replace "summing to 1" with "summing to at most 1"; this raises the dimension by 1, so to simplify notation, the indexing changes:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_c^n = \left\{(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n~\big|~\sum_{i = 1}^n t_i \leq 1 \text{ and } t_i \ge 0 \text{ for all } i\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This yields an ''n''-simplex as a corner of the ''n''-cube, and is a standard orthogonal simplex. This is the simplex used in the [[simplex method]], which is based at the origin, and locally models a vertex on a polytope with ''n'' facets.

==Cartesian coordinates for regular ''n''-dimensional simplex in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;==
The coordinates of the vertices of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex can be obtained from these two properties,
# For a regular simplex, the distances of its vertices to its center are equal.
# The angle subtended by any two vertices of an ''n''-dimensional simplex through its center is &lt;math&gt;\arccos\left(\tfrac{-1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

These can be used as follows. Let vectors (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) represent the vertices of an ''n''-simplex center the origin, all [[unit vector]]s so a distance 1 from the origin, satisfying the first property. The second property means the [[dot product]] between any pair of the vectors is &lt;math&gt;-1/n&lt;/math&gt;. This can be used to calculate positions for them.

For example in three dimensions the vectors (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the vertices of a 3-simplex or tetrahedron. Write these as

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Choose the first vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to have all but the first component zero, so by the first property it must be (1, 0, 0) and the vectors become

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By the second property the dot product of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with all other vectors is -{{frac|1|3}}, so each of their ''x'' components must equal this, and the vectors become

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next choose ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to have all but the first two elements zero. The second element is the only unknown. It can be calculated from the first property using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (choose any of the two square roots), and so the second vector can be completed:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The second property can be used to calculate the remaining ''y'' components, by taking the dot product of  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with each and solving to give

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From which the ''z'' components can be calculated, using the Pythagorean theorem again to satisfy the first property, the two possible square roots giving the two results

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This process can be carried out in any dimension, using ''n'' + 1 vectors, applying the first and second properties alternately to determine all the values.

== Geometric properties ==

=== Volume ===
The [[volume]] of an ''n''-simplex in ''n''-dimensional space with vertices (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;
 \left|{1\over n!} \det
 \begin{pmatrix}
  v_1-v_0, &amp; v_2-v_0,&amp; \dots, &amp; v_n-v_0
 \end{pmatrix}\right|
&lt;/math&gt;

where each column of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[determinant]] is the difference between the [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] representing two vertices.&lt;ref&gt;A derivation of a very similar formula can be found in {{cite journal | last1 =  Stein | first1 = P. | year = 1966 | title = A Note on the Volume of a Simplex | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 299–301 | publisher =  | jstor = 2315353 | doi =   10.2307/2315353 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common way of computing the volume of the simplex is via the [[Distance geometry#Cayley–Menger determinants|Cayley–Menger determinant]]. It can also compute the volume of a simplex embedded in a higher-dimensional space, e.g., a triangle in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Colins, Karen D. "Cayley-Menger Determinant." From MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cayley-MengerDeterminant.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the 1/''n''! it is the formula for the volume of an ''n''-[[parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]]. 
This can be understood as follows: Assume that ''P'' is an ''n''-parallelotope constructed on a basis &lt;math&gt;(v_0, e_1, \ldots, e_n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;.
Given a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, call a list of vertices &lt;math&gt;v_0,\ v_1, \ldots, v_n&lt;/math&gt; a ''n''-path if 
:&lt;math&gt;v_1 = v_0 + e_{\sigma(1)},\ v_2 = v_1 + e_{\sigma(2)},\ldots, v_n = v_{n-1}+e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt; 
(so there are ''n''!&amp;nbsp;''n''-paths and &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the permutation). The following assertions hold:

If ''P'' is the unit ''n''-hypercube, then the union of the ''n''-simplexes formed by the convex hull of each ''n''-path is ''P'', and these simplexes are congruent and pairwise non-overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;Every ''n''-path corresponding to a permutation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the image of the ''n''-path &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0,\ v_0+e_1,\ v_0+e_1+e_2,\ldots v_0+e_1+\cdots + e_n&lt;/math&gt; by the affine isometry that sends &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0&lt;/math&gt;, and whose linear part matches &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e_{\sigma(i)}&lt;/math&gt; for all&amp;nbsp;''i''. hence every two ''n''-paths are isometric, and so is their convex hulls; this explains the congruence of the simplexes. To show the other assertions, it suffices to remark that the interior of the simplex determined by the ''n''-path &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0,\ v_0+e_{\sigma(1)},\ v_0+e_{\sigma(1)}+e_{\sigma(2)}\ldots v_0+e_{\sigma(1)}+\cdots + e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0 + (x_1+\cdots +x_n) e_{\sigma(1)} + \cdots + (x_{n-1}+x_n) e_{\sigma(n-1)} + x_n e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0&lt; x_i &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_1+\cdots + x_n &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt; Hence the components of these points with respect to each corresponding permuted basis are strictly ordered in the decreasing order. That explains why the simplexes are non-overlapping. The fact that the union of the simplexes is the whole unit ''n''-hypercube follows as well, replacing the strict inequalities above by "&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \leq&lt;/math&gt;". The same arguments are also valid for a general parallelotope, except the isometry between the simplexes.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the volume of such a simplex is 

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{Vol}(P)}{n!} = \frac 1 {n!}.&lt;/math&gt;  

If ''P'' is a general parallelotope, the same assertions hold except that it is no more true, in dimension&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, that the simplexes need to be pairwise congruent; yet their volumes remain equal, because the ''n''-parallelotop is the image of the unit ''n''-hypercube by the linear isomorphism that sends the canonical basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt;. As previously, this implies that the volume of a simplex coming from a ''n''-path is:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{Vol}(P)}{n!} = \frac{\det(e_1, \ldots, e_n)}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, given an ''n''-simplex &lt;math&gt;(v_0,\ v_1,\ v_2,\ldots v_n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;, it can be supposed that the vectors &lt;math&gt;e_1 = v_1-v_0,\ e_2 = v_2-v_1,\ldots e_n=v_n-v_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;. Considering the parallelotope constructed from &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt;, one sees that the previous formula is valid for every simplex.

Finally, the formula at the beginning of this section is obtained by observing that 
:&lt;math&gt;\det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_0,\ldots v_n-v_0) = \det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_1,\ldots, v_n-v_{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

From this formula, it follows immediately that the volume under a standard ''n''-simplex (i.e. between the origin and the simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;
{1 \over (n+1)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of a regular ''n''-simplex with unit side length is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\sqrt{n+1}}{n!\sqrt{2^n}}
&lt;/math&gt;

as can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, to get the volume under the ''n''-simplex as a function of its vertex distance ''x'' from the origin, differentiating with respect to ''x'', at &lt;math&gt;x=1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (where the ''n''-simplex side length is 1), and normalizing by the length &lt;math&gt;dx/\sqrt{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; of the increment, &lt;math&gt;(dx/(n+1),\ldots, dx/(n+1))&lt;/math&gt;, along the normal vector.

The [[dihedral angle]] of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex is cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1/''n''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | date = October 2002 | pages = 756–758 | title = An Elementary Calculation of the Dihedral Angle of the Regular ''n''-Simplex | first1 = Harold R. | last1 = Parks | author1-link = Harold R.

===Simplices with an "orthogonal corner"===
An "orthogonal corner" means here that there is a vertex at which all adjacent edges are pairwise orthogonal. It immediately follows that all adjacent [[Face (geometry)|faces]] are pairwise orthogonal. Such simplices are generalizations of right triangles and for them there exists an ''n''-dimensional version of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

The sum of the squared (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volumes of the facets adjacent to the orthogonal corner equals the squared (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the orthogonal corner.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n |A_k|^2 = |A_0|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; A_1 \ldots A_n &lt;/math&gt; are facets being pairwise orthogonal to each other but not orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; A_0 &lt;/math&gt;, which is the facet opposite the orthogonal corner.

For a 2-simplex the theorem is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is [[de Gua's theorem]] for a tetrahedron 
with an orthogonal corner.

===Relation to the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-hypercube===
The [[Hasse diagram]] of the face lattice of an ''n''-simplex is isomorphic to the graph of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[hypercube]]'s edges, with the hypercube's vertices mapping to each of the ''n''-simplex's elements, including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube). This fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex's face lattice, since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive.

The ''n''-simplex is also the [[vertex figure]] of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-hypercube. It is also the [[Facet (geometry)|facet]] of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[orthoplex]].

===Topology===
[[Topology|Topologically]], an ''n''-simplex is [[topologically equivalent|equivalent]] to an [[ball (mathematics)|''n''-ball]]. Every ''n''-simplex is an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold with corners]].

===Probability===
{{Main article|Categorical distribution}}

In probability theory, the points of the standard ''n''-simplex in (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-space are the space of possible parameters (probabilities) of the [[categorical distribution]] on ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 possible outcomes.

===Compounds===
Since all simplices are self-dual, they can form a series of compounds;

* Two triangles form a [[hexagram]] {6/2}.
* Two tetrahedra form a [[compound of two tetrahedra]] or [[stellated octahedron]].
* Two 5-cells form a [[compound of two 5-cells]] in four dimensions.

== Algebraic topology&lt;!--'Singular n-simplex' redirects here--&gt; ==
In [[algebraic topology]], simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of [[topological space]]s called [[simplicial complex]]es. These spaces are built from simplices glued together in a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] called [[simplicial homology]].

A finite set of ''k''-simplexes embedded in an [[open subset]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is called an '''affine ''k''-chain'''. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. If some of the simplexes have the opposite [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], these are prefixed by a minus sign. If some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.

Note that each facet of an ''n''-simplex is an affine (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex, and thus the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of an ''n''-simplex is an affine ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1-chain. Thus, if we denote one positively oriented affine simplex as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=[v_0,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n]&lt;/math&gt;

with the &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt; denoting the vertices, then the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''σ'' is the chain

:&lt;math&gt;\partial\sigma = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j [v_0,\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_n].&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from this expression, and the linearity of the boundary operator,  that the boundary of the boundary of a simplex is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^2\sigma = \partial ( ~ \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j [v_0,\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_n]~ ) =0. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero:  &lt;math&gt; \partial ^2 \rho =0 &lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a [[manifold]] by means of smooth, differentiable map &lt;math&gt;f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, both the summation convention for denoting the set, and the boundary operation commute with the [[embedding]].  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;f(\sum\nolimits_i a_i \sigma_i) = \sum\nolimits_i a_i f(\sigma_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity.  For the boundary operator &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;, one has:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial f(\rho) = f (\partial \rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is a chain. The boundary operation commutes with the mapping because, in the end, the chain is defined as a set and little more, and the set operation always commutes with the [[function (mathematics)|map operation]] (by definition of a map).

A continuous map &lt;math&gt;f:\sigma\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; to a [[topological space]] ''X'' is frequently referred to as a '''singular ''n''-simplex'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. (A map is generally called "singular" if it fails to have some desirable property such as continuity and, in this case, the term is meant to reflect to the fact that the continuous map need not be an embedding.)&lt;ref&gt;John M. Lee, ''Introduction to Topological Manifolds'', Springer, 2006, pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic geometry ==
Since classical algebraic geometry allows to talk about polynomial equations, but not inequalities, the ''algebraic standard n-simplex'' is commonly defined as the subset of affine (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional space, where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part). The algebraic description of this set is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^n := \left\{x \in \mathbb{A}^{n+1} ~\Big|~ \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i - 1 = 0\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

which equals the [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]-theoretic description &lt;math&gt;\Delta_n(R) = \operatorname{Spec}(R[\Delta^n])&lt;/math&gt; with

:&lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^n] := R[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]\left/\left(\sum x_i -1\right)\right.&lt;/math&gt;

the ring of regular functions on the algebraic ''n''-simplex (for any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;).

By using the same definitions as for the classical ''n''-simplex, the ''n''-simplices for different dimensions ''n'' assemble into one [[simplicial object]], while the rings &lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^n]&lt;/math&gt; assemble into one cosimplicial object &lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^\bullet]&lt;/math&gt; (in the category of schemes resp. rings, since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial).

The algebraic ''n''-simplices are used in higher [[K-theory]] and in the definition of higher [[Chow group]]s.

== Applications ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Simplices are used in plotting quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a [[ternary plot]].

In [[applied statistics#industrial|industrial statistics]], simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In the design of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such [[mixture]]s, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, in which case the feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using [[response surface methodology]], and then a local maximum can be computed using a [[nonlinear programming]] method, such as [[sequential quadratic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[operations research]], [[linear programming]] problems can be solved by the [[simplex algorithm]] of [[George Dantzig]].

In [[geometric design]] and [[computer graphics]],  many methods first perform simplicial [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]]s of the domain and then  [[interpolation|fit interpolating]] [[polynomial and rational function modeling|polynomials]] to each simplex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vondran | first = Gary L. |date=April 1998 | title = Radial and Pruned Tetrahedral Interpolation Techniques | journal = HP Technical Report | volume = HPL-98-95 | pages = 1–32 | url = http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/98/HPL-98-95.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the hydrides of most elements in the [[p-block]] can resemble a simplex if one is to connect each atom. [[Neon]] does not react with hydrogen and as such is [[Monatomic gas|a point]], [[fluorine]] bonds with one hydrogen atom and forms a line segment, [[oxygen]] bonds with two hydrogen in a [[Bent molecular geometry|bent]] fashion resembling a triangle, [[nitrogen]] reacts to form a [[Trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry|tetrahedron]], and [[carbon]] will form [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|a structure]] resembling a Schlegel diagram of the 5-cell. This trend continues for the heavier analogues of each element, as well as if the hydrogen is replaced by [[halogen]] atoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5396">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''s''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; theorem}}
In [[recursion theory|computability theory]] the '''''s''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; theorem''', (also called the '''translation lemma''', '''parameter theorem''', and the '''parameterization theorem''') is a basic result about [[programming language]]s (and, more generally, [[Gödel numbering]]s of the [[computable function]]s) (Soare 1987, Rogers 1967).  It was first proved by [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] (1943). The name "s&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;" comes from the occurrence of a ''s'' with subscript ''n'' and superscript ''m'' in the original formulation of the theorem (see below).

In practical terms, the theorem says that for a given programming language and positive integers ''m'' and ''n'', there exists a particular [[algorithm]] that accepts as input the [[source code]] of a program with ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[free variables]], together with ''m'' values. This algorithm generates source code that effectively substitutes the values for the first ''m'' free variables, leaving the rest of the variables free.

==Details==

The basic form of the theorem applies to functions of two arguments (Nies 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;6). Given a Gödel numbering &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of recursive functions, there is a [[primitive recursive function]] ''s'' of two arguments with the following property: for every Gödel number ''p'' of a partial computable function ''f'' with two arguments, the expressions &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{s(p,x)}(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; are defined for the same combinations of natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', and their values are equal for any such combination. In other words, the following [[extensional equality]] of functions holds for every ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{s(p,x)} \simeq \lambda y.\varphi_p(x,y).\,&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for any ''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a primitive recursive function &lt;math&gt;s^m_n&lt;/math&gt; of ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 arguments that behaves as follows: for every Gödel number ''p'' of a partial computable function with ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' arguments, and all values of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{s^m_n (p,x_1,\dots,x_m)} \simeq \lambda y_1,\dots,y_n.\varphi_p(x_1,\dots,x_m,y_1,\dots,y_n).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''s'' described above can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;s^1_1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal Statement==

For all arities &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;,

For every Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_x&lt;/math&gt; of arity &lt;math&gt;m + n&lt;/math&gt;, and for all possible values of inputs &lt;math&gt;y_1 \dots y_m&lt;/math&gt;,

there exists a Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_k&lt;/math&gt; of arity &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, such that

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z_1 \dots z_n  ~:~{\rm TM}_x(y_1 \dots y_m,~ z_1 \dots z_n) = {\rm TM}_k(z_1 \dots z_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, there is a Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; that allows &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be calculated from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;; it is denoted &lt;math&gt;k = s_n^m(x, y_1 \dots y_m)&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore, the result generalizes to any Turing Complete computing model.

Informally, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; finds the Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_k&lt;/math&gt; which is the result of hardcoding the values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_x&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
The following [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] code implements s&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; for Lisp.
&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
 (defun s11 (f x)
   (let ((y (gensym)))
     (list 'lambda (list y) (list f x y))))
&lt;/source&gt;
For example, {{code|lang=lisp|(s11 '(lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 3)}} evaluates to {{code|lang=lisp|(lambda (g42) ((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 3 g42))}}.

'''Marie-Sophie Germain''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁi sɔfi ʒɛʁmɛ̃|lang}}; 1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, [[physicist]], and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library including ones by [[Leonhard Euler]] and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. One of the pioneers of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity theory]], she won the grand prize from the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] for her essay on the subject. Her work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life.{{sfn|Case|Leggett|2005|p=39}} Before her death Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Nick (1990). "Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?". The Mathematical Gazette 74 (470): 346–351, esp. p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 1831, she died from breast cancer . At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls’ school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the [[Sophie Germain Prize]] in her honor.

==Early life==

===Family===
Marie-Sophie Germain was born on April 1, 1776, in Paris, France, in a house on Rue Saint-Denis. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-François, was a wealthy silk merchant,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}}{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} though some believe he was a [[goldsmith]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the [[bourgeoisie]] to the [[Estates General of 1789|États-Généraux]], which he saw change into the [[French Revolution#National Assembly (1789)|Constitutional Assembly]]. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-François became the director of a bank; at least, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}}

Marie-Sophie had one younger sister, named Angélique-Ambroise, and one older sister, named Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of "Maries" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain's nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline's son, published some of Germain's work after she died (see [[Sophie Germain#Work in philosophy|Work in Philosophy]]).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}

===Introduction to mathematics===
When Germain was 13, the [[French Revolution#Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment she turned to her father's library.{{sfn|Osen|1974|pp=83–84}} Here she found [[Jean-Étienne Montucla|J. E. Montucla's]] ''L'Histoire des Mathématiques'', and his story of the death of [[Archimedes]] intrigued her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}

Sophie Germain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}} could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=90}} So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library,{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=84}} even teaching herself Latin and Greek so she could read works like those of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. She also enjoyed ''Traité d'Arithmétique'' by [[Étienne Bézout]] and ''Le Calcul Différentiel'' by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited her in her house, encouraging her in her studies.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}

Germain's parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics.{{sfn|Gray|1978|pp=47–48}} As Lynn Osen describes, when her parents found Sophie "asleep at her desk in the morning, the ink frozen in the ink horn and her slate covered with calculations," they realized that their daughter was serious and relented.{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=85}} After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}

===École Polytechnique===
[[Image:Porton antigua sede École Polytechnique Sainte Geneviève.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the historic building of the École Polytechnique]]
In 1794, when Germain was 18, the [[École Polytechnique]] opened.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the "lecture notes available to all who asked."{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} The new method also required the students to "submit written observations."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=69}} Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-August Le Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/sophie-germain.html |first=Simon |last=Singh |year=1997 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |title=Math's Hidden Woman |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fearing," as she later explained to Gauss, "the ridicule attached to a female scientist."{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. LeBlanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} and he became her mentor.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} He visited her in her home, giving her moral support.{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=85}}

==Early work in number theory==

===Correspondence with Legendre===
Germain first became interested in number theory in 1798 when [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] published ''Essai sur la théorie des nombres''.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, elasticity. Legendre showed some of Germain's work in the ''Supplément'' to his second edition of the ''Théorie des Nombres'', where he calls it ''très ingénieuse'' ["very ingenious"] (See [[#Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem|Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem]]).{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}}

===Correspondence with Gauss===
[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|Carl Friedrich Gauss]]
Germain's interest in number theory was renewed when she read [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' monumental work ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems,{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=352}} she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M. LeBlanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} to the author himself, who was one year younger than she.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=157}} The first letter, dated 21 November 1804,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} discussed Gauss' ''Disquisitiones'' and presented some of Germain's work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]] of the form ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}} However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}}

Around 1807 (sources differ),{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=88}}{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of [[Braunschweig]], where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety, a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} As it turned out, Gauss was fine,{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=88}} but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}

Three months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  He replied,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
How can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M leBlanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person. . . when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory's] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the most noble courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=349}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gauss' letters to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Olbers]] show that his praise for Germain was sincere.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}{{sfn|Bell|1937|p=262}} In the same 1807 letter, Sophie claimed that if &lt;math&gt;x^n+y^n&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;h^2+nf^2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: &lt;math&gt;15^{11} + 8^{11}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;h^2+nf^2&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;15+11&lt;/math&gt; cannot.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|1994}}

Although Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}

==Work in elasticity==

===Germain's first attempt for the Academy Prize===
[[Image:Echladni.jpg|thumb|left|Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni]]
When Germain's correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning [[Ernst Chladni]]'s experiments with vibrating metal plates.{{sfn|Osen|1974|pp=88–89}} The object of the competition, as stated by the Academy, was "to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence." Lagrange's comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] deterred all but two contestants, [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Denis Poisson]] and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the Academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant,{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}

In 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}} She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811, and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that "the true equations of the movement were not established," even though "the experiments presented ingenious results."{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Lagrange was able to use Germain's work to derive an equation that was "correct under special assumptions."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}

===Subsequent attempts for the Prize===
The contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Germain's anonymous{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving [[multiple integral|double integrals]],{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} and it received only an honorable mention because "the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established."{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity, and did not acknowledge Germain's help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the Academy commission, had had access to her work).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}

Germain submitted her third paper, "Recherches sur la théorie des surfaces élastiques"{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} under her own name, and on 8 January 1816{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Although Germain had at last been awarded the ''prix extraordinaire'',{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} the Academy was still not fully satisfied.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=91}} Sophie had derived the correct [[differential equation]],{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} which led to incorrect boundary conditions.{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} Here is Germain's final equation:

:&lt;math&gt;N^2\left(\frac{\partial^4 z}{\partial x^4} + \frac{\partial^4 z}{\partial x^2 \partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^4 z}{\partial y^4}\right) + \frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial t^2} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a constant.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}

After winning the Academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the Academy's tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed when she made friends with [[Joseph Fourier]], a secretary of the Academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}

===Later work in elasticity===
[[File:Germain - Récherches sur la théorie des surfaces élastiques, 1821 - 723413.tif|thumb|''Récherches sur la théorie des surfaces élastiques'', 1821]]
Germain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in her method.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}

In 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the Academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by "introducing certain simplifying hypotheses." This put the Academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be "inadequate and trivial," but they did not want to "treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work." So [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who had been appointed to review her work, recommended she publish it, and she followed his advice.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 4}}

One further work of Germain's on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831: her "Mémoire sur la courbure des surfaces." She used the [[mean curvature]] in her research (see [[Sophien|Honors in Number Theory]]).{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}

==Later work in number theory==

===Renewed interest===
Germain's best work was in number theory,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}} and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the Academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} It reawakened Germain's interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}}

In the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field, and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|pp=356–357}} Germain's letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss if her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=362}}

===Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem===
[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre de Fermat]]]]
Fermat's Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all ''p'' that do not divide any of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Case 2 includes all ''p'' that divide at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Germain proposed the following, commonly called "[[Sophie Germain's theorem]]":{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let ''p'' be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''Np''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (N any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:
#if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;0 ([[modular arithmetic|mod ''P'']]) then ''P'' divides ''xyz'', and
#''p'' is not a ''p''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power residue (mod ''P'').
Then the first case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] holds true for ''p''.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Germain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all odd primes ''p''&lt;100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, "she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent ''p''&lt;197."{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}} L. E. Dickson later used Germain's theorem to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for odd primes less than 1700.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=763}}

In an unpublished manuscript entitled ''Remarque sur l'impossibilité de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l'équation x&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;y&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;z&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'',{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}} Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat's theorem for ''p''&gt;5 must be numbers "whose size frightens the imagination,"{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}} around 40 digits long.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=371}}  Sophie did not publish this work. Her brilliant theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre's treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Legendre|Correspondence with Legendre]]).{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Del Centina states that "after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central",{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}}  but ultimately her method did not work.{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}

==Work in philosophy==
In addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by [[Auguste Comte]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=73}}

Two of her philosophical works, ''Pensées diverses'' and ''Considérations générales sur l'état des sciences et des lettres, aux différentes époques de leur culture'',{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=91}} were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=53}}  ''Pensées'' is a history of science and mathematics with Sophie's commentary.{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=91}} In ''Considérations'', the work admired by Comte, Sophie argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the [[humanities]].{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}}

==Final years==
In 1829 Germain learned she had breast cancer. Despite the pain,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 5–6}} she continued to work. In 1831 ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' published her paper on the [[curvature]] of elastic surfaces and "a note about finding {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{4(x^p -1)}{x-1} = y^2 \pm pz^2&lt;/math&gt;."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Mary Gray records, "She also published in ''Annales de chimie et de physique'' an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}

Despite Germain's intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a "rentière – annuitant"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} (property holder),{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} not a "mathématicienne."{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1837—six years after Germain's death—Gauss lamented, "she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree."{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=347}}

==Honors==

===Memorials===
[[File:Grave, Sophie Germain.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Sophie Germain in Père Lachaise Cemetery]]
Germain's resting place in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris is marked by a gravestone.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} &lt;!-- The grave seems "OK" in the image, and the lower plaque includes a reference to the girls' school named after her, so I assume it has been kept up or replaced since the centennial mentioned next. --&gt; At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died. The school houses a bust commissioned by the Paris City Council.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}}

===Honors in number theory===
E. Dubouis defined a ''sophien'' of a prime {{math|''n''}} to be a prime {{math|θ}} where {{math|1=θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kn''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}}, for such {{math|''n''}} that yield {{math|θ}} such that {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (mod θ)}} has no solutions when {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are prime to {{math|''n''}}.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=769}}

A [[Sophie Germain prime]] is a prime {{math|''p''}} such that {{math|2''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} is also prime.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}}

The ''Germain curvature'' (also called [[mean curvature]]) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{k_1 + k_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=347}} when {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the maximum and minimum values of the normal curvature.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}

''Sophie Germain's Identity'' states that for any {{math|{''x,y''}}}, then,

:&lt;math&gt;x^4+4y^4 = ((x+y)^2+y^2)((x-y)^2+y^2) = (x^2+2xy+2y^2)(x^2-2xy+2y^2). &lt;/math&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Contemporary praise and criticisms===
Vesna Petrovich found that the educated world's response to the publication in 1821 of Germain's prize-winning essay "ranged from polite to indifferent".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} Yet, some critics had high praise for it. Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said, "[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians."{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}} Germain was also included in [[H. J. Mozans]]' book "[[Woman in Science]]",{{sfn|Mozans|1913}} although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography "is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable".{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=201}} Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician [[Claude-Louis Navier]] as saying, "it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write."{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}

Germain's contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics. Osen relates that "[[Gaspard de Prony|Baron de Prony]] called her the [[Hypatia of Alexandria|Hypatia]] of the nineteenth century," and "J.J Biot wrote, in the [[Journal des sçavans|''Journal de Savants'']], that she had probably penetrated the science of mathematics more deeply than any other of her sex."{{sfn|Osen|1974|p=90}} Gauss certainly thought highly of her, and he recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Gauss|Correspondence with Gauss]]).

===Modern praise and criticisms===
The modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, "Germain's work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis."{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=51}} Petrovich adds, "This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young [[child prodigy|prodigy]] to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians."{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384–385}}

Not withstanding the problems with Germain's theory of vibrations, Gray states that "Germain's work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity."{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} Mozans writes, however, that when the [[Eiffel tower]] was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain's name was not among them: despite the salience of her work to the tower's construction. Mozans asked, "Was she excluded from this list... because she was a woman? It would seem so."{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}

Concerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states, "She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the ''Disquisitiones'', and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters."{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} Gray adds that "The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development."{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that "Sophie Germain's creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics...[she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems,"{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}} and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain's biographers, summarize as follows: "All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men."{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}

==Germain in popular culture==
Germain was referenced and quoted in [[David Auburn]]'s 2001 play ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]].'' The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden's [[Proof (2005 film)|film adaptation]] of the same play in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).

In the fictional work "[[The Last Theorem]]" by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Frederik Pohl]], Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].

==Sophie Germain Prize==

The [[Sophie Germain Prize]] (Prix Sophie Germain), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in Paris. Its purpose is to honour a French mathematician for research in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. This award, in the amount of €8,000, was established in 2003, under the auspices of the [[Institut de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prix Sophie Germain – Fondation de l'Institut de France |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/prix/laureat_germain.pdf |publisher=Institut de France – Académie des sciences |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129202400/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/prix/laureat_germain.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''spherical shell''' is a generalization of an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] to three dimensions. It is the region between two [[concentric]] [[sphere]]s of differing radii.&lt;ref name="Wolfram"/&gt;

==Volume==
The [[volume]] of a spherical shell is the difference between the enclosed volume of the outer sphere and the [[Sphere#Enclosed volume|enclosed volume of the inner sphere]]:
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 - \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (R^3 - r^3)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the inner sphere and ''R'' is the radius of the outer sphere.

An approximation for the volume of a thin spherical shell is the area of the outer sphere multiplied by the thickness ''t'' of the shell:&lt;ref name="wonders"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V \approx 4 \pi r^2 t,&lt;/math&gt;
when ''t'' is very small compared to ''r'' (&lt;math&gt;t \ll r&lt;/math&gt;).

==In popular culture==
A [[Dyson sphere]] encloses a fictitious spherical shell around a star, as first described by author [[Olaf Stapledon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13222">[[Image:Squeeze r=1.5.svg|thumb|right|''r'' = 3/2 squeeze mapping]]
In [[linear algebra]], a '''squeeze mapping''' is a type of [[linear map]] that preserves Euclidean [[area]] of regions in the [[Cartesian plane]], but is ''not'' a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] or [[shear mapping]].

For a fixed positive real number {{math|''a''}}, the mapping

:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto (ax, y/a)&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''squeeze mapping'' with parameter {{math|''a''}}. Since

:&lt;math&gt;\{ (u,v) \, : \, u v = \mathrm{constant}\}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[hyperbola]], if {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''ax''}} and {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''y''/''a''}}, then {{math|''uv'' {{=}} ''xy''}} and the points of the image of the squeeze mapping are on the same hyperbola as {{math|(''x'',''y'')}} is. For this reason it is natural to think of the squeeze mapping as a '''hyperbolic rotation''', as did [[Émile Borel]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Borel]] (1914) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04710001 Introduction Geometrique à quelques Théories Physiques], page 29, Gauthier-Villars, link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with ''circular rotations'', which preserve circles.

==Logarithm and hyperbolic angle==
The squeeze mapping sets the stage for development of the concept of logarithms. The problem of finding the [[area]] bounded by a hyperbola (such as {{math|''xy'' {{=}} 1)}} is one of [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]]. The solution, found by [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]] in 1647, required the [[natural logarithm]] function, a new concept. Some insight into logarithms comes through [[hyperbolic sector]]s that are permuted by squeeze mappings while preserving their area. The area of a hyperbolic sector is taken as a measure of a [[hyperbolic angle]] associated with the sector. The hyperbolic angle concept is quite independent of the [[angle|ordinary circular angle]], but shares a property of invariance with it: whereas circular angle is invariant under rotation, hyperbolic angle is invariant under squeeze mapping. Both circular and hyperbolic angle generate [[invariant measure]]s but with respect to different transformation groups. The [[hyperbolic function]]s, which take hyperbolic angle as argument, perform the role that [[circular functions]] play with the circular angle argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mellen W. Haskell]] (1895) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1895-01-06/S0002-9904-1895-00266-9/S0002-9904-1895-00266-9.pdf On the introduction of the notion of hyperbolic functions] [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 1(6):155–9,particularly equation 12, page 159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
:[[File:Hyperbolic sector squeeze mapping.svg|250px|right|thumb|A squeeze mapping moves one purple [[hyperbolic sector]] to another with the same area. &lt;br&gt;It also squeezes blue and green [[rectangle]]s.]]
If {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''s''}} are positive real numbers, the [[Function composition|composition]] of their squeeze mappings is the squeeze mapping of their product. Therefore, the collection of squeeze mappings forms a [[one-parameter group]] isomorphic to the [[multiplicative group]] of [[positive real numbers]]. An additive view of this group arises from consideration of hyperbolic sectors and their hyperbolic angles.

From the point of view of the [[classical group]]s, the group of squeeze mappings is {{math|SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,1)}}, the [[identity component]] of the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] of [[2 × 2 real matrices]] preserving the [[quadratic form]] {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is equivalent to preserving the form {{math|''xy''}} via the [[change of basis]]

:&lt;math&gt;x=u+v,\quad y=u-v\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and corresponds geometrically to preserving hyperbolae. The perspective of the group of squeeze mappings as hyperbolic rotation is analogous to interpreting the group {{math|SO(2)}} (the connected component of the definite [[orthogonal group]]) preserving quadratic form {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} as being ''circular rotations''.

Note that the "{{math|SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}" notation corresponds to the fact that the reflections

:&lt;math&gt;u \mapsto -u,\quad v \mapsto -v&lt;/math&gt;

are not allowed, though they preserve the form (in terms of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} these are {{math|''x'' ↦ ''y'', ''y'' ↦ ''x''}} and {{math|''x'' ↦ −''x'', ''y'' ↦ −''y'')}}; the additional "{{math|+}}" in the hyperbolic case (as compared with the circular case) is necessary to specify the identity component because the group {{math|O(1,1)}} has {{math|4}} [[connected component (topology)|connected component]]s, while the group {{math|O(2)}} has {{math|2}} components: {{math|SO(1,1)}} has {{math|2}} components, while {{math|SO(2)}} only has 1. The fact that the squeeze transforms preserve area and orientation corresponds to the inclusion of subgroups {{math|SO ⊂ SL}} &amp;ndash; in this case {{math|SO(1,1)&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;[[SL2(R)|SL(2)]]}} – of the subgroup of hyperbolic rotations in the [[special linear group]] of transforms preserving area and orientation (a [[volume form]]). In the language of [[Möbius transformation]]s, the squeeze transformations are the [[SL2(R)#Hyperbolic elements|hyperbolic elements]] in the [[SL2(R)#Classification of elements|classification of elements]].

==Applications==
In studying linear algebra there are the purely abstract applications such as illustration of the [[singular-value decomposition]] or in the important role of the squeeze mapping in the structure of [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. These applications are somewhat bland compared to two [[physics|physical]] and a [[philosophy|philosophical]] application.

===Corner flow===
In [[fluid dynamics]] one of the fundamental motions of an [[incompressible flow]] involves [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] of a flow running up against an immovable wall.
Representing the wall by the axis ''y'' = 0 and taking the parameter ''r'' = exp(''t'') where ''t'' is time, then the squeeze mapping with parameter ''r'' applied to an initial fluid state produces a flow with bifurcation left and right of the axis ''x'' = 0. The same [[mathematical model|model]] gives '''fluid convergence''' when time is run backward. Indeed, the [[area]] of any [[hyperbolic sector]] is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under squeezing.

For another approach to a flow with hyperbolic [[streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamlines]], see {{section link|Potential flow|Power laws with n {{=}} 2}}.

In 1989 Ottino&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Ottino (1989) ''The Kinematics of Mixing: stretching, chaos, transport'', page 29, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; described the "linear isochoric two-dimensional flow" as
:&lt;math&gt;v_1 = G x_2 \quad v_2 = K G x_1&lt;/math&gt;
where K lies in the interval [&amp;minus;1, 1]. The streamlines follow the curves
:&lt;math&gt;x_2^2 - K x_1^2 = \mathrm{constant}&lt;/math&gt;
so negative ''K'' corresponds to an [[ellipse]] and positive ''K'' to a hyperbola, with the rectangular case of the squeeze mapping corresponding to ''K'' = 1.

Stocker and Hosoi&lt;ref&gt;Roman Stocker &amp; [[Anette Hosoi|A.E. Hosoi]] (2004) "Corner flow in free liquid films", ''Journal of Engineering Mathematics'' 50:267&amp;ndash;88&lt;/ref&gt; described their approach to corner flow as follows:
:we suggest an alternative formulation to account for the corner-like geometry, based on the use of hyperbolic coordinates, which allows substantial analytical progress towards determination of the flow in a Plateau border and attached liquid threads. We consider a region of flow forming an angle of ''π''/2 and delimited on the left and bottom by symmetry planes.
Stocker and Hosoi then recall Moffatt's&lt;ref&gt;H.K. Moffatt (1964) "Viscous and resistive eddies near a sharp corner", [[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]] 18:1&amp;ndash;18&lt;/ref&gt; consideration of "flow in a corner between rigid boundaries, induced by an arbitrary disturbance at a large distance." According to Stocker and Hosoi,
:For a free fluid in a square corner, Moffatt's (antisymmetric) stream function ... [indicates] that hyperbolic coordinates are indeed the natural choice to describe these flows.

===Relativistic spacetime===
Select (0,0) for a "here and now" in a spacetime. Light radiant left and right through this central event tracks two lines in the spacetime, lines that can be used to give coordinates to events away from (0,0). Trajectories of lesser velocity track closer to the original timeline (0,''t''). Any such velocity can be viewed as a zero velocity under a squeeze mapping called a [[Lorentz boost]]. This insight follows from a study of [[split-complex number]] multiplications and the [[split-complex number#The diagonal basis|diagonal basis]] which corresponds to the pair of light lines.
Formally, a squeeze preserves the hyperbolic metric expressed in the form ''xy''; in a different coordinate system. This application in the [[theory of relativity]] was noted in 1912 by Wilson and Lewis,&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] &amp; [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] (1912) "The space-time manifold of relativity. The non-Euclidean geometry of mechanics and electromagnetics", Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] 48:387&amp;ndash;507, footnote p.&amp;nbsp;401&lt;/ref&gt; by Werner Greub,&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Greub (1967) ''Linear Algebra'', Springer-Verlag. See pages 272 to 274&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Louis Kauffman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Kauffman]] (1985) "Transformations in Special Relativity", [[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] 24:223&amp;ndash;36&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Wolfgang Rindler]], in his popular textbook on relativity, used the squeeze mapping form of Lorentz transformations in his demonstration of their characteristic property.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Rindler]], ''Essential Relativity'', equation 29.5 on page 45 of the 1969 edition, or equation 2.17 on page 37 of the 1977 edition, or equation 2.16 on page 52 of the 2001 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''squeeze transformation'' was used in this context in an article connecting the [[Lorentz group]] with [[Jones calculus]] in optics.&lt;ref&gt;Daesoo Han, Young Suh Kim &amp; Marilyn E. Noz (1997) "Jones-matrix formalism as a representation of the Lorentz group", [[Journal of the Optical Society of America]] A14(9):2290–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge to transcendentals===
The area-preserving property of squeeze mapping has an application in setting the foundation of the transcendental functions [[natural logarithm]] and its inverse the [[exponential function]]:

'''Definition:''' Sector(''a,b'') is the [[hyperbolic sector]] obtained with central rays to (''a'', 1/''a'') and (''b'', 1/''b'').

'''Lemma:''' If ''bc'' = ''ad'', then there is a squeeze mapping that moves the sector(''a,b'') to sector(''c,d'').

Proof: Take parameter ''r'' = ''c''/''a'' so that (''u,v'') = (''rx'', ''y''/''r'') takes (''a'', 1/''a'') to (''c'', 1/''c'') and (''b'', 1/''b'') to (''d'', 1/''d'').

'''Theorem''' ([[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]] 1647) If ''bc'' = ''ad'', then the quadrature of the hyperbola ''xy'' = 1 against the asymptote has equal areas between ''a'' and ''b'' compared to between ''c'' and ''d''.

Proof: An argument adding and subtracting triangles of area ½, one triangle being {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}, shows the hyperbolic sector area is equal to the area along the asymptote. The theorem then follows from the lemma.

'''Theorem''' ([[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]] 1649) As area measured against the asymptote increases in arithmetic progression, the projections upon the asymptote increase in geometric sequence. Thus the areas form ''logarithms'' of the asymptote index.

For instance, for a standard position angle which runs from (1,&amp;nbsp;1) to (''x'',&amp;nbsp;1/''x''), one may ask "When is the hyperbolic angle equal to one?" The answer is the [[transcendental number]] x = [[e (mathematical constant)|e]].

A squeeze with ''r'' = e moves the unit angle to one between (''e'',&amp;nbsp;1/''e'') and (''ee'',&amp;nbsp;1/''ee'') which subtends a sector also of area one. The [[geometric progression]]
: ''e'', ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''e''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ...
corresponds to the asymptotic index achieved with each sum of areas
: 1,2,3, ..., ''n'',...
which is a proto-typical [[arithmetic progression]] ''A'' + ''nd'' where ''A'' = 0 and ''d'' = 1 .

The process optimally transfers partial information using entanglement and classical communication. It allows for sending information using an amount of entanglement given by the [[conditional quantum entropy]], &lt;math&gt;H(A|B)\,=\,H(AB)-H(B) \, .&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H(A)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Von Neumann entropy]], &lt;math&gt;H(A):=-Tr\rho_A\log\rho_A&lt;/math&gt;.  It thus provides an operational meaning to this quantity.

Unlike its classical counterpart, the quantum conditional entropy can be negative.  In this case, the sender can transfer the state to the receiver using no entanglement, and as an added bonus, this amount of entanglement can be gained, rather than used.  Thus quantum information can be negative.

The amount of classical information needed is the [[mutual information]] &lt;math&gt;I(A:R):=H(A)+H(R)-H(AR)&lt;/math&gt;.  The case where the classical communication is replaced by quantum communication was considered in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0606225  |doi=10.1098/rspa.2009.0202 |first1=A.| last1= Abeyesinghe |first2=I.|last2=Devetak|first3=P|last3=Hayden|first4=A.|last4=Winter

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11950">In mathematics, the '''three-gap theorem''', '''three-distance theorem''', or '''Steinhaus conjecture''' states that if one places ''n'' points on a circle, at angles of ''&amp;theta;'', 2''&amp;theta;'', 3''&amp;theta;'' ... from the starting point, then there will be at most three distinct distances between pairs of points in adjacent positions around the circle. When there are three distances, the largest of the three always equals the sum of the other two.{{r|automatic}} Unless ''&amp;theta;'' is a rational multiple of {{pi}}, there will also be at least two distinct distances.

This result was conjectured by [[Hugo Steinhaus]], and proved in the 1950s by [[Vera T. Sós]], {{ill|János Surányi|hu|Surányi János (matematikus)}}, and [[Stanisław Świerczkowski]]. Its applications include the study of plant growth and musical tuning systems, and the theory of [[Sturmian word]]s.

==Applications==
[[File:Goldener Schnitt Blattstand.png|thumb|End-on view of a plant stem in which consecutive leaves are separated by the [[golden angle]] ]]
In [[phyllotaxis]] (the theory of plant growth), it has been observed that each successive leaf on the stems of many plants is turned from the previous leaf by the [[golden angle]], approximately 137.5°. It has been suggested that this angle maximizes the sun-collecting power of the plant's leaves.{{r|mnw}} If one looks end-on at a plant stem that has grown in this way, there will be at most three distinct angles between two leaves that are consecutive in the cyclic order given by this end-on view.{{r|vr87}} In the figure, the largest of these three angles occurs three times, between the leaves numbered 3 and 6, between leaves 4 and 7, and between leaves 5 and 8. The second-largest angle occurs five times, between leaves 6 and 1, 9 and 4, 7 and 2, 10 and 5, and 8 and 3. And the smallest angle occurs only twice, between leaves 1 and 9 and between leaves 2 and 10. (This phenomenon has nothing to do with the [[golden ratio]]; the same property, of having only three distinct gaps between consecutive points on a circle, happens for any other rotation angle, and not just for the golden angle.){{r|vr87}}

[[File:PythagoreanTuningGeometric.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A geometric view of the tones of the [[Pythagorean tuning]] as points on a circle, showing the [[Pythagorean comma]] (the gap between the first and last points of the path) as the amount by which this tuning system fails to close up to a regular [[dodecagram]]. The edges between the points of the circle are the [[perfect fifth]]s from which this tuning system is constructed.]]
In [[music theory]], this theorem implies that if a [[tuning system]] is [[Generated collection|generated]] by some number of consecutive multiples of a given [[Interval (music)|interval]], reduced to a cyclic sequence by considering two tones to be equivalent when they differ by whole numbers of [[octaves]], then there are at most three different intervals between consecutive tones of the scale.{{r|carey|microtonal}} For instance, the [[Pythagorean tuning]] is constructed in this way from multiples of a [[perfect fifth]]. It has only two distinct intervals representing its [[semitone]]s,{{r|semitones}} but if it were extended by one more step then the sequence of intervals between its tones would include a third shorter interval, the [[Pythagorean comma]].{{r|pebble}}

In the theory of [[Sturmian word]]s, the theorem implies that the words of a given length ''n'' that appear within a given Sturmian word have at most three distinct frequencies. If there are three frequencies, then one of them must equal the sum of the other two.{{r|sturmian}}

==History and proof==
The three-gap theorem was conjectured by [[Hugo Steinhaus]], and its first proofs were published in the late 1950s by [[Vera T. Sós]],{{r|sos}} {{ill|János Surányi|hu|Surányi János (matematikus)}},{{r|suranyi}} and [[Stanisław Świerczkowski]].{{r|sw}} Several later proofs have also been published.{{r|halton|slater67|vr88|mayero|ms}}

The following simple proof is due to Frank Liang. Define a gap (an arc of the circle between adjacent points of the given set) to be ''rigid'' if rotating that gap by an angle of ''&amp;theta;'' does not produce another gap of the same length. Each rotation by ''&amp;theta;'' increases the position of the gap endpoints in the placement ordering of the points, and such an increase cannot be repeated indefinitely, so every gap has the same length as a rigid gap. But the only ways for a gap to be rigid are for one of its two endpoints to be the last point in the placement sequence (so that the corresponding point is missing from the rotated gap) or for another point to land in its rotated copy. An endpoint can only be missing if the gap is one of the two gaps on either side of the last point in the placement ordering. And a point can only land within the rotated copy if it is the first point in the placement ordering. So there can be at most three rigid gaps, and at most three lengths of gaps. Additionally, when there are three, the rotated copy of a rigid gap that has the first point in it is partitioned by that point into two smaller gaps, so in this case the longest gap length is the sum of the other two.{{r|liang|shiu}}

A closely related but earlier theorem, also called the three-gap theorem, is that if ''A'' is any arc of the circle, then the [[integer sequence]] of multiples of ''&amp;theta;'' that land in ''A'' has at most three gaps between sequence values. Again, if there are three gaps then one is the sum of the other two.{{r|slater50|florek}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5160">In [[modular arithmetic]], '''Thue's lemma''' roughly states that every modular integer may be represented by a "modular fraction" such that the numerator and the denominator have [[absolute value]]s not greater than the [[square root]] of the modulus.

More precisely for every pair of [[integers]] {{math|(''a'', ''m'')}} with {{math|''m'' &gt; 1}}, given two positive integers {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} such that {{math|''X'' ≤ ''m'' &lt; ''XY''}}, there are two integers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} such that 
:&lt;math&gt;ay\equiv x \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;|x| &lt; X,\quad 0 &lt; y &lt; Y.&lt;/math&gt;
Usually, one takes {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} equal to the smallest integer greater than the square root of {{math|''m''}}, but the general form is sometimes useful, and make the unicity theorem (below) easier to state.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, theorem 2.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known proof is attributed to {{harvs|txt|first=Axel |last=Thue|authorlink=Axel Thue|year=1902}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=A.|last= Thue|title= Et par antydninger til en taltheoretisk metode |journal= Kra. Vidensk. Selsk. Forh.|volume= 7 |year=1902|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used a [[Pigeonhole principle|pigeonhole]] argument.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Pete L.|title=Thue's Lemma and Binary Forms|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.151.636&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Löndahl|first1=Carl|title=Lecture on sums of squares|date=2011-03-22|url=https://carllondahl.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sumsofsquares1.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to prove [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]] by taking ''m'' to be a prime ''p'' that is 1 mod 4 and taking ''a'' to satisfy ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0 mod ''p''.  (Such an "a" is guaranteed for "p" by [[Wilson's Theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Oystein|last=Ore|title=Number Theory and its History|pages=262–263|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Uniqueness==

In general, the solution whose existence is asserted by Thue's lemma is not unique. For example, when {{math|1=''a'' = 1}} there are usually several solutions {{math|1=(''x'',''y'') = (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), ...}}, providing that {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are not too small. Therefore, one may only hope unicity for the [[rational number]] {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|''y''}}}}, to which {{mvar|a}} is congruent modulo {{mvar|m}} if ''y'' and ''m'' are coprime. Nevertheless, this rational number needs not to be unique; for example, if {{math|1=''m'' = 5}}, {{math|1=''a'' = 2}} and {{math|1= ''X'' = ''Y'' = 3}}, one has the two solutions
:&lt;math&gt;2a+1 \equiv -a+2 \equiv 0 \pmod 5&lt;/math&gt;.

However, for {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} small enough, if a solution exists, it is unique. More precisely, with above notation, if 
:&lt;math&gt;2XY &lt; m,&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt;ay_1-x_1\equiv ay_2-x_2 \equiv 0 \pmod m&lt;/math&gt;,
with 
:&lt;math&gt;\left | x_1\right |&lt; X, \quad\left| y_1\right| &lt; Y,&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\left| x_2\right| &lt; X, \quad\left| y_2\right| &lt; Y,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x_1}{y_1}=\frac{x_2}{y_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This result is the basis for [[rational reconstruction (mathematics)|rational reconstruction]], which allows using modular arithmetic for computing rational numbers for which one knows bounds for numerators and denominators.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, section 4.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof is rather easy: by multiplying each congruence by the other {{math|''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and subtracting, one gets
:&lt;math&gt;y_2x_1-y_1x_2 \equiv 0 \pmod m.&lt;/math&gt;
The hypotheses imply that each term has an absolute value lower than {{math|''XY'' &lt; {{sfrac|''m''|2}}}}, and thus that the absolute value of their difference is lower than {{mvar|m}}. This implies that &lt;math&gt;y_2x_1-y_1x_2 =0&lt;/math&gt;, and thus the result.

==Computing solutions==
The original proof of Thue's lemma is not efficient, in the sense that it does not provide any fast method for computing the solution.  
The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]], allows us to provide a proof that leads to an efficient algorithm that has the same [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, section 4.5&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, given the two integers {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|a}} appearing in Thue's lemma, the extended Euclidean algorithm computes three sequences of integers {{math|(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}},  {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;t_im+y_ia =x_i \quad \text{for } i=0, 1, ...,&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are non-negative and strictly decreasing. The desired solution is, up to the sign, the first pair {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''X''}}.

'''Verena Esther Huber-Dyson''' (May 6, 1923 – March 12, 2016) was a Swiss-American mathematician, known for work in [[group theory]] and [[formal logic]].&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-2009"&gt;Nicholas Dawidoff, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html "The Civil Heretic"], ''[[New York Times]]'', March 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  She has been described as a "brilliant mathematician",&lt;ref name="nyt-2009" /&gt; and did research on the interface between algebra and logic, focusing on [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] in [[group theory]].   At the time of her death she was emeritus faculty in the philosophy department of the [[University of Calgary]], Alberta.

== Life and career ==
=== Family and early life ===
Huber-Dyson was born Verena Esther Huber in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], on May 6, 1923. Her parents, Karl (Charles) Huber (1893-1946) and Berthy Ryffel (1899-1945), were Swiss nationals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schewe|first=Phillip|title=Maverick Genius: The Pioneering Odyssey of Freeman Dyson|year=2013|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; who raised Verena and her sister Adelheid ("Heidi", 1925-1987) in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], where the girls attended the German-speaking ''Deutsche Schule'', or [[German School of Athens]], until forced to return to Switzerland in 1940 by the war.

Charles Huber, who had managed the Middle Eastern operations of Bühler AG, a Swiss food-process engineering firm, began working for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), monitoring the treatment of prisoners of war in internment camps. As the ICRC delegate to India and Ceylon, he was responsible for Italian prisoners held in British camps, but also visited German and Allied camps in Europe, and in 1945-46 served as an ICRC delegate to the United States, which he described to Verena as a place she "definitely ought to experience at length and in depth but just as definitely ought not to settle in."&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

She studied mathematics, with minors in physics and philosophy, at the [[University of Zurich]], where she obtained her Ph.D in mathematics in 1947 with a thesis in [[finite group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ein Dualismus als Klassifikationsprinzip in der abstrakten Gruppentheorie'' (dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jocfer"&gt;John J. O'Connor and Edmund F. Robertson, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Dyson.html Freeman Dyson], The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive, University of St. Andrews Scotland (last visited March 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=90286}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of [[Andreas Speiser]].

=== Children ===
Verena married Hans-Georg Haefeli, a fellow mathematician, in 1942, and was divorced in 1948. Her first daughter, Katarina Haefeli (now Halm), was born in 1945.{{sfn|Schewe|2013}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feferman|first=Soloman|last2=Feferman|first2=Anita|title=Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic|pp=272–276|year=2004|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She subsequently married [[Freeman Dyson]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on August 11, 1950.&lt;ref name="jocfer" /&gt;  They had two children together, [[Esther Dyson]] (born July 14, 1951, in Zurich) and [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] (born 1953, Ithaca, New York)&lt;ref name="nyt-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jocfer" /&gt;  and divorced in 1958.{{sfn|Feferman|Feferman|2004|pp=272–276}}

=== Career ===
Huber-Dyson accepted a postdoctoral fellow appointment at  the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/vhaefeli01 Directory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107133237/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/vhaefeli01 |date=2013-01-07 }}, ''A Community of Scholars: Institute for Advanced Study'', [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (last visited March 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; where she worked on [[group theory]] and [[formal logic]].{{sfn|Schewe|2013|pp=72}}{{sfn|Feferman|Feferman|2004|pp=272-276}} She also began teaching at [[Goucher College]] near Baltimore during this time.{{sfn|Schewe|pp=72|2013}}

She moved to California with her daughter Katarina, began teaching at [[San Jose State University]] in 1959, and then joined [[Alfred Tarski]]'s Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. {{sfn|Feferman|Feferman|2004|pp=272-276}} &lt;ref name="edge-godel"&gt;Verena Huber-Dyson, [https://www.edge.org/conversation/g-oumldel-in-a-nutshell "Gödel in a Nutshell"], ''Edge'', May 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huber-Dyson taught at [[San Jose State University]], the [[University of Zürich]], [[University of Monash]], as well as at [[UC Berkeley]], [[Adelphi University]], [[UCLA]], and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], in mathematics and in philosophy departments.  She accepted a position in the philosophy department of the [[University of Calgary]] in 1973, becoming emerita in 1988.{{sfn|Schewe|2013}}
